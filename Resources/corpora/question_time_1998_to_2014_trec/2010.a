 - Mr Speaker, thank you for that question without notice from Mr Policy! It is about policy, and can I say to those opposite: the proceedings of this parliament are broadcast daily. We are here all week, we are here all next week and we are here for five weeks in the current sittings. If the honourable gentleman wishes to engage in a debate on the future of climate change, I welcome that debate.First of all, it would be a debate about whether or not we accept the science of climate change. We have a view on that. Someone opposite says that climate change is, to use his own words 'absolute crap'. Secondly, we would have a debate to respond to the honourable gentleman's question about whether or not the policies on offer have an effect, and I think that is pretty interesting when you look at what has been put out there into the public space today, because those opposite have not put a cap on carbon pollution at all. We have put a cap on carbon pollution because that is the first test. The second test is this: do you actually charge those who are the biggest polluters or let them off scot-free? Those opposite have decided to let the biggest polluters off scot-free, and guess what they are doing: they are going to charge the Australian taxpayer instead. Thirdly, for the flow-on consequences for working families, we offer compensation. Those opposite, led by the Leader of the Opposition, offer one big fat zero.So, Mr Speaker, the honourable gentleman asks: 'Shall we have a debate?' I thought that that was one of the reasons the parliament was here assembled - to debate the big challenges. If his preoccupation is being on television, can I just say that there are cameras all around here, it is on every day and long may it continue thus. I therefore respond to the honourable gentleman's question by saying, 'Yes, and let us have the debate in the people's house.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Brisbane for his question, because one of the long-term challenges pointed to in the Intergenerational report to which he refers is, in fact, the challenge of climate change, and if we do not get that long-term challenge right then it is difficult to get all the other challenges right. It is not just an environmental challenge; it is an economic challenge for industries such as tourism as well. The Treasurer yesterday released the Intergenerational report, and it contains some pretty interesting conclusions.This is the third Intergenerational report, and the intergenerational reports of 2002 and the one following that - those of the Treasurer's predecessor, the former member for Higgins - pointed to the core challenge of our ageing population. Most critical are the two challenges which come from that again. First, what are we going to do about the impact of a smaller proportion of Australians working in the workforce and, therefore, generating less economic growth than in the past and, therefore, less taxation revenue to fund services in the future? That is the No. 1 challenge. The No. 2 challenge is: how do you actually boost economic growth in order to fill that gap so that we can generate that extra tax revenue in order to fund the future needs of an ageing population in health, in aged care and in pensions? These are the two big challenges which are identified in the Intergenerational report.Here is a figure which everyone in this chamber should reflect upon: as of today 14 per cent of Australians - one in seven - are over the age of 65. By 2050 23 per cent of Australians - one in four - will be over the age of 65. Take that down to the number of people in the workforce. Forty years ago we had 7.5 people of working age for every person over the age of 65. Today that figure is five people in the workforce for every person over the age of 65. Roll the clock ahead to midcentury and we are down to 2.7 people in the workforce for every person over the age of 65. This defines the core challenge because, unless we can fill that gap, what we are going to see is economic growth going down from its historical average in recent times of 3.3 down to something like 2.7, which actually has a huge impact on revenue and on individual living standards. So the big challenge for each intergenerational report is: how do you plug that economic growth gap which arises from the ageing of the population?The response to this is that there are two big policy levers available to government and the wider economy. One is productivity growth and the second is what you do with workforce participation. We must boost productivity growth. That is No. 1. What we have in the Intergenerational report is a very clear definition that if we lift productivity growth to where it was back in the nineties - which is around two per cent - instead of 1.4 per cent, where it fell to when those opposite were in office, we boost growth back to an average annual growth figure of something closer to three. That begins to plug the growth gap and begins to plug the revenue gap for the future.So what are the tools available for us? Boosting productivity growth by (1) investing in infrastructure; (2) investing in skills; (3) investing, also, in the microeconomic reform agenda to cut away red tape from business. These outline the core elements of government economic policy because, unless we deal with these challenges now, they will confront each government as it is elected in the future, because health and ageing will not simply disappear. This is the challenge we face. If you look at the impact of health budgets on state budgets around the country, it is huge: by 2046, absent policy change, state based revenue will be consumed by health and hospitals expenditure alone. So this outlines the core elements of the challenge and the policy agenda which all responsible policy leaders in this country would be advancing. How do we boost productivity growth through infrastructure, through skills and through microeconomic reform; how do we lift workforce participation; and how do we reform the health and hospital system of the future and fund it in order to ensure that we have the services which the seniors of today and tomorrow deserve and need for their futures?</DOC>

 - I notice, in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question about $1,100, that after he was challenged on that figure by myself and other spokesmen of the government in recent times he suddenly went silent. The reason he went silent is that the figure is without foundation. The honourable member would be familiar with the fact that the impact on the average family is $624 per year - $12 per week. The honourable member knows that what he did in order to support his fear campaign in the community was simply double it up. What we need is a bit of transparency and honesty in this debate, and it would start in terms of the actual impact of climate change policies - this government's and the opposition's - on working families.The government has put forward through the Treasury modelling the impact of its emissions trading scheme. The opposition leader today said: 'Here is a policy. I think this is how much it costs, but don't ask me how I'm going to fund it.' The answer to that is that, if you are going to have an unfunded policy, it flows through to taxpayers paying the price for an opposition's policy which is not properly costed and not properly funded. Ultimately, working families pay one way or the other; what the Leader of the Opposition has sought to do is try to be very quiet about the way in which working families would be slugged by the proposal which he has put forward today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. The challenges laid out in the Australia to 2050 report I released yesterday are very serious but they are certainly not insurmountable. As the Prime Minister said a moment ago, the ageing of our population does have some very big implications for Australia's future economy and for our society. The Intergenerational report shows that by 2050 the proportion of Australia's population aged 65 and over will nearly double. Those opposite may want to stick their heads in the sand and ignore this fact. They certainly did not ignore it during the two previous intergenerational reports, but apparently they now deny the reality of this very basic demographic fact. This means by 2050 there will only be 2.7 people of working age for every person aged 65 and over, compared to five people today. Common sense tells you that this will put pressure on economic growth and it will certainly put pressure on living standards. It means that living standards over the next 40 years will likely grow at a slower pace than in the past 40 years. The IGR projects real GDP per person to grow at 1.5 per cent a year over the next 40 years, compared with 1.9 per cent over the previous 40 years, and economic growth to slow from an average of 3.3 per cent over the last 40 years to 2.7 per cent over the next 40 years to 2050.Faced with these projections governments can make choices, and governments have two choices: we can ignore these future challenges, as the previous government did, or we can take steps now to grow our economy and to lift our growth potential by lifting the productivity of our economy - and that is the approach that we take. We on this side of the House understand the nature of the challenge: we need to ensure we have continuing prosperity with rising living standards, with social cohesiveness and with a sustainable environment. We on this side of the House are committed to doing that and to working hard to do it, and that is why we brought forward this Intergenerational report. As the Prime Minister has already said, it means we have to increase our growth rate of productivity and it means we have to get in there and do the hard work and the hard yards of the reform agenda, and we have been doing that from day one.The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer sat around the cabinet table under the previous government, saw a growing and ageing population and did absolutely nothing. They said: 'It's got nothing to do with us. Leave it all to the states.' They would not be a partner with the states or local government in investing in infrastructure. They would not 'fess up to the fact that we had a skills problem in this country and that we needed to do much more to educate and skill our workforce. All of those things were swept right under the carpet, but this government is determined to implement a regulatory reform agenda which lifts our productivity. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation is making great strides in that area, as is the Minister for Education. There are the investments in extra training places - 711,000 extra vocational education and training places and 50,000 additional university places - and, of course, the $36 billion investment in infrastructure.All of these things go to the very core of a reform agenda. They go to the very core of a nation-building agenda. They go to the very core of the quality of life in our communities. All of these issues were swept under the carpet by the previous government. We are up to the task of taking on this challenge, but of course those on the opposite side of the House simply want to sweep it all under the carpet and play their political games. We on this side of the House will not sweep the big challenges under the carpet. We are up to the task of meeting the future challenges of this country to sustain our living standards and to protect the quality of our lives. That is what we are dedicated to, but those opposite are so divided and so bereft of any alternative policy they have nothing to do but to play short-term, cheap, populist politics that does not add up to a row of beans - and it certainly does not add up to leadership.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Nationals for his question. It goes again to the assertion about the impact of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme on the overall household sector. Once again he used this figure of $1,100. Again the National Party pluck it out of space - pluck it out of thin air. The figure was contained in the question of the Leader of the Opposition which I answered just before. If they bothered to honestly reflect upon the data and modelling released by the Treasury of the precise impact on families of acting on climate change, it is there in black and white. -  - The nice thing about the member for Sturt is that he always puts an earnest case. Five weeks ago he put an earnest case in support of an emissions trading scheme; today he puts an earnest case against an emissions trading scheme, but it is always earnest. In fact, more than half of them over there supported the scheme, six weeks ago, that they are now arguing against. I find that interesting. But consistency has never been their strong suit.The question goes to the cost of living impact of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The impact on the CPI is 1.1 per cent, as indicated in the modelling which was released by the Treasury. The Leader of the National Party asked a question about the impact on bread and milk. Within that price index milk goes up by 0.8 per cent, bread goes up by 0.7 per cent and meat by 0.7 per cent. We have been up front about the impact on prices. I would suggest that the Leader of the Opposition, as he built up to the announcement of his alternative proposal today, would indicate what the cost flowthrough of his proposal is. We have been transparent in the papers, in the attachments and in the Treasury numbering on what flows through to individual working families. It is there in black and white. Those opposite are pretending this: they can act on climate change, but it can be cost free for the entire economy. Business does not have to pay and working families do not have to pay. Does the taxpayer have to pay? Somebody has to pay. Let me tell you: in this proposal put out today, there is not much by way of substance.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. Today the Reserve Bank board left the official cash rate unchanged at 3.75 per cent, its lowest level since 1967. I am sure all of us on this side of the House certainly welcome this decision. Families will welcome this decision and businesses will welcome this decision, but it is obviously not welcomed by those opposite. They are perhaps the most disappointed people in the House today because they somehow think that they can use these decisions for their political advantage.Today's decision means that a family with a $300,000 mortgage are still paying around $600 a month less than they were paying 18 months ago. That does not mean that interest rate rises do not have an impact. They certainly do. They certainly do hit the family budget, but we on this side of the House understand that they impact on the family budget and that is why we are so determined to focus on a low inflationary strategy. That is why we are so determined to make the investments in infrastructure that were not made by those opposite. That is why we are so determined to educate our workforce and to skill our workforce, because under those opposite inflation hit 16-year highs and interest rates went up 10 times in a row after they had promised to keep them at record lows.So we are committed to a long-term strategy here to do everything we can to expand the productive capacity of the economy to make sure that we can do everything within our power to lessen inflationary pressures in the economy. I think it is worth mentioning that rates are now 300 basis points lower than they were when the Liberal Party were last in office.If the shadow Treasurer wants to be taken seriously in this whole debate, he should explain how he proposes to keep interest rates at 1967 levels forever. He should explain that to the House. He is out there constantly making erratic and wild statements and we had an example of this only last week when the latest inflation number came out. He went out and made the most weird and extreme statements about that inflation number. Most of them were incorrect. It was the usual 'sloppy Joe' approach, but it is no substitute for policy and no substitute for economic analysis. We on this side of the House are determined to do everything we can to see sustainable growth which lifts living standards up and we are determined to make the necessary investments for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. It is useful to reflect on the number of positions that she has had on this matter in recent times. In the Howard government, she was all for emissions trading; five weeks ago, she was all for emissions trading and global action; and today, suddenly, she is all against - full throttle forward, full throttle in reverse.The question that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked is about the impact of Copenhagen. I want to make three points about what was achieved at Copenhagen. The first is that all Australians would agree that the outcome in Copenhagen was disappointing. Everyone across the world accepts that fact, except that there are only a limited number of people in the world who laugh at that fact. The mood of the nation and across the world is: how do we act together to bring down greenhouse gas emissions? Those opposite may take a perverse delight in the problems which were there for everybody to see at the Copenhagen conference on climate change as we tried to forge an agreement across 190 nations from various political systems and different economic structures across the world.The second point I would make in response to the deputy leader's question is this: we - that is, the gathering of nations at Copenhagen - for the first time agreed in a global accord that temperature increases should be kept within two degrees Centigrade. That is the first time that that has happened. It therefore provides guidance for the future. In the past that did not exist; it now exists.The second change which occurred in Copenhagen was that for the first time there were developed and developing countries indicating that they would submit targets and commitments of action. In the past this was exclusively seen as a developed country task. That is no longer the case. The third achievement at Copenhagen was that, as a result of Copenhagen and the discussions which went on there, a global monitoring system would be developed to ensure that those who commit actually do what they say they are going to do. These are three changes to the world subsequent to December as opposed to what occurred prior to December.The other part of the deputy leader's question goes to Australia's own efforts. I simply say to her - and I think it is consistent with the position which has been adopted by various people opposite in recent times - that our government's position is that we will do no more and no less than the rest of the global community. -  - Can I say to those opposite as they seek to interject: their targets are five, 15 and 25. The government's targets are five, 15 and 25. That is our position and that is the opposition's position. We have developed a credible mechanism to achieve that target. What we have seen from the proposal put out today by the Leader of the Opposition is something which, frankly, looks as if it simply does not add up or stack up in achieving that environmental outcome.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question, because he represents a part of the Great Barrier Reef which, if we were to see temperature rises go through the roof, would ultimately be destroyed. That is not just an environmental catastrophe; it is also an economic catastrophe because we have tens of thousands of Queenslanders employed in the tourism industry on the Great Barrier Reef.I noticed the other day, by the way, that the Leader of the Opposition said that, if the worst case scenario put out by scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change were to come to pass and we were to see global temperature increases of the order of four degrees Centigrade, it did not represent any big moral challenge for the future. Can I say that, if we saw temperature increases like that, as far as the Barrier Reef is concerned, frankly, it would be destroyed beyond recognition. That is why I welcome the question from the member for Leichhardt.We all sat there today in anticipation of what alternative plan would be put forward by the opposition on climate change. It has been a long time coming. The government put forward its proposal at the end of 2008, and until about five weeks ago it had the majority support of those opposite, and then they removed the then Leader of the Opposition. When we listen to what was put forward today, it was a pretty interesting presentation indeed. The Leader of the Opposition has described climate change as 'absolute crap'. Those are his words, not mine. He said that climate change is absolute crap and he has confirmed that view today in that the proposal he has put forward is nothing more than a climate con job. This is a climate con job, absolute and final. It does less, it costs more and, by definition, it will mean higher taxes. Let us go through these in order. -  - Those opposite seem to guffaw about costs. If you go to the budget papers, which we have produced, you will find the impact on budget of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is something like $3.3 billion across the decade. Those opposite in their own costings, which have yet to be tested, admit to a budget impact of $10 billion - three times that which has been advanced by the government - and they say over there that this is therefore proof positive that their proposal will cost less than ours. Let us go to the entrails of the climate change con - the climate con job put forward by the Leader of the Opposition today. There are three big problems with it. - The first is that it does not work and the reason it does not work, as the member for Sturt knows by his embarrassed interjection, is that the Leader of the Opposition puts no cap on carbon; he puts no cap on carbon pollution. On the one hand you say you are going to reduce carbon pollution but on the other hand you say, 'I'm putting forward a plan which doesn't actually put a cap on how much carbon pollution you allow out into the atmosphere,' - failure No. 1. Failure No. 2 is this: what he does through this plan is leave the big polluters alone and slug taxpayers instead. Not only does it cost more than the government's scheme; he leaves the big polluters to one side and says, 'You're okay, don't worry about that,' and then goes on to say, 'For you taxpayers who will be copping extra taxation as a result of this and possibly extra prices as well, we will work that through.' Those individual taxpayers and consumers will not get one dollar of compensation. That is problem No. 2 - in other words, let the big polluters go free and slug Australian working families as taxpayers. That is the second problem. The third problem with this plan, this proposal, this climate con job is this: it is totally unfunded. We have been waiting for this alternative plan for - how long? They costed it at $10 billion but cannot even summon the collective honesty to put forward how they would offset that in their own budget numberings.This is the absolute core set of problems with what those opposite have advanced in terms of their alternative climate change plan. It does not work, it puts no cap on carbon, it lets all the big polluters go absolutely free, it slugs taxpayers and working families as a result and it does not even bother to attempt to fund the policy. That is the core of what has been put forward today. It all comes off the back of a Leader of the Opposition who does not believe any of this in the first place. If you go out there and publicly say that climate change is absolute crap, what do you think people conclude when you put out a piece of paper saying that you are actually serious about it? That is why people do not trust the Leader of the Opposition on climate change: because he does not believe that it is actually happening.If you look at the evolution of his positions on this, he supported an emissions trading scheme when he was a member of the Howard government. He said then that climate change was absolute crap. He said that the Liberals should support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme unamended. He then said they should support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme amended. He then said he totally opposed the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. On top of all that, he said to the former Leader of the Opposition, 'Don't worry about me, Malcolm, I am just a political weathervane when it comes to climate change.' The Leader of the Opposition has changed his position on the emissions trading scheme probably more often than he has changed his undies. It has gone on and on and on. One day after another we have a different position. Can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you are going to come up with a policy, fund it, cost it, make it environmentally credible against these three most basic tests - fail, fail and fail.</DOC>

 - We have had a spectacle of policy consistency today - those up on their feet today attacking the emissions trading scheme, five weeks ago out there supporting it, cuddling up. Why is it that those opposite cannot figure out that, if you are going to be believed on climate change, you actually have to stand for something and stick to your views? Half of those opposite voted for the position put forward by the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth; half of them didn't. But when more than half of them eventually got behind him, what did they do? They rolled the leader. What do you think that says to the Australian community?</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. He asked specifically about the cost of electricity and gas under the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and he asked where it could be found. In broad summary I think that was the content of his question. On the question of electricity, electricity prices under the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme would rise by seven per cent in 2011-12. As for gas, the gas price would increase by four per cent as advised in both cases by the Treasury in 2011-12.The second part of the honourable member's question goes to the extent to which the government is transparent about this. Yesterday I made these statements in the parliament, today I make the statements in the parliament and they go to the actual cost of the scheme.The third part of the Leader of the Opposition's question went to what he described as 'this big tax' on all Australians - to use his own terms - and that is what I would like to respond to as well. I think honourable members and various members of the public were witness to a fairly extraordinary interview last night on this subject on the 
The 7.30 Report. It was, I think, necessary viewing because it goes to the absolute heart of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition about 'this great big tax'. I will read some of what was contained in that interview. In his interview with Kerry O'Brien on the ABC, which just received plaudits from those opposite and I welcome that, the first statement from the Leader of the Opposition last night, as today, was to this effect:Well, under Mr Rudd's scheme taxpayers will pay because they are consumers, they'll pay a lot more, $120 billion _That is his statement upfront. - Well, member for Sturt, let us just see what unfolds in this interview between Mr O'Brien and the Leader of the Opposition. The first question which is asked by Mr O'Brien of the Leader of the Opposition is:_ Mr Abbott, is it honest of you to say baldly, as you just did, that this entire cost of $100 billion plus, will actually come out of taxpayers' pockets. Consumers pockets, is that correct?The first evasion from the Leader of the Opposition is as follows:But it's a giant money-go-round, it's a giant drag on the economy.He then goes on, but the question he was asked was, 'Is this $120 billion a tax coming out of taxpayers' or consumers' pockets?' Mr O'Brien has a second effort to extract the truth from the Leader of the Opposition and asks again:Is it honest of you to say that consumers and taxpayers will pay $110 billion, or whatever figure you use, is that honest?The Leader of the Opposition's answer on the question he has been asking me today about is:Because of the, of the volume of trades, - I am seeking to be absolutely accurate in what it contains here - Because of the, of the volume of trades, the accumulative value of all this, on the Government's own figures, is close to $120 billion.Then we have the third attempt by Mr O'Brien at asking the direct question of, 'Is the $120 billion a tax on people and on consumers?' Mr O'Brien asks:The total churn, as you put it, does not mean that individuals will foot that bill, does it.To which the Leader of the Opposition replies:Yes.He agrees with the proposition that it is not a tax on consumers. That is what he says. It is absolutely clear. -  - I would suggest that those opposite actually read the transcript. He gets asked once; he gets asked twice; he gets asked a third time. This one big tax - this $120 billion - he says is a direct impost on taxpayers and consumers. Three times he was asked this question. The question as it was put was:The total churn, as you put it, does not mean that individuals will foot that bill, does it.And he agrees with the proposition. I can just say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is transparent out of his own mouth that he accepts the proposition that this, in fact, is something quite different. So let us go to the actual essence of his proposition. - I always enjoy the interjections from the PhD from Flinders, who, we read out yesterday, was a strong supporter of an emissions trading scheme all his life. But here goes, to the absolute core of it. Firstly, on taxpayers, we in our scheme cost taxpayers $3.3 billion; they cost them $10 billion-plus, three times as much, at their own admission. Secondly, our scheme refers to, as the Leader of the Opposition confirms in his own interview, the 'value' of the carbon market. It is like the value of the electricity market or the value of the gas market. What he has sought to do is to say that that equals a tax on consumers.Last night's interview was spectacular in the Leader of the Opposition being nailed on the core con which lies at the heart of his climate con job strategy, and that is that on tax you charge three times more. On the question of the size of the market which is created for carbon through the CPRS, that is comparing apples with oranges and you know it, and you were exposed on television last night for having done so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I thank the honourable member for her question because I believe all those who are attending the House today, and the nation at large, are interested in the state of the national economy. They are interested in how the nation has responded to the global economic recession. They are interested in the implications for jobs.This government is optimistic about the economy's future. This government is optimistic because the government has acted early and decisively to intervene to support the economy, keep the economy strong, provide and protect jobs in the economy and support working families on the way through. This is clearly illustrated when we actually look at the employment data around the world and the growth data around the world. Most recently we have seen the IMF put out growth data for the period 2010, and it is forecasting global growth of 3.9 per cent. This contrasts with 2009, when the global economy, for the first time since the war, actually contracted, by 0.8 per cent. Those are the dimensions of the economic challenge which we in this country faced last year. I also draw to the House's attention what the IMF said when it released this data. It said:Due to the still-fragile nature of the recovery, fiscal policies need to remain supportive of economic activity in the near term, and the fiscal stimulus planned for 2010 should be implemented fully.That is the considered position of the IMF.Australia's achievements in response to this are as follows. We, uniquely among the major advanced economies, did not go into recession. This economy, uniquely of the advanced economies, grew in the period 2008-09. Thirdly, we generated the second lowest unemployment of the major advanced economies, and we did so with the lowest debt and the lowest deficit of the major advanced economies and, can I say to those opposite, while retaining this government's and this country's AAA credit rating.The core of our national infrastructure stimulus plan is this: it is to intervene to protect Australian jobs, because we are serious about that. The numbers speak for themselves. Over the past year here in Australia, we have created some 112,000 jobs. Can I say to those opposite: as we look around the rest of the world's data, in America in the same period of time 5.8 million jobs were lost; in Canada 321,000 jobs were lost; in the United Kingdom nearly half a million jobs were lost; in the European area at large more than three million jobs were lost; in Japan more than a million jobs were lost; and in Australia our employment growth, through those 112,000 jobs, went up as a consequence of government stimulus strategy and the participation in it by the Australian business community.Can I also draw the House's attention to the fact that, if we were to look at the comparison of what we have done in response to this global economic recession, it is actually important in terms of previous global recessions as well. During the global recession of the early eighties, global growth was 0.9 per cent; Australia's unemployment rate peaked at 10.4 per cent. In the recession of the early nineties, our unemployment rate peaked at 10.9 per cent. In this global economic recession, the worst in 75 years, we through the MYEFO have forecast unemployment to peak at 6.35 and it is now 5.8 per cent.My point is this: across the world jobs are being destroyed in practically every country on earth. Here, we actually added 112,000 jobs, and, secondly, against the measure of previous recessions where unemployment reached double digit figures in Australia, we have so far kept unemployment at between 5.5 and 5.8 per cent. That is the consequence of a government intervening through a national economic stimulus and infrastructure strategy. I conclude by saying that this has been to protect Australian jobs. We have done so through infrastructure projects. We are building some 27,000 infrastructure projects around the country. These projects have supported the creation of these 112,000 jobs over the past year, together with other activity from the Australian business community.That is our policy; that is our approach. What is the alternative? The alternative is to pull $20 billion out of the infrastructure stimulus strategy. Five thousand school projects around the country have not yet commenced - 5,000. So the challenge for those opposite is: if we are going to pull $20 billion out of the national infrastructure stimulus strategy, stand up and name the 5,000 schools where onsite construction has not commenced and name where you will make these cuts. Not only will you undermine those school communities, not only will you undermine Australia's economic growth, but you will also undermine this government's and this country's proud record on employment and jobs.</DOC>

 - Can I say in response to the honourable member's question that the advice which the government has received from the Treasury is as follows: firstly, in relation to electricity prices -  -  - I am directly answering the question which has been asked - that in 2011-12 electricity prices would go up by seven per cent and that in 2012-13 they would go up by 12 per cent. That actually goes to the sequencing of the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, with a fixed price in the first year and a floating price in the second. That is the answer to the honourable member's question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question, because economic stimulus is playing a critical role in supporting employment and in supporting small business in his electorate and in electorates right around the country. It was delivered precisely at the right time through the nation-building stimulus program and infrastructure investments we put in place and announced one year ago today. I think it is pretty fair to say that the economic performance of Australia over the last 12 months is a tribute to the hard work and to the resilience of the Australian people. It is a tribute to the Australian people and it is a tribute to Australian business. I think the way Australians got behind the stimulus says a lot about the quality of our people and the quality of our businesses, and I think it is important to acknowledge that today, because over the last 12 months Australia has achieved something special. What we managed to do, working together, was to put some confidence back into the economy. The impact of the stimulus was, in fact, over a 12-month period greater than the sum of its parts.Of course, there will be those in this House who will seek to rewrite history. They will seek to say that it was not needed. They will sit back and ignore the circumstances and the dangers this economy faced over 12 months ago, because over 12 months ago financial systems around the world were in meltdown. Over 12 months ago, share markets were plummeting. Over 12 months ago, global trade and production had fallen off a cliff and millions of jobs were being lost worldwide. Countries were following each other into recession like dominoes. Our economy 12 months ago was on the brink of a recession, having contracted in the December quarter. Of course, we were then facing the bleak prospect of one million Australians being out of work.Those were the circumstances 12 months ago, but a combination of stimulus and the resilience and hard work of the Australian people and businesses has meant that we have avoided a recession, and in avoiding a recession we have saved tens of thousands of jobs and we have kept open tens of thousands of small businesses, because there has been a pipeline of activity which has underpinned confidence in the economy. It has kept customers going through the doors of businesses and, of course, it has invested in vital areas of infrastructure, in our schools and in our social housing. All of this has been absolutely important to the economic success of Australia and explains why this country is the only major advanced economy not to go into recession. Consider what we have achieved together given that backdrop: 112,000 jobs created over the past year; an unemployment rate of 5.5 per cent, unlike the 10 per cent rate in the US and the other high rates right around Europe; stronger growth than just about every other advanced economy; and 20,000 school projects under construction.I know everybody on this side of the House supports those projects. They have been vital to local employment in local communities. And, of course, there are 6,600 social homes already under construction, a further 42,000 homes repaired and 3,300 community infrastructure projects across the nation. But of course those opposite do not accept the need for these projects, and they do represent a grave risk to these projects and the jobs that they support, because if they had had their way this country would be in recession right now. It will suit their purposes to pretend that none of this happened. I well remember the debates in this House 12 months ago. I remember the debates when we were in the House at 4 am, putting the case for economic stimulus - putting the case that was denied by most of those opposite. Whatever you thought of the debate and whatever you thought about the propositions being put by those opposite - which were full of political opportunism and a lack of national interest - at least many of them did put their case. But there were two people who did not speak in those debates at 4 am - who did not speak in the whole debate about the economic stimulus program and the infrastructure investments. They were the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer.We know the Leader of the Opposition says economics is boring. He finds it boring because he simply does not understand it. And what alternative policy have we had from the shadow Treasurer? He has had the full summer to get a costed economic policy together, and they cannot even fund their climate change policy. His only substantial contribution over the summer was to go on a TV program, put on a crown, get a tutu, wrap it round himself and wave a magic wand like some giant Tinkerbelle. That has been the only contribution to the policy debate we have had from their economic team. The Liberals got it wrong 12 months ago and they are getting it wrong again today.</DOC>

 - I welcome any debate on the cost of our respective approaches to climate change, because that put forward yesterday by those opposite does less, costs more and is totally unfunded. The question put by the Leader of the Opposition goes again to the electricity price. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the Treasury advice to the government is that prices will rise by seven per cent in 2011-12 and 12 per cent in 2012-13. I would further tell the Leader of the Opposition that the total average increase in electricity, based on the advice from the Treasury, will be $1.70 per week or $88 per year in 2011-12. That is part 1. Part 2 is this: omitted from his presentation just now is the fact that the government has something called a compensation scheme for working families.The reason the government charges polluters is to use the money from the big polluters to provide financial support to working families so that they can deal with the 1.1 per cent increase in the cost of living and provide them with the resources to then fund the acquisition of energy efficiency measures for their home. That is why we have done it that way. What is the contrast? Those opposite, when it comes to compensating working families, offer not one dollar. What they have done -  -  - He interjects on time, 'The money churn.' Guess what churn those opposite have decided to use. They reach their hand into the pocket of taxpayers and churn that money into the pockets of the big polluters. That is exactly what they have done. That is Liberal Party churn, front and centre, because what they have done is transfer the burden of climate change transition from the big polluters who cause it onto working families as taxpayers or consumers. That is it in a nutshell.I am also taken by the fact that for the first time in my life that I have been in this position I have heard those opposite cite as their source of authority a publication of the government of New South Wales. But I will just leave that to one side and ask him to reflect on the numbers that I provided before from the Treasury. The Leader of the Opposition concluded his question with this: he referred again to what he describes as the great big tax, on which he was asked three specific times last night on television whether it was an impost on consumers and taxpayers. He ducked and he weaved because he knew the answer was no.The bottom line is this - their approach is as follows: (1) they do less with their scheme, (2) it costs more for taxpayers and (3) it is not even funded. On this there are only two ways to go. You will fund your scheme by a huge additional tax yourselves because you are charging taxpayers at least three times more than the government scheme or, secondly, as the Leader of the Opposition was asked again this morning, you cut services. When asked whether he was going to cut schools, cut hospitals, cut defence, he refused to rule it out. Can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition that there are two ways you can go when you have an unfunded policy. One is that you jack up taxes and you pass them on to working families; the second is that you cut services. When asked whether he would cut hospitals and defence this morning he ran a million miles.The heart of the climate con job by the Leader of the Opposition is this: they are putting forward a scheme which costs the taxpayer three times as much. That is point 1. Point 2: those opposite know that, when it comes to the value of the carbon market over the next 10 years, the value of the carbon market is not a cost to taxpayers. It is like saying that the value of the electricity market is a cost to taxpayers and they therefore know that the value of a market as one concept does not equal a direct impost on taxpayers. What he has deliberately done is mix apples with oranges. That is the heart of the big con. It is at the very centre of the climate con job which he has tried to put forward to the Australian people. Bit by bit, tile by tile, as each day passes, it starts to crumble into a total lack of credibility. - Consistent with my previous answer, yes. - The document was confidential. Consistent with my predecessor's practice, I will not be tabling it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. A short answer to how many of these projects those opposite supported would be: none. I can answer that: none, not one, because you voted against this government's economic stimulus plan. But through the Nation Building Program we have quadrupled federal investment in rail to $7.9 billion. I was with the member for Moreton and the member for Oxley just a couple of weeks ago at Acacia Ridge to lay the last sleeper on the $55.8 million upgrade of the rail line between the Queensland-New South Wales border and Acacia Ridge. The shadow minister tries to argue they funded this. It was actually part of the economic stimulus plan that they voted against. It is true that on the day the shadow minister put out a release saying that John Anderson did it when he was transport minister - three transport ministers ago. One of those ministers is the current occupant of the shadow ministry position.This was funded under the economic stimulus plan. All the old wooden sleepers were replaced with 105,000 new concrete sleepers, meaning that jobs were created in the production of those concrete sleepers at Grafton, in the electorate of the member for Page. Significant improvements were also made to signalling and line infrastructure. Funding was announced in December 2008, 120 jobs were supported and the project was completed within 13 months.There was also a historic moment that day, because the management of this section of the rail line was transferred from the Queensland government to the Australian Rail Track Corporation, of which the Commonwealth is a shareholder. This creates, for the first time, a truly national rail network connecting all mainland states. It took us 110 years but, through the economic stimulus plan, we were able to provide the funding. Through the cooperative relationship with the states, we were able to provide the policy impetus to make sure this occurred. This was one of the 17 rail projects that were fast-tracked under the economic stimulus plan when we put some $1.2 billion of capital into the ARTC. Seven of those projects have now been completed.I am asked about other projects as well. Of the 14 major projects - collectively worth some $6 billion - that were accelerated, 10 are running ahead of schedule. Jobs are being created, and those roads will be opened ahead of schedule. We tripled work on black spots - 607 projects - 349 completed and another 131 underway. In relation to boom gates at rail crossings, there are 292 projects; 73 of which have been completed. In relation to community infrastructure projects, these are projects that they lobbied for but voted against. They are still lobbying for the second round. One by one they come around to my office lobbying for the next round of these projects. There are 3,357 projects that have been funded; 2,874 of those have been completed already. This means supporting jobs in local areas today - when they are needed. All of those - rail, road, community infrastructure - support the infrastructure development that we need for the future.</DOC>

 - Some mothers do 'ave 'em! For the member for Cowper to suggest that electricity prices have gone up in the last 12 months as a consequence of the CPRS is patently absurd. I am not suggesting -  - I am not suggesting that the small business man in question has claimed that electricity prices have gone up over the last year as a consequence of the CPRS, but that is what the member for Cowper said. As we know, the author of the question is the Manager of Opposition Business, because he repeated the question. We are quite happy for you to ask the question again. -  - I will wind up my remarks by saying that this is the most absurd question I have ever heard in this chamber. That the member for Cowper would read out a question written by the member for Sturt, the Manager of Opposition Business in the House, asserting that increases in electricity prices over the last year have been caused by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is absurd. It is an absurd question. The member for Cowper has embarrassed himself and he should think twice about asking stupid questions in the parliament.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question and for her support of the education revolution, including the My School reform. This was a reform where the parents of this nation voted with their fingertips and got onto My School. To give the House the most recent update figures from the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, they are recording 1.6 million visits to the site, 77 million page views and 176 million hits on My School - parents voting with their fingertips desperate for this information. This sentiment was well summarised in yesterday's Daily Telegraph, where Sharryn Brownlee, in talking about the reaction of her P&amp;C to this amount of information, was quoted as saying:'People really like it _ my e mails haven't stopped. They are so pleased to be able to look at the information and understand it _ this is changing the level of conversation in P and C meetings from fundraising to education topics.'That is a very well-put sentiment - and it is happening right around the nation as a result of My School. Of course, My School is also going to be used to help guide where a new $2 billion of funding, a new $2 billion of resources, for schools can go to so that it can make the biggest difference for Australian kids - part of our education revolution; part of almost doubling the amount of money going to school education from the national government over the lazy and incompetent days of the Howard government.We always knew that My School was going to be controversial. We always knew that there was going to be a lot of public debate and we always knew that there would be public debate about misuse of the information. But I regret to inform the House that there was one potential misuse of the information that we did not foresee when we launched My School. That, of course, is the misuse that the Leader of the Opposition is planning - the misuse of using the My School website to identify schools to rip money out of and stop their nation-building stimulus. The Leader of the Opposition has committed to ripping $20 billion out of our nation-building stimulus package. Given the single biggest element of the package is infrastructure in schools, if you are ripping $20 billion out of the package you are ripping money off schools.So, while Australian parents are on the site trying to work out how to improve their kids' schools and education, the Leader of the Opposition is on the site trying to find a school to rip some money out of. One wonders what the Leader of the Opposition would say to the principal of Reidy Park Primary School, who said:We would have had to have lamington drives for the next 100 years to get the money we need to get to do these sorts of things. It is wonderful.To that he would say, 'That looks like something that I can hack out and keep.' What would the Leader of the Opposition say to the principal of Southport Primary School, who said, 'The stimulus is the most wonderful thing we've seen in primary education in the whole of our careers'? Well, the Leader of the Opposition would say that he would be ripping that money out of that school. What would the Leader of the Opposition say to the principal of Sawyer's Valley, who said:_ we don't have any visual arts facilities and performing arts is taught in a very old, small building some distance from the rest of the classrooms __           _           _Having a dedicated room for visual arts will be a fantastic boost for students and staff. - 14:52:10 
The Leader of the Opposition, for some reason, is talking about MySpace. He should try to keep up. - It is called My School, not MySpace, for the edification of the Leader of the Opposition. Let me tell you the link - the opposition was opposed to both. They fought us on the legislation for the My School website and transparency, and voted against the nation-building stimulus package. The point here is a very simple one. The Leader of the Opposition likes to present himself as an honest man. Well, if he is an honest man, come clean with Australian parents about where the $20 billion is coming out of. It has got to be coming out schools. Table a list of every one so that Australian parents can see it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for that question. Today marks the anniversary of the announcement of the nation building and economic stimulus plan. It had two goals: to protect the Australian economy from the effects of the worst recession in 75 years and to build investment in Australia's future. The social housing element of the program was the largest investment in social housing at a time when investment was desperately needed in the housing industry to support jobs. As the Treasurer said earlier, by the end of December 6,675 homes had been commenced. As at the end of January, 7,784 homes are being built, with almost 500 completed and 70,000 repairs and maintenance jobs are underway, with over 42,000 completed. In fact, in the electorate of the member for Banks, we have seen the social housing program deliver 207 homes - 116 are underway and three are already complete. Of course, that is great for local business and it is great for the most vulnerable people in our society.As I have been travelling around the country I have heard many stories from local builders and local tradespeople. I was with the member for Kingston not so long ago looking at developments in that electorate. Last May, I visited a new housing site in Hackam west in Adelaide's southern suburbs. When I was there I met Bradley Jansen, the Managing Director of Qattro, a company that had won a contract to build houses in Hackam. They already had land and they planned to build 16 homes, but the global financial crisis really knocked them for six. Because the private market slowed down, Qattro were thinking about making some redundancies.Within two weeks of the government making its social housing announcement, Qattro had attended an information session and they saw opportunities for their business. The Hackam project was approved in round 1 of the social housing projects and as a result they deferred two planned redundancies. Recently, the member for Kingston invited me back to see the progress on that development. I have to say it was terrific to see that construction had started on 30 June on 13 three-bedroom homes and three 2-bedroom homes and some other work was being done on an existing property. That work has progressed apace. A number of those homes have been completed and Qattro are looking at doing the roadworks now on that development. By July people will be moving into those new homes.Mark Gardiner from Qattro told me about the jobs that this development was supporting. He talked about 20 full-time subcontractors working on this one development. They put on three new staff in their office to manage the work they were doing. Because of this stimulus work they were doing on this development, the money had been released for them to undertake other jobs that meant the pipeline was there. It is not just the stimulus work that is happening for them; having money in their business means that they can keep working on other much-needed homes across Adelaide, particularly in the southern suburbs.I want to say one other thing about these jobs. The member for Kingston and the Minister for Employment Participation held a local jobs forum in the Kingston electorate. Qattro went along to that forum and because they went they were able to employ local people. They were able to put on local contractors and subcontractors. They were able to source their kitchens locally. It meant that they were able to employ local people not just on the stimulus work; they will be able to provide ongoing employment on the 100 or so properties they build in those southern suburbs of Adelaide every year. There is the job's effect of the stimulus package but there is the ongoing jobs effect of having Qattro in touch with local builders, local plumbers, local electricians, local carpenters, local bricklayers and the ongoing work that those contractors and subcontractors will get. Behind the success story that is the social housing element of the stimulus package are hundreds of stories like this - great local employment outcomes.</DOC>

In that personal explanation, I indicated that a solicitor from Slater and Gordon contacted my former chief of staff. The only document forwarded to my office was an email, which only contained a photograph. No words were contained in the email. No specific allegations were made. Consequently, in the light of that, general inquiries were made but there were no specific allegations.On the matters in today's newspapers in the Fairfax press, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would also be aware that the member for Hunter has provided a personal explanation denying those matters and indicating that they could be the subject of legal proceedings. To assist the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I indicate that the material canvassed in today's Fairfax articles, the allegations about the member for Hunter, were news to me. The first time I was aware of them was when I read the newspapers this morning.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for her question. She has, of course, been a colleague of mine for many years. The scientific case for action on climate change is very clear. This country, as we know, faces huge environmental and economic costs from climate change and doing nothing or having pretend policies is not an option for this country. The fact is that an emissions trading scheme is the most cost-effective and efficient economy-wide approach to reducing emissions. This is a point well recognised by former Prime Minister John Howard, who had this to say on 27 May 2007:It is fundamental to any response both here and elsewhere that a price is set for carbon emissions. This is best done through the market mechanism of an emissions trading system.The Leader of the Opposition and the climate sceptics gang that got control of the leadership on the other side of this House have repudiated that fundamentally sound economic observation.Understand that the coalition's policy is not about serious public policy. It is not about seriously addressing climate change. It is all about politics, because what we know is that the new Leader of the Opposition thinks the science is absolute crap but that it is politically a problem for the coalition. So they have had to concoct a policy position that is not serious. It is a con job and we all know it. Their policy does not oblige a single emitter of carbon pollution to reduce their emissions - not a single emitter. It is based on a 'business as usual' scenario - that is, emissions can be allowed to grow. There is no obligation to reduce them. It involves no cap. Their policy involves no cap on emissions and it cannot guarantee that this country could meet any target. Instead, subsidies will be offered to favourite projects. They will be picking winners from their fund. It will be a more costly system of abatement and it will shift the cost burden from polluters to households. It offers, on that point, no compensation to households and it will not link with international efforts.In the Sydney Morning Herald, the Leader of the Opposition himself conceded that business as usual emissions growth will attract no penalty under their policy. He said: Business as usual does not result in any penalty. On current projections, business as usual emissions growth can lead to an emissions level in this economy 20 per cent higher than year 2000 levels - and that, instead of a five per cent cut, would be considered a success under the policy they announced yesterday. It is absurd and it is a con job. But Senator Joyce, who can always be relied upon, has really let the cat out of the bag. Senator Joyce said:The beauty of the scheme is if people do not want to participate in it, if they don't want access to the funds, they don't have to.So nothing happens. He said that last night on 
Lateline, but incredibly he went further. He actually thinks that greed might be something of a motivation. This is what he had to say:Because of the greed factor. People will see money on the table.That is what we have with their policy - reward for greed. This is the underpinning policy that has been put forward - no cap on emissions and no reductions in emissions growth.Just imagine when this fund is set up. The National Party is going to have a good time with it, isn't it? It will be regional rorts all over again. That is all this policy amounts to. Already, as I indicated yesterday, algae fired power stations are on the agenda - no business case and no cost analysis, but that will be a good thing to hand out money for. That is what the Leader of the Opposition cited as a likely project that would attract funding under their new fund. It is ridiculous. It is not just a con job; the policy that you put out is a farce. It is not serious public policymaking; it is a con. Any member of this House who accepts the science and is serious about climate change and reducing our emissions will support the legislation that was introduced into this House last night. Let us not forget that, less than 10 weeks ago, that side of parliament supported the legislation. You should support it again.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lyne for his question. I will come to the elements of the government's investment in transport infrastructure. First of all, I go to the Roads to Recovery Program. The government is investing a record $1.75 billion in the Roads to Recovery Program and that funds local government for local roads. The second point I would make in relation to that is that the government's investment in local roads has gone up by a quarter of a billion dollars relative to the same period under the previous government. That is the second point I would make. Thirdly, on the question of black spots, we are currently providing across the country $150 million as part of the economic stimulus plan. - I note the interjection by the Leader of the National Party, who actually voted against funding for the national Black Spot Program. I presume the National Party also voted against our boom gates program as well?Government members - Yes. - So they voted against safety for boom gates and they voted against funding under the stimulus strategy to fix black spots across the country - that is $150 million. In the electorate of Lyne, I say to the honourable member that what we have done is provide funding for councils - the Greater Taree City Council, Kempsey Shire Council and the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council. That has been increased from $11.1 million to nearly $60 million over a five-year period. That is an increase of 43 per cent.On the Blackspot Program, according to my advice we are providing $1.5 million, including stimulus funding, to fix seven blackspots in the honourable gentleman's electorate of Lyne. He asked a broader question about the fixing of timber bridges. Those are our generic responses to this challenge nationwide for local roads and for local blackspots in particular. Obviously, local government also have it within their remit to draw upon those funds for those purposes.The member for Lyne asked a legitimate question about the overall capacity of state and territory governments to provide effectively for infrastructure. Can I simply answer the honourable member's question in these terms: what many ministers and the government have been confronted with is the effect that spending responsibilities are having on the overall state of both Liberal and Labor governments across the country. This is obviously one of the factors which inform our considerations on the future of health and hospital reform. You can see the impact in terms of what has been, in many cases across the country, an underinvestment by state and local governments in local transport infrastructure. I have some knowledge, having taken a few drives myself, about the state of a number of rural bridges.Therefore, the serious answer to the honourable gentleman's question goes to the long-term structure of Commonwealth-state financial relations, and it goes to the serious question of the future spending responsibilities of the states and how that impacts also on the health and hospitals debate. In answer to the honourable member's question, that is specifically what we are doing in two categories. That is the application for his electorate and those are the increases we have made. On the broader question of the financial capacity of states and territories, we have much more reform work still to be done.</DOC>

As a result of that, the government has adopted a number of rules with respect to committing to get the budget back into surplus. One of them is to match new spending with savings. Those who care to look at the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers at the end of last year will see that that is precisely what has occurred. Unfortunately, there are some in this House who think the government is not doing enough and that the fiscal settings should be stricter. Sadly, their actions are very different from their words, because at the same time as they are indicating that the government should be tougher and should have more savings, over in the Senate they are blocking major savings legislation, defending millionaires' private health insurance subsidies at a cost of $9.5 billion to the budget, and they are announcing new spending initiatives. The other day they announced $750 million a year to help save the Murray-Darling Basin, and yesterday they announced a new spending initiative with respect to climate change: $3.2 billion over the forward estimates with no savings whatsoever - no explanation as to where the money is coming from to pay for this policy.The policy they announced was straight out of the John Howard songbook: pretend you are doing something, splash a lot of taxpayers' money around, set up a big pork barrel slush fund for the National Party, and make sure you do not upset anybody by declaring business as usual. There are a couple of critical questions about this. How is it that the half the Liberal Party who think that climate change is either a scientific fraud or a communist conspiracy are prepared to support spending $3.2 billion to address it? And how is it that the other half of the Liberal Party, who voted for the government's emissions trading legislation to be supported, now say that it should not be supported? The most significant question about this commitment is: how is it that the nations of the world gathered in Copenhagen only weeks ago to consider how to deal with climate change, and they were unable to come up with this brilliant solution that the Leader of the Opposition has somehow stumbled upon? They did not realise that if you commit to spending a quarter of a percentage point of the government's budget over a few years it will fix climate change - Dr Abbott's miracle cure for climate change. There it is in a little bottle; it is just a little bit of dirt, a few trees and a few solar panels. Mix them all together and you have got Dr Abbott's miracle cure for climate change. Can we perhaps expect that we will have delegations descending upon Australia from all around the world to see the magical miracle cure for climate change from Dr Abbott? Both the Leader of the Opposition and I are probably waiting for his hair restorer product to come out, and there will be a few other customers around the House today.Last night, my fourth opposition number, Senator Barnaby Goose or whatever his name is, let the cat out of the bag about where the money is coming from. - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. I will refer to him henceforth as my fourth shadow finance minister. Last night on Lateline Senator Joyce was asked how the coalition was going to pay for the spending that it just committed itself to with respect to climate change. His answer was that he could not say and had to wait until the Henry report on taxation emerged. That can only mean one thing because, by the time the election arrives, the government's taxation decisions with respect to the Henry report will be in the bottom line. Whether they impact this year, next year or the following year, they will be in the bottom line. So any changes that Senator Joyce proposes to make with respect to taxation will be above and beyond that. Were such changes to reduce taxation, that would not be able to pay for the $3.2 billion, would it? In other words, there is only one logical outcome from Senator Joyce's statement - that is, the opposition, if it is elected to government, is going to increase taxes in order to pay for its climate change policy.Further, this morning on the radio program 
AM, when Senator Joyce was asked a similar question, 'Can he guarantee there won't be any tax increases?' he responded, 'That's a very hard question to answer,' and then said, 'Wait for the Henry report.' The truth is that the opposition's climate change policy is simply a giant con job. It is straight out of the Howard songbook. It is pure John Howard: splash money around, set up a National Party slush fund, pretend you are doing something and meanwhile hope you can skate through. Those days are over. This government and this nation are committed to dealing with the serious challenge of climate change. That involves tough decisions, not the kind of nonsense that we saw from the Leader of the Opposition yesterday.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for the question he asked. Unfortunately for the member for La Trobe, it was clearly written by the member for Sturt and run round to him. I saw that happen with my own eyes. When you take a question from the member for Sturt the premises on which it is based are always wrong. The member for La Trobe may like to study our education revolution reforms, particularly those that we are bringing through our national partnership program for schools. - Do you want the answer or do you want to sit there and yell? Make a decision. - I am going to assume, despite his conduct, that the member for La Trobe is actually interested in education. I know it is a big assumption, but I will assume that. I have been asked about the empowerment of school principals and I am referring the member for La Trobe to our education revolution reforms, particularly the reforms we are delivering through our national partnerships that are delivering more money for disadvantaged schools, more money for literacy and numeracy and more money to improve teacher quality. In those reforms we are working to empower principals in their schools to make decisions about their schools for whole school improvement. Indeed, the very essence of these reforms is that schools that need to lift standards will be empowered locally, working through whole school improvement plans to make decisions on what would make the biggest difference for their school. It might be more teachers, teachers aides, literacy and numeracy coaches, breakfast clubs or after school hours care. There is a suite of reforms working on questions of principal empowerment. - I know the member for Sturt has not appreciated that - and the member for La Trobe is now repeating his words - but the message for the member for La Trobe is: the words of the member for Sturt are wrong and every time he repeats them he repeats an error and gets something wrong. The member for Sturt has not kept up with, studied or cared about the education revolution, other than to block and vote against things like the nation-building plan for schools and our transparency measures that delivered the My School website. On the question of working with schools under the Building the Education Revolution program, what the member for La Trobe would be aware of is this is a nation-building stimulus. He voted against it. I am sure he goes to his schools every day and says, 'I don't want you to have this money. I voted against you having this money.' He should be doing that because that would be truthful. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. As I was saying to the member for La Trobe about the three schools in his electorate, who are working on their Building the Education Revolution projects: fact No. 1, the member for La Trobe voted against them having the money; fact No. 2, we are always very willing to work with school communities to work through issues -  - I conclude by saying: the message for the member for La Trobe is as follows. He should go back to his school community and say: 'I didn't want you to have this money. I voted against it.' If there is some issue the principals would like to raise with a government that cares about education, obviously we always stand ready to work through issues. But let us see some honesty from the member for La Trobe upfront. He opposed every dollar, every brick, every nail and every building project in every school in his electorate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He has always taken a very active interest in the health needs of his community in Braddon. I know he is determined like the rest of us on this side of the House to make sure that our expenditure in health is sustainable into the future. That is why we have reintroduced our private health insurance incentive bills. They have just passed through the House today and have now been referred to the Senate.We are determined to pursue these sensible reforms because we do not think it is appropriate that taxi drivers, secretaries, nurses and others should be funding the private health insurance of politicians, bankers and millionaires. This is not an appropriate position for us long term. What was shown in the Intergenerational report that the Treasurer released at the start of the week was that private health insurance is the fastest growing expenditure item of health in -  -  - If the members opposite would like to listen to the answer, they would find that in the Intergenerational report it is clear that the private health insurance rebate is growing faster than all other expenditure in health and needs of course to be reined in. What is important to understand is the measures that have been introduced have been designed to ensure that the participation rate is not significantly affected. Our changes are designed to have a minimal impact on participation, with 99.7 per cent of people projected to maintain their hospital cover.Now that we have the opportunity with this bill going again to the Senate, we will see how serious the opposition, in particular the new finance spokesperson, is about a measure that will save $2 billion over the next four years. I know that the Leader of the Opposition does know that $2 billion is a lot of money. In fact I also know that he knows that health and hospitals cost a lot of money. He told the Australian 
late last year that one of the problems with hospitals is, 'There is not enough money.' I wonder why there is not enough money when, as health minister, the Leader of the Opposition oversaw $1 billion being pulled out of our public hospitals and then has the audacity to say, 'The problem with hospitals is they do not have enough money.' Why is that, I ask the Leader of the Opposition? The Leader of the Opposition is very good at identifying problems - hospitals need more money - but he does not have any solutions. His only solution when he was in government was to actually rip money out of our public hospitals. He is very good at being all complaint but no solution.In contrast our government has been investing in health busily for the last two years block by block, rebuilding the system that was pulled apart by the Leader of the Opposition. Now we have an opportunity to save $2 billion in a very fair and reasonable way over the next four years, nearly $10 billion over the projections for about the next 10-year period and we know it grows exponentially on Treasury advice to $100 billion by the middle of the century. This can easily be effected and it is a policy which we think is fair. It is about making private health insurance sustainable. If the new finance spokesperson meant anything at all when he said he would keep an open mind and look at anything that would deliver a net saving to the budget, the opposition would be getting on board and supporting this measure in the Senate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee very much for his question because this is a legitimate question raised by those in regional Australia. I am very much aware of the trial which is underway in his part of Australia. Let me answer his question as best I can concerning, firstly, access to general transmission and, secondly, the question of local television news - I think they were the elements of the question.Firstly, people in regional Australia will get local news. The satellite service will have a dedicated local news channel and they will be able to get their news by what is described as a red button technology. Secondly, I am advised that some people in signal black spots will need a dish for satellite television and we have announced that we will subsidise this at a cost of $400 per household. This means that everyone would be able to get digital TV and all those news channels, including everyone in regional Australia based on the advice that the government has received.Could I go on to say that in early January this year the government reached an important agreement with Australia's commercial broadcasters to deliver on the full range of digital television channels to all Australians no matter where they live. The solution being implemented by the government is aimed at ensuring that viewers in black spots around Australia will have access to the same number of television channels as are currently available in the capital cities.Furthermore, I am advised that under this agreement the commercial broadcasters will upgrade a substantial number of existing analog self-help transmission sites to digital. For areas where retransmission sites are not upgraded or which rely on the existing analog satellite service the government will fully fund a new satellite service. The service will include all free-to-air digital television services including the original three commercial and two national channels as well as new digital services such as ABC2, ABC3, SBS TWO, GO!, 7TWO and ONE HD. Furthermore, the government will provide capital and operational funds to broadcast via satellite all of the local news segments from all of the licensed areas and submarkets around Australia.Furthermore, Mr Speaker, in response to the honourable member's question I am advised that viewers would be able to access their local news via this channel as soon as it is available from broadcasters, and they would be able to select their local news on the dedicated news channel via the red button technology I referred to before, which is similar to the system that is already used on Sky News. I thank the member for his question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for the question. There has been a lot of talk in the last 24 hours about what can and cannot be done for farmers in terms of soil carbon. I think it is important to note that, under the legislation that was put to this House and to the Senate last year and was voted against by the coalition in the Senate, the government was establishing an offsets scheme for abatement for areas that were not covered by the CPRS but did count towards our international obligations. We were also establishing the national carbon offsets standard for an abatement program which did not count towards international targets. That was being established under that legislation, which at the end of last year the coalition voted against.In the scheme that was announced yesterday there are two key problems. Firstly, it is bad for farmers and, secondly, it does not deliver the reductions in carbon pollution that the Leader of the Opposition committed to on about his second day in the job. The way it is bad for farmers and the difference between what the government put to the Senate and what was announced yesterday is best described in an interview this morning on the Fran Kelly program when Peter Cosier from the Wentworth Group said: 'Well, the emissions trading scheme according to the Treasury modelling would pay farmers two, three or four times more than what the coalition policy is providing. So, if I was a farmer, I would not necessarily be that excited by what was being put forward yesterday.'The other issue that needs to be dealt with is that this does not deliver the reductions in carbon pollution under the international rules that the Leader of the Opposition committed to. It was about day 2 or 3 in the job when, in a courtyard, he stood beside the deputy and recommitted the coalition to the bipartisan approach of the five per cent reduction in emissions under the international rules. The problem they have is that under the current international rules soil carbon does not get counted. The maths are relatively simple here. By 2020, if you assume business as usual, their presumptions are the same as ours in that emissions would be at 121 per cent of 2000 levels. To reduce carbon pollution by five per cent in the year 2020 you need to find a reduction of 140 megatonnes. Eighty-five megatonnes of the 140 that they have found cannot be counted under international rules.It took two days in the job before the Leader of the Opposition committed to replicate the commitment that had been made by his predecessor, that there would be a bipartisan approach of a five per cent reduction under international rules. Instead they get a 55-megatonne reduction at best which means that, when the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme offers a five per cent reduction by 2020, the Leader of the Opposition offers a 10 per cent increase in emissions by 2020. The Leader of the Opposition is the only person in the world who is arguing that the response to climate change should be to increase carbon pollution. Under international rules the difference between each side of the House is simple. We reduce carbon pollution by five per cent; they increase it by at least 10.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mayo for his question. Firstly, on the question of the release of waters from New South Wales to the state of South Australia and the various needs placed on the Murray in that state both urban and rural, the Premier of South Australia and I have discussed this. Secondly, I have also discussed it with the Premier of New South Wales. Could I also say in response to the honourable member's question that the Minister for Climate Change and Water has actively discussed the needs of South Australia with both premiers. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects about action. What occurred as a consequence of that was the release of 148 gigalitres from the New South Wales system into the South Australian system.An opposition member - What's happened? - Can I say to the honourable member who interjects about what action has occurred -  - The member for Sturt interjected and said: have I written a letter back? I have told him what action ensued, and the action that ensued was the release of 148 gigalitres from the New South Wales system into South Australia. This is a significant action by New South Wales. It occurred within the framework of the cooperation which now underpins the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the discussions which now occur within it on how we can provide water from the system into South Australia to meet its various needs. So, if the question is about a request for action and the delivery of action, I would draw the honourable member's attention to the facts of what transpired, the actions of this government within it and the specific responsibilities and action by our Minister for Climate Change and Water.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I do notice on this question of climate change that, within barely 24 hours of the release of the alternative plan, we had about three or four questions from those opposite on climate change, and then it went elsewhere.I am asked about the integrity and transparency of dealing with the effectiveness and costs of different approaches to climate change. The government has described the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday as a giant climate con job, and we have done so for three or four specific reasons. The first is this: it does less, it costs more and it is totally unfunded. These are very basic propositions. It does less because they do not cap carbon; it costs more because the cost to taxpayers is 300 per cent more than that put forward by the government. The reason that occurs is that they have let the big polluters off scot-free and instead they have transferred the burden to taxpayers and consumers. That is con No. 1.What is con No. 2? Con No. 2 is: where do they fund this totally unfunded scheme from? The Minister for Finance and Deregulation referred today to Senator Joyce's intervention in this debate, and the bottom line is that if you have, at their calculation, more than $10 billion invested in this scheme - $10 billion possibly rising - then the question is that you can fund it by an increased tax or you can fund it by cutting services for schools, for hospitals or for defence. In these areas today they were asked and they ruled out none. That is con No. 2.What is con No. 3? Con No. 3 is the performance last night by the Leader of the Opposition on the absolute giant con at the middle of this overall con job, and that is his comparison of apples with oranges. He was challenged three times by Kerry O'Brien to come clean on his so-called giant tax. Three times he ducked and weaved - this is the 'straight-talking' Leader of the Opposition: three times asked a straight question, duck and weave, duck and weave and duck and weave - because the giant con at the centre of it was his equation of the total value of the carbon market on the one hand with the value of a total tax and direct tax on the Australian consumer and household on the other. That is the absolute con. He knows that. Everyone who follows this debate knows that.But, as they say, there is more. I would go to the whole question of the bona fides of their engagement in this debate on climate change generally. We know the Leader of the Opposition has said in the past, in his own words, that climate change is 'absolute crap'. Those are his words, not mine. But he has also sought to invoke the authority of others to legitimise the plan that he put forward yesterday. Let me quote to you what he said. He said yesterday:I do want to draw your attention to the work that has been done by Frontier Economics who have said that our policy is economically and environmentally responsible.Furthermore, he went on and said:_ it was incidentally designed by Frontier Economics who are very happy with the scheme that we are putting up today.For the information of the House, that was yesterday. Today we have had some developments. The managing director of Frontier Economics, Mr Danny Price, said a few hours ago the following:Well, we've looked at Tony Abbott's scheme - two things, really: the quantity of abatement from the different sources and whether the costs actually add up. We've never said anything about whether that's more cost effective than the CPRS or, indeed, what we proposed, so it's been a very limited review in this case.But there is more, because the managing director of Frontier Economics, Mr Danny Price, was invoked by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, if I read it correctly, as part of the mob who designed it; it was designed by Frontier Economics, to quote him. The Leader of the Opposition says here:I do want to draw your attention to the work that has been done by Frontier Economics who have said that our policy is economically and environmentally responsible.That is what the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday. Let me go on, therefore, to what Frontier Economics have said today on radio. The radio presenter said:Mr Abbott's saying he's got an emissions reduction fund which will raise $1 billion over four years but, okay, he's not calling it a carbon tax, but that's a tax. That's got to be money found that would normally be spent on health, education et cetera, so it's a tax indirectly.That is the radio presenter. Here is the answer given by Danny Price, the managing director of Frontier Economics. In response to that question, he says:Yep. So, instead of under the government's scheme where producers and consumers are having to buy permits and the government handing the money back again, what's happening again is the government will have to pay for it by changing taxes and changing expenditures.That is his description of what they are putting forward. Can I say to those opposite: let me just repeat what Mr Price from Frontier Economics said:So, instead of under the government's scheme where producers and consumers are having to buy permits and the government handing the money back again, what's happening again is the government will have to pay for it by changing taxes and changing expenditures.Let us be very clear about this. -  - With those opposite you always know when there is a problem because the volume goes up on their side. So we have this from Frontier Economics, which was cited by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday when he said:I do want to draw your attention to the work that has been done by Frontier Economics who have said that our policy is economically and environmentally responsible.They have said:We've never said anything about whether that's more cost effective than the CPRS or, indeed, what we proposed, so it's been a very limited review in this case.If you are going to go out there and try and claw together some credibility from Frontier Economics, to invoke their name in the debate, and then the managing director of Frontier Economics comes out 24 hours later and effectively distances that organisation from the detail of the plan which has been put forward, what that does is let the cat out of the bag. The Leader of the Opposition says he is a straight talker. He came out yesterday and said that this organisation, Frontier Economics, were pretty happy with what they had put forward. Frontier Economics have had a different point of view put out to the public today. If you cannot even line up Frontier Economics behind your plan 24 hours after you have released it, I think you have a credibility problem.Always remember, when it comes to the credibility on this question, what the former Leader of the Opposition had to say about the current Leader of the Opposition on climate change. When it comes to climate change - and Mr Abbott has changed his position four or five times over the last five or six months - the former Leader of the Opposition says that the current Leader of the Opposition would go in and say, 'Mate, you know that on climate change I am just a bit of a political weathervane'. All that goes to underpin the point that he believes that climate change, in his own words, is 'absolute crap' and the entire scheme he has put forward is not effective, does not add up and therefore, frankly, does not deserve the support of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - My first response to the Leader of the Opposition's question is that the decision to back an emissions trading scheme in this country was first taken by John Howard as Prime Minister of Australia two years ago. The second point is that it was a decision also supported by the then Treasurer, Mr Costello, and, until five or six weeks ago, it was a decision supported by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth. It has also been a position supported by the member for Flinders and various members that I can identify across the front bench of the coalition.On the question of the United States, which the honourable member has asked about, can I say this: in the United States President Obama confronts an institution which is well known to this place as well - it is called 'the senate'. The senate in the United States is not necessarily going to be accommodating of his aspirations to introduce an emissions trading scheme. On the question of global action in emissions trading I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to answer this: why is it that 30 advanced economies around the world have made the same decision as John Howard, Peter Costello, Malcolm Turnbull and, until six weeks ago, all of those represented opposite? The reason for this change is that those opposite have chosen instead a path which is all about the politics of complaint, not the policy of solution.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The preface to her question is an important one, because this Labor government has been committed to a market based response to dealing with the challenge of climate change, as historically has the Liberal Party of Australia as opposed to those opposite, who now adopt what has been elegantly described by the former Leader of the Opposition as a 'command and control' approach to bringing about any effective change on climate change.Reform in Australia is a hard business; it always has been. Therefore, when you look at this challenge of climate change, it will be hard in this area as well. If we look back over the last quarter of a century, we can see that the reforms, back in the eighties and nineties, to the Australian economy were hard-won reforms. The reforms that introduced compulsory superannuation, for example, were hard-won reforms. This economy, a quarter of a century later, benefits from governments which had the  courage to make hard decisions in hard areas of reform. Had those decisions not been taken by governments back then, the flexibility of our economy to deal most recently with the challenges of the global financial crisis would have been put to the test indeed.The reform which the economy must undergo in relation to climate change falls exactly into this category. We can either undertake this reform now for the future or we can continue to push it off and push it off and push it off. If we continue to push it off, as those opposite are recommending in their approach, then the reality is that the costs of climate change then come back to fundamentally undermine our future economic wellbeing, whether through its impact on agriculture, the devastation of the Murray-Darling, the impact on tourism in the Great Barrier Reef or the intensification of drought across our nation, our economy and our rural communities as well.It was for these reasons that, having conducted a large number of investigations, the Howard government, through the task group on emissions trading, the Garnaut review, the UK Stern report on the economics of climate change - all these independent examinations - reached one conclusion: the most effective and least costly means to execute change in response to the challenge of climate change was through a market based system. That was the conclusion they reached and that is why all those individual governments  and political leaders at the time reached the same conclusion. Our approach to climate change is based on five core principles: (1) the science; (2) cost; (3) effectiveness; (4) our global engagement; and (5) consistency of approach. On the science, it is fundamental that we on this side of the House accept the climate change science. The Leader of the Opposition has stated elegantly - or inelegantly but effectively - his view on the climate change science. In his owns words: climate change is 'absolute crap'. That is his view. That is not the government's view.The House may be interested to know what the shadow minister responsible for climate change had to say on the science today. In an interview on 4 February on NewsRadio, the member for Flinders answered in these terms: 'My view is very clear. I happen to be, on balance, of the view that the science for climate change is strong and compelling.' - He has given up! Well done, Greg. I say to the member for Flinders that the Leader of the Opposition has given up, and that is the point. I commend the member for Flinders for at least sticking to his consistent position on accepting the science of climate change. This contrasts with the view of the leader he now serves. The Leader of the Opposition now says: 'The science is not entirely settled; there is still considerable room to question on this.' And elsewhere he has said that he is 'entirely underwhelmed' by the science. More compellingly, in his own vernacular, he says that it is 'absolute crap'. We have a Leader of the Opposition, the alternative Prime Minister of Australia who says that climate change is absolute crap and a shadow minister for the environment who says that the evidence is strong and compelling. Is it any wonder that the parliament of the nation is confused on this question?I said there were five principles. Science is one. The second is the cost mechanism. Our approach is simple: we use a market based approach, and that is because we believe that the cost should be borne by the major polluters. Their approach is that the cost should be borne by the taxpayer. Therefore, the difference between the two approaches is simple: theirs is three times more expensive than ours, at least, and it is a $10 billion-plus charge and impost on the taxpayer. On the question of cost, it speaks for itself.Then we go to the question of effectiveness, the third criteria for examining how you are going to deal with this challenge of climate change. Here again we had some interesting developments overnight in the assessment made of the environmental effectiveness of the plan put forward by the Leader of the Opposition the other day. The net result of the plan put forward by the Leader of the Opposition is not to decrease Australia's carbon pollution but to increase it by 13 per cent. Those opposite, through any independent and external analysis of what they have put forward, would know it does not come within a bull's roar of the 138 megatonnes necessary to bring in a five per cent reduction on Australia's overall emissions target. In fact, the conclusion of the Department of Climate Change, looking at it generously, is it would generate 40 million tonnes. That is the third factor. No. 1: they reject the science. No. 2: we accept the science. - On the science, the difference is very clear. We accept the science; they reject the science. On the question of cost, they have chosen the most costly scheme and we have chosen the least costly scheme because it is market based. On effectiveness, our approach is simple: we will bring about a five per cent reduction in carbon pollution because we set a cap on pollution. Their scheme has been judged by the independent analysts of the Department of Climate Change as representing not a decrease in carbon pollution but an increase in carbon pollution.On the question of global responsibility which the honourable Leader of the Opposition just referred to before, the commitments which have been made around the world so far are along the following lines: Japan has committed to a 25 per cent reduction on 1990 levels, the European nations have committed to between 20 and 30 per cent reductions on 1990 levels, the United States has committed to a 17 per cent reduction on 2005 levels, India has committed to reducing emissions intensity by 20 to 25 per cent and China has committed to reduce carbon intensity by 40 to 45 per cent on 2005 levels by 2020.These are the elements by which you analyse the policy, but it goes back to one thing: do you believe them? The Leader of the Opposition knows that he does not believe that climate change is happening. He said that the planet is in fact getting cooler, not warmer. His shadow environment minister has said today that he is wrong. He has said quite clearly to the parliament today that the Leader of the Opposition has given up. You know something? That is precisely what he has done because he thinks the politics is too rich a minefield to harvest and will leave the policy alone for the long term.

 - I welcome the debate on alternative policies on climate change. In the lengthy question asked by the Leader of the Opposition he referred to a well-known consultancy firm called Frontier Economics. It is interesting to see what Frontier had to say about the scheme put forward by those opposite, because when asked again about this on radio yesterday the well-known Danny Price from Frontier Economics said this: 'So I am in favour, ultimately, of a trading scheme.' That is what Frontier Economics said.The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, the day before or the day before that that Frontier Economics were full backers of his approach. It strikes me as passing strange that the full backers of his approach say that the only way to deal with these challenges in the long term is through a market based system. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you are going to invoke an authority like Frontier Economics to justify your position, you get onto the telephone and you ask them, 'Guys, are you going to back me up?' because on this occasion they walked away from it at a million miles an hour.The second part of the question which the honourable Leader of the Opposition asked was about electricity prices. I repeat what I said to him yesterday: price rises would be seven per cent in 2011-12 and 12 per cent in 2012-13. Yesterday, the shadow Treasurer said that there was something remarkably new in this. I draw his attention to a statement which was released by the Minister for Climate Change and Water in November of last year following the negotiations with your side of politics when we agreed on the approach to this. That contained within it precisely the final position vis-a-vis the impact on electricity and gas prices. The prices were put in those terms and at that amount because that was the deal we struck with you. That was contained in the statement and the letter by the minister in November last year and we have been absolutely consistent about that.The final point I make in response to the Leader of the Opposition is this: through a market based system dealing with the challenge of climate, we have indicated quite plainly what the impact on prices will be. Mr Howard said when he was Prime Minister that if you are going to act on climate change it will have an effect on prices. That is what happens. Here is the difference. This government put forward a proposal which says that if prices are going up we will take the money we get from the biggest polluters in the country and use that to provide compensation to working families so that working families can use that money to invest in other forms of energy efficiency. We provide compensation: 92 per cent of Australian households are provided with compensation. How much is provided by way of compensation by those opposite? A big fat zero. Overall, it is a bit like this: we provide a scheme which is low cost, we provide a scheme which is more effective and we provide a scheme which is totally funded; they provide a scheme which is ineffective, which is high cost and which is totally without any funding detail at all.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Brisbane for his question. The climate science is very clear and so is the economics, and the fact of the matter is that an emissions trading scheme is the least costly, most economically efficient way of reducing carbon pollution. That conclusion, of course, is based on extensive research and analysis. There have been major reports, such as the UK's Stern review, considered internationally. Within Australia, the government of course has had regard to all of the advice available to it, from Treasury to the Department of Climate Change and the work done by Professor Garnaut - reflected, of course, in the government's green and white papers.As the Prime Minister indicated earlier, the previous Prime Minister, John Howard, embraced an emissions trading scheme and took it to the last election on the basis of his own extensive report, the Shergold review. The fact of the matter is that the new Leader of the Opposition not only repudiates the science but has abandoned all pretence of sound economics as well. His policy is all dishonest posturing, a pretence and a con job. There was some mention made a couple of moments ago about Mr Danny Price from Frontier Economics. The interesting thing, of course, is that at his press conference releasing this policy the Leader of the Opposition asserted that Frontier supported the policy and said that Frontier thought it was economically and environmentally responsible. But, going through Mr Price's comments on 2GB, he said, 'Our reputation is extremely important to us,' and then went on to say, 'We've never said anything about whether that is more cost effective' - referring to the Liberal Party policy - 'than the CPRS, so it has been a very limited review in this case.' I would not call that a sound endorsement of the policy.But, worse than that, the Leader of the Opposition has now aligned himself with Margaret Thatcher's former offsider, Lord Monckton, who we know, of course, to be the champion of climate change sceptics. This is a man who the Leader of the Opposition met last night and who said that the international climate change negotiations are 'about to impose a communist government on the world'. - You look a bit excitable there, mate. Just relax. Lord Monckton said the climate change negotiations were 'about to impose a communist government on the world'. Sounds a bit like Senator Minchin, doesn't it? Lord Monckton also called young climate activists in Copenhagen 'Hitler Youth'. That is what Lord Monckton had to say. This is the astonishing thing: this guy is even too way out there for Senator Joyce. This is what Senator Joyce, the shadow finance minister, had to say. This is extraordinary:Obviously I and my constituency have some doubts (about the science) but when you find yourself waltzing with the fringe you should take a step back..You ought to have a listen to that one, mate. You are way out there.On the economics, the Leader of the Opposition claims that his policy will reduce emissions by five per cent, and we know that claim to be dishonest; emissions will continue to rise. The Department of Climate Change, as it was reported today, confirms that this is a con job and that emissions are forecast to rise by 13 per cent on year 2000 levels. The advice goes on to say:The Emissions Reduction Fund is far more complex than has been implied by the Opposition, and certainly more difficult to implement than the CPRS.It is bad economics, it is bad for the environment and it is a repudiation of the science. Their proposal will cost more and do less, and it is not funded. Any member of this House who accepts the science and respects sound economics will support the legislation that is being debated in this House now. It was accepted by that side of politics less than 10 weeks ago. It is sound public policy. Yours is a farce. -  - </DOC>

 - The honourable member will know full well that each family's income circumstances differ depending on the numbers of children and the arrangements. -  - I am about to go to the question that was asked. First and foremost I say to the shadow Treasurer that when it comes to compensation for the government's proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme all low-income households will receive full assistance. Secondly, I say to the shadow Treasurer that 50 per cent of middle-income households will receive full assistance. Practically all middle-income households will receive some assistance and finally 92 per cent of all households will receive assistance. On average these households will receive about $660 of compensation or be about $60 better off as a result of the CPRS. In the definition of the thresholds of household income, which goes to the actual question that the honourable gentlemen asked, the definition of low household income as far as a single income is concerned is $30,000, for a couple without children it is $45,000, for a couple with children it is $60,000 -  - In response to the shadow Treasurer's question, first of all what I detailed was the spectrum of the government's compensation package and, secondly, went to the income thresholds which define first of all low-income earners, medium-income earners and high. Low-income earners are those I just defined, medium single income earners are between $30,000 to $80,000 and between $45,000 to $120,000 for a couple without children -  - As I was saying before the actual thresholds which apply to these levels of compensation go from low through medium to high ranging from $30,000 for a single income earner, medium being $30,000 to $80,000 and high above $80,000. In terms of the actual level of assistance, which goes to the other part of the honourable member's question, for low-income earners there are 2.9 million households in the country. The average annual price impact is $420 and the average annual assistance will be $610. For middle-income earners there are 3.7 million households. The average annual impact will be $650 and the average annual assistance will be $700. If the honourable member would like further information on these matters, I am sure we could provide it in due course.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. The financial framework underpinning policies to tackle climate change is an extremely important matter, particularly as these are issues that relate to fundamental change in our economy. Such financial frameworks are important with respect to producing the maximum outcomes with minimum cost to taxpayers, minimum impact on the budget and minimum disruption to the Australian economy. Unfortunately, the alternative that has been released this week by the Leader of the Opposition has a very familiar ring about it. There is a grab bag of gimmicks, the giant slush fund for the National Party to hand out to their mates, the lack of teeth - it is all voluntary - all of those things have a very familiar ring to them.That familiar ring is no coincidence, because, if we look back to the former Howard government and the former Prime Minister, John Howard, before he committed to putting in place an emissions trading scheme, we will see some remarkable similarities between those policies and the policies being advocated by the Leader of the Opposition. I would just like to give a few examples of some of the programs put in place by the Howard government to allegedly address climate change over its time in office. This is by no means an exhaustive list: Local Greenhouse Action, Greenhouse Challenge Plus, Climate Change Science Program, Low Emissions Technology and Abatement program, Renewable Energy Commercialisation Program, Solar Cities program, Remote Renewable Power Generation Program, Photovoltaic Rebate Program, Green Vouchers for Schools, Green Stamp program, Action on Energy Efficiency program, National Climate Change Adaptation Program - and so the list goes on.Time prevents me from giving you the full list, Mr Speaker, but I would like to draw attention to one remaining John Howard program, and that is the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program, a grants program that was designed to fund projects and activities that deliver large-scale emissions abatement that would otherwise not occur. Sound familiar? It sounds an awful lot like the $2½ billion crock that is in the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition this week. It is precisely the old John Howard policies. We are going back to the good old days of 'Honest John', except now it is his love child, 'Phoney Tony'. The script is the same, but it is now 'Phoney Tony' instead of 'Honest John'. The script is: pretend you will do something, hand over bucketloads of money to the National Party to dish out to their mates and not have a serious impact on the problem because it is all voluntary. It is all business as usual according to the opposition's policies.We have seen from the Department of Climate Change's analysis that has been released that the impact on emissions of the proposals put forward by the Leader of the Opposition would be roughly a third of that claimed. So, in other words, if he is to seek to achieve his objective that he allegedly shares with the government - the targets he shares with the government - he would have to increase his spending to somewhere close to treble what he is already committed to, which on his own admission, is an additional $10 billion or so over a 10-year period on top of the $9½ billion he is ripping out of the budget to protect the subsidies for private health insurance for millionaires. This all demonstrates that this is nothing but a giant con job on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. It has little impact on climate change, it involves a massive hit to the budget and it recycles the failed strategies of the past from John Howard.</DOC>

 - If I heard the member for North Sydney's question correctly, he referred to, I think, a double-income family - am I right? Was it with two children? - Oh, a double-income family. Could I draw the honourable member's attention to the following. Under the household assistance package income levels, medium income levels are defined as: single, $30,000 to $80,000; couples with children, $45,000 to $120,000. The medium-income families will have 50 per cent as much as those families who will receive full assistance. As for other households, they will be receiving some assistance.The second part of my answer to the question is this: as the member for North Sydney knows and as the Leader of the Opposition knows -  -  - The Leader of the Opposition refers to families in Australia. There are 8.8 million families in Australia; 8.1 million of them will receive compensation under the government's proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Secondly, they are divided into three sets of income thresholds, as I have just described before. I have also described to him what the compensation arrangements which apply to middle-income earners are.Can I say finally to the Leader of the Opposition and to the shadow Treasurer, who asked the question: they know as well as anyone else in this place that each individual's circumstances vis-a-vis other taxation arrangements which were obtained in the individual case and other social security benefits which were obtained in the individual case, are just the individual's circumstances, and they know it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question. Indeed, I was up in his electorate just a week ago opening one of the projects that we have brought forward as part of the Economic Stimulus Plan. Indeed, we on this side of the House support nation building, and we have ensured that the nation-building program we have established will not only be good for future productivity but also be a part of the action dealing with climate change, because what investment in rail, particularly urban rail, does is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. So we are using a whole-of-government approach to deal with climate change. But, of course, we recognise that you cannot have a piecemeal approach. In order to move to a carbon constrained economy, you need a price signal for the long term, which is why we support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.But, of course, the Leader of the Opposition has repeatedly stated that he wants to cancel the final stage of the Economic Stimulus Plan, and he has labelled the multibillion-dollar investment in the nation's road, urban public rail and port infrastructure as 'low-quality spending'. His finance spokesperson, Senator Joyce, has gone even further, telling Sky News on 10 December:Well I think the whole _ stimulus package was not warranted in the form it went out. I think the stimulus package was inappropriate.It is pretty clear that they were planning deep cuts to infrastructure spending before this week. But we now know that they have to find money to fund their $10 billion climate change con including $3.2 billion over the forward estimates. What we now know is that not only have the climate sceptics taken over over there, the market sceptics have taken over over there as well. You wonder where this inspiration comes from. John Howard looked to Menzies for inspiration. We know that Peter Costello looked in the mirror for inspiration. Brendan Nelson looked to the ALP for inspiration. Malcolm Turnbull looked to George Souris for inspiration and now we have the new Leader of the Opposition with his source of inspiration - the mad monk meets Lord Monckton. Both of them denying the science -  - If you are offended I will withdraw. We know that the previous Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, had Godwin Grech. This bloke, Tony Abbott, has Lord Monckton -  - because his scepticism on climate change would bring him down.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. I go first of all to the preface to his question about big taxes. Can I just remind him that the one he is putting forward is three times more expensive than what the government has put forward. Furthermore the opposition's scheme will cost more than $1,000 per household by 2020 on their current numbers, and can I say to those opposite -  -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was responding to the Leader of the National Party's question, the first part of which went to big taxes and the second part of which -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Can I say in response to the Leader of the National Party's question, the first part of which went to the question of big taxes, I simply, as a matter of truth, assert that their proposal costs the taxpayer more than $10 billion - that is what they say. Our proposal costs the taxpayer $3.3 billion. On a matter of fact theirs is three times the cost of the government's plan.I am in a position where I am trying to implement standing orders that I am on the record as describing in this place, both as Speaker and before being Speaker, as not being a level playing field. If we want to rule out argument and other matter in questions, I am happy to do that. But I think that people should reflect upon what the consequence would be of that. The Prime Minister has the call, he is responding to the question, and I hope that he will be heard in silence. - I respond to the Leader of the National Party, whose question did go in two parts: the first was his reference to big taxes and the second was on the question of compensation arrangements.I was responding to the first one before: by the opposition's own admission their proposal would cost the taxpayer more than $10 billion. The government's proposal is $3.3 billion. By definition, it is three times larger. -  - The second point I would make to the Leader of the Opposition, who seems to be getting pretty excited in question time today, is that if they were to be fair dinkum about the actual emissions target then of course the tax burden goes through the absolute roof. - If you look at those numbers and how they flow out over the decade, of course, they add up to something equivalent to, or perhaps larger than, $1,000 per family as a taxation burden which would flow from the proposal put forward by the opposition. Of course, the alternative in terms of funding it lies in cutting services, and the Leader of the Opposition refused to rule out cuts to defence and refused to rule out cuts to hospitals and therefore, of course, we have had nothing either on the tax side or the spend side to clarify the whole nature of the big tax position and topic which the Leader of the National Party referred to before.My next point on the big tax question is about whether the opposition are serious about the abatement task, which is reducing carbon pollution. Today, we have expert analysis from the Department of Climate Change that the overall impact of the scheme put forward by those opposite is to bring out 40 million tonnes reduction in overall carbon pollution. Of course, the target is 138 million tonnes if we are to be serious about a five per cent reduction overall. So, as I have said in response to an earlier question, if they are only going to do 40 million tonnes reduction, that actually results over time in a 13 per cent increase in the overall emissions in the economy. So they end up paying more in their scheme and we still push out more carbon pollution into the future. It does not add up.But, if they were actually serious about the target of 138 million tonnes worth of greenhouse gas emissions, I am also advised that in fact the tax burden goes beyond $10 billion into multiples beyond that. So I just say to those opposite: if you are putting forward a scheme which does less and costs more you should think very long and hard before you ask questions about other schemes.Now, on the question of compensation which the Leader of the National Party also referred to, I say to the Leader of the National Party that the compensation regime which we have put forward has been clear on the public record for a long time. It applies to different income categories and it has been the subject of multiple questions in this place. In terms of how the scheme is reviewed over time, once the scheme commences household assistance would continue into the future. Secondly, because these assistance payments are indexed to the CPI, assistance will automatically increase in line with increasing carbon prices that affect household costs.I also say that before the scheme commences and indexation begins the government is committed to adjusting the initial level of household assistance if the cost of living impacts are higher than expected. Finally, I say to the Leader of the National Party that the government will also annually review in the budget context the adequacy of assistance to all households, noting that these payments are already automatically increased.These, and the government's position on how we approach indexation, are clear on the public record. That is the response to how we would look at future levels of assistance across the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. Data released today provides further encouraging signs of Australia's continuing economic recovery and evidence of how well the economy has performed in the face of the very strong headwinds that we have felt from the global economy. Today's retail figures show that retail trade values rose 2.1 per cent through 2009, notwithstanding a modest fall in the month of December. For the December quarter, retail trade volumes rose by a strong 1.1 per cent. This demonstrates the very important role that stimulus has played in giving consumers the confidence to keep spending. We have also received encouraging news about activity in the home-building sector. Total residential building approvals were up 2.2 per cent in December and by 53.3 per cent over 2009. That is the strongest annual growth in almost eight years.This comes on top of the Access Economics Investment monitor released today, which shows the government's infrastructure stimulus has helped underpin investment in the economy. Compared with a year ago, there has been a big increase in the value of definite projects now going ahead. Our nation-building investments in schools, roads, rail and ports are a big reason for that improvement. This is what Access Economics had to say:Significant government investment also played a very strong helping hand, most notably the federal government's schools upgrade program.So our infrastructure stimulus has provided a pipeline of projects that will continue to underpin confidence and jobs in the Australian economy. Today's figures show again why Australians should be confident, though not complacent, about our economic prospects. We are encouraged by the signs that we are seeing that stimulus has worked to support the recovery, but we know that there are challenges ahead.The biggest threat to this recovery is the threat by those opposite to rip the rug out from under the stimulus. If they had their way they would rip out the stimulus, costing tens of thousands of jobs, fundamentally impacting upon confidence in the economy and threatening the employment of tens of thousands of tradies right around this country. That would simply shatter confidence. On the one hand, those opposite are saying they are going to rip out stimulus. But of course, on the other, they are going round the country making unfunded promises. It has been something like 65 days since the Leader of the Opposition has had the job. In that time he has racked up $10.7 billion over five years in unfunded commitments. That is his record so far. It is pretty breathtaking.The Leader of the Opposition is bored by economics. We know why he is bored by economics, and that is because he simply does not understand it. He has a shadow Treasurer that is so lazy we have not seen a funded policy produced by those opposite. All of those opposite - but particularly the Leader of the Opposition, particularly the shadow Treasurer and particularly the shadow finance minister - live in fantasy land. They believe in magic puddings. They think you can spend more, lower tax and have a lower deficit. That is their magic pudding. It is no wonder the shadow Treasurer is wandering around waving magic wands and wrapping himself in tutus. It is fantasy land. The Leader of the Opposition is going around dressed like Borat and the shadow finance minister is living in the Stone Age - Barnaby Rubble, getting out his rock abacus and embarrassing himself at the National Press Club. - I withdraw, Mr Speaker, and I will conclude with these words. It is no wonder, after four leaders in a few years, four leaders in just over two years, what a divided rabble the opposition are. With three shadow treasurers in two years, it is no wonder their economic credibility is a smoking ruin.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and particularly for raising issues in relation to the CPRS, which is always a good chance to highlight the opposition's climate con job. When it comes to their plan, we certainly know it does not work. I am very pleased to be here talking about our record funding when it comes to nursing homes. I would like to outline how we are building a modern aged-care system for Australia, with more services for older Australians, more funding -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. We are meeting the challenges of our ageing population also by improving the quality of our aged-care workforce with major investment. I am very pleased the member for Dickson has asked a question particularly in relation to aged care. When the opposition leader was the minister for health, he ripped a whole billion dollars out of the health and hospital system. He was the Minister for Health and Ageing for a period of four years in which he underfunded both health and aged care. - I have already outlined many, many faults with your plans and I have also highlighted our funding arrangements. Also, it has been fully outlined that compensation is available. Can I finalise my comments by saying that the Leader of the Opposition, the former Minister for Health and Ageing, ripped a billion dollars out of the health and aged-care sector. By standing up in this place and making comments in relation to the future of our aged-care system, the member for Dickson highlights his sheer audacity and the extremely inefficient job the Leader of the Opposition did when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. I know that she supports the improvements in her local schools. She has asked me about recent commentary about the Building the Education Revolution program. It is very simple to summarise: parents, teachers and students love it and the opposition hate the Building the Education Revolution program. Unbelievably, on Lateline the shadow minister for finance, Senator Barnaby Joyce, when talking about our Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, of which Building the Education Revolution is a major part, said:What did it deliver us? Give me one outcome that the Labor Party stimulus delivered us?He went on to describe himself as an accountant not fascinated by numbers, so he is going to fit right in with an opposition led by an erratic and volatile man not interested in economics. When we come to the numbers that Barnaby Joyce has missed, they actually tell a story - the numbers about the growth in our economy which meant that this nation stayed out of recession; the numbers about the employment in our economy that show that we supported jobs and continue to support jobs at a crucial time. Senator Barnaby Joyce must have missed the following numbers under the Building the Education Revolution program: 24,009 infrastructure projects are due in our schools, including 10,656 projects in 7,961 primary schools under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program.Senator Barnaby Joyce's crime is not just ignoring these numbers - if he was just ignoring these numbers then he would be foolish; of course, it is more than that. On Lateline when he was asked about how the opposition is going to finance its climate change con job, he said:_ look at the money squandered on their school halls.Senator Barnaby Joyce, confirming proof positive that in order to finance the climate change con job put together by the climate change sceptic who now leads the opposition, the target for their savings will be stopping money being delivered to schools under the Building the Education Revolution program. I think that the opposition need to think about the reaction of school communities to being told that the climate change con job is going to be financed by their local school having money due to it ripped out. I can see some very pale faces on the backbench of the opposition now as they think about explaining that to their local school communities.How would they explain it? How would they explain it to people like Peter Shaw, who is the principal of St Mary's College, who said about the Building the Education Revolution: 'This building program will increase the opportunities for our students to gain skills for local employment and increase their ability to access a career of choice' - getting skills for life and work, something that could be stopped in order to finance the climate change con job! What would they say to Rob Wannon, the chairman of the council of the Knox Grammar School, who said: 'As one of the aims of the scheme is to stimulate the economy through employment, you would be happy to know that our project has already led to the employment of over 20 businesses involved in the design of the new facilities and will shortly result in the employment of over 100 construction personnel.' - I thank the shadow Treasurer for confirming his opposition to expenditure on the Knox school. Maybe he would like to explain to the 100 workers who are being supported by that project why he does not think they deserve a job and why he does not think their families deserve to have a breadwinner in their family. It is quite clear from the reaction of the opposition that they value so little expenditure on schools that it is the obvious target for ripping out money to finance their climate change con job. That is the cost to Australian families and Australian school students.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition's question is in two parts. It is about compensation on the one hand and about big taxes on the other. If I could just refer briefly to the second part of his observation first, it goes to the size of the tax he is proposing - $10 billion in terms of the cost to the taxpayer. We are also advised that if they were to actually be serious about their target of five per cent, the cost to the taxpayer, wait for it, would rise to $27 billion. Can I say to those opposite that this is an extraordinary exchange when they talk about taxes, and we have a scheme from them which in overall terms costs more, does less and is totally unfunded.The second part of the honourable member's question goes to compensation. He refers to the compensation schedule that we have put forward. I note in passing they offer not a dollar of the compensation to any working family anywhere in the country. The household categories are as I described before; the compensation regimes are as I described before as well. For the individuals concerned, and for all those who are going to be affected by the introduction of an emissions trading scheme, I simply go to the point that the cost of living impact as advised to the government by the Treasury is 1.1 per cent. That will flow through to households. What we have for low- and middle-income households is a compensation regime. That is clear; the cost impact has been identified by the government as well, and that is equally clear.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for her question. It is important to maintain  -  - I again thank the member for Canberra for her question. It is important that we have clear and precise commitments and indeed commentary with respect to the public finances in order to maintain public confidence. Unfortunately we are getting exactly the opposite from the new opposition leader and the new, fourth in this term, shadow finance minister. The opposition says that the deficits projected in the budget as a result of the global financial crisis are too big and the debt that is commensurate with that is too high. But they continue to block major savings initiatives in the Senate such as the private health insurance rebate reforms which would save $9½ billion over the next 10 years, and of course they have made huge new spending commitments in their con job on climate change. Those spending commitments are in fact much larger than the opposition understand because, if they are to meet the target they have identified, according to Department of Climate Change calculations they would have to spend almost three times the amount of money that they are projecting. They would have to spend approximately $27 billion over that 10-year period, not the $10 billion that they concede. So there is a giant $27 billion hole in their budget calculations on top of the $9½ billion dollars that they are already blocking in the budget savings that the government has put forward. It is no wonder that the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, suggested that the Leader of the Opposition's approach to climate change might cost as much as $50 billion, and it is no wonder it was repudiated by the former Leader of the Opposition.It is interesting that these days the primary advocate for the opposition on economic policy issues appears not to be the shadow Treasurer; it seems to be shadow finance minister, Senator Barnaby Joyce. He has had a lot of interesting things to say. I know from long personal experience that it is not easy to get a front-page headline, to be the lead story on the front page of a major newspaper, when you are shadow finance minister. Senator Joyce has managed that several times. - Mr Speaker, I was referring to a headline on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald today, which refers to 'a day of gaffes goofs and gibberish.' - I will do that, Mr Speaker. I was asked about the importance of accuracy on statements and commitments regarding public finances. In the one speech yesterday, the new shadow finance minister managed to confuse 'millions' with 'billions' several times when describing the size of the budget. He managed to claim that the $6 billion that was left in the Higher Education Endowment Fund by the former government was all gone, when in fact the successor fund established by the government with those funds had in its accounts as at 31 December 2009, you guessed it, $6 billion. He claimed that debt would peak at $315 billion, when in fact the projected net debt peak is $153 billion. He claimed that current government debt was $120 billion, when the most recent announced level, of November, was $11 billion net debt. He claimed that Australian Public Service growth was out of control under Labor, when in fact in the two years of this government being in office it has increased by 2.1 per cent - most of that Defence personnel - and in the last two years of the Howard government it increased by 9.3 per cent.The shadow minister for finance is busily churning out all of these one-liners - and distancing himself from the Leader of the Opposition meeting Lord Monckton, which I noticed with interest - but his comments are contradicting everything that the Liberal Party does and says. This is on top of his statements prior to parliament resuming. He was open to examining the government's proposals on the private health insurance means test. That was repudiated by the Leader of the Opposition. He was opposed to the Chinese investing in the CSR spin-off company, and the Leader of the Opposition distanced himself from that. He said that the Productivity Commission had watered down its report on executive pay, and the Leader of the Opposition distanced himself from that statement. He said that company tax should be reduced, and the shadow Treasurer - what is left of him - said that that was not opposition policy. He said that Peter Spencer, the farmer who was on a hunger strike, should be compensated and then later repudiated that himself and said that, no, that should not happen.But, of course, the most incredible statement - and the one that really did impact on public confidence - was his suggestion that the US and Australian state governments might default on their debts, that there was a possibility of 'economic Armageddon' and that 'our capacity to feed ourselves and the capacity to provide the fundamentals in medicines and basic fundamental requirements for our nation' were somehow in doubt. And he strapped on a sandwich board and was running up and down and saying, 'The end of the world is nigh'. This is not a shadow finance minister; it is a freak show! It is the bearded lady of Australian politics. And he has taken charge of opposition economic policy! - I withdraw. The sad thing for this country is that now virtually everything we hear from the opposition with respect to public finances, economic policy, debt, budget and how the promises are going to be paid for by the opposition is coming from Senator Barnaby Joyce. If he ever gets control of the public finances of this nation, God help Australia!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, as it goes to the impact of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme on families - a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme which he said only two months ago that he fully supported. The question of cost and compensation goes to the particular circumstances of a family. Let me go through this in some sequence. The Treasury advises that the average cost is expected to be 1.1 per cent in the first two years of the scheme. That is $12 a week or $624 per year for the average family. Secondly, the matter of compensation is provided for under our scheme for some 8.1 million of Australia's 8.8 million families. Treasury advises that the average compensation for these families is $12.70 per week or $660 per year. There are 2.9 million households that will receive full assistance. Of the 3.7 million middle-income households, 50 per cent will receive full assistance. All middle-income families will receive some compensation. Over 92 per cent of households will receive assistance and, on average, these will receive assistance of around $660, as I mentioned before.Now to the honourable member's question concerning the family circumstances to which he has just referred. As he knows, and as the shadow Treasurer and others would know, the particular income profiles and compensation profiles of individual circumstances will depend on a dozen or so different variables. For families these will include, for example, the relative income split between one partner and another and, secondly, the number of children in a family. The third variable in all this is, of course, the government payments and allowances that the family may be receiving - for example, family tax benefit A or B, the age pension, the disability pension, carer payments, the veterans services pension, the war widows pension, unemployment benefits, student and youth allowances and eligibility for the low-income tax offset. These are all the variables which affect an individual family's circumstances.I will also say that if the honourable Leader of the Opposition would refer to the government's white paper he would see that it makes reference to a transitional fund available for any family that is not compensated according to the government's stated commitments. That is made plain there.Finally, can I say in relation to this that full details on the CPRS household assistance package are on the relevant climate change website. Tables there show the impact on, and assistance for, the 27 different household types most common in Australia. Each type has more than 25 different income levels. Altogether, therefore, the tables refer to 600 different household scenarios. These are publicly available on the government's website.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. The government are committed to building a stronger Australian economy and one that protects jobs and delivers for working families. That is why, in the face of the greatest global economic challenge since the Great Depression, we implemented a national infrastructure stimulus strategy, which is right now supporting more than 34,000 projects around the country. The result is that Australia (1) has been kept free of recession and (2) is the only one of the advanced economies that generated positive economic growth in the period 2008-09.I draw the House's attention to what the Reserve Bank had to say in their Statement on monetary policy 
last Friday. It contains new numbers on strengthening employment and on the issue of a strengthened economy. Firstly, on the growth point, it informs us that growth numbers have been revised up by the bank to two per cent for 2009-10 and 3.5 per cent for 2010-11. This is good news for the Australian economy.The government's overriding objective is how we protect jobs in the face of this global economic recession. On employment, the RBA states that it now looks likely that the unemployment rate has peaked at around 5.75 per cent. If that number is realised, it is very good news indeed for Australian working families. The core objective of the government's economic plan is to protect Australian jobs, and that is why we have 34,000 projects out there, underway through the national economic infrastructure stimulus plan.Let us look more broadly at the impact of what we have done in Australia on jobs here, relative to other countries, to put it into context. Since the global recession began, the United States has lost 6.8 million jobs; the UK, 496,000; Germany, 136,000; Canada, 270,000; Japan, almost one million; France, 447,000; and Italy has lost 406,000 jobs. By contrast, Australia has gained 112,000 jobs over the last 12 months. The other thing I would say is this: contrast the performance on jobs with what has happened in previous international recessions. Here I think it is important as well to look historically at how governments have responded to this challenge. In the international recession of the early eighties, the unemployment rate in Australia peaked at 10.4 per cent. That was with global growth still positive at nearly one per cent. Then, in the international recession of the early nineties, we had the unemployment rate peaking at 10.9 per cent despite global growth still being positive at 1.5 per cent. In this current global recession, where we have the economy actually contracting, Australia has generated an unemployment rate of 5.8 per cent. What this demonstrates is that the policies of this government affecting jobs have been better than what we have seen in most other economies around the world and better than what we have done in response to previous recessions as well.The other thing I would say in conclusion about the Reserve Bank's statement last Friday is this: it pointed particularly to the impact of infrastructure stimulus as 'an important offset' to the weaknesses in several areas of the economy - a very important and significant finding. Furthermore, it said that the overall stimulus is currently being withdrawn, while noting that the pick-up in demand around the global economy is still patchy. And we note the IMF's warning from last week which says that there should be no premature withdrawal of stimulus because the global economy is still in fact in a difficult situation.To conclude, can I just say this: there is no clearer contrast between the government and the Liberal and National parties on the question of the economic management of the global recession and recovery. Those opposite - led by the Leader of the Opposition, who says he has no interest in economics and who made the extraordinary decision to appoint Senator Joyce as the alternative finance minister of Australia; leave that to one side - on the core of policy said this: they said we should never have had a national infrastructure stimulus strategy. Had we followed that advice, we would now be in recession and 200,000 Australian jobs would be lost. But the second point is this: on the question of judgment, the Leader of the Opposition, not learning from that mistake, now says, for the future, we should pull out another $20 billion worth of investment in national economic stimulus expenditure. That would also send us down the gurgler.On the question of economic management, the government's approach is clear-cut. We have responded to the global recession in a cogent way. What we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition is poor judgment last year in saying we should not have a stimulus strategy, and poor judgement again in saying that we should pull the rug out from under the recovery for the stimulus strategy which lies ahead.</DOC>

 - I do thank the latest shadow minister for small business for his question. He certainly did not wait for the duration of the siege of Leningrad to ask that question. So he is really not ahead of the game but not as far behind the game as the former shadow minister. -  - Treasury estimates of increases in electricity prices associated with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme are seven per cent in the first year and 12 per cent in the second year. The government will in fact assist Australian small businesses to adapt to a carbon constrained economy, and all revenue - every bit of revenue - from the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will be used to help households and businesses to adjust to invest in clean energy options. The Treasury modelling is based on a passing through of the carbon price, and that is why the government is providing compensation to households. - And I was going directly to the issue of support for small business under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Already, $200 million has been allocated through the $1.97 billion Climate Change Action Fund - get that: the $1.97 billion Climate Change Action Fund - to help businesses, including small businesses, to invest in energy efficient equipment such as hot-water systems, insulation, lighting and heating. And, as part of the Clean Business Australia initiative, the government is providing $56 million for small- and medium-sized manufacturers, such as dry-cleaning operators, to improve the energy efficiency of their production processes. And they would do that by investing in more energy efficient equipment. -  - That is how we will support small businesses in this country. If we are addressing the issue of risks to small business, there is no greater risk to small business in this country than the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow finance minister. The reason I say that is that the shadow finance minister, on Lateline 
just the other day when he was asked where he was going to get the revenue to fund his $10 billion climate change con job, referred to the Henry tax review - and what did he say? He said, 'That is the whole mechanism of where we get the money from.' Here is the shadow finance minister saying there will be at least a $10 billion increase in taxes or new taxes. He did not say, 'Here is the budget; we are looking at the budget.' He said, 'We are looking at the Henry tax review,' indicating in direct contradiction to the opposition leader that they would be getting the money out of the tax system, increasing taxes on small business in this country by up to $10 billion. - I am indeed, Mr Speaker. I am advised that, in relation to the issue of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and businesses that might be affected by higher energy bills, the shadow minister said that, if electricity prices increased because of penalties incurred under Mr Abbott's plan, consumers could sign on with another retailer. There you go. So he is admitting that electricity prices would go up under the plan by this risky opposition leader saying they can just go to another electricity provider. The fact of the matter is that the shadow finance minister, in revealing there would be increased taxes to fund their climate change con job, has let the cat out of the bag - and what a dirty, smelly creature it is; what a dirty, smelly cat it is. The opposition leader is taking working families and small businesses to the cleaners with his climate change con job.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. Today the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship made an important announcement about better targeting our skilled migration system to the skill needs of the Australian economy. In doing so the minister said:We often hear that previous micro-economic reforms have laid the foundation of our current prosperity. Rarely do we hear recognition of the role played by Australia's skilled migration program. It is the unsung achiever of prosperity _ Skilled migrants are also good for the Budget bottom line, adding tens of millions more to tax revenue each year than they consume in government services.He explained - and these are very interesting figures - that migrants make up a quarter of the Australian population but account for around half of our doctors, dentists, IT specialists and chefs and more than a third of our pharmacists, geologists, mechanical engineers and painters and decorators. From those statistics and those words I think we can see there is no more important economic issue for the nation's future than appropriately targeting our skilled migration program. That is why the government has today announced that we will scrap the Migration Occupations in Demand List and replace it with a new more targeted skills occupation list to be drawn up by Skills Australia in light of the nation's needs for skilled labour.This is a vital economic reform, but on this vital economic reform, like on all other economic reform questions, the opposition is deeply divided. I am asked about reactions to this announcement today. Of course, before this announcement we knew that the opposition was deeply divided on climate change and economic reform issues and that has been proved yet again today in the speech by the member for Wentworth and all of his silent supporters on the opposition benches who are now too afraid to come out and support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Before today we knew that the opposition was divided on the question of fiscal responsibility and dealing with debt and deficit. -  - Now we have the shadow Treasurer interjecting. The shadow Treasurer is playing Tinkerbell rather than trying to manage the finances of the opposition, having been usurped by the shadow minister for finance. Now he is having to cope with the uncosted climate change con job of the Leader of the Opposition. We knew before today, when it comes to economic divisions in the opposition, that the division is so deep that the former Treasurer Peter Costello is on the record as saying that the Leader of the Opposition is so economically incompetent he would not have even tolerated him as his deputy.Today, on an important economic issue of skilled migration, another division emerges. We have the Liberal senator Simon Birmingham criticising the government for not allowing enough skilled migration into the country, while the member for Bowman on the very same day comes out and criticises us for allowing too much skilled migration into the country. Not enough or too much? It is a central economic question on which the opposition are as deeply divided as they are on every other question. What this means is that members of the opposition are always available for a handy one-liner, but what they are never available for is the production of responsible, costed policies. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, and it is a lesson as old as time: you cannot run the Australian economy if you cannot run your political party, and each and every day you fail that test - each and every day.</DOC>

 - It is impossible to answer a question when a child is aged 'six to 12 years', but leaving that to one side I think it does demonstrate one thing, which is that the opposition has no intention of helping any family, no matter what the age of the children. Of course, what we are doing is recognising that families come in all shapes and sizes - except not children aged 'six to 12 years'! What we are doing - Opposition members - That's how you describe them! - The government, through its Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, is certainly proposing to use a wide range of mechanisms to provide support, and that is going to be cash assistance to low- and middle-income families. As the Prime Minister indicated before, we expect the average price impact to be 1.1 per cent, and the average impact for families -  - I beg your pardon? - The impact for families of our assistance will be in fact 2.5 per cent. So the average impact on the costs for families is 1.1 per cent; the average level of -  - The big difference is this government intends to provide assistance to families as they meet the costs of climate change. The Liberal Party is providing none.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question, because yesterday I announced a very significant milestone in Australia's recovery from the worst global recession in 75 years. The government was acting on the advice of the Council of Financial Regulators and we will withdraw the guarantee from 31 March this financial year. I made it clear yesterday that the government's Financial Claims Scheme will continue to provide -  - We see the embarrassment of those on the other side of the House, who opposed this in this House - a measure that was so fundamental. Day after day, month after month they opposed the guarantee, they rubbished it in this House, they came in here and asked question after question and they did not support it. This demonstrates why they have made such a fundamental misjudgment about the handling of the global recession. It goes to the very core of their lack of judgment. Everybody on this side of the House remembers very well, day after day, the opposition from those on that side of the House to a measure which did so much to support our financial system and our broader economy at a time of threat from the global financial crisis and what became the global recession.This is a very serious issue, but those opposite are so embarrassed they have to get up and interrupt a relatively straightforward answer to this question. They are completely embarrassed by their bloody-minded opposition to the bank guarantee and to the term-funding guarantee, which just demonstrates their lack of economic judgment. Without the guarantee, our banks would have lent less and interest rates for borrowers would have been far higher. That is the consequence of the guarantee. We were able to stabilise our banking system and ensure the flow of credit right through our economy. We can say today that Australia has been the only major advanced economy in the world that has avoided a recession and it has been one of the few to grow during that period.Once again the lack of judgment from those opposite is obvious, because they not only opposed the bank guarantee in this House; they also opposed the stimulus back in February in this House, and of course they have continued to oppose the stimulus and have been out there suggesting that the stimulus should be withdrawn, which of course would pull the rug right out from underneath the recovery. Governor Stevens has summed this up all very well. This is what he had to say about the introduction of the bank guarantee:_ helped to stabilise what could have been a catastrophic loss of confidence in the global financial system _ 
public confidence in the security of the banking system maintained _ and stabilised a potentially quite dangerous situation.You would have thought that something of that magnitude might have secured the continuous support in this House of the Liberal and National parties, but it did not. They opposed it tooth and nail in this House. What we are now seeing is a continuation of that irresponsible behaviour and that lack of judgment, which demonstrates what a risk all of those opposite are to our economic recovery.We have had the Leader of the Opposition make unfunded commitments to the tune of $10.7 billion over five years at the same time as opposing the stimulus. The fact of the matter is that the Leader of the Opposition does not understand economics and regards it as boring, and that is simply a proxy for the fact he has not got the faintest idea what is going on in the economy. We have got the shadow Treasurer, who appeared on television last night wearing a crown, waving a magic wand and wrapping himself in a tutu, like a giant Tinkerbell! And, of course, we have got Senator Joyce. This is the least qualified economic team from any political party in this House for well over 30 years. They are demonstrating yet again their complete lack of judgment.The Manager of Opposition Business knows that he can ask for a document that has been quoted from to be tabled. He just cannot jump up willy-nilly asking for things to be tabled.</DOC>

 - Can I simply say to the honourable member who has asked the question about migration policy that one of the problems that we have -  - The honourable member asked a question about migration policy; I seek to respond to it. The problem that we have inherited with the skills system, as structured, of the previous government is that it is not properly tailored to the needs of the modern Australian economy. From the statement which has been issued by the immigration minister today, reinforced by the comments of the Deputy Prime Minister before, it is quite plain we need to adjust that for the future, because we want to get the right skills mix for the future needs of the economy. That is what we are on about; that is what we intend to do.Secondly, I would say to the honourable member that the divisions on their side on migration policy were transparent for all to see in the doorstop interviews this morning. - I thank the honourable member again for his question and for his interjection. The government's commitment to our migration policy for the future is to deal with the future skill needs of our economy. The system of skills and the way in which it was structured through the immigration portfolio in the past does not meet the needs of the future; hence the decision concerning the 20,000, which has been publicised in the nation's newspapers today. It is the right way forward, it is in the national interest and it is tailored to our real economic needs, and the government stands by that. Our border protection policy, as honourable members opposite would know, continues to deal with the practical challenges which we confront and which all previous governments have confronted since the 1970s.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question. Decisions and statements by government do influence the actions of investors and consumers and it is therefore vital that economic ministers and the government do act and speak responsibly and accurately. It is also, of course, natural that this test should be applied to those who aspire to run the nation's finances. Unfortunately, the new shadow minister for finance, Senator Joyce, has demonstrated on a number of occasions since he got the appointment from the Leader of the Opposition a serious lack of understanding or, indeed, accuracy in his statements. This demonstrates a very big question mark over the judgment of the Leader of the Opposition in appointing him in the first place, a very big question mark about the opposition's capacity to manage the economy and the budget, and it does suggest that the election of an Abbott government would be a serious risk to the future prosperity of Australia.I would just like to refer to a couple of the statements that Senator Joyce has made. He warned in December of the prospect of 'economic Armageddon' citing the threat to essential medicines and foods. He suggested that the United States might default on its debts. He suggested that various Australian state governments might default on their debts. He called for Australia's major banks to be broken up. More recently, he has opposed Chinese investment in Australian companies, and today he said that Australia cannot afford an increase in the minimum wage, which of course has been frozen for some time as a result of the most recent decision of the Minimum Wage Panel of Fair Work Australia.Had some of these statements been made by a finance minister, the ramifications for Australia could have been very serious, particularly were they to be made at a time of great economic crisis and stress such as this nation went through in the latter part of 2008 and for much of 2009 - the global financial crisis. Some of these statements would have been front page news in newspapers all around the world, would have certainly undermined our relationship with the United States, would have called into question the state of the global economy and would have done enormous damage to Australia's standing with investors both in this country and internationally. I would suggest that, when the Australian finance minister stands up and says that state governments may default, anybody with any sense of understanding of economics on that side - and there are very few - would understand that this poses a real threat to the stability of the Australian economy.I know there is a tendency to dismiss Senator Joyce as something of an entertaining sideshow. He is now in a very different league. It appears that he has effectively taken over as the No. 1 spokesman on the economy from the opposition. We know from Niki Savva's book that the Leader of the Opposition said to the former Treasurer Peter Costello that he was bored with economics. He was quoted in a newspaper article that he found it boring and, for that reason, Peter Costello indicated that he would rule out the Leader of the Opposition as a prospective deputy were he to become leader. - From the poor woman's Wilson Tuckey that's a ripper! Senator Joyce has effectively taken over as the key economic spokesman for the Liberal Party. The Leader of the Opposition is not interested. The member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer, is out to lunch - we hardly ever hear from him at all on these issues. But, for all of these entertaining statements by Senator Joyce, Australians should be very concerned about the risk that he and the Leader of the Opposition pose to sound economic and budget management and to the future prosperity of this country.I note that today the Leader of the Opposition has been holding forth on the good old days - the good old days of public hospital funding under the Howard government, to be precise. As I am sure members on this side will agree, the good old days are not quite what they are cracked up to be. -  - If the Leader of the Opposition and Manager of Opposition Business had allowed me to finish my sentence, they would have completely seen the relevance of the comment. That was that there is one aspect of the good old days that I do have some slight longing for. That is the days when the Liberal Party had some vaguely remotely credible economic spokespeople to put its point of view. Whatever disagreements I might have had with people like Peter Costello, at least I would concede they knew something about what they were talking about. The unfortunate situation now is that we have the Liberal Party led by people who are completely uninterested in economics allowing people who know absolutely nothing about it to be their public representatives.

 - I welcome the beginning of the health and hospitals debate, because the member who was just on his feet was the man who as health minister for four years ripped $1 billion out of Australia's public hospitals. We have before us now the man who as health minister for four years froze GP training places. We have before us at the moment the man who as health minister did nothing about the undersupply of nurses to the Australian health and hospital system. - To all of those he says, 'Wrong, wrong, wrong.' The bottom line is we now have a health and hospitals debate, and I welcome each day of it from this day forward.The Leader of the Opposition was asked about this this morning. He put forward his strategy for the future on health and hospitals when he said, 'I think many of them out there are wishing for the good old days.' That is the pre-2007 days. That line was just referred to by the member for Melbourne. If the Leader of the Opposition has learned absolutely nothing about the state of our hospital system since exiting as health minister and the change in government, he has had his head buried in the sand. - As I said before, I welcome the debate. I welcome what we have done in the two years that we have been in office and those opposite, I am sure, will welcome the reform plan we will unroll to the Australian public this year. -  - Those opposite interject as though health and hospitals was their top priority for 12 years in office. Those 12 years in office saw them rip $1 billion out of the hospital system when the honourable member was the health minister. In the period that we have been in government, with the health minister at the helm, we have increased overall funding to the hospital system by 50 per cent. That is what we have done. We have also increased the training of GPs and nurses. We have invested significantly in cancer treatment and research. This is what we have done in two short years. As for the future plan which will be put to the states very soon, I say to those opposite that we will seek to achieve a compromise with the states on one thing. -  - Those opposite seemed to relish the idea of achieving any kind of compromise with the states. The compromise that we have sought with the states is in one area - that is, bringing down -  - the waiting times for elective surgery by pooling our funding to make a difference on the ground. Those opposite found that sort of compromise arrangement with the states for the last two years unacceptable. They find those sorts of compromises and cooperative arrangements for the future unacceptable. We have done it for elective surgery and we are doing it with emergency departments, with practical measures on the ground. But I say very clearly to this House: if the states and territories do not accept this year the reform proposals for the future, the government will take this matter to the Australian people as we have previously committed to doing.I also say to those opposite, on the question of consistency -  -  - On the question of the Commonwealth's role in relation to health and hospitals, and our approach, which is a reform document for the nation to examine, there have been, firstly and secondly, six months of consultations by the health minister and myself with more than 100 hospitals across Australia - some of which the former health minister himself, when he was the health minister, never visited - and, thirdly, there is a decision-making framework with the states which will come to its conclusion very soon. I am very confident that those opposite, when they see what reform plan we have for the nation, will have a very stark choice indeed.And let us remember, on the question of Commonwealth takeover, that there was a certain Leader of the Opposition, who was previously a health minister, who when asked about this question several years ago said that only one level of government should run the hospitals. He was advocating, then, a Commonwealth takeover of the hospitals. Then, when he becomes Leader of the Opposition, he backs away from it at a million miles an hour. It is a bit like last year backing the emissions trading scheme as Leader of the Opposition and this year saying that the emissions trading scheme is unacceptable. A few years ago he was backing a Commonwealth takeover of the hospital system; when he becomes Leader of the Opposition he pretends that that had never been uttered.The government welcomes health and hospital reform. We have done more in two years than you did in 12 and the reform plan will be for you to back or oppose when the states and territories have reached their own decision in the immediate future.</DOC>

 - I welcome this opportunity and thank the member for Moreton for this question because he, as a member with very high demands in his electorate from the health system, will be very interested to be able to compare and contrast the record of the government's investments in public hospitals with the record of the Leader of the Opposition as a former health minister who cannot pretend that he was not intimately involved in every decision and every legacy left by the Howard government in our health system. We have spent the last two years rebuilding, block by block, after not just four years of this Leader of the Opposition being the health minister but also 12 years of a Howard government which neglected the system.I can understand why the public responds very badly when they are reminded of Mr Abbott's time as the health minister because one of the things that people remember most about Mr Abbott is that he pulled a billion dollars out of our public hospitals and then spent the next four years blaming the states for everything that went wrong. Compare and contrast ripping a billion dollars out of our hospitals to putting hundreds of millions of dollars into elective surgery and into emergency departments - billions of dollars into our public hospitals. This compare and contrast is a very easy thing to do.Look at another thing that the Leader of the Opposition oversaw when he was the health minister: for all of the time that the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister the Howard government had a cap on the training places for GPs. This was despite the fact that 60 per cent of the country had a shortage of GPs. For four years as the health minister, Mr Abbott simply looked the other way and tried to pretend this was somebody else's problem. We have already started to undo the damage caused by those years of neglect. We have increased the number of GP training places by 35 per cent. I am sure the public will want even more than that. We are taking action for things that the Leader of the Opposition neglected year after year after year.Actually, it reminded me very much of a very familiar Monty Python 
script where it was fine to say that we have just cut off an arm as we rip a billion dollars out of our hospitals and we have cut off a leg as we have capped our GP training places, and the Leader of the Opposition just kept saying: 'It's only a flesh wound. Everything's going to be fine; it's just a flesh wound.' - It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition is asking about GP superclinics but the health spokesperson has not asked a question about GP superclinics. That is probably because one has opened in his electorate. Following a $2½ million dollar investment by our government in the member for Dickson's seat, the Strathpine GP superclinic opened two weeks ago and is providing services to the community that otherwise turns up at Redcliffe, Caboolture and Prince Charles hospitals, where the emergency department presentations have gone up exponentially - at one of those hospitals by more than 20 per cent. In the member for Dickson's electorate there is now a service that runs all day Saturday, all day Sunday and until seven o'clock every night during the week. The reason the shadow minister has been completely silent about it is that he did not even have the decency to turn up and congratulate them for providing these services to the community. The Leader of the Opposition is a risk. He has pulled money out of health. If he is elected, he will pull money out of health again, as his finance spokesperson has already made clear, and the public cannot afford that risk.</DOC>

 - On the question of superannuation, as the member for North Sydney would be aware, the changes which the government engineered were taken in order to ensure that we had a proper, balanced system for the future. Those opposite are ideologically opposed to it. We took a sober view in terms of the overall resources available to the budget and we engineered the changes that the honourable member has referred to. The key challenge for Australia for the future is to ensure that both our superannuation and our savings system are sustainable. Remember, one of the challenges of the ageing population is to ensure that that occurs. That goes to savings policies generally, pensions on the other hand and superannuation as well. That is why we have taken the actions that we have. Many of them have been unpopular. The government accepts that. But can I simply say, as a government which has a proud legacy in introducing superannuation to this country as a compulsory measure - opposed tooth and nail by those opposite, year after year, almost decade after decade - we are proud of our record on superannuation in the past and we intend to continue to support proper superannuation for Australians and retirees into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The Rudd government is indeed investing in infrastructure, because we want to build a stronger economy for working families into the future. Today I announce that two more projects as part of our economic stimulus plan have been completed - two projects in the east-west corridor between Adelaide and Kalgoorlie. The $23 million projects, in which two new loop lines have been put in, will lead to practical productivity benefits in two ways. Firstly, they will allow trains of up to a kilometre and a half in length to operate along the track and, secondly, they will allow those longer trains to travel much more quickly - a big productivity benefit and dividend as a direct result of the economic stimulus plan.But this is all at risk because today Senator Joyce has reaffirmed his view that cutbacks to infrastructure investment are on the opposition's agenda. He has confirmed what the current Leader of the Opposition has said; he has confirmed what the former Leader of the Opposition has said: that cutbacks to infrastructure are on the agenda. But, of course, the coalition have got form, because when they last came to office, in 1996, they slashed $2 billion from the road budget over their first eight years. No wonder the Business Council of Australia have estimated that we inherited a $90 billion infrastructure deficit. Now the opposition wants to make more cuts -  -  - A $90 billion infrastructure deficit! - It is from Business Council of Australia. We know those opposite want to argue with the business community, but that is what the BCA said. But, now that the coalition have walked away from market based economics, it is not surprising that they want to battle the Business Council of Australia.Now we know that the opposition want to make more cuts or raise taxes to pay for their climate con job, because that is the only way that they can pay for it. We know on health that the Leader of the Opposition has said he wants to go backwards to the good old days when he cut $1 billion from hospitals. We know that they cut $2 billion from roads when they came into office. They need to say which projects they would cut that were part of the bring-forward of the economic stimulus plan. The Brighton Bypass in Tasmania - will they cut that? Will they cut the Northern Expressway in South Australia, the Western Ring Road in Melbourne or the Ipswich Motorway upgrade? We know that that is on their agenda because they have confirmed that that is the case. What about the Pacific Motorway Transit Project on the Gold Coast, in South-East Queensland? The Bulahdelah Bypass in the electorate of Paterson - will they cut that? What about the duplication of the Douglas Arterial Road in Townsville in Queensland, the Tarcutta Bypass on the Hume Highway, the Woomargama Bypass on the Hume Highway or indeed the Western Highway at Anthony's Cutting, which is due to commence construction next week? We have it there. They say they will make cuts. They need to come clean about where those cuts will be. We on this side of the House regard infrastructure as an investment for the future good of our economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Firstly, the statement to which he refers was given on 20 March last year, not 20 August as he suggests. Secondly, the statement is as follows -  - Well, it is, but you may be referring to a separate statement. The statement which the honourable member I think refers to is as follows:No working families in this country will be worse off as a consequence of the industrial relations laws that we have advanced here in this parliament _As the honourable member will know on any honest reflection, that refers to the transitional legislation which was before the House then. -  - Those opposite will know that that is exactly the legislation which was before the House at the time. The trickiness suggested by those opposite lies in the Leader of the Opposition conflating that piece of legislation with the Fair Work Bill, which came in later. That is what the Leader of the Opposition has done deliberately in this House. He puts himself up as a straight talker, but, when you dig beneath what he says, he had one position on emissions trading last year but has a new position this year, and he had one position on a Commonwealth takeover of hospitals a few years ago but has a different and reverse position now. What the Leader of the Opposition, the straight talker from central casting, now seeks to do is to conflate the debate in the House at the time on the transitional legislation which the industrial relations minister had before the House at the time and the Fair Work Bill, which was considered later.The legislation to which the honourable member refers was the transitional legislation which ensured that every worker on an AWA would have the option of remaining on their existing AWA arrangements. We also introduced a no disadvantage test for new arrangements. Together, these provisions ensured that no worker would be made worse off as a result of the transitional arrangements. That was the debate at the time, and the Leader of the Opposition would know that full well. Therefore, that is the position we put to the Australian public at the time.Secondly, the honourable member may also be interested in what we have said in relation to the Fair Work Act and the commitments we gave to the Australian people at the time. What we said when we introduced these changes to our industrial laws, Forward with Fairness, was as follows:Labor will get the balance right by introducing a fairer and more flexible industrial relations system with sensible transitional arrangements from Mr Howard's Work Choices laws.That is what we did. The honourable member may also be seeking to refer to the impact of awards. I am not sure whether that is within the scope of his question, but can I just say to the honourable member that our position in that respect is absolutely clear-cut and consistent with the past as well. - The honourable member goes to this question about who is being forthright in this place. What he has done today is deliberately take a debate which related to the transitional arrangements in the House at the time - he knows that - and roll it forward to a subsequent consideration by the House of the Fair Work Act. Hence the clever caveat of his question: 'It appears that a misleading of the House has occurred.' No such misleading of the House has occurred. In fact, the misleading is contained within the question just asked by the Leader of the Opposition, and he knows it full well.</DOC>

 - My position on this is no different to that of John Winston Howard, who said exactly the same. That is, if you impose a price on carbon what happens is it actually has an effect on prices in the economy. The question therefore is: how do you actually compensate? We in our scheme provide compensation directly through for consumers who have any pass-through price effect and, secondly, for businesses themselves we have a $1.97 billion Climate Change Adjustment Program fund, $200 million of which is available for small businesses. That is our policy. It is very clear, because we are putting a cap on carbon, we are charging the big polluters and we are also providing compensation for families. With your policy there is no cap on carbon, you are not charging the polluters and you are putting one huge slug on the taxpayers for a completely unfunded policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There can be no higher priority for a national government than the security of the country: protecting the country and protecting its citizens. National security has always been a priority of this government and those which have preceded it and those which will succeed it. For an island nation like Australia, aviation security is a particularly important part of our national security challenge. Australians love to travel and they rightly expect that the government will be doing all that they physically can to keep the travelling public safe.The United States experienced an attempted terrorist attack on Christmas Day on Northwest Airlines flight 253. It was a cold reminder to us all that no nation can afford to be complacent when it comes to security. Following the attack I directed the National Security Adviser to launch an immediate review of Australia's aviation security arrangements. This review examined the implications of that attack for Australia's aviation security arrangements in the field. This review has concluded and has finalised as a matter of urgency and provided advice to the National Security Committee of Cabinet. Based on those findings the government has today decided to implement several significant upgrades to Australia's aviation security arrangements, which will have implications in part for the Australian travelling public.Today the government has announced a four-year $200 million strategy to boost Australia's aviation security. It includes, firstly, increased passenger and baggage screening measures. These include body scanners, next generation multiview X-ray machines and bottle scanners capable of detecting liquid based explosives. The strategy includes, secondly, increased screening at regional airports, including explosives trace detection and metal detectors; thirdly, 50 per cent more firearms and explosives detection dogs at major international airports; fourthly, stronger international engagement and securing last ports of call to Australia; fifthly, a stronger air cargo supply chain through a number of screening measures and the introduction of a regulated shippers scheme; and, sixthly, enhanced systems to improve analysis of passenger information and to screen visa applicants for national security risks.Australia already has a world-class aviation security regime but today's announcement is about how we enhance that regime even further for the future. This may mean it takes longer for passengers to pass through security, but the government believes that this inconvenience is a small price to pay for increased security. Even with these changes there is always a risk that the methods and tactics of terrorists will change and evolve. That is why the government will continue to review on a rolling basis the upgrade of airport security arrangements. No government can guarantee that it will stop every terrorist attack but we will continue to do everything reasonably within our power to prevent attacks in the future.We will increase passenger and baggage screening measures, as I outlined before. There will be, as I noted before, an increase in the number of passengers who will be subject to explosives trace detection at our major international and domestic airports. The government will assist the industry to introduce as soon as practicable a range of new screening technologies at passenger screening points. These will include the latest body scanners, next generation multiview X-ray machines and bottle scanners capable of detecting liquid based explosives. Body scanners will be progressively operational as an additional screening measure at screening points servicing international departing passengers by early 2010. The government understands the privacy concerns some travellers may have with body-scanning technologies and will implement appropriate privacy and facilitation measures to mitigate these concerns.The government will also bring forward screening at a number of additional regional airports served by larger passenger turboprop aircraft. This will provide funding to regional airports to provide equipment for passenger and baggage screening, including explosive trace detection. We have also announced today measures concerning policing at airports, including the explosives detection dogs that I referred to earlier, and the strengthening of international cooperation, particularly in terms of those countries of origin or so-called last ports of call to Australia. The initiatives announced in relation to the air cargo supply chain are also important given its vital link to the overall security fabric of our airports. Finally, there is enhanced data analysis. If there is one thing which has emerged from the events in the United States on 25 December it is that we should make sure that when data is in the system it is properly collated, coordinated and passed to action points within the security system. For those reasons we have also taken further measures in this respect as well.Recent events have shown that terrorists and terrorist organisations are now trying new techniques and strategies in their efforts to target innocent people. Although no single measure can prevent a terrorist attack, new technologies, better training and greater cooperation with other governments can help us stay one step ahead of terrorist organisations. It is vital that we remain vigilant and take those steps that are necessary to protect Australian citizens at home and abroad.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for youth and sport for his first question in his portfolio and say that it is very important to all of us on this side of the House that we ensure that sport is accessible and remains accessible to the Australian community. We know how important it is as part of our preventative health agenda. We want to see more Australians getting out there and active within the community. This is why we were delighted within the last 12 months to be able to inject over $300 million into community sporting facilities, which is a record injection from a federal government at this level.With regard to his question about the impact of climate change, I would remind the shadow minister opposite of the $200 million which we have put in a fund to ensure that we will be able to help the Australian community deal with this. In contrast to this, there is nothing offered by those on the other side. They are quite prepared to sit back and watch as Australian sporting facilities suffer the consequences they are currently suffering as a result of water shortages and temperature rises forcing changes to competition. Australian sport is already being hit by climate change. We on this side of the House are making sure that that is addressed, and addressed responsibly. I would urge those opposite to get on board.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. He, of course, has an ongoing interest in these issues. In December last year I launched Australia's first ever national aviation policy white paper, Flight path to the future. It had in it some 130 recommendations and we are rolling out many of those today with regard to safety and security. As the incident involving Northwest Airlines flight 253 shows, we need to continue to be vigilant when it comes to ensuring that governments will field their responsibility to do everything in their power to secure the safety of the travelling public. Today's announcement certainly does that, with $200 million committed to improvements in aviation security.This is a comprehensive approach. It deals with the increase in passenger and baggage screening, including, of course, the introduction of new technology such as body screeners. We are committed to proper consultations with industry and with the privacy commissioner. They will be involved in the rollout of these which we consider, in the first instance, will be rolled out for secondary screening at the major international airports. We will also be doubling the use of ETDs at airports. We will also be securing our air cargo with $54 million to make sure that our air cargo security is uplifted.With regard to international cooperation, there are a number of measures. We will double the amount of work that we do at last ports of call, identifying on the basis of risk what those last ports are and ensuring that Australia has a presence and an auditing role in ensuring that we do what we can offshore to ensure that Australian travellers who use those airports can use them safely. We will also be increasing our presence internationally at a number of locations. We will be conducting a trial with the United Kingdom, an issue I raised with the Secretary of State for Transport, Lord Adonis, in December last year in London. We also raised issues with Janet Lute from the United States administration in a meeting I had with her earlier this year, and we will be having a trial of the use of new technology with regard to liquids, aerosols and gels.We will be bringing forward the announcement that we made in the white paper for regional screening at airports to 2012, and the government will be providing some $32 million in funds for capital equipment related to that and to an expansion of the use of explosive detection devices in those airports. Previously, we had quite an irrational position. Whether screening was required was based upon the propulsion of an aircraft, not based upon the weight of an aircraft. That is not a sensible position in moving forward, so from July 10 the specific weight will be 30,000 kilograms. From 2012 that will be brought down to 20,000 kilograms. The issue of safety and security at our regional airports has been around for a long time. This government is acting.We are also increasing by 50 per cent the presence of dogs at our airports. We know that feds, as they are called, are particularly good at both detection and deterrence. The increased AFP presence, which will be looked after by the Minister for Home Affairs, will be a substantial move forward in conjunction with the Australian Federal Police.The government will also be reintroducing, when the Senate resits, the regulations that were disallowed last year and, because of the disallowance, there is self-regulation as to who goes into a cockpit of an aircraft. The government believes that it is appropriate that the only people who should be in an aircraft's cockpit are there for operational reasons. We will be seeking to reintroduce these regulations into the Senate. I call upon the Leader of the Opposition to support these sensible regulations because we will need a majority of the Senate's support just to have them introduced. In 2010, when it comes to aviation security, it simply is the case - regardless of the noise from the National Party over there - that we have moved beyond self-regulation. We need to move forward and not look backwards. These sensible regulations should be supported in the Senate when they are reintroduced.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the rehabilitation of the member for O'Connor because he is back in harness. It is good to have him back fully engaged in the deliberations of the parliament. His question asked about the priority of jobs relative to other government measures. That was how he concluded his question, so let me go to that. I simply say this: today we had the Leader of the Opposition out there saying that keeping Australia out of recession was a big waste of money or words to that effect. I will let him justify exactly what he meant by that. When it comes to protecting Australian jobs, can I say to the member for O'Connor that the first priority we had, and not supported by him and other members opposite, was to back the national economic stimulus strategy. By keeping Australia out of recession the government's priority has been to protect Australian jobs - hundreds of thousands of them. Had we taken his advice and the Leader of the Opposition's advice and not brought forward the national economic stimulus strategy, we know from our own Treasury modelling that Australia would now be in recession. Furthermore, we also know that we would have put at risk 200,000 Australian jobs. The member for O'Connor asked a question about the priority which the government attaches to jobs. That is it. On the question of the impact of consumer price on the CPRS, I draw his attention to my earlier statements.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. It is critical that new spending proposals be offset by savings in order to ensure we get the budget back into surplus as quickly as possible. That is why the government, in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers that were published at the end of last year, had savings that covered all of the new spending initiatives that had been announced close to the budget last year. That is why we will be doing the same thing in this forthcoming budget for any new spending that occurs prior to the budget, and that is why we will be having savings in that budget that also cover the prospective new commitments.We have heard a great deal of ranting and raving from the opposition about the evils of deficits in recent times but sadly we have not had the same degree of fiscal discipline coming from them. In fact we have had not one single savings measure put forward by the opposition in spite of the ever-growing list of big unfunded spending promises - including in more recent times, of course, a new climate change policy costing $3.3 billion over the next four years; $3 billion or so on the Murray-Darling Basin; and, just today being trailed in the media, the prospect of a bigger, bolder parental leave scheme, being funded by the opposition from who knows where.Since the election in 2007 we have had endless announcements of new spending but not a single savings proposal from the opposition. I am now on to my fourth shadow finance minister, and the first three are all back in the pavilion with ducks beside their names on the scoreboard. Now Barnaby is at the crease and we are waiting to see what he produces. I note that he is now attracting derision even from his own side. The member for Mayo said today when he slipped up on some numbers in a doorstop interview, 'Oh, no; I've done a Barnaby.' So soon we are going to have a new noun in the Macquarie dictionary as a result of this.Perhaps somewhat more seriously there was something else said about fiscal responsibility in an interview today - and it was indeed something said by Senator Joyce, the shadow finance minister. He spoke about the alleged evils of government debt and he said:We are getting to a point where we cannot repay it.That means that he is asserting on behalf of the opposition that Australia is on the verge of defaulting on its debts. He is not content with alleging that the United States might default or indeed that the Australian state governments might default, which he did a couple of months ago; he is now suggesting that Australia might default on its debts. Statements of this kind indicate why an Abbott-led opposition, the Liberal opposition as it is currently constituted, is a giant risk to the Australian economy and to the future prosperity of Australia working people and the reputation of Australia.At the time of the change of leadership in the Liberal Party at the end of last year, a lot was said about the Liberal Party reconnecting with its support base. The Leader of the Opposition may have reconnected them with the conspiracy theorists, the haters and the science deniers out there but there is another Liberal support base out there, another much larger Liberal support base - that is, a very large number of good, honest, prudent, hardworking people in the towns and cities of this country who, rightly or wrongly, for many years have voted Liberal because they believe that the Liberal Party are sound economic managers. Those people were supported by the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth - who yesterday spoke eloquently about the kind of concerns that he has. It is those Liberal supporters who are being completely betrayed by the Leader of the Opposition, who has said that he is bored by economics and has handed over economic policy and economic management to the outer fringes of the National Party. It is those loyal Liberal voters who will understand why it is a giant risk to Australia to put the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party in charge of the nation's finances.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the Leader of the Opposition. I have a very good working relationship with the Liberal Premier of Western Australia but this is the first time in this House that I have been asked to be accountable for his actions. I would just -  -  - The last time I looked there was not at present a carbon pollution reduction scheme in operation, therefore the Leader of the Opposition's question goes to electricity prices already announced by the Liberal government of Western Australia - and apparently I am responsible for that! As a matter of basic logic I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he might reflect further on his question. - I am sure Colin will be pleased to know that the decisions he is taking about the electricity industry are judged by the Leader of the Opposition here as bad decisions. I am sure Eric Ripper will have fun with that one in the Western Australian parliament when it convenes on these matters. The Leader of the Opposition talked about the impact on gas and electricity prices. They have been the subject of detailed responses by me and other ministers here at the dispatch box based on the Treasury modelling. On the question of the impact on prices, there is one key element missing in this whole debate - that is, the hidden pricing regime of those opposite. When Senator Joyce, who has been the subject of some discussion in recent days, was asked about the impact of what would happen to the opposition penalties regime for non-compliant businesses he indicated that those penalties would apply to business. And if penalties are applied to business as a cost to business then guess what happens? The prices get passed on to consumers. That is the hidden penalty price regime contained in their policy -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The question went to the impact on electricity prices and went to recent decisions by the WA government prior to any passage by this parliament of any emissions trading scheme. I will just repeat that to go back to the basic logical flaw in the question. Secondly, our position in terms of the impact on electricity prices is clear, it is documented, it is on the public record and we have said it day after day. What has not been clear on the part of those opposite is the hidden penalties regime buried within their own scheme. They say that, if you breach so-called business as usual, then businesses unspecified in number will be penalised. When asked what the financial penalty is, they run and they hide and they do not say what it is. But there are three questions which arise here: how many businesses, how big is the penalty and where does the compensation lie?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question. The most efficient and the most cost-effective way to combat climate change is to implement an emissions trading scheme. It is demonstrably the sound economic approach to reducing emissions, and that is the government's policy. In contrast, the coalition's policy will not work. The Department of Climate Change, of course, has modelled that under their policy emissions will rise by 13 per cent over 2000 levels by 2020. In addition to that, we know that their policy will cost more. The scheme will have a greater fiscal impact than they have stated. In addition, we know that taxpayers will pay, not the emitters of carbon pollution, and all the costs are going to be on the budget. It is going to put pressure on to force up taxes.On that front, we know that their policy is not funded. But now we are learning even more from other analyses of their policy. This is what Mr David Pearce, the director of the Centre for International Economics who last year conducted a review of greenhouse policy for the coalition, had to say. It was reported in the Financial Review yesterday:_ the apparent simplicity of the coalition plan would soon disappear if it were ever implemented _ The cost of the scheme could also rise significantly once details such as penalties and assignment of risk were taken into account _So an expert that the coalition have relied upon in the climate change policy area is saying that their plan is too complex, it is incomplete and the costs will go up. Yesterday, in addition, as the Prime Minister just adverted to, Senator Joyce again was out there saying that business will be subject to unspecified penalties, but he has no idea what the penalties will be, how they will be applied or who is going to be liable for them, and no-one in the business community has any idea whatsoever what costs they are going to have to meet. Talk about business uncertainty! It is a policy for chaos.Just before question time, a fresh analysis of coalition policy was issued by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. They have done an analysis of the opposition policy. They have estimated that the opposition climate plan 'would result in an average carbon price of $64 per tonne over four years', compared to a carbon price under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme of only $14 a tonne. Part of their reasoning for that analysis, which is quite a stunning assessment of the cost of their policy, is that the CPRS will be more cost effective because it is a market based mechanism. Is it any wonder the business community is running away from you? You are creating uncertainty and cost, and it will affect investment and jobs. - Mr Page from the Energy Supply Association of Australia said this last Friday of the Leader of the Opposition's policy:We are still not quite sure how an investor in new generation would make a decision about what technology and what fuel source to use.But I can tell you one thing - they will not be thinking about algae fired power stations like you are.The business community is being left with anticipated cost increases and tremendous burdens, and it will have the effect of deferring investment. As the Prime Minister said, these costs will be passed through in higher prices, and yet from the hypocrites that the opposition are there is no compensation and no assistance for pensioners and households to meet those increased costs.Could there be a greater hypocrisy than the member for Menzies rising yesterday out of feigned concern for a maritime worker facing rising costs of living? The entirety of their attack is totally phoney. Their position is phoney. They will be putting up costs and there is no assistance for households and consumers to meet it. The only person on that side of the House in recent times to stand up, say what is right and say what is in the national interest, to his credit, was the member for Wentworth in his address yesterday to the parliament on the CPRS legislation. This is what he had to say:In short, having the government pay for emissions abatement, as opposed to the polluting industries themselves, is a slippery slope which can only result in higher taxes _And that is an accurate observation of your policy. The member for Wentworth went on to say this in referring to the CPRS legislation:This legislation is the only policy on offer which can credibly enable us to meet our commitment to a five per cent cut to emissions by 2020 _I would like to acknowledge the contribution by the member for Wentworth and sincerely so because he stood up under a lot of pressure. It cost him his job as Leader of the Opposition. He was taken out because of his stance, his respect for the science and his acceptance that the best way to reduce emissions in an economy is an emissions trading scheme. The new Leader of the Opposition would do well to take a leaf out of his booklet.</DOC>

 - I stand by my previous answer of a $200 million compensation fund to compensate Australians for the impact of our scheme in contrast to that which is being put forward by those opposite where there is zero to compensate them for these costs. I add that Australian sports are already feeling the consequences of climate change and are already concerned about the impact it is having on their infrastructure, on water shortages and on their ability to maintain their grounds. That is something that we on this side are particularly concerned about. It is why we have a serious plan to tackle climate change; we believe it is real, we believe that it needs to be addressed and we believe it should be done in a fair way to compensate Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question because I know how strong a supporter he is of the future development of the resources sector in his part of Queensland. The government strategy is to build a stronger economy, to protect Australian jobs and to support Australian families by protecting Australian jobs. That is why we acted in the way in which we did in response to the global economic recession and, as a result of that, why Australia remained out of recession.Today Woodside made a significant announcement in relation to the Browse gas project. Woodside announced that the Browse joint venture had selected a site at James Price Point, 60 kilometres north of Broome, as its preferred location to process gas from the venturers' gas fields. There will be more than $1.25 billion invested over the next two years. That this resource is likely to be processed in Australia is welcome news for both the WA economy and the Australian economy. The Browse field contains a contingent resource of about 14 trillion cubic feet of dry gas. The Browse LNG development is expected to contribute about $50 billion to Australia's economy over the life of the project. It is estimated that around $9 billion in additional revenue will flow to the Commonwealth government over the life of the project. The Browse development is expected to generate around 2½ thousand to 3½ thousand jobs on-site during peak construction.I also welcome pronouncements yesterday by Incitec Pivot and British Gas concerning their very substantial projects in Central Queensland. Incitec Pivot has announced that it will restart its billion-dollar Moranbah ammonium nitrate complex. The Moranbah ammonium nitrate complex was mothballed as a result of the global financial crisis in February last year. Restarting it one year on is a huge vote of confidence in the recovery of the Australian economy. When the project restarts in May this year, 500 to 600 jobs will be recreated in civil works.Even more evidence of a bright future for Central Queensland is BHP's 18 January announcement that it has approved a US$267 million investment to accelerate the development of the Caval Ridge and Hay Point Coal Terminal stage 3 expansion projects. These are good projects for Australia. They are good projects for Western Australia, they are good projects for Queensland as well and they reinforce the government strategy of building a stronger economy for the future.Australia is regarded as a desirable investment location around the world. This is reflected in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook, which shows that Australia was ranked eighth highest out of 55 countries in 2007, sixth highest in 2008 and fourth highest out of 57 countries in 2009. According to the yearbook on whether ease of doing business is supported by regulations, Australia's rating increased from 5.65 out of 10 in 2007 to 6.03 in 2009. This is real progress in making Australia an even more desirable investment location.The government and the Deputy Prime Minister entirely seized on the implications which these projects have for the future skills demands of the Australian economy. That is why we have put a range of measures in place to deal with that skills shortage. We want to make sure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past whereby the expansion of resource projects was not accompanied by a parallel investment in infrastructure and skills.The member for Flynn also asked me a question about risks to the Australian economy. I would draw the attention of honourable members in this House to one big risk to the Australian economy, and that is the appointment by the Leader of the Opposition of Senator Joyce as alternative finance minister and, secondly, Senator Joyce as alternative finance minister of Australia saying today, 'We are getting to a point where we can't repay it,' meaning our debt. You have the alternative finance minister of Australia standing up and saying that Australia is at risk of defaulting on its sovereign debt. This is the height of irresponsibility. It is the height of risk to Australia's global economic reputation. He has done this already in relation to the United States, he has done this in relation to the individual states of Australia and today he has done so with a public statement - which will be read in marketplaces across the world - about the sovereign debt of the Commonwealth of Australia.Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, as he finds this statement really amusing, that investors around the world do not find these remarks amusing at all. They take them seriously. We know that the Leader of the Opposition thinks he is on a roll to win the next election. We know he has had a bit of a hoopla in the party room about winning the next election. Well, one of the big risks which the Australian public are evaluating in their minds is what sort of economic risk they buy with a Leader of the Opposition who says he has no interest in economics and an alternative finance minister who today said Australia may default on its sovereign debt. The Leader of the Opposition has got two choices: (1) go out and repudiate the remarks by Senator Joyce, the alternative finance minister and (2) if he has any courage whatsoever, dismiss him today. Even when he does that - and it is coming, as sure as night follows day - his decision in the first place to appoint Barnaby Joyce as the alternative finance minister will still cause the nation to scratch their heads about what possible process of judgment could have been applied to that appointment on day one.</DOC>

 - Both the government and I have full confidence in NBN Co. and full confidence in the minister. The first point I would make in response to the honourable member's question is that the decision to appoint Mr Kaiser to this position was taken independently by NBN Co. Secondly, I am advised that NBN Co., through Mr Quigley, has told estimates that a selection process was undertaken and that Mr Kaiser was interviewed three times before being appointed, twice by NBN Co.'s head of human resources and once by Mr Quigley himself. Furthermore, the CEO of NBN Co., Mr Quigley, has said that, following industry practice, senior roles at NBN Co. have been sourced through a combination of searches by recruitment firms and referrals. Mr Quigley told Senate estimates that 40 per cent of NBN Co.'s staff had been hired on a referral basis. That is the approach which applies to this particular appointment.On the question of appointing people of ability, whatever their past political experience, before those opposite whip themselves up into a frenzy over this one, can I remind them that this government has appointed Peter Costello, on the basis of merit, to a position on the Future Fund; we have appointed Brendan Nelson as our ambassador in Brussels, on the basis of ability; we have appointed Tim Fischer as Ambassador to the Holy See, on the basis of ability; and I think we have even appointed Arthur Sinodinos to something as well. We believe in merit based appointments and we have full confidence in the minister and in NBN Co.'s handling of this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. This morning I opened a housing supply and affordability workshop, with the Minister for Housing, which involved officials from state governments and from the Commonwealth government, representatives of the private sector, the National Housing Supply Council, developers and construction companies. This is one of the most important challenges we face as a nation. As our economy recovers and as our population grows, the demand for housing continues to grow. It has been the case for a long period of time that we have not been constructing enough houses. The housing supply issue, and particularly a shortage of houses, is something that has emerged in our economy over a long period of time.Of course, we put in place a range of measures immediately on coming to government to deal with this question. Our National Rental Affordability Scheme, for example, is being rolled out and is doing a very good job. And there is our investment in social housing - a massive investment in social housing - which is not only stimulating our economy, supporting and creating jobs, but playing a very important part in putting in place a pipeline of activity for our construction sector.But of course the underlying challenge remains to increase supply substantially given the shortage that has emerged over a long period of time. I for one can remember sitting in this House and listening to the former Treasurer talking about doing something about housing supply but then doing nothing - talking about it, blaming it all on the states and not coming to the table to work with state governments and the private sector to do something about a sustainable increase in the supply of housing. Unless the constraints to the supply side of the market are addressed, our cities simply will not adapt to meet the needs of a growing population.In some cases we are the victim of our own success, because we are one of those economies that is growing. We are growing when other economies are going backwards. There are many economies around the world that would love to have this problem. Because this economy is growing and growing more strongly, it makes it all the more urgent that we deal with this problem that has been left to this government particularly by those opposite. That is why we have put in place those measures I was talking about before - the National Rental Affordability Scheme and the investment in social housing. But much more needs to be done, something that was squibbed by those opposite. We need planning and zoning reforms to reduce the time it takes to develop, build and deliver houses. We need to minimise the uncertainty and delay from developer charges. We need to find ways to use data from land audits to enable better use of land development. Of course, we need further work done through COAG, and this matter was put on the agenda of COAG in December. It is being progressed by planning ministers and state housing ministers and Commonwealth ministers in the weeks ahead.We will go on carefully and responsibly building a stronger economy while those opposite simply continue to play in this House, day after day, their political games. Today they have demonstrated yet again why they are such a grave risk to the Australian economy. The statements today by Barnaby Joyce, the alternative finance spokesman from the alternative government, that Australia's sovereign debt was at risk - or that somehow our triple A credit rating was at risk - are simply a slur on this economy and a slur on our international standing. I bet the Leader of the Opposition has not got the guts to remove him because he simply does not understand the nature of what he has done to our international reputation. Not only are those opposite a risk to the budget and to the recovery; they are a risk to our international standing.Last night I attended the 50th anniversary of the modern RBA. At that function in Sydney there were governors of reserve banks from right around the world. There were senior people from the finance community. What they were celebrating there last night was reform in the Australian economy over a 20-year period. What we were celebrating there last night was that, as we get to the end of this year, we will be entering the 20th year of continuous growth in this country. One of the reasons that it will be the 20th year of continuous growth is the fact that this government put in place its economic stimulus precisely at the right time to avoid the recession that those opposite wanted to give this country.In that environment, almost simultaneously with those governors from reserve banks all around the world sitting around the table, we have the finance spokesman from the alternative government putting a slur on our credit rating and suggesting that we could not meet our debt obligations, when it is the case, as every one of those governors around the table knows, that Australia has the lowest debt and the lowest deficit of any major advanced economy and just about any advanced economy. That is what Australia has. We are the envy of the world, but not to Barnaby Joyce, who simply wants to slur the great achievements that the Australian people have made in this economy over a 20-year period.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Firstly, on the responsibilities of ASIO in security assessments, that is independently undertaken by that agency. Secondly, the honourable member will be referring to discussions which have occurred in Senate estimates concerning the way in which ASIO screenings have been undertaken in relation to those individuals, including those who obtained adverse security assessments. We are advised by ASIO that, during the period July to December 2009, ASIO processed security assessments for all irregular maritime arrivals in an average of 35 days. We are also advised that the average time taken to process security assessments for those on the Oceanic Viking was consistent with the average of that period. That is what occurred in this case and that is the advice we have received from ASIO.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Shortland for her question. She has always taken a strong interest in the health reform debate, including hosting forums with health professionals in her own area. This government came to office aware of the challenges facing the health system. It is why we increased hospital funding by 50 per cent, it is why we initiated a root-and-branch reform of the health system and it is why we increased GP training places by 35 per cent. Unlike the previous government, we are upfront about the challenges faced by the system.Of course, when it comes to not being upfront, the Leader of the Opposition has form. This was the man who attacked cancer sufferer Bernie Banton and who harshly capped GP training places when more than 70 per cent of the country had a shortage of GPs. This is the man who strangled hospital funding. This was the man who was so incompetent and disloyal he was even fired by John Hewson. But he also told bald-face porkies to the public. So let us just turn the clock back to July 2004, a very different time to now in this parliament. There were leadership problems within the Liberal Party. The Liberals were in denial about climate change, the Liberals were running fear campaigns about interest rates. -  - When it comes to not being upfront with the public, the real rolled-gold winning performance was from the Leader of the Opposition when he was health minister, when he was asked on Four Corners about whether the Liberal Party would change the Medicare safety net. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am always keen to take your advice and it is the reason that I am comparing and contrasting the performance of the Rudd government in delivering reforms in health and the performance of the Leader of the Opposition when he was the health minister. He was asked on Four Corners whether or not the Liberal Party would change the Medicare safety net. He said that the Liberal Party had a 'cast-iron commitment, an absolutely rock solid ironclad commitment', not to make any changes.I got to thinking: he made a cast-iron promise, he made an ironclad guarantee. I wonder whether really Tony just has a problem with irons. There is no doubt about it, he just has a problem with irons. It was dishonest from the start. He knew that the expenses for the Medicare safety net were going through the roof. He knew it at the time of the election. He told an outright fib to the public and only seven months after they were elected he increased the threshold by a whopping 66 per cent. We know that this is a fateful warning bell for Australians who may or may not be considering voting for this man as Prime Minister of the country. He is just too big a risk to do that.</DOC>

 - In terms of the diplomatic conversations between ourselves and the Indonesians, they have gone to resettlement procedures generally. As they relate to this particular vessel I have no information which I could convey to the honourable member. I say more broadly, though, to the honourable member that our conversations with the Indonesians over a long period of time have gone to resettlement and how we can assist the Indonesians over a whole range of countries, the whole spread of resettlement countries, including Australia, as in fact did the previous government. I say therefore to the -  - As part of our rolling cooperation with Indonesia on the challenge of asylum seekers we have had a whole range of discussions over a long period of time about how that cooperation should be unfolded. It deals also with Indonesia's existing caseload of asylum seekers within Indonesia itself. It deals also with the totality of the caseload in that country. We stand ready to assist Indonesians in their challenges, in their dealings with other resettlement countries and also where we can assist with Australia. That has been the case in the past. That will be the case in the future. That was the case also, I seem to recall, on the part of the previous government, which assisted with some resettlement of those who were asylum seekers in Indonesia to Australia. That is precisely the approach that we would embrace in the future because for the Indonesian government, President Yudhoyono and myself the situation is as follows. This is a common challenge for both of us and therefore we would work very closely with Indonesia on source problems, on what we do with transit people who are in Indonesia itself and also what we do with people who need resettlement to other countries, including Australia. - Australia stands ready to assist our friends in Indonesia as Indonesia has stood ready to assist Australia. That is the way in which sensible governments deal with the challenges of asylum seekers. That is the way we will deal with it in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calwell for her question. She is another member vitally interested in health reform for the future to make sure that the next generation of Australians are going to be able to have and to continue to have the health services to the quality that they deserve. The Rudd government is investing more in our public hospitals than any other Australian government. In the last two years we have been working hard to rebuild after a decade of neglect, and particularly neglect of public hospitals, by the former government and of course its then health minister, now the Leader of the Opposition.Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition called these days the good old days for our hospitals. Let us just have a think about those good old days. In the last decade while the opposition were in government, to the period 2007-08, hospital admissions grew by a million people, and emergency department presentations grew by two million. What was the Leader of the Opposition's policy response in those good old days when we saw this enormous growth? It was to rip a billion dollars out of our public hospitals and blame the states for all of the problems it caused. In fact, according to the Leader of the Opposition, the good old days were so good that there were not any major problems to fix. I would like to read to the House a very short quote from a speech called 'The trouble with reform', a speech given in relation to the health system in 2005 by the Leader of the Opposition when he was the health minister. He said:No-one should fret over an 'unreformed' Australian health system.And this gem:If it ain't broke, don't fix it.So no wonder he did not even bother to turn up to the debate on health in 2007: he simply did not think there were any problems to fix. We on this side of the House take a very different view from that of the Leader of the Opposition. We do believe the health system needs reform. We do not believe that the Australian public should risk letting the man who ripped a billion dollars from our public hospitals be the Prime Minister of this country. He has a track record which we are prepared to line ours up against at any time. Have a look at just one example. A $600 million investment in elective surgery has already delivered relief to more than 60,000 patients across the country. Currently, 125 hospitals are building new operating theatres and renovating or buying new equipment. I would like to read out a couple of examples, and perhaps members opposite will want to comment on them. There is $11 million for a 63-bed interim care facility in Carrara. A $1 million investment in the Flinders Medical Centre for an extra operating theatre and equipment - perhaps the member for Boothby would like to tell us that that is a waste of money. It is something that their government never did. Busy emergency departments have received $750 million to help relieve the pressure on them; 37 emergency departments around the country are undertaking projects to boost capacity, restructure services and put on more staff.The member for Bowman is being unusually quiet. That might be because $18 million is going to the Redland Hospital, in his electorate. I do know that the member for Solomon is usually not a quiet member. He would not be on this because he has been delighted to welcome the $4.3 million going to the Royal Darwin Hospital. All of this is helping to deliver on our promise to fix hospitals. Not one of these projects would have been delivered by the Leader of the Opposition. Not a single dollar would have been put into these projects for the four years that the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister and for the 12 years that they were in government.Do not forget, though, that for all this time Mr Abbott thought that nothing was wrong. He did not really even bother to take a health policy to the 2007 election. There was a decade of massive demand growth in our health system and all it was met with was that famous swagger and a shrug of the shoulders of the man who thought there were no problems to fix. We are prepared to debate his legacy with our record on any day and at any time, but he will have to turn up.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the member for New England. I know his concern for his constituency and people who are doing it tough, particularly because of problems with the Murray-Darling system and the secure delivery of water to individual towns and areas within his electorate. I am not aware of the circumstances that concern that town. In response to the honourable member's question I suggest that the parliamentary secretary now engage the honourable member on what can be done about his specific proposal. This side of the House seeks to engage other members when they come forward with a practical idea of how to fix X, Y and Z and A, B and C. The honourable member has come forward with an idea. I will have the parliamentary secretary investigate it to see whether we can do something about it that is practical and sustainable.More broadly, the honourable member's question goes to the challenge of the Murray-Darling Basin. As a country we are dealing with the fact that the Murray-Darling has in the last decade enjoyed perhaps less than half of its normal average inflow in terms of rain and over the last three to four years something like a quarter of its normal inflow. This has had a cumulative effect on the entire system. We see it right across the Murray-Darling system.We had one set of events recently that concerned the release of water into South Australia by the government of New South Wales, which occurred through the new arrangements put in place by the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong. We now have in place the decision-making mechanism, through the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, to for the first time put a cap on the overall use of water in the system. We also have the capacity for the first time, from next year, in the history of the Murray-Darling for the federal water minister to have responsibility for setting that cap on a scientific basis. We also have for the first time the Australian government buying back water entitlements from what is a hugely taxed river system. From memory, we have purchased back some 780 gigalitres - am I right? 
An honourable member - 776. - 776 gigalitres from the entire system in terms of water entitlements. Over the period I have just been referring to and for some decades before that, as the Murray-Darling became progressively constrained because of the declining inflow of water, the issuing of entitlements by various state governments trebled in number. So on the one hand we had a massive trebling in the entitlements of farmers to take water out of the system; at the same time on the other hand the supply of water was affected by the decrease in rainfall. Of course, climate change is relevant to all of those considerations as well.The other thing, as the honourable member will be aware, is that we are seeking to improve the efficiency of the irrigation infrastructure being used in the Murray-Darling. That is why the government are investing, from memory, in excess of $3 billion with the irrigators across the system, in order to improve the efficiency of irrigators. The last advice I had was that the irrigation system in the Murray-Darling was in many places so antiquated that it was resulting in something like a 30 per cent water loss. - The member for Sturt interjects. I always enjoy interjections from the member for Sturt, as he is such a positive contributor to the deliberations of this place. I do like, however, what Senator Cory Bernardi had to say about him. He said that the member for Sturt said:I live in a Liberal seat, so I had to be a member of the Liberal Party _ - I am always taken by what Senator Bernardi says. He says that member for Sturt said:I live in a Liberal seat, so I had to be a member of the Liberal Party to get into Parliament. If I lived in a Labor seat _ - As the member for Sturt said:If I lived in a Labor seat I would have joined the Labor Party. -  - How sensitive the member for Sturt is!Order!In other words, the Speaker intervened. He said:The Minister will answer the question and not engage in irrelevancies, such as contrasting the Government and the Labor Party.In Hansard on 9 September 1981 a member of the House by the name of Charles -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, but we do welcome interjections from Comrade Christopher. - The member for New England's question goes to the locality and the town. I have outlined the course of action that we will undertake. In response to the question, I did go through the other reforms that we have brought into the system. They are in three categories. The first is, through the basin authority, the capping of water and the scientific basis for it. Secondly, I mentioned what we are doing in terms of investment in irrigation infrastructure. Thirdly, I spoke about what we are doing in the buying back of water entitlements. This is a fundamental challenge for the nation to restore health to the Murray-Darling system. It is being severely challenged by drought, which is in turn exacerbated by the long-term impacts of climate change. Therefore, we must act to deal with the consequences of climate change in a practical way now, while dealing with the long-term causes, which is why some in this House are united in their resolve to act on climate change in an effective national and global manner.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I know that she is interested in fairness and balance at work for the working people in her electorate. The Rudd government is proud of having delivered on its commitment to kill Work Choices and to introduce a fair and balanced workplace relations system, and we are proud of having delivered on our commitment to simplify and modernise the award system.The new workplace relations system and simple, modern awards have been broadly welcomed. They have been welcomed by small businesses because they are slashing red tape. They have been welcomed because it has been modelled to show that it will benefit the Australian economy by $4.8 billion. It is easier for employers and employees to be able to look for their award conditions in 122 simple, modern awards than in more than 4,000 old, archaic industrial instruments. In December last year, the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council welcomed the award modernisation result, and that council includes the ACTU, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Ai Group, the Australian Mines and Metals Association, the National Farmers Federation and many others who represent employers in this country.On the task of award modernisation, let us be very clear: when the Liberal Party was in government, it squibbed that task, and the Leader of the Opposition and his fellow Liberal Party members in government decided instead to introduce Australian workplace agreements which could strip away the award safety net without a cent of compensation. This is a government that has got on with the hard job and simplified awards. We can guarantee to Australian workers that they will always have a safety net at work on which to stand. And we can guarantee to Australian workers that, as we have made the move from the old award system to the new award system, every Australian worker has a guaranteed take-home pay. They are entitled to a take-home pay guarantee.In relation to award modernisation, we have seen a number of claims made, and I am asked about their accuracy and the responsibility of making sure that if you make a claim it is a truthful one. Yesterday we saw, in this parliament, the Leader of the Opposition stand up at 10 minutes past three - about 24 hours ago - and say this:The nurses union says that the government's scheme is worse than Work Choices, and it is.I thought, when he said that, 'Gee, that's a little bit odd,' because I knew Australia's nurses were desperate to get rid of Work Choices, because they feared a re-elected Liberal government would tie hospital funding to the introduction of AWAs, the way they had done in Australian universities. So I thought it was a little bit odd when the Leader of the Opposition said it. But then, of course, the nurses union today has put out the following statement:Assistant Federal Secretary of the Australian Nursing Federation _ Lee Thomas said comments by the Federal Opposition Leader made about the union in Federal Parliament yesterday _ were completely false and should be corrected.Ms Thomas said -  
A government member - Straight-talking Tony! - Straight-talking Tony - such an honest man!Ms Thomas said the statement made by Mr Abbott in the Parliament that the nurses union 'says the government's scheme _ is worse than Workchoices..' has never been made by an official of the Australian Nursing Federation.It 'has never been made'. And Ms Thomas, a representative of nurses, went on to say:'In a speech about being honest with the Australian people he put words in the mouths of nurses that we never said.'This statement then must be corrected or he has misled the Australian Parliament,' _That is a statement from the Australian Nursing Federation.With this Leader of the Opposition we are dealing with a man so arrogant and so out of touch that he wants to put irons in the hands of Australian women and he wants to put words in the mouths of Australian nurses. He should do the decent thing and apologise for this statement, which lacks honesty. Each and every day, Australians are coming to know that this man represents a risk to the economy and represents a risk to the truth, and he certainly represents a risk because he wants Work Choices back.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and I say, at the outset, that the safety of householders in this program of home insulation is an absolute priority for this government, and that is why the announcement has been made today -  -  - to suspend foil insulation in ceilings pending investigations and discussions between my department, safety authorities, the industry itself and technical experts.That comes on top of a number of steps that have been taken in relation to this program, including the decision that I took on 1 November to ban the use of metal fasteners in the installation of foil insulation, and also for the targeted safety program of some 10 per cent in Queensland where there is a significant number of homes with foil insulation in them. That targeted program is underway, and I can report to the House that there are a number of interim results from some 400 homes that have already had their inspections concluded.We will continue to look carefully at the results of the remainder of that program. If it is necessary to expand that program on the basis of providing additional certainty for the delivery of that program, we will. But let us be very clear: the program guidelines at present provide for greater levels of safety and accreditation than is required under Australian standards and under the Building Code of Australia, and I say to people that it is now a specific requirement on the part of installers that they actually make sure that, pre-installation, they conduct a risk assessment. So there is a responsibility on the part of insulation installers to ensure that they observe the guidelines that we have in place and that they make sure that, when they go into the ceiling, there are no risks in relation to this program.As I said at the outset of this answer, safety is an absolute priority for the government in delivery of this program. If there are any additional measures required to increase the levels of safety that already exist in our guidelines, then we will take those steps as necessary.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for his question. Of course, in the killing off of Work Choices and in the move to the Fair Work system there has been a need to ensure that Australian employers and employees got all of the information they needed as the system came into full operation on 1 January this year. That is why we have been in the business of getting that information to them in a practical and responsible way. The Fair Work website has had more than 1.4 million visits, 54,000 copies of the new Fair Work Ombudsman best practice guides have been downloaded, there have been 570,000 calls to the Fair Work information line and $3.7 million has been allocated to fund almost 50,000 education visits by the Fair Work Ombudsman - personal discussions to help businesses make the transition. Under the Fair Work Education and Information program, over 1,700 workshops have been delivered around the nation and there are a further 600 to come in the months ahead. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia has worked in partnership with Telstra - a very innovative partnership - to mail out Fair Work information to over 900,000 small businesses. There have been 60 seminars around the country conducted by the National Farmers Federation for farmers to make sure that they get the information they need. And of course unions are working on the education of employees to make sure working people get the information they need through the union education fund. This is real, on-the-ground education and training. It is a low-cost approach.I am asked whether there have been alternative approaches. Well, there have been. There was the waste of $121 million of taxpayers' money on Work Choices, with $212,000 of that money producing 200,000 of these mouse pads. The House has looked at these mouse pads before. Of course, when we came to office in February 2008 I was advised that there were 97,898 mouse pads still in storage out of the original 200,000. I think I am a pretty determined person and I work as hard as I can, and I have laboured hard to get rid of these mouse pads - I have laboured hard. -  - Well, you can have one, because we have got some left. I have made sure that they have gone to Africa with missionaries. There are some in Uganda in a Christian mission helping out with education over there. They have gone to services for people with disabilities so that they could be cut up in craft class. I have even tried giving them away to journalists as Christmas presents. And of course I gave one to the member for Menzies as a consolation prize when he did not become the fourth Leader of the Opposition in two years. But I have to say this task has been beyond me: there are still 34,650 mouse pads in storage despite my very best labours to get rid of them. They are still there.This would all be very funny if we could quickly get rid of the remaining 34,000. I have actually asked my department for advice. What can we do with them now? The trouble is we cannot shred them and put them into landfill because they are not biodegradable. It is like the Liberal Party's commitment to Work Choices - it is going to take 150,000 years to biodegrade. Tony's toxic mouse pads; Tony's toxic Work Choices. But it is the Australian taxpayer that is having to put up with all of this because storing these mouse pads has cost the taxpayers $17,898. - In conclusion can I say the poor old taxpayer has had enough. Let me renew the offer I made earlier this year to the Leader of the Opposition. I know that he will want these for his next election campaign. We are prepared to shift all 34,000 of them to the Liberal Party secretariat free of charge. Just give me the word and there they will be for you. No more taxpayers' money will be spent on these mouse pads. If you want them, Tony, there they will be. Just let us know. - </DOC>

 - I can confirm that correspondence, as I can confirm a series of processes that were underway in relation to both our discussions with the insulation industry as a whole and advice that I received from my department as to the most appropriate set of guidelines to deliver safe and effective home insulation to the people of Australia. Subsequent to that correspondence I have met with industry and agreed that a number of measures, as were determined to be appropriate, be brought into place in relation to the guidelines. I made a number of decisions in respect of that, and I have made another decision today.In November, both on the advice of the department and following discussions with the industry, electrical trades groups and others, we banned the use of metal fasteners when installing insulation foil in ceilings. That is because if these metal fasteners are used there is the potential for conductivity to take place in the ceiling. That posed an unnecessary risk and on that basis I made that decision to ban metal fasteners - a decision that was acknowledged by all those portions of the insulation industry at the time. As well as that, I have made a decision to ensure that there is a mandatory risk assessment for ceiling insulation so that every installer ascertains the level of risk prior to actually beginning that insulation task. Today I can announce that every home that has foil insulation installed under the government's Home Insulation Program will undergo an electrical safety inspection as a consequence of the initial targeted audit of foil insulation in Queensland homes in particular. This is because safety is an absolute priority for this government. It always has been, and decisions I have made in the past reflect that - as does the decision I have made today.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question because it goes to the state of the economy, the future of the Australian economy and this government's determination to build a stronger economy, protecting Australian jobs and, through protecting hundreds and thousands of Australian jobs, supporting working families. On Friday a statement on monetary policy was released by the RBA. The bank emphasised that the recovery in advanced economies is likely to remain subdued for some time and that significant uncertainties remain. Among those uncertainties, the RBA noted the ongoing fiscal challenges facing some nations. In particular, the RBA noted fiscal challenges facing the government of Greece. In Greece, net debt will be 86 per cent of GDP in 2009, increasing to 95 per cent of GDP in 2010. The Greek government estimates their budget deficit to be 12.7 per cent of GDP in 2009. A significant fiscal crisis in Greece would jeopardise confidence in some parts of the wider European economy and set back the global economic recovery. That is why these are such sensitive matters for us all.It is important to note, therefore, the Greek government's statement concerning its stability program that aims to reduce its budget deficit to 2.8 per cent of GDP by 2012. This plan has been endorsed by both the European Central Bank and the European Commission. On the question of indebtedness around the world, US debt is predicted to rise from 58 per cent of GDP in 2009 to 85 per cent of GDP by 2014; in the UK it is predicted to rise from 62 per cent of GDP in 2009 to 92 per cent of GDP in 2014; and in Japan it is expected to rise from 105 per cent of GDP in 2009 to 143.5 per cent of GDP in 2014. Across all the major advanced economies, net debt will increase from 69.5 per cent of GDP in 2009 to around 93 per cent of GDP in 2014.It is important at this juncture to note the absolute contrast with Australia, because net debt peaks as a percentage of GDP in 2013-14 at 9.6 per cent of GDP. This is around one-tenth of the average of the major advanced economies. As the director of Fitch's Asian sovereign ratings said today, there are concerns in the market right now with other European nations regarding their debt positions, but Australia's sovereign has a very good debt position indeed. That is where we stand. That is the fragility of international debt markets at the present because of perceptions of sovereign risk in certain European countries.Enter into this equation the statements yesterday by the alternative finance minister of Australia, Senator Joyce - reckless and risky in the extreme. His statement was:We are getting to a point where we - Australia - can't repay it _I draw to the attention of the House statements from Joshua Williamson, of Citigroup, yesterday, who described Senator Joyce's comments as incredible. In fact, that is one of a large number of responses from the economic and financial marketplace. He said:We have an excellent debt to GDP position which is also the envy of the industrialised world. And we are being distinguished by international investors as an excellent credit risk.When asked specifically about Senator Joyce's remarks, he also said:_ the market is very sensitive to negative information at the moment. That has to do with credit availability whether it be at a corporate or a sovereign level.He went on to say:We've also got the situation _ of certain European states that are having legitimate difficulties with the ability to rein in their deficits and their debts.When asked what he made of Senator Joyce's remarks and whether they were irresponsible, the representative of Citigroup said they were 'absolutely' irresponsible. That is where we have the statements by Senator Joyce and the response to them from the marketplace.It is not the first time Senator Joyce has opened his mouth on this. He has made similar remarks about the sovereign debts of the various states of Australia and the sovereign debt of the United States of America, the largest economy in the world, where he said that they were at risk of general default, resulting in turn in global 'economic Armageddon'. What has happened in response to this? In this morning's Age, we have the shadow Treasurer stepping up to the plate and saying boldly that in fact there is 'no danger' of Australia defaulting on its debt - thank you, Joe - and, on top of that:I - Joe Hockey - have no doubt Australia has the ability to repay sovereign debt _Thus spake the shadow Treasurer of Australia last night as he sought to clean up the wreckage left by Senator Joyce. But, come this morning, he is asked what his position is in relation to Senator Joyce, his fellow economic frontbencher of the coalition: 'Do you have confidence in Barnaby Joyce?' He replies:I have absolute confidence in Barnaby.So in the Age he says he fundamentally repudiates what Senator Joyce has to say on sovereign debt, and on the ABC this morning he says he has full confidence in the shadow minister and presumably that which he says. Is it any wonder we find it a bit hard to work it all out?But the final word on this must go to the Leader of the Opposition himself. The Leader of the Opposition, when asked whether he backs or does not back Senator Joyce, was all over the place this morning. Four times he was asked whether he would back Senator Joyce as shadow finance minister come the next election:QUESTION: You won't be moving Barnaby Joyce out of the Finance portfolio before the election?The response from Tony straight-talk Abbott was:Look, I have great confidence in my team. I have great confidence in my team. I think they're _ doing a terrific job.The next question was:Will he be there at the next election as Finance spokesman?That is the question: will Senator Joyce be there as finance spokesman. Straight-talking Tony says:_ I have great confidence in my team _Next question: what about him? - That was the third time that the straight-talking Leader of the Opposition was asked whether he would back Senator Joyce as the finance spokesman for the coalition at the next election. And then, the fourth time he was asked, 'Can you guarantee Barnaby's place?' he said, 'Look, I, me, this is the team I will take to the next election.' That was No. 4. Talk about the ring of confidence and all of that! But I presume that what we have here is the Leader of the Opposition backing in Barnaby Joyce, responsible global economic statesman personified.What we have here is capital-R risk: risk represented in the Leader of the Opposition, who says he has no interest in economics; risk in the judgment of the Leader of the Opposition in appointing Senator Joyce to this position; and risk to the economy writ large. We know that Senator Joyce is for the high jump. It is plain from the statements by the Leader of the Opposition this morning that he is going to be cut down as soon as we get out of this place, but once that happens - can I just say - what lies very deeply imprinted in the minds of the Australian public is: what could have possessed the Leader of the Opposition to have made Senator Joyce a member of the crack economic team of the alternative government of Australia? In the history of this parliament, they have together the worst economic frontbench that an opposition has ever served up. It stands for all to see.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I am pleased to advise the Leader of the Opposition, through you, Mr Speaker, about the consultation process that has been a central feature of this program and continues to be so. I can advise the House that at a roundtable in February 2009 industry expressed a desire for a national unit of training to be developed for installers of insulation, recognising that this is an industry that previously had no dedicated training program. My department responded to this advice and contracted the Construction and Property Services Industry Skills Council, the peak training body for the industry, in consultation with DEEWR, to develop training materials for the safe and effective rollout of insulation in accordance with the Australian standards and as required under the guidelines.Following that, CPSISC - I beg your pardon, there are many acronyms here - the Construction and Property Services Industry Skills Council, consulted widely with relevant industry organisations, including the insulation sector, the CFMEU, the MBA and the Housing Industry Association -  -  - In addition, the industry skills council developed a pocketbook to support the training package, and that pocketbook warns explicitly of the dangers of electricity - that stapling live wires to joists can be life threatening - and that advice from a licensed electrical contractor should be sought. As I have consistently said, I will not hesitate to boost training requirements, safety standards and compliance measures under this program. That is what I have done today and that is what I did last year as well in order to have a program that meets the Australian standards, or exceeds them, as it does, and fully conforms to the advice that we have received and that I have received from my department in this matter. I am further in a position -  - Mr Speaker -  - In the real-time political environment which we inhabit now I am very pleased to additionally be able to advise the House in response to the question which the honourable member asked me. I have a copy of the correspondence here from Mr James Tinslay, the CEO of the National Electrical and Communications Association, and a response to that letter from the Assistant Secretary of the Home Energy Branch, who was asked to reply on the minister's behalf, thanking him for the letter, apologising for the delay in replying and pointing out that the guidelines for the Energy Efficient Homes Package clearly state that the insulation installer must follow the minimum wiring and clearance standard distances, as stated in clause 4.5.2.3 and figure 4.7 of the AS/NZS 3000:2007, the Australian and New Zealand standard. The department's response to Mr Tinslay was clear that the guidelines refer to the wiring and minimum clearance distances as stated in those Australian and New Zealand standards and that a development program was in place for training based on existing units. This correspondence also advised NECA that they would be added to the stakeholder register as an organisation that could provide advice, consultation and information. Subsequent to that they have participated in the consultation roundtables that I continue to hold. - I table the letter in question as the document I have spoken to. - That is the letter I was quoting from and that is the document in question.Opposition members - Yes. - No, Mr Speaker. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Today we have had the Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index, and today's data shows that consumer confidence fell modestly in February - down 2.6 per cent from the previous month. Westpac's chief economist, Bill Evans, noted that 'adverse developments in the global economy' are likely to have weighed on sentiment. Notwithstanding this modest fall, we are encouraged that consumer confidence remains high and is still 36.4 per cent higher than it was a year ago. The data today shows that, while we can be confident in Australia's economic recovery, we have no cause for complacency.Of course, maintaining confidence in recovery is very important. It is important that our political leaders work hard to build confidence in our economy and not be out there talking down the economy. We still have a fragile global economy, and it is important that political leaders do not make risky and irresponsible statements that could jeopardise our recovery and put Australian jobs at risk. Today we have seen some more of the serial sloppiness from the economic team on the other side. In fact, they have had a shocker of a week - an absolute shocker. Today, the shadow Treasurer had to slap down the shadow finance minister. But also we have seen the risky behaviour of the shadow Treasurer, rushing out to claim that interest rates are on the rise and to misrepresent the statements of the Reserve Bank. The shadow Treasurer went out last night, all guns blazing, claiming there had been a speech by the Governor of the Reserve Bank that claimed that rates were going up because of the government's fiscal policy. This was a complete misrepresentation last night by the shadow Treasurer, because what does this paper say? On page 1 it says this:For local readers, we emphasise that the paper is not intended to provide any particular message about current issues for monetary policy in Australia. - So sloppy is our Joe that he had not even read that message. But, of course, it gets worse today, because he goes out and continues to misrepresent what the Reserve Bank governor said. Today it is plain that the Reserve Bank governor was not saying what the shadow Treasurer said he was saying. The shadow Treasurer has continued to insist that he was saying that. This is what the Governor of the Reserve Bank had to say about fiscal policy and about the state of our national books on 28 September 2009:There is not much argument that the state of the government accounts in this country is just so superior to virtually anybody with whom we would want to compare.That was in the Senate committee inquiring into the stimulus. If those opposite had their way, this country would be in recession right now. The shadow Treasurer is an embarrassment to all of those who sit opposite. He is a bit like parachute pants - popular for a while but nobody would be seen in them!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question - in fact, I welcome it - because it gives me an opportunity to take the House and those listening through the process of assessment that assessors go through in terms of their accreditation, an assessment journey between wanting to become an assessor and being contracted to do work through the government. The fact is that the decision to embark on the journey of becoming an assessor is an individual decision that is taken by assessors through training organisations and through the Association of Building Sustainability Assessors. It is not a decision that involves a relationship between the government and the assessor. I welcome the fact that a number of people have expressed great interest in becoming assessors under this program because this is a good program. Yes, issues have been raised which I will address - I am absolutely clear about that - but this is the first time that we have provided Australians with the opportunity to build a career path for themselves which centres on providing information to householders about what they can do in their homes by way of energy efficiency measures and the like. The situation in relation to assessors is a matter between the assessors and the body that is required to accredit those assessors, not between the government and the assessors.An additional point is that in this program we did not set out to limit the number of assessors. When it was drawn to my attention that there was a large number of assessors seeking to be accredited under the program and when ABSA brought forward the proposal for a moratorium on assessors being accredited, we did not oppose that moratorium. I think it is worth pointing out that ABSA communicated to all those potential assessors, by email and other means, offering them the opportunity not to continue with their accreditation and to have a refund of their application fee if they desired to take that course of action. Notwithstanding that the Association of Building Sustainability Assessors had said to its cohort of potential assessors, 'We have large numbers of assessors coming through the system; do you want to continue with your training or not, given that we are going to impose a moratorium?' many of them took the decision to continue.One of the reasons for that is that there are a number of other programs that this government delivers and that state governments deliver that enable sustainability assessors to make an income and to make a living. I am very confident that, as we see increased energy efficiency standards become part of the planning code over time, as we see additional requirements and an awareness of the need -  -  - The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts has provided additional information on the rollout of the program to provide the necessary information for assessors who are accredited and those who are contemplating assessment, who are considering becoming an accredited assessor, to understand how this program is being rolled out. We have delivered over 140,000 assessments. In the period through December, when the moratorium was proposed by the Association of Building Sustainability Assessors, we saw significant numbers of assessments take place. It is the case that the increased demand on the department by way of contact did result in delays. Additional resources have been identified to ensure that those delays are kept to a minimum. But, in terms of the decision that people take to become an assessor under this program, our commitment to deliver 360,000 household assessments remains and we will have a workforce in place that is trained to do that job.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. It is very important that approaches to fiscal policy are conducted with clarity and consistency. It is obviously vital for government to behave in a clear and consistent manner with respect to fiscal policy, but it is also important for the alternative government to do so. Unfortunately, in recent times we have not seen a great deal of either clarity or consistency from the opposition on issues associated with fiscal policy. In fact, it now seems that the government is almost confronted with two oppositions that more often than not disagree with each other more than they do with the government. On the one hand, we have the Leader of the Opposition almost on a daily basis putting out big spending promises and we have the shadow finance minister, Senator Joyce, again on a daily basis, making wild statements and claims that the Australian government might default on its debts, the United States government might default on its debts and so forth. On the other hand, we have the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, who seems only to be wheeled out now to repudiate statements made by Senator Joyce. We do not see the shadow Treasurer very often, but every now and then he has to reassure the Australian people that, notwithstanding the litany of big spending commitments being made by his leader, the Liberal Party actually believes in cutting government spending, not increasing it.Yesterday Senator Joyce said that Australia was at risk of defaulting on its debt. On the doors today his statements were unequivocally supported by the member for Tangney and Senator Williams from the opposition. Yet today in the Age the member for North Sydney was quoted as saying:I have no doubt that Australia has the ability to repay sovereign debt. It is in no danger of defaulting on its debt.It appeared this morning that Senator Joyce was slightly getting the message, starting to inch his way back to planet Earth but just starting, when on NewsRadio he said, 'Yea, well, it's not going to happen tomorrow.' It is good news for Australian investors that the threatened default is not going to happen tomorrow - thank you, Senator Joyce! This morning on ABC radio the member for North Sydney was asked, as the Prime Minister indicated, if he had absolute confidence in Senator Joyce. His response was very interesting and I read from the transcript:Lyndal Curtis: So you have complete confidence in Senator Joyce being a partner in economic portfolios?Joe Hockey: I have absolutely no confidence in Lindsay Tanner who is the clear definition of a Labor minister who has failed as finance minister.As the Prime Minister did indicate, the second time around when the member for North Sydney was asked again, 'And complete confidence in Senator Joyce?' he said:I have absolute confidence in Barnaby.It took him two times. The wheels were turning in his head and he suddenly thought: 'Whoops! I'd better actually say I have confidence in Senator Joyce.' It had to be squeezed out of him. It was a painful process. It had to be squeezed out of him.I understand that watching this circus is entertaining and diverting for many people, but you can get a real sense of how a prospective government is going to govern and how it is going to behave in government by watching how it behaves in opposition. If this circus were occurring in government, there would be absolute mayhem. Investors would be spooked. Our No. 1 ally would be demanding an explanation for the finance minister of this country announcing it was about to default. Australian jobs would be threatened and we would have a bitterly divided government in a period of great global challenge. By appointing Senator Joyce as shadow finance minister, by allowing this circus of great division and disunity to continue, by indicating no interest whatsoever in economic issues, the Leader of the Opposition shows that he is a giant risk to the Australian economy and that he is not worthy of the trust of the Australian people to manage our economy and our finances. - Yes, I was, Mr Speaker. - No, they are not. I am happy to table the display of disunity on the part of the opposition.</DOC>

 - The program that the member for North Sydney refers to was in fact a program of the Howard government inherited by the current Rudd government. Shortly prior to the election in 2007, the amount of the rebate involved was in fact doubled by the Howard government, and that in a sense has been the core reason why the program has blown out. The government has included within its budget calculations provision for the cost of the additional expense -  -  -  - This expenditure, like other expenditures which the government has committed to, is in fact provided for in the budget. Unlike many of the commitments that the Leader of the Opposition has been making in recent times, there are savings to cover this expenditure and other expenditures. There is a document called the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which I would recommend to the dwindling band of fiscally and economically literate members of the opposition. It would be an interesting exercise for them to have a look at some budget papers from time to time.It is also important to note that, as a result of these changes in this program, the government has shifted its mechanism for subsidising householders putting solar panels on their roofs to the renewable energy target mechanism. So there is now a different system in place to enable what is otherwise a very worthwhile objective to be pursued. But again I think it is worth noting that the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition, in pursuing -  - You are not really going to raise relevance, are you? You have got to be joking. - The person who has asked the question of how this is going to be funded is somebody who presided over opposition finances where we had commitments to reduce fuel excise by 5c a litre, increase the pension, reintroduce the Investing in Our Schools Program, give a commitment to further capital gains tax relief for small business, $3.3 billion on a climate change policy that is uncosted, $3 billion of extra money for the Murray-Darling Basin and now an expanded parental leave policy - none of which has been funded by a single saving -  - The government's position with respect to spending and savings is very clear and has been outlined by both me and the Treasurer in this parliament on a number of occasions - that is, new spending will be offset by savings, and spending will not be increased beyond two per cent in real terms once the growth rate in this economy goes beyond three per cent. And for an opposition that is engaged in a giant, unfunded spendathon, with a daily set of new billions of dollars worth of commitments that have no savings to back them up, to suggest that the government has a problem on this front is the absolute epitome of hypocrisy. The country demands sound economic management. The Abbott opposition has abandoned its core supporters and is a risk to the future prosperity of this nation. It has no idea of fiscal management and it would be a great threat to the future of the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for that question, particularly as she and the Prime Minister have just announced recently in Hobart an extra investment of $3½ million in the Royal Hobart Hospital emergency department as part of the $750 million investment in emergency departments. I know that, similarly, the member for Braddon was pleased when $3.7 million of that money was earmarked to be spent at the North West Regional Hospital in Burnie.We of course are investing more in health than any other government. At the same time we know that health costs are rising, so we do need to take action to protect the long-term sustainability of the health budget and to make sure that taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely and fairly. We have invested an extra $20 billion through the healthcare agreement, because we could see patients suffering after the Howard government starved public hospitals of funds for many years.I am asked also if there is a risk to these investments. There certainly is not any risk from our government. We are absolutely determined to invest in health, and our determination is unwavering. The same cannot be said, however, for those opposite. The shadow Treasurer, for example, is on the record as saying that he would not have invested this money in health, telling the Australian just after COAG that he would not have made the generous $15.1 billion Council of Australian Governments deal. The shadow finance minister has refused to rule out any health cuts. This morning the Leader of the Opposition finally got around to admitting that he had cut money from the health budget. I have to tell you, though, that the Leader of the Opposition did not want to actually call it a cut but he did admit it. I want to read, for the benefit of the House, what the Leader of the Opposition said on 2GB this morning, because, for those of you who missed the interview, it was a real ripper and does need to be recorded. I quote from the Leader of the Opposition:Um, the forward estimates were reduced by a billion dollars.Was that money going to public hospitals ever reduced?No, it was not, but the rate of growth, ah, of funding, was decreased and that is why Kevin Rudd keeps repeating that he's ripped a billion dollars out of health. I did not rip a billion dollars out of health. Um, the rate of growth just slowed somewhat.So this is straight-talking Tony for you. I think it must be special code for people who find economics boring - a cut here, a cut there - but I suppose it is all the same to the Liberal Party. What the budget papers make absolutely clear is that hundreds of millions of dollars appeared with a minus in front of them, and pretty clearly that is what old fashioned economists, like Peter Costello, called a budget cut. Even if the Leader of the Opposition wants to call it just a 'ah, funding decrease' or 'a reduction in the forward estimates' or 'um, the rate of growth slowing somewhat', that is a billion dollars, it is this man's legacy and he cannot be trusted to be the Prime Minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his very timely question - very timely indeed. As we know, one in five working women are reliant on awards, and around half of Australian women with children under five are in the paid workforce. That is why it is so important today to make a difference for working women as they seek to balance work and family life, and that challenge will get more difficult as our population ages and as we are increasingly reliant on increasing the participation rate of working-age adults. That is why our Fair Work Act introduces new benefits and new protections to balance work and family life, including a right to request extended parental leave; including a right to request a return to flexible or part-time work; including a low-paid bargaining stream to particularly benefit low-paid areas, which tend to be areas in which women work, and to ensure that they have got access to the benefits of bargaining; including protection from unfair dismissal; and including a guaranteed safety net that no-one can rip away.Let us compare these protections to the rip-offs under Work Choices. We know from ABS data that women on Australian workplace agreements earned less than women on collective agreements. Women working full time on Australian workplace agreements took home on average a staggering $87.40 less per week than their colleagues on collective agreements. Women working in casual jobs on Australian workplace agreements earned an amazing $94 per week less than women on collective agreements. This shameful, toxic, nasty system has been buried by us because we knew that Work Choices was hurting working women and working families. It is the Liberal Party that wants to dig up, unearth and breathe new life back into this shameful, toxic mess.Beyond workplace relations laws, helping women balance work and family life is also about parental leave, and that is why our government is establishing the first ever paid parental leave scheme in this county. Our scheme is fully funded. They are two words you will never see pass the lips of the Leader of the Opposition. They are two words he will never say: 'fully funded'. He will never have a sentence with those two words in a row. Until this morning, Australians would have believed that the Leader of the Opposition had announced an unfunded parental leave scheme. But from this morning we actually know that both the funding and the scheme are fictitious, because the Leader of the Opposition, was asked this morning by Alan Jones:Finally, you have announced that you will implement if you are elected to government a policy to provide six months paid parental leave.Alan goes on to say:Who will? Employers have welcomed your initiatives so long as they don't have to pay. Who would pay for your six months parental leave?To that question, the Leader of the Opposition gives the following answer:Yeah, well, Alan, the Sydney Morning Herald kind of jumped the gun yesterday. We have not made any announcement. I talked about this in my book Battlelines which was released in the middle of last year.He did not make an announcement; he is on a book tour selling Battlelines. We know, of course, following today's revelation on Alan Jones' program is that this so-called policy is make-believe. It is uncosted and unfunded. Why would the Leader of the Opposition be out with an unfunded, uncosted, really unannounced policy? There is no policy here. Really, if you look at this Leader of the Opposition, the explanation is pretty clear. There is no policy, because he does not believe in paid parental leave. When he was a member of the Howard government, he said:Compulsory paid maternity leave? Over this government's dead body. - The face of modern liberalism: it is so attractive and so intelligent. The Leader of the Opposition said:Compulsory paid maternity leave? Over this government's dead body.Isn't he a straight talker! What a wonderful grab. Not a word wasted! - I withdraw. Of course, I said the wrong thing; the face of modern liberalism is Bronwyn Bishop. I apologise. -  10000 
SPEAKER, TheThe SPEAKER - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. The Deputy Prime Minister, on the basis that she must withdraw without qualification, will withdraw. She will refer to members by their titles. - Mr Speaker, I withdraw. I was referring to the straight talker, the Leader of the Opposition, when he made it painfully clear that he does not support paid parental leave. So what we have got is a paid parental leave scheme, supposedly announced by the Leader of the Opposition, then unannounced today. All this is unfunded, and his truthful attitude was revealed years ago when he said 'over his dead body' would there be a paid parental leave scheme. It is painfully clear that what this all adds up to is that the Leader of the Opposition is a risk to the pay and conditions of working women, because he wants to bring back Work Choices and a risk to our paid parental leave scheme which we will deliver for working Australians.</DOC>

 - Mr Work Choices is still alive and well on the opposition front bench. - This is a government that believes in delivering an education revolution. We believe in that because when we came to government the education system of this nation had been neglected for 12 long years, and schools in particular were crying out for reform. There are various members of the opposition who should be hanging their heads in shame at that track record. - In overcoming the shameful neglect of Australian education by the members of the Liberal Party, we have been investing in education. Let me make it absolutely clear: I make no apology whatsoever for engaging in the biggest school modernisation program the nation has ever seen. I make no apology whatsoever for getting into the hands of Australian children hundreds of thousands of computers so they can have access to the learning tools of the 21st century. For the edification of the member for Sturt, each of these figures is accounted for in the budget. Our education spending is in the budget for all to see.Of course, there is a risk to this education spending. The risk to this education spending is the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Joyce and the member for Sturt - all of whom are on the record as saying they want to cut billions of dollars out of our stimulus program. If you are going to cut billions of dollars out of our stimulus program, you are going to cut billions of dollars out of schools. When I asked for just a modicum of honesty from the supposedly straight-talking Leader of the Opposition, when I asked him to table a list of the schools that would bear the cuts, I got absolute silence. This carry-on from the member for Sturt will be viewed as the hypocrisy it is until the Leader of the Opposition steps up to the dispatch box with a list of schools and says, 'These are the cuts that I stand by.'I would say the following thing to the member for Sturt: if he is so concerned -  -  - The Liberal Party were just proving yet again how devoid of content they are. In conclusion, I say to the member for Sturt: if he truly had any interest in the question of budgeting, why didn't he stop the Leader of the Opposition making a completely unfunded announcement about his climate change con job? Hypocrisy is written all over their faces -  - and the fake hearty laughs from the shadow Treasurer, a man who certainly is a shadow of what he used to be, proves my point.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his very important question, because it is a terrible fact that exceptional disadvantage continues in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. It is the case that both the previous government and now this government have recognised that urgent and continuing action is needed to address this terrible disadvantage. That is why I persevered to get a deal in the Alice Springs town camps. We have started action in those town camps, but we have a huge amount left to do.The government have also strengthened the Northern Territory emergency response, investing an additional $1.2 billion, because we recognise that we have to be there across the board for the long term. There are now 65 additional police deployed. I would also like to inform the House that there are now 16,000 people on compulsory income management in the Northern Territory. That compares to the around 1,400 people who were on compulsory income management when we came into government.We have also recently introduced legislation into the parliament to make sure that the Northern Territory emergency response can be effective in the long term. We are introducing major welfare reforms to extend what are clear benefits of income management to more vulnerable Australians. We want to start in the Northern Territory, but we want to be able to extend income management to other vulnerable Australians across the country.It is the case that our reforms will make sure that people's welfare payments are spent on the essentials of life - spent on food and rent, not on alcohol and gambling. The number of people on income management in the Northern Territory with our reforms is estimated to be 20,000. So 20,000 people are expected to be on income management under the reforms that we have introduced. This is all about personal responsibility and all about making sure that we do everything we possibly can to get children to school and to get young people engaged in work and training. We want to fight passive welfare and to link the payment of welfare to making sure that children go to school on a regular basis and that they continue their studies and go to work. I want to make it absolutely clear that these arrangements do not apply at the moment. The changes that we have proposed will make sure that income management can be rolled out in the towns in the Northern Territory - in Tennant Creek, in Katherine and in the suburbs of Alice Springs and Darwin - where we have significant and desperate circumstances for many, many people.I have to say that it is extremely disappointing that the opposition have said that they will not support these vital reforms. It is very, very significant that the opposition are not supporting these vital reforms, which would have seen such a significant improvement to the lives of so many very vulnerable people in the Northern Territory - particularly when it would have seen an expansion in the number of people on income management. The Leader of the Opposition has previously said that he wants to see income management extended to other welfare recipients, and that is exactly what this government reform will do. The Leader of the Opposition has also said that he wants to see the Northern Territory emergency response become sustainable over the longer term - and that is exactly what these reforms will do. We do need to have welfare reform to make sure that the Northern Territory emergency response is sustainable for the longer term and that the benefits of income management can be extended to other vulnerable Australians.</DOC>

 - I would refer the member for North Sydney to the fact that in the budget of 2008 there was a total of $33 billion worth of savings measures put in place by the government over the forward estimates. In the budget of 2009 there was a further $22 billion worth of savings measures put in place over the forward estimates. The Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers were released towards the end of last year. They are, in effect, a mid-term report on the budget. For the first time ever there were savings initiatives in those Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers to cover off new spending initiatives that were announced over that period. Finally, I would make the observation to the member for North Sydney that one of the reasons why we had a big task in front of us to find savings in the 2008 budget was that - An opposition member - It was a good point. - My final response to the member for North Sydney is that when we came to office we confronted a budget where there had been no serious savings measures by the previous government since the 2003 budget. Of course, since we have come to office that pattern of fiscal profligacy has been continued by the opposition. So we have now got to a point where it is seven years since the Liberal Party put forward a serious savings measure. We do not really hold our breath for the prospect that we will get one. Eventually we might get a savings proposal from them, but it has been seven years since the last one.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question and for his ongoing interest in these very important matters that we confront at our airports. Yesterday the Prime Minister, accompanied by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and I, announced major national security measures that will improve the safety of passengers and those employed at our major capital city and regional airports.I would like to outline those changes involving the Customs and Border Protection Service and also the Australian Federal Police that will make our airports safer. Firstly, I indicate that there will be $24.9 million over four years to enhance passenger risk assessment by Customs and Border Protection which will allow for a more effective assessment of a larger number of passengers earlier and faster. It will allow for proper analysis, the proper storage, the proper assessment and effective profiling of passenger data and sharing with other border and intelligence agencies - a very important mechanism to improve the way in which we track passengers who come into our ports. It will mean effectively that we will have more information about who is coming here. It will also determine and establish the history of travel of persons of interest and, therefore, we will be able to measure potential risks and also determine appropriate responses to those potential risks.Secondly, there is a $17.7 million initiative over four years to enhance by almost 50 per cent the presence of firearms and explosive detection dogs who will assist bomb appraisal officers and other uniformed Australian Federal Police officers in making a very effective and highly visible contribution to airport security. This, of course, is fully supported by the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Tony Negus. I also indicate that there is $12.3 million over the 2010-11 year to assist the transition of the unified police model to what is now described as the all-in model, effectively ensuring that over a number of years the Australian Federal Police take primary responsibility for the security of our major airports in this country - a very important initiative, one that was not taken up by the previous government but was embraced by this government. We are working now with the state governments and the state jurisdictions of police and the Australian Federal Police in order to ensure that we bring that very important measure forward and have it properly realised.While the majority of travellers go through airports in capital cities such as Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane, our increased security measures will also boost safety and security for our regional airports. We know that the previous government neglected the needs of the security of regional airports for far too long. We know that there were concerns raised by communities within the regions in this country about the security of our airports and that they fell on the deaf ears of those opposite. So for almost 12 years they neglected those regions. They like to say that they are the party for the regions, but what did they do? They did nothing when it came to securing the airports in those areas.In relation to the announcement yesterday, industry has already been quick to support the government's initiatives. Qantas will support measures that improve aviation safety and security and will work closely with the government and border agencies to ensure measures balance the priorities of passenger safety and security with practical operations of airports and airlines. Singapore Airlines has said the airline was comfortable with the changes. A company spokesperson said: 'The government is acting in a reasonable and enlightened manner. This is a positive development.'The events in the United States late last year involving Northwest Airlines flight 253 are a chilling reminder to us all that the threat to airports and aviation is ever present. These measures are central to this country's national security, and the government had hoped that this challenge could be dealt with in a considered and bipartisan manner; but, unfortunately, that is not the case. So desperate are those opposite to score political points on such an important issue that they have failed to check the facts. In a joint release distributed yesterday by the members for Wide Bay and Stirling, the opposition have been very loose with the truth. First, they assert that risk based assessments have reduced aviation security. That is entirely untrue; that is wrong. Since July last year, when the new air-screening measures were implemented, there has been an increase in the number of major criminal detections, including drug detections. Secondly, the member for Stirling and the member for Wide Bay assert that the number of Australian Federal Police sworn officers has dropped since the election. This is entirely untrue. The facts prove the lie. Since the election of the Rudd government in November 2007 -  - I will, don't you worry, Member for Stirling. One day you might even get a question. - In relation to the number of sworn officers since the election of the government, there has been an additional 181 officers - that is a 6.7 per cent increase - and we are ahead of our commitment to ensure that we have 500 additional police in the five years, ahead of that forecast. So that is another assertion made by those opposite which is entirely mischievous and untrue. Thirdly, the member for Stirling and the member for Wide Bay have accused the government of 'walking away from air security officers or sky marshals'. The opposition is wrong, wrong and wrong. The fact is that the Air Security Officer Program continues to provide an integral layer of security at our airports and there has been no reduction whatsoever in the funding for the program.It is one thing to be loose with the truth in some other areas of public policy but, when it comes to national security, we would expect those opposite to join with us to combat serious and organised crime and to combat terrorism. What we do not expect is for them to mislead the public in terms of what the government is doing. I suggest to the opposition that they join the government - put aside their distortions and their political opportunism - and support our border and intelligence agencies by embracing these very important national security measures.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the Leader of the Opposition for his question about our commitments on education, specifically on the digital education revolution and our undertaking to provide computers to secondary school students from year 9 to year 12 at a one to one ratio by 2011-12. Secondly, I say to the Leader of the Opposition that we have so far rolled out more than 200,000 computers to Australian secondary schools. That is 200,000 more than were ever rolled out by the previous government, of which he was a member. - I say to the Leader of the Opposition and those who seek to interject on this one: this government is proud of its record of achievement in education. This government is proud of Building the Education Revolution. This government is proud of building trades training centres in Australian secondary schools. The member for Bowman then left the chamber. 
 - This government is proud of its record of more than 200,000 computers in Australian secondary schools; proud of the fact that we have the biggest school modernisation program underway in Australia's history; and proud of the fact that we are undertaking fundamental reforms in the quality of education through the My School website and the investment in disadvantaged schools. This is a record of achievement in education.When the Leader of the Opposition stands up and speaks about integrity of commitments, I have one set of words for him: rock solid, solid gold guarantee - the absolute 'rock solid', 'ironclad' commitment that he gave to the Australian people on his Medicare safety net undertaking. The Leader of the Opposition stands up and speaks of integrity, but 'rock solid, ironclad, absolute commitment' were his words on the eve of the 2004 election when he said he would not touch the Medicare safety net, would not touch the thresholds, and then four months later upped the thresholds both for low-income earners and for middle-income earners.Can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he raises and continues to raise questions of integrity and commitment here, one by one we will go through what happened under his period as health minister, one by one we will go through his record in terms of the Medicare safety net - that rock solid, ironclad commitment that he gave to the Australian people - and, beyond that, we will look very carefully at what the Leader of the Opposition had to say as he sought to weasel his way out of the fact that he ripped $1 billion out of Australia's public hospital system. The Leader of the Opposition was health minister for four years and what he came out and said was, 'Oh, it wasn't me; in fact, it is just that the increase in expenditure on health slowed a little bit.' I can say to the Leader of the Opposition that we are going to peel back those numbers day by day and look at precisely what he did in the period 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007 - the period when he was health minister - so proud he is of his achievements in this respect.We welcome a debate on the record of his achievement in health against the record of achievement of this government in health. We welcome a debate on the record of this government in education against the record of those opposite on education. Every time the Leader of the Opposition opens his mouth, 'Absolute, rock solid ironclad commitments,' we will be listening very carefully to the integrity of his words, as we watched with great disappointment the honouring of those commitments by him in the past.</DOC>

 - I thank my good friend and neighbour, the member for Forde, for his continuing interest in small business through the Logan Country Chamber of Commerce and the Logan Chamber of Commerce, which we share, and also the Beenleigh Yatala Chamber of Commerce.The government's economic stimulus plan is supporting small businesses and tradies right now right around the nation. They are engaged in no fewer than 34,000 construction projects across Australia - 34,000 construction projects supporting our tradies and small businesses. Indeed, 70 per cent of the stimulus spending has been on nation-building infrastructure, including the biggest school modernisation program in Australia's history. The Australian public think it is great. Wouldn't you think that the opposition would think that it is really good that we are supporting small businesses and our tradies? But just on the anniversary of the stimulus package being announced in parliament the other day, what did the opposition leader have to say? He said:It was not the stimulus package or the spending that saved Australia; it was the reforms that saved Australia - reforms that this government cannot contemplate and in fact are winding back.To what is he referring? Work Choices, of course - the great reform of the Leader of the Opposition and his cohorts on the front bench, who he has promoted to the front bench. 'Of course,' he says, 'only the name Work Choices is dead' - you know, like the parrot: 'It's not dead; just pining for the fjords.' Of course, Work Choices would come back under the Leader of the Opposition if he ever were to become Prime Minister.He went on to describe the spending on schools that everyone is fond of as 'very low-grade spending'. Who is engaged in building these infrastructure projects that the opposition leader continues to oppose to this day? Of course, it is our tradies and the small businesses who supply them. The opposition voted against - and to this day continues to oppose - that spending and support for small business. We can conclude from that that the opposition leader, with his extreme views, is a big risk to Australia.I can illustrate that further because yesterday the opposition leader floated a policy of six months paid parental leave. When looking for the source of funding for this - and I believe he referred to the book on the Alan Jones program this morning - he referred back to his book where he developed this policy and said: 'It could be funded through a small general levy on business. Small business would instinctively regard any extra cost from the levy as unfair.' You bet your sweet bippy they would regard it as unfair.We are talking about sources of funding and integrity. When the shadow finance minister was asked on Lateline just last week how he would fund the coalition's $10 billion climate change con job, he referred to the tax system and said, 'That is the whole mechanism of where we get the money from.' The whole mechanism is the tax system. That would be true to form. Why? Because the coalition holds the record as the biggest taxing government in Australia's history, as confirmed by the budget papers. Small businesses would be in the firing line from either the levy or the taxes that Sir Barnaby Bjelke-Petersen has described as the source for this extra revenue to fund the parental leave scheme and also -  - I am happy to withdraw, Mr Speaker. Senator Joyce is sounding more and more like Sir Joh Bjelke-Peterson every day but without Sir Joh's coherence or mathematical prowess. Yesterday's unfunded six month paid parental scheme is just another example of phony Tony's funny money scheme. -  - I will, Mr Speaker. Senator Joyce and the opposition leader are a big risk to the Australian economy. I can just envisage the job application of Senator Joyce when he went to the opposition leader and said, 'I'd really like to be shadow finance minister.' It would have gone along these lines, 'You may be right, I might be crazy but it just may be a lunatic you're looking for.' - Nearly. - That is wonderful Italian, Mr Speaker. Under the Rudd government Australians can be optimistic about Australia's future because we are building a stronger economy for working families and the small businesses of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for all the elements of the question. I also want to acknowledge in the House that the member for Kennedy is someone who says the identical thing in his electorate as he says in here. That is not replicated by every regional member in his place, and can easily be contrasted with Senator Barnaby Joyce, who reckons he does not like overseas investment when he is talking to farmers but is quite happy to fly around in Clive Palmer's private jet, backed with Chinese currency. - The question goes to two issues: firstly, the northern task force and the prospects for increased agriculture in the north of the country and, secondly, an application for exceptional circumstances in the gulf area of Queensland, in particular in the member's seat. If I could deal with the northern task force issues first. I am reminded very much of a conversation I had in the north of Australia but on the other side of the country at Kilto Station, where I remarked to a farmer that I had been advised that one of the problems with agriculture in the north is that there are a hundred things you can grow but a thousand things that will eat it all - that is, in terms of the biosecurity challenges. He quipped straightaway with, 'But one of those things is people.' It is true that we need to look very seriously at opportunities for improved agriculture in the north of Australia. We were reminded of this at community cabinet in Townsville where we met with a delegation with particular proposals for the Gilbert River - proposals the farmers involved made clear are very much ready to go.There are some conclusions which have been drawn out of the commentary that has followed from the report of the northern task force to which the government do not subscribe. Some of the commentary has claimed that the government would never contemplate dams and weirs, or that some line is drawn where they would never be considered. This is not true. Where they are appropriate and where they are sustainable, the federal government does not in any way rule those things out. However, some expectations for that report were probably built higher than they should have been. The concept that all of the agriculture in the Murray-Darling Basin was going to be transplanted to the north was never going to happen, but it is true that there are significant new opportunities in the north and a lot more can be done there than is currently being done.I refer to the mosaic form of agriculture and in particular what can be done for the beef industry in the north. At the moment, one of the reasons we are reliant exclusively on the live export industry is that we are not able to get cattle to finishing. There are significant opportunities to get cattle to finishing in terms of limited irrigation in the mosaic way. Those sorts of opportunities are contemplated in the northern task force report and supported strongly by the producers involved, including Terry Underwood, whose property I visited in the Northern Territory. Those opportunities are real, and as the government works through that report we have a very clear view that a lot more is possible in the north than we have been doing in the past. That is something that the member for Kennedy has long advocated.He has also advocated that not only should we be very mindful of the fires which happened in the south of our nation last year but also we should be mindful of the massive flood which occurred in the north of our country last year. In that context, an application was made for exceptional circumstances. Members would be aware that exceptional circumstances in the ordinary case deal with drought, and the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements deal with the immediate impact of flood. When I visited those floodwaters with the member for Kennedy - and, from memory, we went to Cloncurry and Normanton - it was made clear at the time that this was not a usual flood. Normally after a flood the pastures kick back and kick back pretty strongly. On this occasion, the water had remained over these pastures for more than eight weeks and that meant that the pasture underneath died completely. - The seed had gone, yes. And that means that the weeds get an advantage, but other than weeds there is not a whole lot growing in the immediate event after a flood like that. The EC application was therefore assessed not on the basis of there having been a flood but on the basis of the impact of the long-term inundation. That meant, just as the farmers predicted that day, that if you came back in a few months time it would not look like the aftermath of a flood but the aftermath of a long-term drought. That is exactly what those producers have been seeing - in addition to the loss of in excess of 100,000 head of cattle.With all of that, we did what we always do and referred it to NRAC, the National Rural Advisory Council. They came back with their recommendations. I am glad the member asked the question today and not yesterday because this morning the government accepted the advice of NRAC and EC will be provided for that area.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question. The responsible economic approach to reducing carbon pollution is to use the most efficient and cost-effective abatement method and certainly not the costly, pick winners approach that the Leader of the Opposition has enunciated. There is no doubt that an emissions trading scheme represents the most economically responsible approach. It has been supported by all eminent economists.Emissions trading and the market mechanism that it involves ensure that the cheapest methods to reduce carbon pollution will be the first to be applied. Many Liberals, including of course John Howard, the former Prime Minister, and the member for Wentworth, the former Leader of the Opposition, agree with this proposition. Indeed, so too on the record does the shadow minister, the member for Flinders, who has very cogently argued this position on previous occasions. As the Prime Minister adverted to in a previous question time, I think, in a 1990 university paper - it may have been his thesis, in fact - which was titled, interestingly, A tax to make the polluter pay, the member for Flinders had this to say:_ the market is the preferable regime as it better ensures that the polluter bears full responsibility for the cost of his or her conduct.Good advice for the new Leader of the Opposition. In more recent times, the member for Flinders has gone further on the issue of emissions trading. Indeed, in a September 2008 address to none other than the New Zealand National Party, and also on subsequent occasions, the member for Flinders had this to say:As the Coalition has long argued, Australia must introduce an emissions trading scheme.That is the shadow minister's position. He is also on the record as respecting the climate science and the need for emissions trading as I have adverted to. It is almost enough to make one feel a bit for him. He is now surrounded by climate change sceptics, he is taking economic instructions from Senator Joyce and he is putting his name to an economically irresponsible and environmentally unworkable coalition policy. He is putting a brave face on it, as he did at the National Press Club today, but I tell you what - it is compromising him deeply.The coalition policy will not work. We already know that emissions will rise by up to 13 per cent over year 2000 levels under their plan. Their policy relies on costly subsidies for favoured projects. Yesterday I pointed to the analysis by Bloomberg that the abatement cost will be in the order of $64 per tonne. The Department of Climate Change analysis also suggests the carbon abatement cost per tonne will be in excess of $50. The Leader of the Opposition claimed it would be $15, I think, when launching the policy. It is completely uncosted and irresponsible economically, with a large burden on the economy. There is no obligation on large emitters of carbon pollution to reduce their emissions. Their proposal is going to put up prices. There is no compensation for pensioners and households. It is a totally economically and environmentally irresponsible position to adopt and it is already creating uncertainty for investment in the energy market because everyone knows a carbon price is coming and that it must be fixed by a market efficient method.The truth is that many on the other side still agree with the government's position. It is to be remembered that only 10 weeks ago a majority of the coalition party room supported emissions trading and supported the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The fact of the matter is that they remain deeply divided over this issue. I noticed in parliament the other day, when the member for Wentworth was giving his address on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation, the member for North Sydney came in to offer support. You should have offered your support when it really counted, when the national interest was at stake, and not been seduced by the media and by the urgers in your own party to be the third man and come last in the race. The important thing is to support economically responsible policy, but all of you, if you oppose the CPRS when it goes to the vote tomorrow, will fail that test.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can confirm receipt of that letter, and I can confirm the actions that attended to it and that I have just detailed at some length in a statement to the House - and the honourable member was there and he heard that statement. I can further say to the honourable member that, on 3 November, Master Electricians Australia wrote to me specifically commending me on my changes to the home ceiling insulation program. They said:The banning of metal fasteners, mandatory down light covers and the requirement for installers to undertake further training on the electrical risks of installing insulation was immediate, proportionate and is very likely to have saved lives _We acted on the basis of the advice that was in front of us in a way which was consistent with our commitment to safety, and we will continue to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. It is important that we respond to the climate change challenge in a way that sets up our economy for the future and protects our environment for the future. It is important that we note this particularly today when we had the member for Wentworth vote with the government, consistent with his stated principles about the best way of dealing with the challenge of climate change. This stands in stark contrast with those opposite, who articulated those same principles only two months ago but departed from them in today's votes in the House.The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is an emissions trading scheme which seeks to do the following: put a cap on carbon pollution, do so by charging Australia's biggest polluters, and use that money to provide compensation for working families so that they in turn can use that money to assist in making their homes more energy efficient. It is a totally costed, totally funded scheme. It makes the big polluters pay for their pollution, it uses the money raised to deal with the increase in the cost of living for consumers, and it is upfront about that. Every cent we raise from polluters will be put back into helping families and businesses adjust. On top of that, 92 per cent of households would be provided with assistance. Only the wealthiest households would miss out.That is our approach. That is the government's clearly articulated position. The other system - if you can call it a system - is the climate change con offered by those opposite. The climate change con put forward by the Leader of the Opposition does less, costs more and is totally unfunded. Firstly, it does less in the sense that it will result in a 13 per cent increase in greenhouse gas emissions. That is the calculation undertaken by the relevant authorities. Secondly, it costs more. It will cost the taxpayer three times more. Further, given that it is totally unfunded, that extra cost to the taxpayer will be met either by increasing taxes or by reducing government services, and those opposite have refused to rule out either.That is before you take into account the other design feature - if you can call it that - of their proposal, the climate change con, which is a hidden penalties regime whereby firms are fined, with penalties, if they go beyond what is called 'business as usual'. There is no definition about how many companies would be caught up in the secret penalties regime and no compensation for the flow-through impact which that would have on prices for consumers. We provide compensation; they provide not a single dollar of compensation.This is all completely understandable because, as the member for Wentworth said on a previous occasion, the proposal being put forward by those opposite is simply a fig leaf to disguise the fact that nothing substantial is being done. That is what it is about; it is a fig leaf and we understand why: because, in the immortal words of the Leader of the Opposition, climate change is 'absolute crap'. Therefore, that is what we have before us: the climate change con of those opposite.Since the opposition has released its approach, its climate change con, we have had further developments in terms of what others think about the scheme. The original supporters of the scheme - or those drawn upon by the Leader of the Opposition to provide detailed advice on how to construct the scheme - Frontier Economics, have walked away from the scheme at a million miles an hour. They said: 'We've never said anything about whether that scheme is more cost effective than the CPRS. It has been a very limited review in this case.' The very interesting observation is this: they say: 'I don't think it is sustainable in the long term. It is more of a short- to medium-term stopgap measure.'The BCA says that the only approach for the future is a market based approach, but what we found really interesting was the contribution from 'Professor' Hunt of Flinders at the National Press Club yesterday - he who in his university thesis said the only approach for the future on climate change is a market based approach. Yesterday he got pushed on the question of whether this would be their permanent approach or whether it could possibly change in the future. The question asked of him was:Does that mean you would consider a carbon price or a carbon market in that review, that would be on the table?What the member for Flinders then goes on to say is, 'Well, out there in the future, we would consider a market based system as a possible future arrangement.' But it gets better, because the Leader of the Opposition has been asked about this as well. He was asked the other day:Is the direct action plan - that is, his climate change con - a package of interim measures until you get into something else later?The Leader of the Opposition responds:I wouldn't ever say that it was the be all and end all. I would never say that, I'm not that full of myself..So says the Leader of the Opposition. He later says that, as far as his direct action plan is concerned, it is a plan for the foreseeable future and that they would go on and have a review in 2015 which would take into account various factors.So, out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition and out of the mouth of the shadow minister for the environment, we have them saying that this plan of theirs is a short-term, stopgap plan. It is an interim arrangement. They leave open the possibility not only of its review but of moving to a market based system. Therefore, based on the words of the Leader of the Opposition, in five years time they would review whether an ETS was desirable and, if it was okay at that time, they would then embrace it. Having just spent the last two months telling us that it is 'this great big tax', now they say that in five years time they might embrace this great big tax. Where is the consistency in that? They are seeking to negotiate one event alone and that is the upcoming election.I say to those opposite that what the Australian people expect on climate change are people who are fair dinkum about it, who have a clear approach and one that works. What we have seen from those opposite is not only one that does less, costs more and is totally unfunded but one which they have a little insurance policy tucked in the closet for - going to an ETS after the next election were they to form the next government of Australia. That is what was said out of the shadow minister's mouth and out of the Leader of the Opposition's mouth. Those opposite do not wish to be upfront and fair dinkum with the Australian people. This government will be.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In relation to the series of negotiations and consultations that were undertaken by this department, my requirement was that the department was mindful of all relevant issues in relation to the delivery of the home installation program, including issues that related to electrical safety and that the views of organisations in relation to those matters ought to be taken into account as we continued to develop our training program. And that is what we did.</DOC>

 - I am sure that all honourable members would welcome the fact that today Australia's unemployment rate fell to 5.3 per cent. This is good news for Australian working families and good news for all Australians interested in the protection of Australian jobs. The government's objective is to keep the Australian economy strong by protecting jobs and supporting working families. It is an important fact that, since August 2009, 194,600 jobs have been created in Australia. This is a good number for the entire economy, for the nation and for all families concerned about the security of their jobs. That is why Australia has been doing so much better than most other economies around the world. The protection of jobs is a big challenge for governments everywhere, but we have seen in the last period of time nearly seven million jobs lost in the United States, nearly half a million lost in the UK, 136,000 jobs lost in Germany, 270,000 lost in Canada and a million lost in Japan. By contrast, Australia has gained nearly 200,000 jobs over the last year. That is where we have stood as the direct product of the economic policy of the government in partnership with the Australian private sector, which has had their sleeves rolled up out there providing real project opportunities in the field.The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that it was not worth keeping Australia out of recession. He said the following on radio:_ it's all very well saying oh, yeah, but we've kept Australia out of recession. Well, fine, but did you really have to waste money to do so?The lesson of the Great Depression, the lesson of the eighties and the lesson of the nineties is that, when the private sector is under stress, when it is in retreat, the role of government is to step up to the plate to keep the economy working, to keep the wheels of the economy turning, so that there is activity to generate opportunities and small business, to ensure that firms are still taking on apprentices and to keep everything out there as active as we possibly can. The Leader of the Opposition has added to his remarks on this today. He said:_ there are other countries which have chosen a different path and there's no evidence that their response has been any less effective than ours. For instance, in New Zealand _Let us have a little look at the numbers on New Zealand. The New Zealand economy has contracted for five consecutive quarters. This is the longest recession New Zealand has had since their quarterly series began in 1987 - that is, 23 years ago. The New Zealand economy has shrunk 2.9 per cent since the end of 2007; the Australian economy has grown by 2.6 per cent since the end of 2007. That is a difference of 5.3 per cent. This is the model to which the Leader of the Opposition draws our attention. He says they have done it better. That is his definition of better: much higher unemployment. Let us have a look at what that would mean for Australia. New Zealand's unemployment rate has risen from 4.3 per cent in September 2008 to 7.3 per cent in December 2009. Our unemployment rate was 4.3 per cent in September 2008 and has risen by three times less.If Australia's growth had been the same as New Zealand's during the global recession, we would have had five quarters of negative growth and we would have an additional 230,000 people out of work. That is the model advocated to us on national radio today by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of Opposition has made a quick grab for some example or analogy - some way to get out of a difficult question in an interview - and has picked on a country like New Zealand and has said that is the way we should go. We know there is a conservative government in New Zealand. I suppose that is the first instinct for his response.He said that they have done just as well as we have at less cost. But 230,000 people would have lost their jobs by pursuing that benchmark for analysis. No wonder people are concluding that the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister represent a risk to Australian jobs - because they do. It goes to the hard question of the future of policy. They say we should withdraw the stimulus. If we withdrew the stimulus for 2010-11, with the biggest infrastructure program in the country's history rolling through our schools, it would detract 2½ percentage points from growth, and that would be 200,000 jobs down the gurgler.That is what they are advocating. They are not just advocating New Zealand as an alternative model, not just 230,000 jobs down the gurgler; they are actively now suggesting a new course of action for the future: cancel the stimulus package and on top of that put at risk 200,000 Australian jobs. It is no wonder people have decided that those opposite represent a capital-'R' risk. The Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and, most importantly, the shadow finance minister represent the worst economic frontbench team that the Liberal-National Party has put forward in their history.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I refer the honourable member to the answer that I gave to the question when it was asked previously in this House, and also to the statement I gave this afternoon. That statement makes it perfectly clear that, upon notice being given to me of the likely dangers posed in ceiling insulation as a consequence of the use of metal fasteners, I acted in an immediate and direct way. Having made that statement clearly here in the parliament, I refer the honourable member to it, and I conclude by saying that, when the issue of foil insulation in ceilings was directly raised with me as a minister in consideration of the safe delivery of this program, I took the necessary steps, including the banning of metal fasteners and, subsequent to that, the suspension of the program as a consequence of the advice I had received.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. It is important to ensure accuracy in public debate regarding fiscal policy and government programs. As members may recall, I have made a number of critical comments in recent days with respect to some contributions by my opposite number, Senator Barnaby Joyce, with respect to some of the claims he has made in public debate about fiscal policy and government programs - for example, his suggestion a couple of days ago that it was possible that Australia might default on its debts. Therefore, I was delighted to wake up this morning and see in today's Australian that the Leader of the Opposition had intervened in the cause of accuracy in public debate on fiscal policy and government programs.According to the Australian this morning, he and Senator Minchin payed Senator Joyce a 'friendly visit' a couple of nights ago - the kind of friendly visit that is usually associated with violin cases, roses and things like that. As a result of this friendly visit, Senator Joyce told the Australian:'Tony told me there was a campaign directed against me _ 'and:'It was friendly,' Senator Joyce said. 'He said I needed to be aware there is a campaign directed against me.'He is pretty quick on the uptake, the old Senator Joyce! That, at least, I would consider a good start, because, in situations like this, the first step is acknowledging you have a problem. The next step may be somewhat more difficult, because he will have to work out why this campaign is happening. 
14:21:57 I was encouraged by this report and I foolishly commented to one of my staff, 'Perhaps today would be a gaffe-free day for Senator Joyce'. A few hours went by and I was looking good. But, sadly, I proved to be wrong, because on the doors Senator Joyce alleged that the government's solar panels program had blown out to the tune of $850 billion. Once again, he has got his trillions and his millions and his billions mixed up. Anyone can make a slip of the tongue but, unfortunately, this is becoming a habit with Senator Joyce, and this is a very serious issue.As the Treasurer and I know only too well, the accuracy and the responsibility of statements that are made by the nation's treasurer and finance minister are critical. They can influence market behaviour. They can influence investor decisions. They can influence the confidence of other nations and the confidence of international investors in the Australian economy. All that ultimately flows through into two things: jobs and economic activity in the Australian economy.If we were to have a shambolic, incoherent, undisciplined finance minister like Senator Joyce, that would put at risk the Australian economy and Australian jobs. The Leader of the Opposition's appointment of Senator Joyce, his continued support for him and allowing him to be the de facto No.1 economic spokesman for the coalition shows why he is a risk to the Australian economy, why he is a risk to Australian jobs and why he is not worthy of the trust of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I refer him to the statement that I made in the House earlier today. I amplify that statement by pointing out the process that I went through in order to determine the appropriate level of training for the installation of insulation. Up until such time as this program began to be rolled out through Australia and installers started installing insulation, there was no nationally accredited training module at all.I have introduced that but I have done it in the proper way. I have done it with full consultation with the relevant state bodies and the training organisations, and I have brought forward a module for training on the basis of the advice that I have received from my department that it meets the goals that the government has for risks and the appropriate level of training. I have always said about this program that insulating over a million homes is a significant exercise by any measure - and that is what this government has done - and that if there additional issues that required addressing over time then I would address them. Regarding the nationally accredited training model that was brought forward for the first time by this government, significant additional advice to me showed that the potential for an additional level of training ought to be contemplated by me. I took that advice and I brought it to bear.I conclude on one other matter in reference to the question previously asked of me by the honourable member. I am pleased to note the media release from NECA today welcoming the safety inspections and the 'announcement by Minister Garrett to immediately conduct' those inspections:It is pleasing that Minister Garrett has now acted on our advice and households will be able to engage a licensed electrician to conduct a safety inspection, and, where required, rectify any identified faults.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. I think today's employment figures are a tribute to the resilience of the Australian economy and to the hard work that employers and employees have done in extremely difficult circumstances over the past 12 months. They really are something special because, in the circumstances in which this country has found itself in over the last 12 months, to have created over 180,000 jobs is something very special. What it says a lot about is the impact of the stimulus. It says a lot about the resilience of our employers and the hard work of our employees. What we particularly celebrate about these figures today is the thought that 52,700 Australians have told their families in January that they got a job. Nothing is more important to somebody's security than the certainty of their employment and the knowledge that they have a pay packet.What has driven this government, particularly from the beginning of this global recession, has been jobs. It has been at the centre of everything that we have done in the economy. What it has meant is that when employment in other countries such as United States, such as Canada and many other countries was going backwards at a rate of knots, here we achieved such a special outcome for our country. - It just shows you what little priority those opposite give to jobs. Those sorts of interjections just demonstrate the fundamental misjudgments and misrepresentations that are coming from those opposite, particularly when it comes to economic policy. That comment just demonstrates how wrong the Liberal Party got its response to this global recession by because, if it had not been for the stimulus that was put in place, this country would be in recession. Instead of growing by 0.6 per cent in the year through to September we would have gone backwards by two per cent and we would be standing here today talking about far higher unemployment.But, of course, those opposite have so misunderstood the economy, so misunderstood the global economy, that they are a threat to future employment and investment in this country. As the Prime Minister said before, we had the Leader of the Opposition out saying on radio that saving jobs was a waste of money. Well, go and tell that to all of the Australians who are in jobs as a result of the stimulus. Go and tell that to all of the small businesses whose stores are still open as a result of the stimulus. But of course those opposite are masters of misrepresentation and masters of misjudgment, and no misjudgment is more fundamental than the misjudgment that the Leader of the Opposition made when he appointed Barnaby Joyce to the role of shadow finance spokesman. This was summed up in an article in the Courier Mail on 8 February by Tim Hughes, who writes a regular economic column. I do not think he is normally a friend to the government, but this is what he had to say:What does it say about Abbott when he puts Joyce into the second-most unsuited portfolio for him? _ To me it suggests that Abbott thinks the economy is a joke. Either that or he simply does not understand the serious responsibilities of government.He went on to say:Abbott made the appointment and, in so doing, has effectively disqualified himself from running our economy. Australia's long-term future depends on a strong rate of investment and much of the funding for that investment comes from offshore.That brings me back to Mr Joyce, because Mr Joyce has been out there campaigning against foreign investment - campaigning against the arrangements the government has put in place to make sure that we protect the national interests of this country through the Foreign Investment Review Board. It is a fact that one in four jobs in mining in regional Australia depend on foreign investment, and Mr Joyce has been campaigning right around this country against that foreign investment. But, of course, he let the cat out of the bag at the Press Club earlier this week, when he admitted that he had been flying around the country with Clive Palmer, the biggest recipient of the foreign investment in this country that is creating jobs. What that says is that Mr Joyce has one standard when he is in the front bar of the pub in Roma or somewhere like that and entirely another when he is in the plane with Clive Palmer at 30,000 feet, sipping a scotch. What that shows is just how short-term - how opportunistic - these people are. There is not a principle that they adhere to, and that is why they are such a massive risk to our economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As he knows, in the statement that I brought forward to the House prior to question time these matters were canvassed in some detail. I will add to that statement by saying the following. The requirements for the safe installation of insulation were always a key component of the rollout of this program. They are a component that exists within state regulations as well. They are a component that exists within occupational health and safety requirements, which are compulsory under the Home Insulation Program.It is also the case that, of the range of issues that were identified, safety issues and otherwise, in the early processes of consultation with my department and relevant authorities, all of those matters were taken into account and a training module brought forward which would deal with it satisfactorily. Additionally, in relation to the matter concerning foil insulation, I repeat what I said in my statement to the House and I add that it was only as a consequence of my decision to ban metal fasteners that the necessary step was taken to ensure that, where installers breached the existing guidelines under the program, they would not in any way, by virtue of their negligence, be able to place any householders at risk.The honourable member brings the question to me about the current state of households and ceiling insulation and safety. I make the point to him that the decision I took to have a 10 per cent sample audit of ceilings with foil insulation in Queensland was as a consequence of the issues that had been raised and that that particular audit process, in its preliminary stages, has identified additional risks in ceilings that are not a consequence of the Home Insulation Program. It is the case that this particular issue, identified by me, was dealt with by me at the time on the advice that I had from my department and put the necessary safety measures in place for the rollout of the program.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I know that in his electorate he knows what it is like to see families struggle with unemployment and why he therefore would have been particularly welcoming of today's news that unemployment has fallen by 0.2 per cent to 5.3 per cent in January. I have to say that I think it is quite remarkable that, when the Prime Minister first mentioned this figure in question time today, on this side of the House we saw welcoming and enthusiasm for that result. On the other side of the House we saw a stony-faced silence, because the opposition would have preferred it had the numbers been worse.What these unemployment results are telling us is that the number of people employed in January increased by 52,700 to 10.966 million, and that is the largest increase in employment since December 2006. For the third consecutive month the Australian Bureau of Statistics has reported the number of people unemployed has decreased, down 22,300 persons to 612,000 in January. We should remind ourselves that, if we compare this unemployment result with the start of the global financial crisis, we can see that 124,500 Australians more are unemployed today than at the start of the global financial crisis. So there are Australians we want to support through economic stimulus and through the economy to get the benefits of work. It is also crystal clear that, if not for economic stimulus, unemployment would have been 1½ percentage points higher and we would have seen more than 200,000 extra Australians out of work.If we compare where our Australian economy is with results overseas as economies around the world show the impact of the global financial crisis, we know that in the US, four million jobs were lost; in Japan, 1.3 million jobs; in the UK, more than 400,000 jobs; in France, more than 300,000 jobs; in Italy, more than 300,000 jobs; and the list goes on. Consequently, when we look at the situation in Australia, we can see economic stimulus at work - the economic stimulus that we have provided through our nation building programs including the Building the Education Revolution program. Let us hear this in the words of people who employ others and who know what is happening out on the ground. Joe Cachia, the managing director of Piruse Constructions, saidWithout the stimulus money, the building industry is dead. In the next two or three months it will generate a lot more work. I've no doubt about that.David Rees, the Australian head of research for Jones Lang LaSalle said:The federal government stimulus package, particularly the fiscal stimulus directed towards schools, is filling the hole left by private investment.Steve Marais, the director of Condev Construction said:As a growing company we have a large database of tradespeople who will benefit from the roll-out of the contracts.We know that if the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Barnaby Joyce had been in the cabinet room when the global financial crisis hit, there would have been no economic stimulus, no employer would have uttered these words and we would have seen the Australian economy go into recession with more than 200,000 more Australians out of work.Even in opposition, not having learnt that lesson, the Leader of the Opposition is threatening these vital stimulus projects even today. In doing so, he is threatening the biggest school modernisation program the nation has ever seen, but he is also threatening the jobs of working Australians who are delivering that economic stimulus. It just goes to show that for the Leader of the Opposition economics might be boring, but it is vital to working families who depend on the economy and the government's management of it for work.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. He is someone with a keen interest in and knowledge of the issues to do with closing the gap in life expectancy for Indigenous Australians. This afternoon the Prime Minister delivered the second report, Closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage. It was a very important occasion - a milestone in establishing where we are now and laying down markers for the future. As the Prime Minister made very clear, we are not standing still.Despite the comments from the Leader of the Opposition in his contribution, we are taking action. This is demonstrated by the 57 per cent increase in funding for Indigenous health since the Rudd government came to office. Australian governments have committed $1.6 billion through COAG towards closing the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. As part of that package, $805.5 million - the Commonwealth contribution - is to address chronic disease within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.I just want to make this observation; it is very important that it is understood. Chronic disease - such things as type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease and lung cancer - accounts for two-thirds of premature deaths amongst Indigenous Australians. The Indigenous Chronic Disease Package will improve the prevention, early detection and ongoing management of these diseases.In addition, through the COAG early childhood development agreement, the government is committed, as the Prime Minister reminded us this afternoon, to halving the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five within a decade. As the Prime Minister reminded us, Indigenous kids are twice as likely to die before the age of five as other Australian children. That, of course, is a tragedy - one I am only too well aware of because of the large Indigenous population in my electorate. I know the member for Leichhardt is aware of this detail from his work in his electorate. A significant contributor to this appalling situation is the prevalence of underweight babies, who are at greater risk of dying during the first year of life and are prone to ill health in childhood. It is our responsibility to support Indigenous babies and their mothers and ensure that they have the best possible care throughout the pregnancy and the first crucial years of life.Along with Minister Macklin, this morning I visited the Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service here in Canberra, where we were able to announce the funding of 10 new mothers and babies services across the country under the New Directions program. As the Prime Minister said in his Close the Gap speech, under the $90.3 million mothers and babies services program a total of 11,000 mothers and babies will be supported over five years with services including improved antenatal and postnatal care, advice on nutrition and health checks. This adds to the 43 Indigenous child and maternity services already in place.It is very, very important that we understand that, despite the rhetoric that came from the Leader of the Opposition in his response to the Prime Minister's speech, we are deadly serious about addressing issues to do with closing the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Far from just being a matter of words, as it was described by the Leader of the Opposition, we are delivering not on words but on taking action - definitive action which is there for all to see. I say to members of the chamber and, indeed, people who might be listening to this discussion: take a look at the Prime Minister's speech this morning to understand precisely what the government is doing to close the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.</DOC>

I am just responding to the question which has been asked by the Leader of the Opposition. The sequence of any such decision as taken by this government is (1) to obtain the policy design for a program (2) to finance it as appropriate and (3) to adhere to the administrative protocols and arrangements which go with the decision. I also draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the statement made to the House by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts concerning those implementation arrangements, and I would encourage the Leader of the Opposition to study the minister's statement very carefully.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question, because he has very high demands from his constituents on health matters - as does the community in Tasmania, where workforce issues are more challenging than in other parts of the country. We know that one of the problems when the Rudd government was elected was that we inherited an extraordinary legacy, following the Leader of the Opposition's period as the health minister, of workforce shortages that were at crises points. We had nationwide medical workforce shortages stretching across 74 per cent of the country and affecting 60 per cent of the population, capped GP training places at 600 and a nationwide shortage of about 6,000 nurses. These were the good old days that the Leader of the Opposition is pining for.But try telling that to the outer suburban families who could not get into the see a GP because the GP's books were closed or the regional communities who had lost their only doctor in town. Under the Leader of the Opposition the good old days were days where the family GP became an endangered species. But we took immediate action to address this chronic problem. Since 2007 we have been training more GP's than ever before - and, rather than leaving it to chance like the Liberal Party did, we have a plan in place to train the future health workforce in Australia.So, in addition to training over 800 GP's - a 35 per cent increase from the time the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister - we have also increased the number of places for junior doctors to experience working in general practice settings by 10 per cent and we are investing $1.1 billion in clinical training for doctors, nurses and other health professionals. This is the single-biggest investment that an Australian government has ever made in the workforce. More students are going to receive quality clinical training as health professionals, and of course that means over time that Australians, not just in the seat of Lyons in Tasmania but across the country, will find it easier to get the healthcare professionals that they need.Tomorrow I will be meeting with the states' health ministers in a dedicated health ministers conference dealing with workforce issues where I will be asking and encouraging - in fact, requiring - them to sign onto additional commitments in the workforce arena. This of course is in stark contrast to the leader opposite, who basically said the system was not broken. His direct quote was, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. But everybody knows that his response to the lack of access to medical care for families was to cap GP places. His response to 750 public hospitals suffering, after he ripped $1 billion out of the public hospital system, was to pick one winner, the Mersey Hospital in Tasmania, and forget about all the rest. His sneaky spin to explain away a $1 billion funding cut was to call it a 'reduction in the forward estimates'. And his response to one of 650,000 Australians on the public dental waiting list, after his government axed the program, was to lament that he 'did not have a magic wand to solve the problem'. - Exactly! I did wonder whether maybe that magic wand had been found. Of course, the shadow Treasurer is storing it somewhere with his tutu and crown. No doubt the Leader of the Opposition will be able to ask for that magic wand to fix and fund all of those uncosted promises. He might be able to use the magic wand to convince the shadow finance minister what the difference is between a million and a billion dollars! - He might be able to use that magic wand for all sorts of useful purposes in the shadow ministry. - But the serious point here is that the Leader of the Opposition has a legacy: he neglected the health workforce needs of the country. Every member on the other side knows this, because they are the people who write to me everyday about their shortage of doctors. They can thank their leader for that problem. Luckily, we are starting to fix it.</DOC>

 - Both myself and the government have full confidence in the minister for the environment. The reason we have full confidence in the minister is that he has been a first-class minister. I draw the honourable member's attention to the statement which has been made available to the House by the minister and his response to the various matters that have been raised in this debate. I would again ask the Leader of the Opposition, who is notorious for not looking at the detail of things, to actually examine the detail of that before he engages in a wider debate.The Leader of the Opposition's broader question goes to the performance of the minister for the environment. Can I say that why I have said that the minister for the environment has been a first-class minister for the environment is as follows: this minister has been out there engaged in ensuring that Australian working families have assistance with things like solar panels on their roofs to make a real difference in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and energy home prices - 120,000 solar panels have gone out in two years or more. I would contrast that with the 12 years of when those opposite were in power, when they paid a total of 10,500 rebates - 10,500 solar rebates in their 12 years; in the period we have been in office, 120,000 solar panels. Mr Speaker, if you want a clear contrast of the performance of the government versus the opposition on a clear program which aims to assist working families put solar panels on their roofs, that is No. 1.I draw the honourable member's attention to what the minister has done in relation to the National Solar Schools Program as well: 2,400 Australian schools have already been approved and over 850 installations already confirmed. The minister has also been engaged in the proper regulation and dissemination of regulatory material concerning incandescent light bulbs, the proper energy rating of energy appliances and the practical matters which fall within the province of a minister for the environment.What we have learnt so far about the Leader of the Opposition is that the Leader of the Opposition asks a question like this not in order to obtain an answer. The Leader of the Opposition has not bothered to read the full statement which has been provided by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts before question time; the Leader of the Opposition has asked his question because it is Thursday, it is question number 7 and it is time for the censure motion.It does not matter what day of the week it is, we warm up for the censure motion. So we see the forensic attack by the member for Flinders: questions one, two, three, four, five, six; the responses to each of those given in detail by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts; no progress being made; and so we wheel in the Leader of the Opposition to up the ante a bit and add some theatre. I expect the Leader of the Opposition will now move his motion, or whatever he is going to move. Can I say firstly in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question: the minister, in his statement earlier to the House, goes through in detail the issues concerning this particular matter. Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition asked a question about his performance as minister more generally, and I have responded to the minister's performance in general.I conclude this answer where I began: I and the government have full confidence in the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because it allows me to continue to advise the House on those measures and actions that were taken by me and the government in relation to the Home Insulation Program. I can advise the House that the Minter Ellison report and the risk assessment processes that the government undertook at the time produced a set of advices to me in relation to this program and informed the establishment of the guidelines under this program, the nationally accredited training model under this program and a set of additional measures that were delivered to ensure that we had safety, effective delivery and adequate training in relation to this program.I caution the Leader of the Opposition against extrapolating from interim results of audit and risk management to produce in the community an apprehension that each and every ceiling is of an order to be identified as having a specific risk. As the secretary of the department made clear in her statement on Friday and as I have made clear in my statements subsequently, the totality of the advice that has come to me includes the consideration that the department has had not only of Minter Ellison reports but of other material and consultations with stakeholders, industry, training bodies and the like, and they are the matters upon which I took advice and acted in this program.Mr Speaker, I add through you to the Leader of the Opposition that I have additionally announced further details today in relation to both safety inspections and rectification work relating to the termination of the Home Insulation Program. We have said we will expand the:_ targeted, risk based audit and inspection program to 15 per cent of homes with non-foil insulation installed under Home Insulation Program which may have safety risks. This risk based audit will be extended further, if necessary, to any segments of households deemed at risk.That is the commitment that the government has made today. We stand by that commitment and we will deliver the new program, the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme, in that manner.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question, because working families across Australia have a deep interest in the future of the health and hospital system of Australia. Australians have a fundamental interest in making sure that our system is got right for the future. Every year Australians make about 115 million visits to the doctor. Every year the nation's 768 public hospitals deliver some 49 million hospital services to the Australian public. All this is made possible by a dedicated Australian health workforce made up of something like 60,000 doctors, 230,000 nurses and 134,000 allied health professionals. This comes at great cost to the Australian taxpayer. Taxpayers at present pay some $71.2 billion each year to support this public health system of Australia.We have to look, however, at how this system of ours is sustainable into the future. By international standards our health and hospital system performs well, but it is under great pressure. The demand for health services in Australia is rapidly outweighing the supply of those services, and the reasons are pretty plain: firstly, an expanding population; secondly, an ageing population; and, thirdly, of course, great advances in medical technology. I also say to those opposite and to the House at large: the proportion of those over the age of 65 is increasing and is expected to increase around sevenfold, which means that the overall burden on our health and hospital system for the future will be greater indeed.The other point of stress in the system for the future is -  - the ability of the states and territories to fund the system's expansion for the decades ahead. Mr Speaker, those opposite interject about the capacity of the health system to deliver, a health system which has not been able to deliver effectively because the previous government ripped a billion dollars out of the public hospital system. Treasury projects that the total health spending of all states will exceed 100 per cent of their tax revenues, excluding the GST, by around 2045-46 and possibly earlier in a number of states - in fact, as early as in about 20 or so years time. A final point about stress in the system and the ability to fund future needs is this: waste, duplication and overlap. The Bennett report reached conclusions that some 10 to 20 per cent of our total health expenditure at present could currently be being wasted because of the duplications which exist within our system.The government in its two years in office has increased the overall allocation to health and hospitals by some 50 per cent. We have a $1.1 billion investment in training for more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals; a $750 million investment in improving our emergency departments; a half-billion dollar investment in subacute care beds; and nearly a half-billion dollar investment in prevention, expanding the preventative healthcare investment to $872 million. These are the practical measures we have taken so far, given the billion dollars which was ripped out of the system by those who preceded us.The government is also taking significant steps to underpin the future funding needs of the system. That is why in the 2009-10 budget we introduced the vital private health insurance savings measure to make sure that low- and middle-income Australian taxpayers were not subsidising the health insurance of wealthier Australians. This important savings measure is still being blocked by the opposition in the parliament. If not passed it will cost taxpayers almost $2 billion over the forward estimates and much more beyond - billions of dollars which should be being invested in the future needs of our health and hospital system. This is absolutely fundamental to the future funding of the reforms and expansion of the system that we need, a system that is already under considerable stress.That is why the government welcomes a debate on the future of health and hospitals. That is why the government has acted, in its two years on this matter, against the billion dollars ripped out of the health and hospital system by those opposite. I say to those opposite, when they reflect upon their 12 years in office - the freeze they put on the training places for GPs, the billions they ripped out of the health system overall and, on top of that, the shortage of 6,000 nurses across the country - this is a debate that we welcome for the parliament and for the country at large. We have acted in the two years we have been in, and we have much more to do on this one.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The answer to that question is that I received the full Minter Ellison report this year and that is the first occasion that I saw and read that report in its entirety. The second part of his question to me I respond to as follows. In determining a risk assessment mechanism for the rollout of the Home Insulation Program, I understand my department drew on a range of sources and information including the Minter Ellison risk assessment report and began to deliver a risk register as a consequence of that report. The totality of advice that I received, including my department's identification of matters raised not only in that report but in others coming through to me, I have responded to. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: I have responded to it in these terms which were to ensure that we put in place a delivery of the Home Insulation Program that provided for the management of risk to acceptable levels.A number of those matters that have been identified in this report were identified in other engagements that were brought to my attention over time - namely, consultations with stakeholders, views of relevant technical experts and otherwise. The task that I set myself was to determine that the advice that I received was the appropriate advice to act upon. I put in place a series of measures to ensure the rollout of this program taking into account any matters identified by the department and brought forward to me by way of advice. That is what I did in relation to this program. There are a staged series of additional announcements I made on the basis of advice I received to lift issues in relation to safety and subsequently to training. It is a case of managing acceptable risk levels that has always been the determiner for me as minister. That is why I have made every decision up to the decisions I have made in the last week.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his very important question. It is important that we put the health budget on a sustainable footing. The Australia 2050 report highlighted the impact of rapidly rising health costs on the future of the Australian economy. Health costs are projected to increase from 15 per cent of all Commonwealth spending now to something like 26 per cent by 2050. This is an increase in 2049-50 of something like $200 billion from today's spending. This makes health the biggest pressure on our budget, contributing around two-thirds of the total increase in public spending over this time. This reflects ageing pressures, increasing demand for health services and new and more expensive drugs and technologies. The Australia 2050 report identifies the critical need to address the rising cost of our health system.This side of the House is committed to safeguarding the long-term sustainability of the health budget but also making sure that taxpayers' dollars are distributed fairly. Spending on the private health insurance rebate has grown from $2.1 billion in 2000-01 to $4.2 billion last financial year. Real spending per person is projected to increase by more than 50 per cent from 2012-13 to the equivalent of $319 per person in 2022-23. That is the primary reason why the government has announced fair and responsible changes to the private health insurance rebate to better target that rebate to those who need it most. Our changes are designed to have a minimal impact on participation with 99.7 per cent of people expected to maintain their hospital cover according to Treasury analysis.Unfortunately, the opposition shows no sign at all of doing the right thing with this change to the private health insurance rebate. They want a health system where working families subsidise the healthcare costs of the well to do. That is simply unacceptable in the circumstances that I have outlined. We hear all sorts of extreme statements from the shadow Treasurer and from the Leader of the Opposition about how they stand for fiscal responsibility, but they are in there knocking off a saving of $2 billion over four years and $9 billion to 2019-20. Every day the shadow Treasurer huffs and puffs about how responsible he is and says that the opposition stand for responsible economic measures, but the opposition in the Senate just show that he is full of hot air, because there is no fiscal responsibility on that side of the House. If they were interested in providing affordable health care to average Australians and if they were responsible economic managers, they would be backing this very important bill in the Senate, but what they are doing is demonstrating yet again what a risk they are to the Commonwealth budget and the Australian economy. We on this side of the House will get on with the hard work of supporting hardworking Australian families and giving them a fair go.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and point out to the honourable member that, as he well knows, the information that was provided by the secretary of the department on Friday pointed to two components of compliance and risk under this program, one relating to actual risks identified as being significant and the other a range of risk issues including, amongst other things, spaces between the installation of batts, uncompleted paperwork and the like. I again caution the opposition about conflating interim figures on risk assessment to make predictions about the risk levels across the landscape of the Home Insulation Program. The fact is that we have insulated over one million homes under this program, that there has been a risk and compliance strategy in place since the program ran out from 1 July and that that has been delivered as a consequence of advice that we received not only from my department but also from the industry itself, from training bodies and from consultations with stakeholders which have regularly taken place as a consequence of the delivery of this program.The changes we announced on Friday go to the key point that the appropriate and safe management of risk under this program is a responsibility I take seriously and the measures that we have identified for both a register and a continued delivery of insulation into people's homes through the transition to a new program is well articulated and identified. We will work closely with industry and the relevant authorities, particularly state authorities, in relation to that delivery. It will be done in a way which ensures that the delivery of insulation, a product which has been in use in Australian homes for many years and installed safely for many years, can continue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question because I know the member for Lyons and the member for Braddon and many members on this side of the House, and I suspect also the member for Maranoa and perhaps the member for Gippsland, the member for Lyne and the member for New England, would all understand that their constituents on low and middle incomes rely very heavily on the private health insurance rebate and want it to be sustainable for the future. It is important for those low- and middle-income earners in electorates that are not like the North Shore electorates represented by the Leader of the Opposition or the shadow Treasurer that have large numbers of high-income earners who are being subsidised by those on low and middle incomes who indeed need government assistance to ensure that they can keep their private health insurance.The changes that are being debated in the Senate today are designed to make the private health insurance rebate sustainable to ensure that those low- and middle-income Australians are able to continue to have the support that they deserve from the government. But before those opposite get too agitated let me read a statement by the new President of the Business Council of Australia, Mr Graham Bradley. I do not think the Business Council of Australia can be accused of being Labor patsies, but it appears that even the new Business Council of Australia president supports the government's approach. Recently he called on the government 'to secure the future affordability of our health care system' and said that bringing the budget back into surplus would require 'tightening eligibility requirements and means testing' - in other words, exactly the type of measure that is being voted on in the Senate today, tomorrow or whenever the opposition finally decide that they are prepared to let there be a vote.There is another chance for the opposition to show that not only do they support low- and middle-income earners but also they support the views of the Business Council. It is no longer just a question of whether or not they can play the politics of this. Ultimately, millions of low- and middle-income earners across the country want this support, need this support and deserve to be able to have the rebate system sustainable into the future. So it is a question of not just the fiscal credibility that the Treasurer dealt with earlier but also their credibility in the community, telling low- and middle-income earners in electorates across the country that their support is under threat when they will not support these sensible measures that even the Business Council of Australia thinks should be supported.</DOC>

 - I am advised that there are 87 identified risks in relation to fire under this program, but I will go on to say that the announcement that I made today in relation to the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme and this program as it transitions made clear that a number of factors will be taken into account in relation to the assessment process as it pertains to those who are installing insulation under the scheme from June of next year. In relation to the existing program of monitoring, audit and compliance, can I advise the House - as I began to again today - of the decisions that I have taken today in relation to the rollout of an amplified audit, risk and compliance program under the existing audit and compliance measures that the department has in place. We will accelerate and amplify that audit and risk assessment. It will be done initially to capture some 15 per cent of those targeted homes, and it begins, as a matter of course, on top of the existing program of audit compliance that is already underway.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question, and I know that he, as I am and members of the government are, is very concerned about student income support and supporting Australian students to go to university. The Leader of the Opposition is always free with advice to others about things that they should take responsibility for. Well, the Leader of the Opposition himself faces a test this week as to whether or not he will step up to his responsibilities to ensure that legislation passes this parliament which enables us to pay fair student income support to the students who need it the most.I want to make clear to this parliament and to the Leader of the Opposition the consequences he will be personally responsible for if this legislation does not go through the parliament. If this legislation does not go through the parliament then 25,000 students with family incomes between $32,800 and $44,165 per annum will miss out on an increase to the maximum rate of youth allowance. We should be clear about that. That means that the Leader of the Opposition will be personally responsible for a student who lives in a home that earns around $40,000 a year not getting full youth allowance.Then, of course, the Leader of the Opposition, if this legislation does not pass, will be personally responsible for the fact that a student who needs to move to study from a family that earns $60,000 a year - they should be able to receive almost $12,000 in their first year - will get no support unless they take a gap year. Then, on the question of university students, for a family with, perhaps, two students living away from home and a family income of $140,000, if this legislation passes then those students will be able to get rent assistance and the new Student Start-up Scholarship, plus a relocation scholarship. If this legislation is not passed, those students will get nothing. These are the consequences of the conduct of the Liberal Party and what is at stake this week.It amazes me that, at the same time as the Leader of the Opposition is obviously directing his Liberal Party senators to hold up this legislation, I get correspondence from members of the opposition asking me to fix the very problems that they have created. I got correspondence from the member for Gippsland, who asks whether or not we would fix the fact that someone who gets youth allowance has part-time income taken into account when they are calculating youth allowance. He wants that fixed. Well, the legislation that Liberal senators are holding up fixes that very thing. The thing he wants fixed is being held up by his colleagues. Then, of course, he is not alone. I have had correspondence from Senator McGauran, who originally wrote to Centrelink; the correspondence was referred to me. Senator McGauran was complaining about the parental income test for youth allowance being too low. Well, Senator McGauran is right, but all Senator McGauran has to do during the Senate vote is vote on our side of the chamber, and we will be able to get this legislation through.Ultimately this comes down to a test for the Leader of the Opposition, and it is a test this week. The test is whether or not he will stand up for a youth allowance package that is fair or whether he will end up explaining to literally thousands of students in thousands of families why they are not getting the benefits that the government wants to pay to them, a gross unfairness for which he will be responsible.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I remind the honourable member that on a number of occasions, including in radio interviews in relation to this program, I have made very clear to people what the number is in relation to the Home Insulation Program. I do recall an occasion when I was first asked the question in the House on this particular matter and that the opposition made much merry of the fact that I actually quoted the number: 1800 808 571.But can I go further and respond to the honourable member's question by saying -  - I will say that in terms of providing the public with information concerning the Home Insulation Program, it has always been the case that there was a website available for people to access. That website has had the guidelines and requirements under the scheme, and there was also posted clear information to installers under that program about what steps should be taken in relation to any risks or compliance breaches that may take place.The fact is that we take safety seriously in the delivery of ceiling insulation. I have to say that there are a substantial number of credible, well-qualified and honourable ceiling installers who have done their job under this program according to the guidelines. They have placed insulation in people's ceilings which does not pose any additional risks for householders. For the opposition to claim in the parliament that up to a million homes or otherwise are at risk is not an appropriate or responsible way to ask questions of me on this matter.I am very happy to take the questions that the opposition puts to me, but I simply point out to those opposite that the information that was tendered on Friday made clear that some 75 or 76 per cent of households that had been insulated under this program had not shown compliance or risk issues associated with them and, of those that remained, it was some eight per cent where significant risk issues were attached and they would be followed up as a matter of urgency - as they always have been under this program.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his very important question. I think that the evidence the governor gave last Friday was a heartening assessment of the performance of the Australian economy during the global recession.I think when we last sat we were talking about the creation of some 180,000 jobs in this country in extraordinary circumstances, meaning that breadwinners were going to work and businesses were keeping their doors open because of economic stimulus and because of the remarkable resilience of the Australian economy, the capacity of the workforce, the capacity of employers to work together with the government and the economic stimulus to support our economy during a time of great trauma in the global economy. Everyone on this side of the House certainly celebrates that performance. It has been very important to this country.I think that the evidence the governor gave at the committee was heartening. He talked about the strong rebound in the Asia-Pacific but, of course, he did note that there were headwinds elsewhere in the global economy. He made the point that we were still yet to see evidence of a self-sustaining recovery in private demand in the large industrial economies, with growth being driven by the inventory cycle and temporary stimulus. He confirmed, however, that Australia's finances are much healthier than comparable countries. I would just like to quote from the governor:And in terms of fiscal sustainability, Australia's position is, by any measure, very strong indeed.Of course, his remarks follow those of the assistant governor, Philip Lowe, last week, who had this to say about the Australian economy:We have come through the global downturn better than expected and, unlike many other advanced economies, employment has recently grown strongly and the level of investment remains high.So that is encouraging for the country and it is encouraging for all of our citizens.I think it also demonstrates not only that Australia has cause for confidence but that it is important that we do not have public commentary which is talking down our economy. It is very important that we do not get into that position. Of course, the governor had some interesting remarks to make on Friday about recent commentary around spending and interest rates. Many in the House would remember that a week or so ago the governor gave a speech at a conference in Sydney, where on page 1, at the bottom, it said, 'This commentary has got nothing to do with Australia.''Nothing to do with Australia' - you might recall that we had the opposition in here with a map of the globe, and the shadow Treasurer came out with all guns blazing. I think he asked the question to the Prime Minister - I have not had many questions from the shadow Treasurer; I think there has been one since September -  - Sloppy Joe there went out, all guns blazing -  - hurdling the RBA governor in his attempts to talk down the economy! What did the governor say in his evidence about this distortion and misrepresentation from the shadow Treasurer? He said:No particular message was intended for Australia here, as I think was clear in the disclaimer at the front of the paper - which most people who have reported on the paper have overlooked, I notice.There has rarely been a sharper rebuke of a shadow Treasurer than that delivered by the governor at the committee last week: a direct repudiation of those opposite, and another demonstration of why they are so reckless and such a risk to the Australian economy.For our part, we will go on supporting the Australian economy, creating jobs and looking after working people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I recognise his extensive small business experience and his knowledge of the importance of business confidence in creating jobs. Last week we saw a broad improvement in business conditions across almost all sectors. The NAB quarterly business survey found that business confidence strengthened in the December quarter 2009 and now is at its highest level in 15 years. I am sure this is welcomed by members on both sides of the House, because business confidence is so important when it comes to job creation. Getting Australians into work and keeping them in work has been the focus of the government in the light of the global financial crisis and the ongoing international economic instability.Clearly, the government's stimulus package has had a marked effect on business confidence, which has flowed on in terms of jobs. The OECD last week issued another reminder of the importance of the government's stimulus when it comes to the economy. It said that employment in Australia in 2010 will be between 1.4 and 1.9 percentage points higher than what it would have been without the stimulus measures adopted. That is what the OECD says. It is very important that stimulus remains in place, because withdrawing the remaining stimulus would put at risk 100,000 jobs. One hundred thousand jobs will be put at risk by the opposition.I am also asked about risks to the confidence and the stability within the Australian economy. The main risk lies in the trifecta of economic ignorance which makes up the economic team of those opposite - the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance; the trifecta of economic ignorance. We have all grown accustomed to the daily rants of the shadow minister for finance, but I think he has the right to feel aggrieved that his mistakes have received so much attention, because all he has been trying to do is keep up with the boss. We have seen the Leader of the Opposition cite New Zealand as the role model for the Australian economy. We remember that on The 7.30 Report on 6 January he was asked about how the stimulus was necessary and that it had appeared to have done the trick, and he said:But at high price. And if you look across the Tasman, New Zealand has done just as well it seems as Australia without going into anything like the same level of debt and deficit that we have.So they have done just as well as us - with an unemployment rate of 7.3 per cent! Apparently, that is good enough for the Leader of the Opposition.And we have the shadow Treasurer, who has been willing to cite anyone and anything in support of his arguments that stimulus should be withdrawn. Do we remember the famous Gordon Brown speech - the phantom speech invented by the shadow Treasurer, a fabrication by the shadow Treasurer? That then brings us to the fabrication with respect to the Governor of the Reserve Bank's remarks - the verballing of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, as the Treasurer indicated - which was completely repudiated by the Governor of the Reserve Bank. But if that was not enough, last week in Senate estimates, in answering questions from Senator Joyce about the line of argument put by the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance about spending and interest rates, the Secretary to the Treasury said that that was 'a gross oversimplification of economic understanding'. So we have a new year and a new leader, but the same old sloppy Joe. - He is at his most credible when he is wearing a tutu, not when he is quoting others in response to his argument. We have a pattern here - a pattern of a fundamental lack of understanding of the Australian economy. I say through you, Mr Speaker, to the Deputy Prime Minister, that perhaps we need an enhancement to the My School website. Perhaps we need a subject-by-subject breakdown. If we had that, Nambour high school would beat Riverview every time. What we see is three people who have no fundamental understanding of economics and who are a great risk to the economy, because they do not get economics in Australia and they do not get international economics - they do not get economics at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I certainly do acknowledge that, where there has been a tragic loss of life in relation to the potential linkages between this program and a fatality, that is a matter of great concern to me, as it is to everyone in the House. I make the point as well to the Leader of the Opposition that I have made no judgment on the cause of those fatalities, neither should I in my position as minister and, frankly, neither should he in his position as opposition leader. These matters are the subject of inquiry by relevant state safety authorities and, additionally, potentially, by coronial inquiry. It is abuse of the position that we hold - to be able to speak to the nation as a whole - to infer, prior to properly and fully understanding the consequences of any incident, what has or has not caused this matter.It is the case, regrettably, that there have been these fatalities and the association with this program has been identified. I very, very much regret that. In terms of the honourable member asking me about responsibility: I take responsibility for delivering a program that the government designed to achieve the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, for dealing with the challenges of the fiscal stimulus package responding to the global financial crisis, for providing the opportunities for extra employment and for ensuring that the program was delivered in a way which was safe, and that training standards were in place to enable us to do that. At every step of the way I have taken advice from my department as to what appropriate measures should be in place to ensure those goals of risk management. - I will continue to do that. I will continue to exercise my responsibilities diligently as the minister for the environment.</DOC>

I make the point that at no time -  - I make the point that I have always taken into account, during the course of the program, any elements that have come through in terms of risk identification, including those brought forward by my department in briefing, whether they have been identified by Minter Ellison or any other source, and I have always taken advice based on the issues that have been raised.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I would have thought that all members of this place would be concerned about appropriate actions to deal with the threat of terrorism at home and abroad, but it seems that those opposite find this in part a laughing matter; the government does not. On too many occasions my own predecessors in this position have stood in the parliament to mourn the deaths of Australians who have perished as victims of terrorism. As a nation we mourned the murder of 88 innocent Australians in the Bali bombing in 2002. We mourned also those who died in subsequent attacks in New York, in Riyadh, in Jakarta, in London and in Mumbai. These attacks have taken away the lives of far too many innocent Australians and cut down far too many Australians in their prime. Each of these individual stories is a human tragedy for their families and for those who have survived them. Our thoughts are again with them today.The threat of terrorism has not gone away. The threat comes in the main from adherence to the distorted and militant interpretation of Islam that is espoused by groups such as al-Qaeda. Prior to the rise of jihadist terrorism, Australia was not a specific target of terrorist organisations. Now Australia is such a target. That is why, as part of our national security reform agenda, we have placed particular priority on combating terrorism. In a key milestone in that effort today the government is releasing the counterterrorism white paper, Securing Australia: protecting our community. It is the first white paper on counterterrorism to integrate the domestic and the foreign elements of the terrorist threat and the government's response. Increasingly, this becomes a seamless threat.The white paper outlines two key shifts in the terrorist threat to Australia. Firstly, there has been some counterterrorism success in South and South-East Asia, but these have been offset by new areas of concern, such as Somalia and Yemen, where a new generation of terrorists inspired by the message of al-Qaeda are taking root. Secondly - and I would have thought this is of particular significance to this House and the country - Australia now faces an increased terrorist threat from people born or raised in Australia who take inspiration from international Jihadist narratives. The bombings in London in July 2005 brought that starkly home to us. Home-grown terrorism is now a reality in many Western democracies. I note reports in the last two days. The United States Secretary of Homeland Security has commented on the rise of home-grown terrorist threats in the United States of America. It is an increasing feature of the threat landscape in Australia, and it is something of which the nation must take note.The government is committed to concrete action to combat terrorism. No government can guarantee that Australia will be free from the threat of terrorism, but the government can guarantee that we will take all necessary and practical measures to combat the threat of terrorism. I am concerned that those opposite continue to find action against terrorism a laughing matter. There are four key elements to our strategy encapsulated in the words 'analysis', 'protection', 'response' and 'resilience'. -  - The government is committed to concrete action to combat terrorism. We do so in four specific respects - and these are canvassed in the white paper, which I draw to the attention of honourable members - analysis, protection, response and resilience. Analysis of course deals with the question of the operation of our intelligence agencies, which once again the Leader of the Opposition seems to find a laughing matter; we do not. On protection, the government will need to embrace a range of additional measures to deal with the terrorist threat. -  - The government's response to the terrorist threat is encapsulated in four categories: analysis, protection, response and resilience. I was dealing with the question of analysis, which goes to the operation of our intelligence agencies. Protection concerns what we do to enhance, for example, the security domain at our airports and also other specific measures which we referred to earlier today. Response deals with having robust legal frameworks and enforcement agencies to assist in preventing terrorist attacks from taking place or dealing with them in the event that they do. On resilience, Australia's strong and resilient community has a key role to play in arresting the development of violent extremism and terrorism on the home front.Today, with the release of the white paper, the government has committed itself to new measures in this respect. In a major strengthening of our measures in this regard, the government will invest $69 million over four years to introduce biometric checks for visa applications in around 10 countries. Under the new system people applying for a non-electronic visa in these countries will be required to present in person at a visa application centre to lodge their visa application and submit fingerprints and facial images. The government has also decided to establish a new multi-agency Counter-Terrorism Control Centre within ASIO to better coordinate our counterterrorism capabilities on the ground. These commitments today are in addition to the $200 million investment that we have made to strengthen aviation security.As I said before, no government can guarantee that Australia will be free from the terrorist threat, but what we can do is take practical measures in order to reduce the threat, and that is what I have outlined to the House today. Home-grown terrorism is now a reality in Australia we must accept. We are advised by the agencies that home-grown terrorism in Australia is of increasing concern, and that is why we have announced the range of measures contained in today's paper.</DOC>

 - As I indicated in my answers in the House yesterday and as the secretary and other officials indicated when they gave evidence to the Senate committee, I have always received briefings from the department on the basis of risks that have been identified through a range of different sources, including those risks that were identified by Minter Ellison. Whether identified by Minter Ellison or any other source, I have always taken action on the basis of addressing those risks. I have never suggested that I was not aware of the risks in rolling out this program, including those identified by Minter Ellison, industry bodies, state authorities and others. A risk assessment process was underway and it was my responsibility to take advice from the department to determine how those risks, as identified, should be managed. Those processes included roundtables I attended, advice from my office, correspondence, direct discussion with officials and the like. It is important to emphasise that the very purpose of conducting risk assessments is to scope risks, identify challenges and put in place the right mechanisms to respond to them in the program's final design, and that is what I did in this case.</DOC>

 - As the Prime Minister has indicated, today the government has released the counterterrorism white paper. It has been prepared after extensive consultation and a review of contemporary events. For instance, a review of security arrangements in respect of the attempted bombing of the Northwest Airlines flight on 25 December last year shows that quite often information revealing a potential attack is available. The more difficult but critical task is drawing that information together and using it for operational purposes.Accordingly, an essential part of the strategy is establishing, as the Prime Minister has indicated, a counterterrorism control centre, which will be established within the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, to improve coordination across government agencies in counterterrorism intelligence, decision making and operations. This centre will bring together senior officials - experts from Australia's key intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The centre will drive a fully integrated national approach to counterterrorism by identifying specific counterterrorism priorities and developing a stronger fusion of intelligence community and law enforcement community effort. It will collate and analyse data, both from within Australia and overseas, before that information is distributed and applied for operational purposes.As the Prime Minister has also indicated, the white paper outlines the increased threat posed by home-grown terrorism. In that respect it is instructive that since 2001 38 people have been prosecuted as a result of counterterrorism operations and there have been 20 people convicted of terrorism offences under our criminal laws. It is of note and, while some of these cases are still before the courts, it must be stressed that 37 of those 38 were Australian citizens and, of that 37, 20 were born in Australia. The unfortunate reality therefore is that, while, yes, it is only a small minority, violent extremism is active in our community. Successful prosecutions in Melbourne and Sydney demonstrate this only too clearly.Research shows that there is no single pathway to violent extremism. The factors seem to indicate a reaction to overseas events, grievances with local and national issues and even individual circumstances such as poor education and socioeconomic factors. Clearly, there is a lot of valuable work that is already being undertaken right across the country at a state and territory level but countering extremism is a national challenge and requires a national response that focuses upon and develops best practice under an overarching strategic direction.As a starting point the government has identified four key areas of work - that is, identifying and disrupting violent extremists, identifying at-risk groups and individuals and supporting them to resist violent extremism, maintaining the social cohesion and resilience of communities, and using effective communications to challenge violent extremist messages and supporting alternatives. In summary, the counterterrorism white paper shows that the threat of terrorism is regrettably real. It is persistent; it is evolving, but the white paper is a further step in delivering a safer more secure Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Neither I nor my office received the Minter Ellison risk management plan until 11 February 2010 and it was not provided to my office until that time. Neither I nor my office saw the risk register dated 9 April and tabled in the Senate committee yesterday until it was provided to my office yesterday. - I have said previously I am not suggesting for one minute that I was not aware of risks in rolling out this program, including those that were identified to my department by Minter Ellison, by industry bodies, by state agencies or by other experts. From the commencement of this program my office was kept abreast of how the program was developing, the risk assessment processes that were underway and the issues likely to be identified as part of that assessment process right through the design and implementation of the Home Insulation Program. That included not only the material that came through to me by way of advice from the department but also the material and advice that came through as a consequence of roundtables which I attended, advice to my office, correspondence and direct discussions with officials.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. Indeed, in the aviation white paper released last year we indicated that safety and security in aviation must be the government's No. 1 priority. On 9 February the Prime Minister launched a $200 million aviation security package to respond to emerging threats. This is a comprehensive package. It includes improved passenger and baggage screening, improved passenger screening at regional airports and moving to a rational system based on the maximum takeoff weight of an aircraft rather than the previous system which was based upon the propulsion of an aircraft. It also includes improved policing at airports and an increase in the numbers of explosive-detection dogs, improved air cargo security and improved security at airports which are the last port of call.At that time I made it clear that the government would be reintroducing regulations to improve cockpit security when the Senate next met and indeed this afternoon that will occur in the Senate. In September last year regulations to restrict access to the cockpit to persons with an operational, safety, security or training need were disallowed by the Senate with the support of the opposition. These regulations had been introduced in March 2009. They were operating effectively right through to September 2009 until they were disallowed by those in the opposition over in the Senate.Since this disallowance, there have been no effective legal restrictions on who can enter a cockpit. Aviation security experts advise that strict and consistent rules must apply as to who can open the hardened cockpit door and enter the cockpit. This government believes that the same security rules should apply to every flight, not differ from airline to airline and from pilot to pilot. This is too important an issue to rely upon self-regulation. The government will be introducing these regulations and later today in the Senate we will require Senate approval. Because of the timing in which you can reintroduce a disallowed motion, we require the support of the opposition in order to have these regulations introduced.This is a test. Expert advice on security and safety is very clear. There is a very clear choice - you are for it or you are against it. Hardened cockpit doors and restricting access are the last line of defence to stop terrorists from taking control of a plane. The Leader of the Opposition has a choice to make this afternoon in the Senate. The government's counterterrorism white paper makes it clear that the threat is real and therefore the response must be real as well. Of course, there must be some doubt about their response. Today Senator Birmingham said about the government's counterterrorism policy that the greatest threat to safety in Australia is the Home Insulation Program - not terrorism but the Home Insulation Program. This is another example of how those opposite talk first and think later. They do not take these national security issues seriously because they are too busy playing politics.I will say this about the former Prime Minister: John Howard would never have allowed the Liberal Party to make such a ridiculous argument. Unfortunately, this Leader of the Opposition has. I urge the opposition to come to their senses on this matter and support the government in its endeavour to be able to reintroduce regulations so that the national government - which has responsibility for national security - has some control over who enters or leaves a cockpit.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I refer him to the announcement I made yesterday concerning further details of the government's safety inspections and rectification work relating to the terminated Home Insulation Program. I said in the House yesterday that the government is prepared to check as many houses as necessary through this process and that the process of checking will be subject to the necessary scrutiny as has already applied to inspections under the program up to this point. The government will expand its proactive risk based, audited inspection program. It will be expanded to some 15 per cent of homes under the program. Over and above this audit, a hotline will be established for households that are concerned about the safety of their -  - As I said to the House yesterday, there will be an expanded audit and inspection program focusing on households where there are significant concerns about safety risks, including a hotline which will be progressively rolled out from Wednesday. Additionally, where assessments show that there are significant potential risks, an onsite inspection by an accredited inspector will be arranged. Inspections will occur over time in priority order based on risk. The factors that will be taken into account will include the record of the installer, including any audits or inspections previously conducted; the location, age and nature of the home; roof space issues around ceiling fans; and the type and method of insulation installed - as would be the requirements expected under this inspection program. An accredited inspector is enabled to do the inspections under this program and, on that basis, the program of inspections will be rolled out.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for this question. She comes from an electorate which has a very large number of health professionals and has always been interested in making sure that the workforce needs of the country are well met.Of course, since coming to office the Rudd government has been working very busily to clean up the mess left by the previous government and the previous health minister in the workforce area. For example, we have increased the cap that the Leader of the Opposition left on GP training places by 35 per cent, to over 800 places. We have increased the number of junior doctors to experience working in general practice by 10 per cent this year. We have invested in an extra 1,000 nursing places at university. Health Workforce Australia has been established to plan for the future needs and development of the health workforce, backed up by a $1.1 billion investment in clinical training. We have introduced new incentives to rural doctors, and this week I will introduce into parliament legislation which supports the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for 10 health professions, delivering for the first time a single system for states and territories to make sure of something that the previous government, under the Leader of the Opposition, was unable to deliver: that doctors, nurses and allied health professionals are recognised across the country, saving their resources and time and allowing them to move across the country.Contrast our record of action in the last two years with the previous government - the good old days that the former Minister for Health and Ageing, the opposition leader, talks to. He ripped a billion dollars out of our hospitals, as we know. He capped those GP training places. The result was a nationwide workforce shortage stretching across 74 per cent of the country, affecting 60 per cent of the population.What members - certainly on this side of the House - might not know is: as 'closed for business' signs were going up or GPs were telling patients their books were full and they could not be seen, what was the opposition leader's response as the minister? Did he have a grand plan to deal with the medical workforce shortage? You would think that, after four years, he might have had some plan. But I have been able to -  - I have been able to uncover - and the member for Dickson will particularly enjoy this - the centrepiece policy that the Leader of the Opposition introduced to deal with this growing workforce crisis. He went straight to a hole-in-one solution. You might think that that is sort of a strange description, but his solution to the workforce shortage was golf balls. Golf balls might sound like a strange thing to do, but the minister - I have this here with me - produced, in response to the workforce shortages covering 74 per cent of the country, a golf ball - a golf ball which says 'doctor vacancy'. A great help to finding doctors for every regional town across the country that needs a doctor! - Let's encourage them to go and play golf! Obviously, when there was a shortage, encouraging them to go and play golf was going to be a good idea! - This cost $6,000 of taxpayers' money. - It might be difficult to technically meet the relevance requirements of the parliament, because it is difficult to see how a golf ball -  - could solve the medical workforce shortages across the country. -  - But, of course, what we have seen is that the former health minister, as the Leader of the Opposition -  - has now finally teed off with a health policy. This health policy is that there should be some local hospital boards in some hospitals in some states across the country. Obviously this is not a policy that is going to make the cut. I think that my colleagues over here might have to tell the Leader of the Opposition he will be playing minigolf with our children if this is the sort of approach that he is going to take to health policy rather than dealing with the problems that we are fixing - the problems he left us. - </DOC>

In particular, I acknowledge that, from a whole range of advices through the department to me, I was in a position to be able to bring forward and assess clearly the risks that had been identified and put mechanisms in place to deal with managing those risks. That includes the Installer Provider Register, that includes the audit and compliance scheme, that includes referencing Australian standards in the Building Code, that includes the establishment of memorandums of understanding with fair trading agencies and the ACCC and it includes convening regular industry consultative roundtables in order to monitor the program's rollout.

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. The government is committed to returning the budget to surplus as quickly as possible and to paying down debt. As a result of the global financial crisis having a very severe impact upon the budget, the government has to make tough decisions with respect to the budget position. Indeed, in the 2009 budget we did make tough decisions. Some of the critical tough decisions were application of a means test to the private health insurance rebate and an accompanying reform of the structure of the Medicare levy surcharge. These changes produced an estimated saving over the forward estimates of almost $2 billion and a saving for the budget over a period 10 years of just under $10 billion. Treasury modelling indicated that the net impact of these changes on the take-up of private health insurance would be very limited. They would be very, very marginal. They would mean that I would pay more and that people on incomes like mine would pay more for private health insurance. But I am afraid I do not see the logic of why ordinary working people on 50 or 60 grand a year should have their taxes paying subsidies to my private health insurance when many of those same working people cannot afford private health insurance for themselves. I do not see the logic of that.The conservative parties - the Liberal Party and the National Party - are blocking these savings in the Senate. They are now facing the second attempt by the government to get these changes through the Senate and they are continuing to play games, trying to avoid the issue but, in effect, blocking these changes in the Senate. -  - What the opposition is doing is protecting subsidies for higher income earners, doing great damage to the government's budget settings at the same time as claiming that they would be more fiscally responsible - they would have lower deficits - than the government. Yet the impact of their position would be to add $10 billion to the government's debt.There has been one small glimmer of hope in this whole affair, and that is my opposite number, Senator Barnaby Joyce, the shadow finance minister, who on 12 January indicated that he was prepared to consider supporting the government's position. Unfortunately, his view did not last very long and a few weeks later he indicated that he had retreated from that position. Over the past week or so, Senator Joyce has gone very quiet. I saw him on Q&amp;A Monday last week and we have barely heard from him since; I am worried something has happened to him. I am worried he has been got at or something. I am concerned he might have been abducted by aliens or something! There is a real worry about whether Senator Joyce is now going to have an independent view on anything. He has made a career out of his alleged independent view on things; I would like to see him step back up to the plate on this issue and adopt the fiscally responsible position to move beyond the stream of consciousness stuff that we have had from him to adopting a fiscally responsible position that will assist the government to return the budget to surplus and to pay down debt.It would appear that the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, has finally caught up with the shadow finance minister. He has gagged him, he has bound him and he has sat him in the corner, and now the shadow finance minister cannot express a genuine view. I have a message for the opposition: the task of getting the budget back to surplus is a fundamental priority for the government and, instead of claiming that, were you the government, you would actually get the budget back into surplus quicker, how about you behave in accordance with that as an opposition now? All we get is the bloviating from the giant windbags like the member for North Sydney, but they do the opposite in practice. So it is now time for the big test in the Senate: are you going to support the government's efforts to return the budget to surplus or are you going to support ordinary working people paying subsidies for millionaires' private health insurance?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. My answer to the honourable member is that we will ensure that not only the rollout of ceiling insulation under the renewable energy bonus program but also the audit, compliance and inspection program of roofs takes place in an orderly and a timely way. I make a point through you, Mr Speaker, to members opposite: the risk assessment measures that have been put in place in this program from the start and the risk assessment mechanisms that will be in place for this program as it transitions in the future will ensure that public safety -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I say to the honourable member, having noted his comments in the doorstop interviews this morning, that for the opposition to continue to raise the spectre of unnecessary high anxiety about insulation risks is to ignore a number of measures that have already been identified by the government and put in place in relation to both this program and the measures that we contemplate in the future. Prior to this, any householder who had a concern about insulation in their ceiling could call the department and have that matter considered and have an appropriate audit and monitoring take place. - In relation to the honourable member's question, I make the following observations: any householders who have safety concerns in relation to insulation in their ceilings already have access to a hotline. There is also a monitoring and compliance program that is being rolled out to ensure that risk identification takes place as a matter of consequence. In relation to the further delivery of ceiling insulation that the government has identified as necessary, householders who continue to have safety concerns are able to request a risk assessment for their home. If the assessment shows that there are any significant risks, on-site inspection by an accredited inspector can be arranged. Inspections will occur over time, as is appropriate, under the program in order to ensure safe delivery of insulation into ceilings.Additionally, in relation to the announcements made previously, which the member is well aware of, we have identified a more significantly rigorous regime for installers, to enable them to meet the existing requirements under the register. In consultation with state authorities, work safety authorities and others, there will be the provision of quality assessment and the provision of a specific bond, to ensure that any issues in relation to rectification are addressed. All of these matters have been identified as necessary to establish a strengthened regime for the installation of insulation, and householders can have confidence that they will be rolled out in a proper and appropriate manner.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for her question, because the Australian economy has outperformed virtually every other advanced economy during this global recession. I think that is something that all Australians are proud of - the performance of our economy during this global recession; the fact that we have created in Australia, together, over 180,000 jobs; and the fact that we continued to grow as other economies were falling into recession.We have had some judgment about this from the OECD, who put a report out last week. They remarked particularly on the performance of the Reserve Bank - and of course on the performance of the government, in terms of the measures that we took to stimulate the economy. They highlighted the role that monetary and fiscal policy has played in supporting our economy during this global recession. We get some commentary from those opposite that the performance of the Australian economy is due to a whole lot of things other than monetary and fiscal policy. It is true that the very good regulation of our financial system has played a part. It is also the case that strong growth in the Asia-Pacific has been important. But what we see in the OECD report is their belief that monetary and fiscal policy domestically here was absolutely fundamental. They made this point:This would not have been enough if monetary and fiscal policies had not been developed progressively to respond to the crisis. These have in no small part shielded businesses and citizens from the initial damaging impacts of the global recession.Of course there has been a bit of commentary around monetary policy. We had the shadow Treasurer running around the place last week, peddling his phoney claims about some link between current spending and interest rates. As we know, Tinkerbell over there was repudiated fundamentally by the Reserve Bank governor in his evidence to the committee only last week - and, of course, was also repudiated fundamentally by the OECD. This is what they said about what interest rate rises in Australia have reflected:_ the relatively favourable trends experienced by the economy over the recent period and the reduction of the large global downside risk which prevailed until mid-2009.So, like the Reserve Bank governor, they have completely repudiated the point that has been made by the shadow Treasurer. Of course, sometimes there is a little bit of honesty from Tinkerbell -  -  - It just slipped out. Sloppy Joe let it slip out. - I withdraw. A letter from Joe Hockey, the shadow Treasurer, to the editor of the Financial Review, says:The Reserve Bank of Australia recognises that this is no longer appropriate and is now in the process of moving interest rates back to more normal levels over a relatively short period of time.He will tell the truth in the Financial Review, but he will not do it on talkback radio. He is constantly out there talking down our economy, and what he will not say is that interest rates are now 300 basis points lower than they were when the Liberals were last in government. I know he thinks he can wave that magic wand and put interest rates back at 1967 levels, but economic policy does not work like that. What we are getting from those opposite is a risky, extreme commentary which talks down the economy. On this side of the House, we will continue to support employment and small business to continue to support the Australian people and their continued employment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The first point I would make is that FIRB approval does not give foreign investors the right to mine or export uranium. It does not do that at all. I think the member may misunderstand this. We have a whole regime that deals with that and that is put in place by the Minister for Resources and Energy. It does not necessarily give them the right to mine at all and it does not give them the right to export.In a sense, I fundamentally reject the point that the member is making. Nevertheless, let me deal with this very important question of foreign investment in Australia. This country has always required foreign investment to develop, and that is particularly the case in our resources sector. Because we are a capital-hungry country when it comes to resources, we operate a foreign investment regime. This government proudly apply a national interest test and we have proudly applied that particularly in circumstances where state owned enterprises are involved. Where necessary we have applied it. Both sides of politics have done this on different occasions. We all accept the need for foreign investment in this country. If it does not meet those guidelines, we do not necessarily approve it. Conditions may be put on a particular project.I do not and cannot come in here and discuss the ins and outs of each project. On this occasion, the member says it was approved. It was approved, but that approval does not have the impact the member has suggested, for the reason I said before: it does not give foreign investors the right to mine or export uranium. The right to mine or export uranium is based on our strict uranium policy, our bilateral safeguard agreements and our environmental and safety approvals. That is where all that occurs. This government will continue to apply our national interest test on foreign investment to maximise the benefit that flows to this country in terms of jobs and in terms of wealth creation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for her question, as I know that in her part of Australia she places particular importance on the delivery of local healthcare services. Health and hospitals are a big part of the nation's future because so many working families depend on them. Each year, Australians make 115 million visits to their local doctor. Every year our nation's 768 public hospitals provide nearly 50 million hospital services to the Australian public. The workforce here is huge: some 60,000 doctors, 230,000 nurses and 134,000 allied health professionals. Taxpayers are currently spending $71 billion-plus each year to support the system.Could I also go to the demands being placed on our system now and into the future from the increase in our population, the ageing of our population and the improvements in medical technology. We project a very large increase indeed in the period ahead in the total national investment in our health and hospital system. Based on current projections, that equates to an increase in average Australian government health spending per person from $2,290 per year today to $7,200 by 2050. That is the trajectory we are on.The other point which is relevant here is the capacity of the states and territories in the future to fund the hospitals and the health services on which Australian families depend. The member for Lyne just asked a question. I visited the hospital in Port Macquarie in his electorate, and the message came through loud and clear that that hospital needs to be able to plan better and resource better for its future needs. Here is where the rubber hits the road: state outlays are being increased on health and hospitals right now by about 11 per cent per year and state own-source revenues are growing by about four per cent per year. That is why there is a funding crisis as well.The honourable member's question went to the government's investments in this area. I refer again to the $64 billion investment that we have made already through the National Healthcare Agreement. That represented a 50 per cent increase on the agreement which preceded it; the agreement in which the then minister for health, the current Leader of the Opposition, extracted $1 billion from the hospital system. Also, we have invested $1.1 billion in training more doctors; in contrast to the then minister for health, the current Leader of the Opposition, who froze GP training places. We also have increased our investment in the provision for nurses and nothing was done to deal with the shortage of nurses during the previous minister's occupancy of the position.This also brings us back to how we fund responsibly the future needs of our health and hospital system. There is a piece of legislation up in the Senate called the PHI, which those opposite are standing in the way of passing, which would deliver some $2 billion to assist in the future injection of capital into our overstretched health and hospital system - $2 billion from the wealthiest Australians who are currently being cross-subsidised by poorer Australians and middle-class Australians. That is why we are proceeding with that reform.Those opposite interjected before about primary health care and about GP superclinics. I would say to the shadow minister for health, the member for Dickson, or those members opposite who do not find health faintly interesting, that he should also have a clear look at how his GP superclinic is now performing in Strathpine; and the reporting in the local press from those who have been out there supporting it, as doctors and local users of the system, because it is providing flexible out-of-hours services. The other day at Ballan, in the seat of the member for Ballarat, we also saw reports from the local authorities about what was necessary and happening there in terms of flexible delivery of services in that community. - The government is proud of rolling out its reforms in primary healthcare. This is what we intend to do to make sure that our primary healthcare reforms are implemented on the ground and are helping the people of Strathpine, are helping the good people of Ballarat and are helping those where these GP superclinics are being rolled out across the country. I say to those opposite with their great reformist zeal on health: in their 12 years in office what did they do in terms of delivering a single GP superclinic? Zero. What did they do in capital funding for the health system? Zero. Our plans for the future are clear.</DOC>

As the honourable member would know, there is the opportunity for the person in question to make that complaint specifically known to the department and for the department to respond to that complaint, as it does to each and every complaint that is received under this program. - Through you, Mr Speaker, I respond to the honourable member by reminding him that under the Home Insulation Program it was a requirement of installers that they meet the guidelines in question. It also was a requirement that the householder signed the order form in order to satisfy themselves that that particular job had been done in accordance with the guidelines. - The purpose of having an insulation hotline in place is to enable those who have any concerns about the quality of work, or any other matters in relation to this program, to have their concerns addressed. And that is what should happen in his instance.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question, and I thank her for the opportunity to visit her electorate last week and to meet with community leaders and local schools. I believe that the member for O'Connor has indicated what may be motivating the Liberal Party to hold up the student income support bill in the Senate; that is, they simply do not understand it and they care so little about Australian students and Australian working families that they have not bothered to familiarise themselves with the details of it.I point out to the House that, very significantly, those who care about education are urging senators to pass this bill. Yesterday Australia's 39 vice-chancellors each signed a letter to every senator, calling on them to pass the bill - a truly extraordinary thing. And now, as I understand it, opposition members are hurling abuse about vice-chancellors. Thirty-nine vice-chancellors sent a letter calling on senators to pass the bill. In the letter the vice-chancellors said:We, the undersigned, write on behalf of Australia's universities and their students to seek your support for the passage of the bill.And they go on:The income support for students bill properly targets less well-off students across Australia for whom income support is critical. The increases to the parental and personal income thresholds will mean that more students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds will be able to access the full rate of youth allowance.I table a copy of the letter and the full list of 39 signatories to the letter. The government, at each and every stage of trying to reform youth allowance to make it fairer, have been willing to accept reasonable amendments. We have worked with the Greens and accepted amendments. We have worked with Senator Xenophon and accepted amendments. That means that, as of today -  - Perhaps the shadow minister for education might want to contemplate this: as of today, every vice-chancellor in this country is calling on the Senate to pass the bill; every state and territory education minister in this country is calling on the Senate to pass the bill; the Australian Greens want the bill passed; Senator Xenophon wants the bill passed; the National Union of Students wants the bill passed; and every Independent member in the House of Representatives wants the bill passed. In their caterwauling and arrogance they reveal how out of touch they are. I ask members of the Liberal Party to contemplate this: in taking the stance that they are taking they are saying, in their arrogance, that they know better than every Australian vice-chancellor, that they know better than struggling students, that they know better than the Liberal minister for education in Western Australia, and that they know better than the working families who need this support.I ask the Leader of the Opposition, who is known to feign concern about cost-of-living questions for working families: how can he justify his senators' refusal to pass a bill which would allow a middle-income family in the bush who earn $70,000 a year and have two kids, one who is already at university and one who is about to go there, to receive $13,300 in the first year for the student starting university and $10,300 for the student already at university? Under the current scheme they would receive next to nothing. How can he say to that family, in that income range, that they should not get those benefits? I am asking the Leader of the Opposition - who is now making a catastrophic error by seeking advice from the shadow minister for education - to have the courage to think this through for himself and to ask himself: can he credibly ever again raise cost-of-living issues if he does not pass this bill?If he truly believes that people in income ranges like $70,000 a year deserve support, he should instruct his senators to pass this bill. If he does not, then he is standing by the scheme the Howard government stood by for its term in office, where a family earning $44,000 a year does not get full youth allowance whilst a family earning $300,000 a year, with a student at home, does get full youth allowance. It would amaze me that anybody, even members of the Liberal Party, could walk out and credibly say to the Australian people, 'That's fair.' A kid who lives at home in a family earning $300,000 a year gets full youth allowance, even if they live in Carlton or central Sydney, 10 steps from the university, while a kid who needs to move away from home, who is from a family that earns $40,000-odd a year, does not qualify for full youth allowance. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to seriously contemplate this himself and to think it through. It is an important question for students who are trying to go to university right now.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I can advise the House that the government has indicated that it is prepared to consider appropriate transitional arrangements for legitimate industry participants and that a hotline is now available, the installer hotline, 1800 -  - in order to enable people to receive accurate information in respect of the ongoing transition in this program. The government is focused on providing support for those people who are retrenched. Any insulation workers who lose their jobs have access to assistance under the Compact for Retrenched Workers. In particular, the government is focused on helping any insulation worker who may be affected.I must make the observation that it is the opposition that voted against the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan in its entirety; it is the opposition that opposed this scheme in its entirety; it is the opposition that called for the suspension of this scheme -  - In relation to this scheme, the opposition are all crocodile tears. They opposed it at the start, they want it suspended, and we are moving immediately to work through transitional arrangements, mindful of the impacts on employment in this sector.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Oxley for his question and the fine work he does as Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. Today the COAG Reform Council released its progress report on COAG's National Partnership Agreement to Deliver a Seamless National Economy. This follows the release last week of an OECD report - the Prime Minister has it in his hand but I also have the quote - which concluded:Australia represents in many ways a 'role model' for OECD countries in its proactive approach to regulatory reform.That is great; that is an endorsement of the reform program of the Rudd government.A COAG working group which is co-chaired by my colleague the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and me has been working hard on COAG's ambitious reform agenda, which covers no less than 27 different areas of business regulation. The COAG Reform Council's assessment relates the progress up to 30 September last year, and I am pleased to announce that COAG has already agreed on a response to the report that was released today, with the Prime Minister, the premiers and the chief ministers adopting our working group's recommendations within just four working days. Thank you, Prime Minister, thank you to the premiers and thank you to the chief ministers.COAG, I can announce, is implementing all of the COAG Reform Council's recommendations, and that is testimony to the commitment of the Commonwealth, the states and the territories to working together to advance this vitally important microeconomic reform. - I am fascinated to hear the shadow Treasurer saying: 'What are they? What are the 27 areas of regulatory reform?' He has never heard of them. He has never heard of economic reform in this country and never heard of deregulation - and I will have more to say about that in a moment.I thank the COAG Reform Council and the states and territories for their important work on these reforms. At least one-third of the reforms are approaching completion by the middle of the year, which is just 1½ years into a five-year agreement. - The shadow Treasurer asks what the 27 reforms are, and I can say that they include 10 hot spots identified -  -  - wait for it, brother - by COAG under the previous coalition government. Those 10 regulatory hot spots were identified by COAG under the previous coalition government. And what did the Business Council of Australia have to say on progress by the coalition on these 10 hot spots? It said: 'Eighteen months ago COAG released a plan to tackle 10 business regulation hot spots.' It was referring to 2007. 'Clearly they were so hot they burnt a hole in the piece of paper and we haven't seen them since.' That is an indictment of you, the coalition, for lack of progress on these 10 important regulatory reforms. Indeed, the Business Council of Australia further described the period covered by the previous coalition government as one of 'the creeping reregulation of business'.Now that they are in opposition, the coalition have sought to thwart perhaps the most important of these reforms, and of course I refer to a national system of occupational health and safety, for which the coalition opposed in the Senate the facilitating legislation not once, not twice but three times, such is their lack of commitment to economic reform in this country. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to rethink his strategy of opposing Rudd government reforms for the sake of opposition and to support the Rudd government's economic reform program.It is already well known that the opposition leader is a big risk to the Australian economy and so too is his sidekick, Senator Barnaby Joyce. Senator Barnaby Joyce wanders around Australia with a briefcase full of new regulations. He has the Birdsville amendment, the Blacktown amendment, the Richmond amendment and the Breakfast Creek amendment - amendments named after just about every pub in Australia. We know Senator Joyce will go, but what will remain is the opposition leader's poor judgment - his poor judgment in appointing Senator Joyce. - It is revealing, is it not, that the shadow Treasurer, a member of the previous government, does not even know the 10 regulatory hot spots that they failed to deliver on? Senator Joyce will go, but the opposition leader's poor judgment will remain. The Rudd government is building a stronger economy for the future by supporting jobs and small businesses today.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I would draw the honourable member's attention to the employment which has arisen as a consequence of this program - a program which was opposed by those opposite at the very beginning. That is the first point.The second thing I would draw to the honourable member's intention is that the home efficiency rebate program, which is scheduled to commence on 1 June, represents continued investment on the part of the government in home insulation and solar panels. Thirdly, I would say in response to the honourable member's question that, when it comes to transitional industry assistance, the minister has already indicated the form which that could take and that affected businesses are, of course, able to contact the minister. Fourthly, for those workers who are affected by the cancellation of the Home Insulation Program, specific arrangements have been put in place by the Minister for Employment Participation. I would also draw those to the attention of the House.The Minister for Employment Participation has announced a $10 million commitment for 2,000 structural adjustment places in the Productivity Places Program for insulation workers affected by changes. Secondly, there are training places available to retrain insulation workers for new jobs. These are on top of the 4,000 places announced last year to help workers transition from the insulation industry - 2,000 places in the Language, Literacy and Numeracy Program and 2,000 Apprenticeships Access places. These have been announced previously. They were put in place because this program, when it was originally established, had a finite budget and a finite time line. That is why the government was concerned to provide mechanisms for those who had been employed within it to transition from it into permanent employment elsewhere.These are the various measures which the government has put in place. I would again draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that the employment which has been created by this program over the last 12 months was, frankly, opposed in every measure by those opposite, as they opposed every other stimulus measure put forward by the government in its February 2009 package.</DOC>

 - I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question and note that he, at least, supports Australian content on Australian television. The government will protect Australian content on commercial television by offering licence fee rebates to commercial broadcasters in 2010 and 2011. Licence fee rebates will be 33 per cent in 2010 and 50 per cent in 2011. The government estimates that the cost of the rebate will be some $220 million over the three financial years, subject to the revenue of TV stations. As part of its digital television switch-over package, the government has made provision for a range of related measures, and this greatly reduces the impact on the underlying cash balance.The government has provided this assistance for three important reasons. The first reason is to protect Australian content on TV. Figures from ACMA show that, in 2006-07, commercial television broadcasters spent some $790 million, or 65.8 per cent of their total programming expenditure, on Australian programs, including some $96 million on Australian drama. That drama includes Underbelly on Channel 9, which had 2.9 million viewers, and Packed to the Rafters on Channel 7, which had 2.6 million viewers in 2009. Other important Australian content includes MasterChef on Channel 10, with some 2.3 million viewers. There is a second reason, which is that commercial television broadcasters are switching to digital television and will need to invest in new technologies. Digital TV involves converting equipment, broadcasting in a different spectrum, adding additional channels and promoting the Freeview platform. The third reason is that the Australian industry already pays significantly higher fees to government than comparable nations.This is also consistent, it must be said, with precedent. Back in 2000, the former government offered TV licence fee rebates of $260 million to assist the rollout of digital TV in regional areas. We can go back even further. Commercial radio licence fees were cut by 50 per cent in 1992 to compensate for the expansion of radio services that occurred with the introduction of the Broadcasting Services Act. We on this side of the House are clear about our position, but I must also talk about how this has been received. It is fair to say that it has been received in a number of ways. Firstly, upon the announcement, the relevant opposition spokesperson, Tony Smith, the shadow minister, was reported on 8 February as saying:Preserving quality Australian content is important and there is little doubt the cost of delivering that content is higher at present _That is a pretty clear position from the relevant shadow minister. Then, for some reason unknown to me, days later the Leader of the Opposition was out there revealing once again the old Abbott habit: talking before he thought. The Leader of the Opposition was out there accusing the government of bribing the commercial networks, and a bribe requires a two-way transaction that we knew what we were doing in bribing them and that they - the likes of Laurie Oakes, Mark Riley and Paul Bongiorno - were prepared to change the way that they broadcast the news on the basis of this bribe. I wonder why that occurred? Of course, you had one in favour and one against - and you will always have one in the middle over there. And the one in the middle, of course, was Tinkerbell. - The shadow Treasurer went on Meet the Press on Sunday and he had a bob each way; he was for it and he was against it. This is an important issue. It is subject to disallowance in the other place so they will have to take a decision, and we await that decision with interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question because, as we know in this place, there are huge challenges on the Australian health and hospital system. If we look at what is happening with the ageing of our population and the fact that we are going to have a huge increase in the expenditure which will be necessary on those over 65 in the future, we face fundamental challenges for how we deal with this as a nation going forward.One of the reports produced recently by the government predicts a sevenfold increase in overall expenditure on health for those over the age of 65. Furthermore, those over the age of 65 will increase as a proportion of our total population from something like 13 per cent of our population today to something like 23 or 24 per cent of our population by mid-century. That is the challenge. Furthermore, it is a challenge for budgets, both federal and state. What we have seen is the increased outlays by state governments on health averaging some 11 per cent across the nation in recent years but their own-source revenue rising by only four per cent over that same period of time, producing a widening fiscal gap between the demands on the system and the states' capacity to fund the expansion of the hospital system as is necessary.The third part of what I would say in response to the honourable member's question is that, when you look specifically at the action the government has taken so far, you will see we are seeking to lay the foundations for the future expansion of our health and hospital system. Firstly, what we have done in just two years in office, through the Minister for Health and Ageing, is to increase the funding by the Australian government to the public hospital system by 50 per cent. That stands in contrast to the $1 billion ripped out of that system by the Leader of the Opposition when he was health minister for four years. Secondly, the Australian government has increased the number of GP training places by 35 per cent, whereas the Leader of the Opposition when he was health minister for four years froze the number of GP training places. Thirdly, this government has increased the number of nurse training places. The Leader of the Opposition when he was health minister did nothing to address what was then described as a shortfall of 6,000 nurses in the system. Fourthly, this government has made a direct investment of $ ¾ billion into the direct services provided by our emergency departments. That contrasts with a zero direct investment of dollars by the Leader of the Opposition when he was health minister. No. 5: we have invested some $600 million already directly into elective surgery, providing an additional 60,000 elective surgery procedures across the country, which stands in contrast to a zero investment by the Leader of the Opposition when he was health minister. We are rolling out 36 GP superclinics across the nation. Eight are now either fully or partially operational and the remainder have contracts signed. That contrasts with zero GP superclinics rolled out by those opposite.That is what we have been doing so far, but it all comes back to how we fund and finance this for the future. The decision by those opposite to continue to block the government's measures and announced policy on PHI goes to the heart of our ability to provide finance for our hospital system for the future. Some $2 billion across the forward estimates lies caught up in an arrangement in the Senate whereby the Leader of the Opposition is standing by the principle that the least salaried Australians should subsidise the private health insurance costs of someone on $200,000 and $300,000 salary a year, like the Leader of the Opposition and me - that someone on $30,000 a year should be cross-subsidising the private health insurance premium rebate for someone on $200,000 to $300,000 a year. That is what is at stake here because it is the working people of this country who present to accident and emergency and who queue up at public hospitals in order to be on elective surgery waiting lists who need that investment. That is why health and hospital reform for the future is absolutely necessary. We have made a strong start through the existing allocation of $64 billion to the system under the Minister for Health and Ageing.Those opposite, it seems, have one solution for the ageing of our population. I see what the Leader of the Opposition has had to say about that again in recent days: to increase the age pension to 70. That is his response to the ageing of the population - make people work to the age of 70. In contrast, we have brought about the single largest reform to the age pension system in the country's history. On top of that, we have invested $64 billion into the public hospital system of the nation, and this government intends to get on with the business of building better health and better hospitals for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. I know him less well than the member for Pearce; nonetheless I will take what he has said at face value. If any individual seeking to contact the government on these matters cannot get through, that is unacceptable. The government therefore must lift its game to make that happen, and we intend to do so.On the question of those who run insulation businesses - and the honourable member referred to one business in particular in his question - I had the opportunity today in front of Parliament House to speak to a number of businesses that had come here to protest over the decisions taken by the government. I spent some time speaking with representatives of four companies. They may be with us in the public gallery; I am uncertain whether that is the case. It was important to hear from them first-hand their experiences. The bottom line is, as I said yesterday in my remarks in a press conference, as Prime Minister of the country I fully accept responsibility for the government's decisions whether they are, firstly, popular decisions or unpopular decisions; secondly, good decisions or bad decisions; or, thirdly, programs which are implemented with perfect success or those which are not - and that extends, of course, to this program.Insulation workers were at the heart of the matters which were raised with me by those four owners of insulation companies today. The Insulation Council of Australia and New Zealand has estimated as of 18 February that the closure of the program would result in 6,000 people losing their jobs. Many of these people are good, honest workers whose jobs have been disrupted because of a small number of shonky operators.The government therefore offers a commitment to those workers as follows: (1) each worker will receive support to retain their current job through the transition phase before the new Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme begins, this support will be provided through assistance to businesses to retain workers through the transition phase in either work or training; (2) in addition, the government will assist displaced insulation workers to find alternative jobs with other employers in other industries, which assistance will be provided through priority employment coordinators, dedicated insulation coordination officers and the resources of the Job Services Australia network; (3) where appropriate employment opportunities are not available, the government will ensure that a relevant training place is available to displaced insulation workers to help those workers transition to more permanent employment in the future, given that the Home Insulation Program was designed as a temporary program.The $41.2 million insulation worker adjustment package will be funded through an allocation of $11.5 million from the Jobs Fund and $29.7 million from the Productivity Places Program and other existing training programs. The government will continue to assess the number of workers displaced by the early termination of the Home Insulation Program and will make adjustments to this package as required.One of the other key concerns raised with me by the owners of the companies whom I met earlier today in front of Parliament House was the continuation of the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme in the future. Their question to me was: when can we transition to that scheme? The government has indicated that we would have it up and running by 1 June, and in the case of certain firms it may be possible to do so earlier. I am certain that the owners of those businesses - and I say this in response to the honourable member for Fadden - would be concerned to have heard statements I believe to have been made by representatives of the opposition, including the shadow Treasurer, who have declined to provide bipartisan support for the continuation of that scheme in the future. - Mr Speaker, I listen very carefully to the interjections by those opposite, and they confirm exactly the point I was making. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer are, on the one hand, out there reflecting concern about the jobs impact of a program and, in the same breath, walking the other side of the street and providing no support for the continuation of a revised program in the future. I think the shadow Treasurer exceeded his brief, but he has done so eloquently today.In response to the member for Fadden's question - that is, the contents of the government's proposed insulation worker adjustment package - as I said in the conclusion of my remarks before, we stand ready to make other appropriate adjustments as necessary. The government will not walk away from its responsibilities to the workers of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. Obviously he, like all members of the House, is interested in the issue of private health insurance. It is a particularly timely question, given that the other place has just voted against the first of the private health insurance rebate measures. The opposition have blown a $2 billion hole in the budget and have no health policies of any substance to put forward to the public. We are committed to making sure that private health insurance is affordable for low- and middle-income earners. This year I used my powers under the Private Health Insurance Act to ask for resubmissions from more than half of the health funds, as their proposed increases were too high. This has resulted in lower rebates for 75 per cent of private health members, some 8.5 million people. - It is interesting to hear the shadow Treasurer and the shadow health minister yelling out from the other side of the House, because the announced increase of 5.78 per cent that I made yesterday - an increase is never good news for families - was a smaller increase than it would have been. For all of the hollering from those opposite I do need to advise them that when their dear leader was the health minister the average increase under Mr Abbott was 6.44 per cent. I think, to be fair to the Leader of the Opposition, we should acknowledge that his average was 6.44 per cent but the average over the last five years of the coalition was 6.63 per cent. So he did have a slightly better average, but it is still significantly higher.The truth is no-one ever wants these premiums to go up. The obligation of the government that we take far more seriously than those opposite ever did is to make sure that the increases are kept to the absolute minimum that is necessary. The approach that the Leader of the Opposition took when he was the health minister was just a simple tick and flick: they asked, he gave and the premiums went up. I did wonder whether we were being a bit unfair to the Leader of the Opposition, because he was no doubt pretty busy working out what he was going to do with several thousand golf balls that he paid $6,000 for! - The member for Canning is asking if he could have one of the golf balls. Unfortunately, I do need to advise the House that my department has told me some 2,700 of these golf balls are stored in a warehouse. I think, although the member for Canning is no doubt a worthy recipient, what I would like to encourage the House to do is to tell me of any worthy charity that might actually be able to do something useful with these golf balls, because they certainly are not going to help get any doctors into rural areas. - It is interesting, because the member for Dickson, I am told, is a golf fan. I am prepared to offer him some balls if he wants some! -  - I confess I do not have this on good authority, but I understand that his application for membership of the Surfers Paradise Golf Club is still pending. I wish him good luck. But in all seriousness, I was very concerned to hear the member for Dickson out spruiking that any increase in the premiums was an outrage. He was asked on radio this morning what premium increase he would have approved. His response, at least initially, was quite a sensible one. He said, 'I would allow a reasonable amount.' Fair enough. But he was asked what that reasonable amount would be, and he said, 'Well, uh, I can't put a figure on it.' So he is happy to go out and criticise us for an increase which is smaller than was projected by the industry and the media and was smaller than the record of the leader that he operates under, but he actually has no figure to put forward himself.The facts are very clear: since we have come into government an extra 474,000 people have taken out private hospital cover and coverage has increased to 44.7 per cent, which is the highest level of coverage since 2001. The facts are very clear: private health insurers are enjoying growing membership, the government has acted to keep premium rises to a minimum and the Liberals simply stand for premium-hike free-for-alls. As the shadow Treasurer said, he would not want to intervene in a free market and wants to sell off Medibank. Of course, they also stand for rebates for millionaires. It is not a very good record. I am happy to offer these golf balls to the member if he would like some.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I also draw his attention to the range of measures that I outlined earlier in my response to the member for Fadden, because they go directly to the question of the detail of the government's insulation worker adjustment package. In response to the honourable member's question I would add two points. That is that the employment generated from this scheme would not have existed if the original policies recommended by those opposite were adhered to by the House; there would have been no such program. Secondly, I also note from the comments of the shadow Treasurer that he provides no such guarantee for the continuation of this program in the future. So, therefore, I say to the honourable member, if he is being fair dinkum about the employment impacts, to consider carefully the implications of the statement made by the shadow Treasurer today, which refused to provide any support for the continuation of this program through the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme in the future. That is the core element of each and every one of the industry representatives' concerns as reflected to me in my discussions with them earlier today.</DOC>

 - I thank my friend the member for Flynn for his question. We all know his commitment to his communities and his understanding of issues to do with delivery of health services to people who live in rural and regional Australia. The issue of health services to rural and regional Australia is at the forefront of the government's mind. That is why I was fortunate enough to be appointed the first minister in this parliament for Indigenous health and rural and regional health, and I thank the Prime Minister for that appointment. I want to make some observations about the importance of addressing health services in regional Australia. - You just grab hold of Tony's balls. I have one for you. - Last week I visited the north-western New South Wales town of Walgett where I had the very great fortune to spend time with Dr Vlad Matic whose practice was awarded the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners 2009 National General Practice of the Year award, a very important -  - Mr Speaker, I am happy to withdraw my remark. - As I visit rural and remote parts of Australia, as I have been doing over the last few months, talking to rural practitioners and other health professionals, it is very clear that a key issue confronting the delivery of health services in the bush is workforce, workforce, workforce. - An unfortunate aside from the Leader of the Opposition is that they did not freeze GP training places, but they did. We need to understand that whilst we have been going around listening we have also been producing. In 2009-10, we are investing $700 million in targeted rural health programs, a 45 per cent increase in funding of rural programs compared to that provided by the previous Minister for Health and Ageing and now Leader of the Opposition.This government has introduced a $134.4 million package of incentives and reforms. This encouragement is based on the simple principle that the more remote you go, the better the reward. As a result of this proposal and changes that will come in on 1 July, 500 communities and 2,400 general practitioners will be entitled to these new benefits. I have three examples. In the electorate of Eden-Monaro there are relocation grants of $30,000, retention payments after six months of $4,000 and after five years $18,000. In the electorate of Parkes - in Walgett where I was last week - relocation grants are $60,000, retention payments are $5,500 after six months and $47,000 after five years. In my own electorate of Lingiari - the wonderful town of Borroloola - relocation grants are $120,000, retention payments are $8,000 after six months and $47,000 after three years. In addition, we have introduced a rural locum support program providing locum support placements to enable rural GPs to take time off at the same time providing urban doctors with additional training opportunities to undertake locum exchange.We have lifted the number of GP training places by 35 per cent to 800 - training places that were frozen at 600 by the Leader of the Opposition. We have invested $1.1 billion in Health Workforce Australia which was established for clinical training, the biggest Commonwealth commitment to the health workforce. The government is also investing in a series of rural education initiatives through rural health departments of universities and rural clinical schools, boosting funding by $10.9 million. As well as that, we are investing capital through the National Rural and Remote Health Infrastructure Program. I know this is of great interest to the members opposite because they are all applying for it - they are encouraging people in their electorates to apply for it. The difference is that whilst we have been going around talking we have also been taking action. The contrast between the positions adopted by this government and the policies introduced by Mr Abbott when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing are there for all to see. The contrast could not be greater. - The issuing of golf balls as a way of inducing people into the rural workforce is no answer. What it demonstrates is that a vacuum exists between their ears.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for O'Connor for his question, as he raises the legitimate interests of a firm which has been affected by the government's decision to cancel the Home Insulation Program. I would also, in response to the member for O'Connor's question, draw his attention to the contents of the answer that I delivered earlier to the member for Fadden and referred to also in my answer to the member for La Trobe.The second point I would make to the member for O'Connor is that he refers to, I am sure, a good firm that has been in the business, I think he said, for 16 years - is that correct? This program, the Home Insulation Program, has been in existence for about one year prior to its cancellation. So I would simply draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that what has happened with that particular program, and the one which is envisaged to be introduced by 1 June this year, represents significant enhancements to the pre-existing business flows of firms which existed within this industry.I can also say in response to the honourable member's question that the normal provisions of Australia's industrial relations law will prevail in the case of each firm under these circumstances. But I draw his attention in particular to those provisions which are contained in the government's insulation worker adjustment package, which I outlined earlier today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for his question, and I know that he is concerned about proper provision of support for students wanting to attend university. The Senate as yet has not reached the student income support bill, so there is still time for the Leader of the Opposition to personally consider this question and personally consider how Liberal senators should vote on this bill in the next debate. I am asking the Leader of the Opposition to consider the following: that this legislation is necessary so that over 150,000 university students who receive youth allowance, Abstudy or Austudy are able to receive a new annual start-up scholarship worth $2,254 when the scheme is in full operation.This bill is necessary so the parental income test will be raised so that families with two children studying away from home can earn more than $140,000 per year before their allowance is cut completely. Students who choose to move to study may be eligible for an additional relocation scholarship worth $4,000 in the first year. This bill is also necessary so that, from 1 July 2012, students will be able to earn up $400 a fortnight, an increased amount, without having their payments reduced. This bill is necessary so that the age of independence will progressively be reduced from 25 to 22 years of age. That measure itself will see an estimated 6,700 new recipients of the independent rate of youth allowance.I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to consider the fact that every vice-chancellor of every Australian university, on the merits of this proposal, is asking him to pass the bill; that the National Union of Students is asking him to pass the bill; that every education minister in every state and territory, including the minister who serves in the Liberal government in Western Australia, is asking him to pass the bill. -  - The opposition is yelling out and has on the media said, 'Why don't you split the bill?' There is a quick answer to that, and perhaps the shadow Treasurer might like to listen to it: splitting the bill would cost over a billion dollars. The position that was announced by Senator Fiona Nash on Sky News, splitting the bill, would cost more than a billion dollars. That is because the splitting of the bill has all the beneficial measures enacted but has none of the savings measures enacted. -  - Showing how bored they are by economics and how unreal their economic credibility is in the modern age, they are saying, 'Take it off the pink batts program.' Of course, we are talking about a permanent change to student income support that would cost more than a billion dollars.What I am saying to the Leader of the Opposition is: please reconsider your position. But if the Leader of the Opposition does not do that then I would at least ask the Leader of the Opposition to do this. I fear that this playing of politics with students is going to end in a very cruel, cruel joke. I fear that what is going to happen here is that the Liberal Party will play politics with this, will block our measures and will create the illusion that it is prepared to invest a billion dollars extra in student income support and then, when we come to the next election and the opposition is required to produce its figures and costings under the Charter of Budget Honesty, that $1 billion extra investment will melt away. A cruel joke will be played on Australian students: holding out the prospect of an extra billion dollars now, and that billion dollars being snatched away at the election. I would say to the members of the Liberal Party and the National Party who have been genuinely concerned about this matter - and I know that there are some: imagine the position you will be in at the next election if you defeat this legislation, stop students getting money and pretend you are going to give them an extra billion dollars and then at the next election you do not actually come forth with that billion dollars. Imagine the fury of your local constituents then. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to reconsider and to pass this bill. That is what people who care about education are asking him to do, and there is still time.Opposition members - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. First of all there was a government task force established in 2008 involving multiple agencies in the government to develop a national energy efficiency strategy. That was concluded by about September 2008. It, in fact, recommended to the government a range of programs worth some $2.9 billion. In developing this recommendation, the task force highlighted the cost-effectiveness of ceiling insulation relative to other household energy efficiency measures such as appliance upgrading and double glazing.As the honourable member will know, when the government considered a range of measures to support the economy in early 2009 this was one of them. The government's consideration of it was based on that earlier work of the national energy efficiency strategy, in which my own and other departments were engaged.In further response to the honourable member's question, the relevant cabinet committee was presented with proposals concerning this program based on that earlier work. I also say that the overall scope of the program was defined through the Office of the Coordinator-General. Furthermore, the specific implementation of the program and risk assessment associated with it was then delegated to the minister and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I am happy to take any further questions on that matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I know that, like me, he is concerned that the students we are talking about, who are missing out on scholarships, missing out on relocation scholarships and missing out on youth allowance, are real people. They are real Australians, young Australians, who want to go to university to improve their life chances and life prospects.I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that he needs to consider the circumstances of these individual Australians. I know that the member for Corangamite is concerned about the circumstance of Wilfred Hawkins. Wilfred Hawkins is a hardworking student living in Geelong, presumably in the electorate of Corio or the electorate of Corangamite. Wilfred Hawkins will be studying science at Melbourne university this year, but if the Leader of the Opposition does not ask his senators - indeed, instruct his senators - to pass our bill Wilfred Hawkins will miss out on the new $4,000 relocation scholarship and student start-up scholarship worth $1,434 next year and $2,254 after that - a real human being who is going to be hurt by the conduct of the Leader of the Opposition.What will the Leader of the Opposition say to Rachel Durant from the University of Technology? Rachel is president of the Students' Association. She will potentially benefit from the changes to the personal income test and the new scholarships once the legislation is passed.Or what would the Leader of the Opposition say to one of my very own constituents: Tonia Bassett. Tonia Bassett's daughter has to move to Queensland to go to university. Centrelink has advised her that her daughter will benefit from higher youth allowance and new scholarships once the legislation has passed. These are three young Australians who will not get these extra benefits unless the Leader of the Opposition acts and says to his senators that his senators must pass this bill. -  - Of course, as I have raised these individual examples, opposition members, including the shadow minister for education, have called out, 'Split the bill'. Let me explain it to them one more time: if we split the bill as indicated by Senator Nash on Sky TV, that will pass all the beneficial measures and none of the savings. That is not a one-off cost; that creates an ongoing cost to the student income support system of more than a billion dollars.I can see the shadow Treasurer is now thinking about this, and I ask him to think this: if his members raise expectations in their electorates that the coalition, despite a track record in government of never having reformed student income support, in opposition is going to invest a billion dollars more in student income support, then I ask the Leader of the Opposition and I ask the shadow Treasurer: are they absolutely guaranteeing they will make good on that promise at the election? That is that the first entry the shadow Treasurer will put in his Charter of Budget Honesty will not be on health, it will not be on tax cuts, it will not be on infrastructure expenditure and it will not be on anything else - the first billion dollars off the top of expenditure he chooses to make at the election will be into student income support. And if there is any chance that the answer to that question is 'no' - and I think we all know that the answer is going to be no - then it is cruel and it is wrong to hold up paying these benefits to students on the basis that you stand for them getting an extra billion dollars only to let them down in the election campaign.There are members of the backbench who have some goodwill on this matter; some of them have individually come to my office for briefings and to talk to me about it, and I accept that they are genuinely concerned. I accept that they were genuinely concerned on the transition matter and we acted on those concerns - the legislation has been amended to address the transition matter that was raised by members opposite, as well as by members of the government, by student organisations and by the education community. That change has been made. Once again I ask those members of the opposition of goodwill: how are they going to feel if they reject this legislation now and they do not produce the billion dollars in the election campaign? What will you say to your constituents if that happens? Think about it, and if you think you are not promising that billion dollars then the right thing now is to pass this bill.I urge the Leader of the Opposition to reconsider this question. I urge him to genuinely reconsider it. This is not a question of politics; this is a question of actually getting money into the hands of students. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to consider it and I ask the members of the backbench who are full of goodwill, and who I can see are actually considering this question now, to urge the Leader of the Opposition to allow this legislation to pass. I know the shadow minister wants to keep playing politics with it - just like he played politics with the money that we paid to schools. The time for politics is gone; it is time to let this legislation through.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flinders for his question. In terms of those specific remarks he referred to by the South Australian Coordinator-General, I am unaware of them. -  - I am simply saying that I am unaware of them. In response to the honourable member's question I would say that, as far as the risks associated with the implementation of this program were concerned, firstly, with regard to the cabinet's deliberations on this matter, in the early part of 2009 an initial risk assessment was done for the cabinet; and, secondly, once a decision was taken, the implementation of the program was then provided to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts and the department. The minister, I think, during the course of yesterday and the day before answered a range of questions concerning the risk assessments with which he was presented, both by Minter Ellison and other sources, and the minister's response to each of those recommendations which came to him from his officers was based on that risk assessment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. Last November I directed the Australian Office of Financial Management to invest up to $8 billion in high-quality, AAA-rated residential mortgage backed securities to further support competition in Australia's home loan market. Many smaller lenders rely heavily on RMBS to fund their lending by packaging home loans into these securities and borrowing against them. Members would know that the government had previously announced an initial $8 billion in RMBS in late 2008. And just a few weeks ago, I announced a fresh boost to competition, with three non-bank lenders and two smaller banks allocated up to $3.4 billion in year-long pipeline funding for our second $8 billion investment.The government's support has been critical to preserving the infrastructure of this very important market which many smaller bank and non-bank lenders depend on to fund their home loans. Last week we saw the evidence of this, with AMP reducing its basic variable interest rate for new home loans by a full 10 basis points and attributing the cut directly to the government's action. In fact, AMP's chief executive, Craig Dunn, wrote to me to say:_ this reduction in interest rates has only been possible because of the improvement to the securitisation markets flowing on from the Government's support.There is a long way to go yet, but there is no doubt that we have seen some encouraging signs that our support is helping confidence among private investors in RMBS.Of the $13.2 billion in Australian RMBS issuance in which the AOFM has taken a stake, some 39 per cent of nearly $5.2 billion has been private capital. Mr Dunn in his letter to me said:_ we are also hopeful that we will be further able to reduce our rates in the coming months, as we gear up our operations in light of ongoing improvements in the securitisation market.In fact, last week, Reserve Bank assistant governor Guy Debelle confirmed that:_ RMBS is again beginning to provide a competitive source of funding, particularly for the regional banks _ and non-bank lenders _It is clear that the government's direct investment of up to $16 billion in the RMBS market is enabling smaller lenders to lend at competitive interest rates and to maintain a higher level of lending than would otherwise have been possible. But, of course, the global financial crisis has created significant challenges for competition in our domestic banking market. We know that we cannot overcome these overnight, but I think Australians appreciate that we are working hard to support more competition in the banking sector - because, by supporting smaller Australian lenders, our investments are helping place more competition on big banks and downward pressure on mortgage rates.But we have had some commentary today by the shadow finance minister about levels of debt and about levels of interest rates. The shadow finance minister got himself in another one of his famous tangles this morning - after being released from the 'witness protection program', where they have had him for over a week. This morning he actually invented a new economic concept called 'net debt gross, public and private'. That is a bit like a new winter sport - NRL, AFL and NBL all played at Rod Laver Oval with a ball in the middle. He does not have a clue about what he is talking about. This morning the shadow Treasurer was asked by a journalist:Have you heard the term 'net debt gross, public and private'?Mr Hockey laughs:Well, I did today.Things are getting to a pretty sad state when the shadow Treasurer cannot explain what the shadow finance minister is talking about. Fair dinkum; it is a case of dumb and dumber!It is not really humorous because the shadow finance minister has an impact: when he speaks many people think he knows what he is talking about. This morning he repeated what was rejected last week by the Reserve Bank governor. He repeated his claim that somehow Australia might default. This is a very serious and irresponsible thing for a shadow finance minister to say. This was the question from the journalist, 'How serious is the problem?' - the question being debt. This is what Joyce said:I stand by my belief that if you go on that path, that's quite evident. If you continue on that trajectory, you are going to get to a point of reckoning. Quite obviously you will get to a point of reckoning.This is the point that was rejected by the Reserve Bank governor last week. On 19 February, when he was questioned about the previous statements from the shadow finance minister, this is what the Reserve Bank governor had to say:People in positions of authority and responsibility certainly must be wary of the way they speak. _ I think one has to be careful of inadvertently giving false impressions, to be sure.Joyce went on to say a whole lot of other ridiculous, stupid and damaging things about debt. He went on to talk about private debt and made all sorts of outrageous claims. There is one thing that we must all be aware of: his claims about private debt are a complete condemnation of the record of everybody sitting on the other side. This is the case: he said that he was concerned about what was happening with foreign debt.Think about this: between 1996 and 2007, the Liberals presided over a doubling in net foreign debt. Under the Liberals, net foreign debt rose from $192 billion in March 1996 to $589 billion in December 2007. In fact, net debt is smaller today under this government than it was when those opposite were in government. What we have here is scaremongering. Consider this: between 1996 and 2007, the Liberals left the nation with a 440 per cent increase in credit card debt, a 280 per cent increase in household debt and a 270 per cent increase in corporate debt. They are out of their depth, they do not know what they are talking about and they are a risk to the economic future of this nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question. I do indeed recall being very proud that day as the government intervened to cushion the impact of the global financial crisis on the Australian economy and on jobs. Part of that was the $1.2 billion that we injected into the Australian Rail Track Corporation - $580 million of that was allocated to the Hunter region. Indeed, at least one of the loop lines that we announced on that day has already been completed.With regard to the Liverpool Range, I am aware that the member for New England has a keen and legitimate interest in this issue. As I advised the House in October last year, the ARTC is undertaking this project in close consultation with industry. This is a very complex engineering exercise, and last week the ARTC and industry agreed to undertake further geotechnical investigations to narrow down the alignment options. Those options will be narrowed down to three from the existing six and then the ARTC will go to industry to ask them for their views as to which alignment should occur. That concept assessment report will go to industry by the middle of this year for consideration.Industry, of course, has an important role to play in this. We fund the ARTC, but the ARTC receives funds from the access fees from private industry. Hence, they not only get the clear benefits but also have a role to play in financing. This will lead to a major increase in productivity once the alignment is chosen. In this regard, there is a fundamental issue of whether you tunnel or whether you go around some of the landscape there. Once those issues are resolved and after we go back to the industry in the middle of 2010, the next step towards construction can commence. I thank the member for his question and I indicate to him, as he knows, that I will keep him fully informed of how this important project proceeds.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She certainly does understand what the government has done and continues to do for both pensioners and families, as we help them with their cost of living pressures. We have already delivered very significant reforms, particularly for pensioners. We have delivered much needed support for more than three million Australian pensioners. It is this government that are going to introduce Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme - a scheme that will certainly help mums and dad, and their babies. This government also believe that it is very important to target family support like the family tax benefit and the baby bonus.These are very significant reforms that we have delivered in our two years in government after 12 years of inaction on these very important issues from the former government. Those opposite refused to do anything to increase the pension for 12 long years, even though they knew that pensioners were doing it tough. They also refused to introduce a paid parental leave scheme. We know what the Leader of the Opposition has had to say about that - that paid parental leave would be introduced over his dead body.It is becoming very difficult to keep up with the policies of those opposite. Earlier this month we had a lot of confusion on one day when Mr Abbott seemed to backflip on his opposition to a paid parental leave scheme only then to flip over again later in the day. There was a front page splash in the Sydney Morning Herald saying that he was about to develop a policy - no costings, no detail, but nevertheless he was apparently going to have a policy. Within hours of that being on the front page of the Herald he was desperately back-pedalling, saying that the paper had jumped the gun.Today we see more policy confusion from the Leader of the Opposition. Once again in the Herald, they seem to have a copy of a very secret plan that would see older Australians working longer to pay for welfare payments to high-income families. This is a shadow cabinet proposal from the member for Warringah:If a universal family tax benefit payment needs to be fully funded it could be done by further increasing the retirement age.We already know from the Leader of the Opposition's book that he wants to increase the retirement age to 70 and the good thing about today is that we now know why. We now know why it is that he wants to see the age pension age increased to 70, because he is saying that under a future Liberal government pensioners would have to work longer so that welfare payments could be paid to high-income families. That would mean that those higher income families would get $4,800 per child per year and that would be paid for by making older Australians work until they are 70. That is the policy of the Leader of the Opposition.We now know that the Leader of the Opposition is a very serious risk to older Australians. You might think that this is a policy, but instead of that being a clear direction for the Leader of the Opposition we had a comment from a spokesperson saying that no final decisions have been made. - It might be 75. That was not in the book. The hard thing for pensioners is that they do not know what is going to come out of this Leader of the Opposition. What is the latest policy thought bubble that he is going to come up with? I just say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is time to come clean with the pensioners of Australia and tell them what your secret plans really are for them.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. As the Leader of the Opposition would be aware, when the government announced the cancellation of the program last Friday the minister in his statement indicated that the government would be prepared to provide - or to consider providing - transitional assistance to affected firms. The second point I would say in response to the Leader of the Opposition is that the government accepts fully the direct consequences which flow from its decision on the firms out there in the economy producing these services and in some cases manufacturing the goods as well. Therefore, the challenge for us is to work through the detail of transitional assistance as it would most appropriately apply to firms in different circumstances. I am advised by the minister that he will be meeting with representatives of the industry in the immediate period. I understand further that representatives of the industry whom I met earlier today, one of whom was just now in the press gallery, will be meeting also with the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations later in the day as well.The government, as I indicated in my answer earlier today, has indicated its preparedness to assist with workers who have been displaced by this scheme. But I would say again to the Leader of the Opposition that what industry is saying loud and clear is that they want a renewable energy bonus scheme in the future. That is what they want - continuity of work. We have cancelled this program in order to deal with the safety and security matters which have been raised, and we have indicated our intention to commence a new scheme. However, those opposite, when talking about the interests of businesses or of workers, have to reflect upon what the shadow Treasurer said only today when he refused to provide any level of bipartisan support for such a future scheme. That goes to the heart of the provision of future employment and it goes to the heart of the future work for firms concerned. I say to those opposite that, if they are going to express concerns for businesses and for workers, at least their position on this should be consistent.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. International cooperation to counter and stare down international terrorism is of course not just very important; it is absolutely essential, and the white paper published yesterday makes that clear. It makes it clear that the threat to Australia and the international community is ever-present, ongoing and, regrettably, will be a permanent feature of life for the period to come. It is also clear that the threat is evolving.As a consequence of good international cooperation, Australia already has entered into 14 formal memorandums of understanding, MOUs, on counterterrorism. They are - not in alphabetical order - with Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia, Thailand, Brunei, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, East Timor, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey and Bangladesh. Members should not assume that the list will end there. As I said, regrettably this will be a feature for some time.The white paper makes it clear that the threat is evolving. We have had some success through international cooperation against al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We have also had tremendous success against Jemaah Islamiyah, particularly in Indonesia. But we also know, as a result of security and threat assessments shared by like-minded countries, that the al-Qaeda threat is spreading potentially to Yemen and also to Somalia. As a consequence, we need to ensure that our international cooperation not only persists but also evolves to cover these threats, as we have seen in the case of Yemen and the recent London international conference, and as we have seen in the case of Somalia and the international cooperation for activity off the coast of Somalia that is putting international transport is at risk.Importantly, international cooperation also goes to the sharing of intelligence, the use of data - particularly data relating to known terrorists or terror suspects, or people who are regarded as risks in this context - and also the sharing of technology. We have seen in recent times the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union move to enhancing the visa applications that they have, requiring biometric data to be included with visa applications. Yesterday in the white paper the government announced that we would move in the first stage to 10 overseas countries where we would, in cooperation with the British - utilising their facilities, their resources and their collection centres - introduce biometric requirements so far as visas are concerned; that is, fingerprints, facial scanning and facial screening. This is a sensible risk minimisation procedure to introduce. I do not think it will end there. Just as we have seen the United States and the United Kingdom introduce it, as we see the first phase of our introduction, it will not end there. - I made the point yesterday that the government is not proposing - as the shadow minister for foreign affairs in her interjection asks me to do - to list the 10 countries where this will be introduced until such time as the processes have occurred. There are very obvious and sensible reasons, which go to immigration processes and national security, why that should be the case. I see that the shadow minister said in a press release that we should name them because 'the longer this speculation continues, the greater the potential for offence among some of our key diplomatic and trading partners'. I made it clear yesterday: no-one should assume which countries might be on or off the list, and no-one should assume that there will be, either already occurring or in the future, diplomatic efforts to make sure that nation-states understand precisely what we are doing and the reasons for it.As the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has made clear, there are a range of factors as to why a particular country might be chosen in the first stage. One obviously goes to national security, another goes to minimisation of risk and the other obviously goes to where the collection centres that the British hold might be available for use. So people should not assume one way or the other or think that they know more than they do. There are risks associated with the approach adopted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the opposition on this matter. There are risks associated in naming those countries before the processes are ready and available, and the government is not proposing to accept or take those risks.I take at face value the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She just happens to be wrong on this point and does not appreciate the fundamental risks involved. I was much more disappointed yesterday with reckless and irresponsible comments from the other side which sought to make the point that there was no risk here that needed to be confronted. The statements by Senator Birmingham could only be described as reckless and irresponsible. I am surprised that the Leader of the Opposition has not disavowed them. I have to say that I was very disappointed this morning when I saw the Leader of the Opposition essentially say that the white paper on the international threat from terrorism was a distraction and had been overstated. I am very disappointed that the Leader of the Opposition should say that. When he was asked, at his doorstop, what the basis was for saying that, he referred to a newspaper report. He referred to his daily newspaper clips.There are very grave risks involved in national security areas in relying upon newspaper clippings rather than the professional and expert advice that we get from the intelligence community and our security officials. There are very grave risks in relying on newspaper reports. The Leader of the Opposition has been offered a briefing on this by officials, including the Director-General of ASIO. My very strong advice to the Leader of the Opposition is that he might want to take that up and rely upon objective, detailed expert advice rather than his newspaper clips.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, and I say what I said earlier in question time today -  - that as Prime Minister I accept full responsibility for government programs - those programs which are judged by the community to be successful and those which are judged not to be successful. Where mistakes are made, our responsibility is to deal with those mistakes rather than to pretend that they do not exist or to push responsibility elsewhere.The second thing I would say in response to the honourable member's question is as follows. I outlined before the government's commitment in relation to each worker. That was part of the insulation worker adjustment package. Let me recap that for his information. The government's commitment is that each worker will receive one of three things. Each worker will receive support to retain their current job through the transition phase before the new renewable energy bonus program begins. This support will be provided through assistance to business to retain workers through the transition phase in either work or training. Or, secondly, the government will assist displaced insulation workers to find alternative jobs with other employers in other industries. This assistance will be provided through priority employment coordinators, dedicated insulation coordination officers and the resources of the Job Services Australia network. Or, thirdly, where appropriate employment opportunities are not available, the government will ensure that a relevant training place is available to displaced insulation workers.That is our response to the problems which have arisen with the implementation of this program. I think some in this chamber would find the position of the Leader of the Opposition to be ironic. He is the former minister for industrial relations and one of the, shall I say, strongest advocates of Work Choices in the past and in the future - a system of industrial relations that had something to say about basic conditions, including redundancy payments. Can I say that the Leader of the Opposition should reflect on the consistency of his position on the broader protection of workers' rights.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation is in the Senate and facing obstructionism and delay yet again from the opposition. It is timely to remind the House how important it is that we pass this legislation, given the threat that climate change represents to our environment and our economy. The simple fact of the matter is that if we want to reduce carbon pollution at the lowest cost to the economy then we need an emissions trading scheme.That is why Reserve Bank board member Mr Warwick McKibbin as recently as last week said, 'You need to get a carbon price into the economy.' It is also why Peter Shergold, who headed up the Howard government's own emissions trading task group, said yesterday on ABC Radio National:_ the most effective way to drive change, we know, is when you've got a clear price signal. I think an emissions trading scheme is, in the long-term, better _It is widely accepted by all reputable economic commentators that emissions trading is the best mechanism for reducing emissions. The coalition have turned their backs on an economically responsible approach to this issue. We know their direct action plan will not work; emissions will increase. It will cost more. It will have a greater fiscal impact than they have stated. It will make taxpayers pay, not the emitters of carbon pollution. All the costs will be on the budget, with no compensation to pensioners or households. It is also unfunded. You can understand, to return to Mr McKibbin's interview, why he has said that he is not a big fan of the coalition's direct action approach. The coalition have no credibility on this issue. Their policy is economically irresponsible. It is environmentally unworkable and, as we know, the sceptics in the coalition are running the show. We know that the Leader of the Opposition says that the climate science is 'crap'. We know the opposition in the Senate thinks it is all a left-wing conspiracy.Today, again, they are instituting delaying tactics. Senator Abetz is well known on this issue - for thinking that weeds pose a greater challenge than climate change. He now wants to refer this off to another committee of inquiry, which will, I think, take us to the 16th inquiry into how we should deal with climate change. It is all delay; it is all obstructionism. It is economic irresponsibility from that side. It is environmentally unworkable. With such an important reform, where we need the certainty for the business community about how a carbon price is to be achieved, and it is clearly in the national interest, it is time for the opposition to seriously rethink their position and to support this legislation in the Senate.The legislation, it needs to be borne in mind, reflects the agreement that was reached between the government and the coalition just several months ago, and we know that many senators, members of the coalition, support the legislation and support the deal. The Leader of the Opposition has made the point in fairly recent times about the importance of the Liberal Party allowing people to follow their consciences and vote in favour of what they believe. Here is an opportunity: support the CPRS in the Senate. Let us make this important reform and do what is necessary environmentally and what is responsible economically.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In answering his question, I will begin by adding to an earlier answer which, I think, was asked by the member for Pearce concerning inquiries from the general public. The advice I have just been provided with by Centrelink, via the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, is that up to 2 pm today, 24 February, there have been 568 calls from the public with six calls abandoned and an average speed of answer of 14 seconds. We will seek to update members with further data on that. For the further information of those opposite, on the question of calls from employees, the number of calls to 2.30 pm was 3,124, with 68 calls abandoned and an average speed of answer of 76 seconds. As the minister has already advised me, we will seek to improve that in the manner I stated earlier today in response to the question from the member for Pearce.The first part of my answer, just then, went to the public's legitimate concern about ceiling insulation. I also draw the honourable member's attention to the arrangements which the government has put in place. Let me just go through them. Firstly, the government has said that, for houses which have had insulation installed under the Home Insulation Program, we are prepared to check as many as necessary. The government will expand its current targeted risk based audit and inspection program to 15 per cent of homes with non-foil insulation installed under the Home Insulation Program.Secondly, I say to the honourable member that, when it comes to the execution of those inspections, the arrangements are along the following lines. If households have had insulation installed under the Home Insulation Program and they have concerns and their original installer has qualified for reregistration under the program, in the first instance it will be recommended that that installer check that work. If, however, the consumer or the householder objects to that then of course the government would step in and provide an inspection by another party, not that original installer. That is the second point I make in response to the honourable member's question.The third point is that when it comes to the reregistration of installers, all installers, in order to participate in this program, will be required to reregister. They will need to show evidence of meeting the training and skills requirements stipulated by the minister as well as to provide certified quality assurance and occupational health and safety plans.The other thing I would say in response to the honourable member's question relates to the industry as it existed before. Many concerns have been raised about the relative connection between foil insulation, in particular, and household safety and, more broadly, between insulation and household safety. Prior to the implementation of this program - this is for the information of honourable members - I am advised that the average number of annual installations in the retrofitted insulation industry was between 65,000 and 75,000 a year. I am further advised that, under those circumstances, in the year 2008 there were some 83 fires in three states - New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. That was prior to the implementation of this program. I draw the honourable member's attention to the data provided by the minister earlier this week. With more than one million households being currently installed, 87 fires have been linked to the installation of insulation under the Home Insulation Program. Those are the facts as I have been advised and as have been presented. We will therefore continue with the implementation of the inspection regime which the honourable Leader of the Opposition has asked me to detail.</DOC>

I can say to the House that in terms of briefs received by me and of the number in question, I am not going to approximate an absolute recall at this point in time. I am sure the member will understand that. I can say that the risk assessment process informed by Minter Ellison and a number of other assessments undertaken by the department were constituted in those briefs, as was advice on matters that had been raised and identified in terms of risk, and I responded accordingly.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. His question is in two parts. Firstly, I want to again draw to the attention of the House the remarks I made earlier about the investigation by Dubai authorities of the use of three Australian passports and the investigation that the government has asked the Australian Federal Police to effect. I have reported that matter to the House and I have made public remarks. I do not intend to go through that again, other than to advise the House that, as I indicated publicly, I made representations to Israeli Ambassador Rotem this morning. On the government's instructions these same representations were effected by Australian officials in Tel Aviv early this morning - sometime between 4.30 am and 5.00 am Tel Aviv time - underlining the point of the Australian government's seriousness about these matters.The second part of the member's question goes to how over a period of time successive Australian governments have worked very hard to seek to ensure the integrity and the sanctity of the Australian passport system. I am not the first occupier of this office or the first member of the executive to make the point that, despite all of the best procedures adopted by Australia for its passport system over the years and despite our world-class reputation, there will still be occasions where our passports can be used by people badly motivated and often with criminal intent. There will be occasions where passport fraud and passport identity lapses occur.In the particular case that has been drawn to attention today, there were three passports involved and they were issued in 2003. They were from what was called the L series passports. Those passports are valid for 10 years and they are usable Australian travel documents. There are some 200,000 L series passports in existence. The so-called L series passport was introduced in late 2003, and the M series ePassport was introduced in October 2005. This was the first ePassport that included microchip technology for the storage of personal information on the passport. This was regarded as a substantial breakthrough in technology, in integrity and in security. In May last year I launched the so-called N series, the latest of the Australian passport series, which enhances that technology. In terms of the series of passports over the years, there was the L series in 2003 and the M series ePassport in October 2005 and now there is the N series, which I have referred to. People should understand very carefully that no one is suggesting that there is any need to replace old passports. While passport fraud does occur in Australia, there is a low incidence of serious fraud when compared to other countries but when we do find these instances of fraud they are very extensively pursued. As I have indicated, the technology that we use is regarded as world class.In this matter I have indicated to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that a briefing on the particular matter is available to her from the AFP and ASIO; the same, I understand, has been offered to the Leader of the Opposition in the usual way. I have seen the Deputy Leader of the Opposition try and make some connection today between this matter and the visa system rollout referred to in the white paper. Whilst both matters go to people movement and the integrity of passport and visa systems, there is no linkage between the two. I just simply make that point.I was more concerned, frankly, when I read the reference the Leader of the Opposition made this morning at a doorstop. The transcript reads:QUESTION:Just on another issue, just with the Australia passport holders, how concerned are you? Stephen Smith's calling the Israeli Ambassador to discuss this problem.TONY ABBOTT:Obviously I think it is an issue. I think that the security of our passport system is important and I guess I would want to know why the Government hasn't ensured the security of our passport system. I mean, why didn't the Government put in place a passport system that could not be subjected to this kind of scamming?I think the Leader of the Opposition should take up the briefing, and I am very happy to add the Australian Passport Office. I would very gently make this point: the three passports involved were issued in 2003. The last time I looked, Leader of the Opposition, in 2003 you were a minister in a previous government - a member of the executive which oversaw the issuing of that passport. You should think very carefully before you speak on these matters. Successive Australian governments, including my predecessor in 2003, have worked very hard to make sure of the integrity of the Australian passport system and, frankly, Leader of the Opposition, you should know better.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, which deals in part with fire-related incidents. Could I draw his attention to the following advice that I have received. That is, before this scheme was introduced, in three states of Australia in the year 2008 there were some 83 insulation related fires. That represented 0.12 per cent of houses experiencing a fire -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The question went in part to the relative danger associated with insulation and the link between that and fires, and it went to a range of other matters as well. In response to the Leader of the Opposition's question, I am advised that in 2008, before the scheme, the percentage of houses experiencing fire related incidents was 0.12 per cent. In 2009, the percentage of houses experiencing a fire as a result of insulation related causes was 0.0085 per cent. Each one of these fire related incidents is one incident too many. Furthermore, whether it is in 2008, 2009 or 2010, the question of household safety is of fundamental importance, the question of industrial safety is of fundamental importance and, of course, the question of workers' safety is of fundamental importance.The second part of the Leader of the Opposition's question goes to the proposed household renewable energy rebate scheme which the government has indicated would be introduced by 1 June this year. The reason the government is spending the period between now and then working through the guidelines associated with that scheme is to deal with the risk management challenges associated with it. The advice that we have from officials is that that represents an appropriate period of time to work that through. As the minister has indicated, there are a number of reputable firms out there who have been engaged in this industry for a long, long time, and therefore it is important that it be possible for re-registered firms who have a long and safe history in this industry to be able to access the possibility of support through the new scheme prior to 1 June. These are the measures which were referred to yesterday. These are the measures which we propose to engage in in the period ahead.I conclude my answer to the Leader of the Opposition by saying that it is important to deal with each and every practical challenge which has arisen through the implementation of this program, one of which goes to the impact on workers, which we spoke about yesterday. - In dealing with the practical challenges which arise from the implementation of the scheme, we must deal with the problems which arise for workers who are in danger of losing their jobs or who have lost their jobs because of the cancellation of the scheme - which I note was called for by a number of parties around the country, including those opposite. Secondly, we must deal with the challenges which arise for good, bona fide firms out there seeking to provide decent work for their employees. Thirdly, we must also deal with the uncertainties faced by households. The government have embarked on actions in each of these three areas. We intend to deal with each of the challenges as they arise.</DOC>

 - On the challenge of health and health care, it is important to note one basic fact. That is, in 2008 around 87 per cent of Australians saw a doctor or a health provider - in other words, this is a mainstream service for the entire Australian community. In fact, Australians make 115 million visits to their local doctor each year and our 768 public hospitals are in the process of providing some 49 million hospital services to the Australian public each year. All Australians want a better health system and a better hospital system for the future.In the two years that this government have been in office, we have, firstly, increased our investment in the public hospitals of this country by 50 per cent, in contrast to those opposite, who ripped $1 billion out of the system when the current Leader of the Opposition was the health minister.Secondly, the government, in just two years, has increased the number of GP training places by 35 per cent, compared with the cap imposed on GP training places when the current Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Health and Ageing for four years.Thirdly, we the government have also made for the first time direct investments in emergency departments and elective surgery, in the case of elective surgery providing more than 60,000 additional procedures across the nation which would not otherwise have occurred, and the amount directly invested in elective surgery and emergency departments by our predecessors in government was zero.On top of that, the government has provided new incentives for doctors to work in rural and remote communities where the shortage of doctors is acute. We are also in the process of implementing the establishment of 36 GP superclinics - including the one at Strathpine - including the eight which are fully or partially operational and the 28 for which contracts have been signed, in contrast to the number of GP superclinics established by those opposite, which was zero.The government has also, in its two years in office, introduced free health checks for every four-year-old to make sure they are fit, healthy and ready to learn when school starts. And on the question of dental care, can I say this: with the introduction of the teen dental program, we are now providing teeth checks for our teenagers - nearly half a million across the country. How many dental services were provided for teenagers by those opposite? Zero. That is quite apart from those opposite having abolished once and for all the Australian dental scheme to look after, in particular, senior Australians who need dental care.That is what we have done in just two years. The challenge ahead is to deal with the challenges of the long-term future. The Minister for Health and Ageing today launched a campaign to combat illicit drug use across the nation. In 2007 more than one-third of the population aged over 14 years had used an illicit drug at least once in their lifetime. That is a stunning statistic. Among 14- to 19-year-old children, regular ecstasy use has rocketed in the last 10 years from less than one in a hundred in 1998 to nearly one in six in 2007. These are disturbing statistics. The government's campaign will help tackle drug use through a wide range of media which will expose young people to the true physical and psychological impacts of drug use.I conclude on the question of health policy by simply saying this: to fund the system for the future, you need to have a secure source of long-term revenue. What those opposite have done by blocking reforms to the private health insurance scheme is deny the investment of some $2 billion into our hospitals of the future. That is across the forward estimates. Expenditure on the PHI rebate is projected to grow at nine per cent a year over the 10 years from 2012-13 onwards, adding a cumulative $33 billion to spending over the next decade. Our reforms are fair, they are principled and they go to those who most need them, as opposed to private health insurance subsidised by the taxpayer for people on $200,000, $300,000 and $400,000 a year, like the Leader of the Opposition and myself, who do not need it.Therefore, for the future this country will build on the health and hospital reforms that we have undertaken in the two years we have been in office already. This will be a big year for health and hospital reform. Australia needs better health and better hospitals. This government will get on with the business of delivering that for all Australians across our country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. I am certain he is also asking that question based on the interests of his constituents. Firstly, I would say in response to the honourable member's question that the government will check as many Australian homes as is necessary. Secondly, I would say in response to the honourable member's question that householders who have foil insulation can get their homes checked right now and do so at the government's expense. Every householder can right now contact a licensed electrician to conduct a safety inspection of their home. Householders will not be put out of pocket for any inspection or rectification works because the electrician will be paid directly by the government. Thirdly, this is available to any householder right now.In terms of non-foil insulation, can I add to my answer to the question posed by the member for Hume. Most of the installations of non-foil insulation - that is, pink batts - were conducted by reputable firms. I am advised that there, of course, have been a number of shonky operators who have done substandard installations. I am advised that more than 92 per cent of roof inspections have identified no safety issues whatsoever and that this is 92 per cent of a sample partly targeted to identified risks in the community. The government will target these homes for inspection first. This risk based audit will be extended further if necessary to any segments of household deemed to be at risk. As I said yesterday, any individual household that, having obtained an inspection by a reregistered home insulation installer, is not happy with that can contact the government direct and a further inspection will be undertaken.As for the future, the standards which will apply forward for insulation installers will be as follows: all installers will be required to be reregistered, all will be required to pay a cash bond, all will be required to show evidence of meeting the training and skills requirements which the government has established and all will be required to provide certified quality assurance and occupational health and safety plans. That is the advice that I have received.I would also, in response to the member for Hume, add this to my answer concerning the standards which apply to the industry, both for training and quality. Under the Home Insulation Program, the government introduced more regulation to the industry than had applied ever before to the insulation industry: firstly, the first national skills requirements for installation contractors; secondly, the first accredited training courses for installers to be put in place; and, thirdly, the first occupational health and safety standards for the insulation industry.I say to the member for Hume, in terms of dealing with the practical problems on the ground for his constituents and the constituents of other members here: we will deal with each of these practical problems as they arise, both for workers, for installers who run good companies, as well as for householders and the concerns they have. I look forward to any representations from the member for Hume or any members opposite in terms of particular concerns in their electorates.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question, particularly because she has one of the GP superclinics in her electorate, but also because I understand that the Daylesford University of the Third Age is with us in the gallery today. I hope you enjoy your experience here in the parliament. You have a very good member of parliament.Last week I was pleased to be able to visit Ballan to be able to have a look at how the Ballan superclinic is going from strength to strength. I can tell the parliament that more than 17,600 people have presented at the Ballan superclinic since it opened late last year. Such is the demand for, as an example, optical services, which have not been provided in the community before, that they are now being offered weekly instead of monthly. Last month, as a number of people in this House would be aware, I officially opened Queensland's first superclinic at Strathpine. This $2½ million superclinic has been delivered two months ahead of schedule. Members of the Strathpine community are now enjoying increased access to primary healthcare services, Medicare-eligible services are being bulk-billed and multidisciplinary care, on offer at the clinic, is available seven days a week. - I notice that the member for Dickson is interjecting. He might be interested to raise his objections to the GP superclinic with two of his constituents, Lisa and Olivia Graham, who gave the superclinic the thumbs up in the Northern Times, one of the local papers. After having called five medical centres, the only place that was open and willing to treat Olivia, after she injured herself on Sunday, was the Strathpine superclinic. Mrs Graham says that, without the superclinic:_ we would have sat for hours in emergency _In the same article, superclinic director, Dr Evan Jones said that each weekend the clinic is:_ treating 120-130 patients who otherwise are likely to have turned up at emergency wards.This passes the common-sense test in the community - that, when 60 per cent of Australians are finding it hard to access a GP after hours, these sorts of services can provide more support. - Those opposite are asking for updates about other superclinics, which I am more than happy to provide to them. Across the country, 29 contracts have been signed. I have mentioned the state-of-the-art superclinic in Ballan in the member for Ballarat's seat. I have mentioned the thumbs up that the mum gave to the Strathpine superclinic and I can also talk to you, for example, about the services that are being provided at seven other sites, including Palmerston in the member for Solomon's seat. The superclinic there is still on track. Actually, when I was there a couple of weeks ago -  -  - Those opposite might like to call out, but the member for Solomon, the local mayor and I inspected the enormous superclinic there which is growing daily and is obviously good for community members there. Perhaps people might be interested in the interim services that are being provided in the member for Riverina's electorate. Services are already being provided there. Other sites include Lake Macquarie, Devonport, Bendigo and the Blue Mountains. Construction and infrastructure is underway at 12 sites. I know that the member for Leichhardt was very pleased when the superclinic site there was chosen and work has commenced on that. I know that the member for Eden-Monaro was delighted - not only has a green light been given for the local superclinic but, this Monday, he was there when demolition was started to make way for the construction of the superclinic. I know that the member for Corio and the member for Corangamite are delighted that superclinic work has started - this is a report from October last year - and that their construction is going very well.I would also like to report to the House that university involvement in the superclinics has been astounding. There are 28 sites which have universities as part of their construction -  -  - It is very interesting, amongst the cat-calling, that the member for Parkes and the member for Wannon are being particularly quiet. They are two members who lobbied hard for their electorates to be added to the superclinics program. Although it may take time, they are very delighted that their electorates are getting these services. The point I was about to make was that the members for Corio and Corangamite are no doubt very pleased that Deakin University -  -  - has recently announced that, for the first time, they have appointed a chair of general practice who will be placed at the Geelong clinic. They see this as an important development in how we will train health professionals for decades to come. In just two years, we are changing the way services are provided and the way healthcare professionals will be trained. That is a record we are proud to stand by.</DOC>

 - I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that any industrial death in Australia is one death too many. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that any industrial accident, of which there are 138,000 in Australia each year, is one accident too many, and those are the ones that involve serious injury. These are challenges which governments of the day have to deal with and we have to reduce these, including in this sector. These four absolute tragedies are extreme, human, personal tragedies for the families concerned.As I said in response to an earlier question from the Leader of the Opposition, the challenges the government faces in dealing with this program and the Renewable Energy Rebate Program of the future are, firstly, to wrestle with the challenges faced by households - and they are real challenges - secondly, to deal with the real practical problems faced by workers losing their jobs and, thirdly, to deal with those concerns which members here and on the other side of the House have raised in relation to firms.I would also draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the response I gave, I think, to the question from the member for Hume before in terms of the results of the initial survey work done by the government in relation to those homes which were identified to be most at risk at this stage. There is much more work to be done, but the government intends to get on with the business of doing it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question, because there is more evidence this week in the economic data that economic stimulus has played a role in supporting jobs and, in particular, in supporting small business through this global recession. Yesterday's data on construction work done showed that the government's infrastructure stimulus was helping to offset the weakness in private activity. Everybody on this side of the House acknowledges the role that the stimulus is playing in supporting small businesses in their suburbs, in their towns and in their regions. It is terribly important at the moment because private non-residential construction activity fell by more than 20 per cent over the past year. But that has been offset by an increase of 42 per cent in public construction activity. That is what is so important at the moment, that is what is underpinning confidence and, of course, that is what is opposed by those opposite.If they had their way there would be tens of thousands of tradies out of work, and tens of thousands of small businesses would hit the wall. That is what these figures today show, because it is these shovel-ready projects that are supporting employment in small business. This is what the Commonwealth Bank economist James McIntyre had to say today, and it is a very important point:The public sector construction component of the stimulus package was designed to kick in with a lag as private sector construction activity fell away in response to the confidence shock of the global financial crisis. The timing and effectiveness of that design is evident in the fourth quarter of 2009. Effective public sector stimulus has kept overall activity from declining significantly.That is very important, but it is not understood by those on that side of the House and not understood by the Leader of the Opposition, who finds economics boring.Today we have also had the capex figures. They show that stimulus, again, is promoting activity. Private sector investment in equipment, plant and machinery rose by 12.4 per cent in the December quarter - again, welcomed on this side of the House. But most importantly, the ABS specifically pointed to the positive impact of the government's small business tax break in today's figures, noting that a large number of businesses reported they had taken up the scheme - further evidence of the importance of stimulus.Of course in the last week we have had the IMF, the OECD and the World Bank all supporting the government's position on stimulus and, of course, all of them have rejected the position of the opposition. So the shadow Treasurer has got it wrong, and has been proven wrong, by those three organisations this week.It is pretty true to say that the coalition economic team have had a shocker this week. This was demonstrated by a media release put out by the shadow Treasurer a couple of days ago. It really warmed my heart, because the lead paragraph referred to his fairy name, Tinkerbell. Thanks for reminding everybody in the country, Shadow Treasurer! Thanks for reminding us of that.In that press release, the member for North Sydney quotes me accurately - as it appears - pointing out that the RBA governor has clearly rejected any link between current spending and interest rates, and he has. That is denied by those opposite. But he then goes on to claim, and quotes me from some time ago, where he says I denounced excessive spending in the latter years of the Howard government, as if there were some contradiction. The problem here is that the shadow Treasurer and those opposite do not understand the difference between spending in a global recession when rates are at 50-year lows, and spending at the height of a boom when rates are 350 basis points higher. How economically illiterate can you get?The position put by those opposite has been repudiated by the Reserve Bank governor. He said this last Friday:This is a normal experience in an economic expansion: as economic activity normalises interest rates do the same _So why is it that we are getting such erratic behaviour from those opposite? I think we got a clue on ABC Sydney 702 this morning. We got a rare insight into the shadow Treasurer. There was a call to the program of Adam Spencer:Spencer: Helen's on the line. How are you, Helen?Helen: I'm very well, Adam, how are you?Spencer: I'm very well, thanks. What would you like to ask?Helen: I'm sure the champion bogong moth eater at St Aloysius was none other than Joe Hockey.I think we know why he is so erratic. He has been eating too many bogong moths. This is what the CSIRO -  - It is yet another example which demonstrates why we have got the worst opposition frontbench in Australian history. This is what the CSIRO says about bogongs:They prepare for summer by building fat reserves (up to 60 per cent of their bodyweight).</DOC>

 - One of the families has contacted me and I have written a letter to that family. That was entirely appropriate given the sentiments expressed by the family concerned. Secondly, each of these families is experiencing great tragedy and any death in this industry or any industrial death is one death too many for the nation. Certainly, for the families concerned they are all unspeakable tragedies. There are 300 industrial deaths in this country each year.I would also say in response to the Leader of the Opposition that any such death is a matter of profound regret to all concerned Australians, including me and including the government. The key challenge is to get on with the business of establishing the facts concerning each of these industrial deaths. The coronial inquiries, the WorkCover related inquiries and the Electrical Safety Office inquiries are all the properly constituted bodies to establish the facts concerning each of these tragedies. That is the case with practically all industrial accidents which occur in this country. I believe it is important to allow those processes to continue. I believe they are best done in a spirit of calm deliberation. It is regrettable that any deaths occur, including these four tragedies.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I would say all members of this House, but the member for Solomon and the member for the Lingiari particularly, understand just how significant the need is in many remote Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. That is why we have persevered in the Alice Springs town camps and got the deal that has been long needed to make a start on improving the living conditions for Indigenous people who live in those town camps.Work has now started in these town camps but we do have an enormous amount to do as we work with local Aboriginal people to confront what remains one of the most disadvantaged places in our country. Just last Monday both the member for Lingiari and I were in Alice Springs and we went to one of the town camps, Larapinta Valley. We visited one of the building sites for the new housing that has now started in that town camp and we were able to see the work that is underway. We met the woman and some of the children who are going to be moving into this house. They are very pleased because at the moment they are living next door in very cramped and overcrowded conditions - there are two adults with six children living there - and they are very much looking forward to being able to move into their new home.One of the very important parts of this task that we have embarked on is that we have set ourselves and the contractors the requirement that there will be local Aboriginal employment. We were able to meet with 12 of the Aboriginal men who are now engaged in building these homes in the town camps. They have been trained as trade assistants and they are now working on site. It felt like 40 degrees in the shade; nevertheless, people were out there starting to get the formwork ready for these new houses. I think everybody here would recognise just how important it is that we have local people engaged in getting a job and holding down a job. It was significant to see the pride already being taken by the people who are employed to build these houses. All of us know and they now know just how critical it is for parents to have a job, to go out each day and to be the role models that they want to be for their children. What we want to do is see more and more Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory getting jobs as part of our housing program.Across all of the camps in Alice Springs now all of the clean up and the 'fix and make safe' work has been completed. Although it may not seem a big deal for everybody in this chamber, one of the things that has also been achieved is that we are now starting a regular weekly rubbish collection. Wheelie bins have been delivered and a normal weekly rubbish collection will now start. The other works completed, which are very significant, are the installation of temporary accommodation facilities, sewer inspections, site surveys, geotechnical testing - all of this work is now well and truly completed. Additional family support programs, alcohol abuse programs and managed accommodation for visitors to the town are also underway.One of the other very significant developments at one of the town camps, Ilpeye Ilpeye, is that as a result of the changed tenure arrangements we are now able to sit down, as we did on Monday with the local residents, and talk about the possibility of homeownership. These are very significant changes for the residents of Ilpeye Ilpeye and, although it is a big challenge for all of us, we are able to do so because of the trust that we have in each other. There is an enormous amount more to be done in the Alice Springs area, particularly in these town camps, but with the goodwill that is now very much evident between the residents, both levels of government and the town council we are able to get on with the job that has been a very long time coming.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I know she would have asked it in relation to the concerns of her constituents. The first thing I say in response to the honourable member's question is that the advice that we have received is that more than 92 per cent of roof inspections have identified no safety issues whatsoever - and that is 92 per cent of a sample partly targeted at identified risk areas. I simply emphasise that point. The second thing I say in response to the honourable member's question is that the inspection process, which can be activated by concerned members of the public, involves whether the installing company have been reregistered by the government because they are good performers with a good industry track record. Then they would conduct that inspection in the first instance. That is the first point.Secondly, if under any circumstances a member of the public is unhappy with that company either doing that work or having conducted it found that it is not to their satisfaction, they are open to the recourse of having the government provide a different person to make that check. On the rest of the provisions concerning individual liabilities -  - The nature of my response to the honourable member's question was to put the actual inspection process into its proper context. Secondly, the honourable member asked questions concerning individual households and the applicability of insurance policies. As the honourable member would be familiar with, that would be entirely dependent on the nature of each individual's circumstances and each individual household. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question because it is about a practical approach to how we as a nation move forward to a low-emission economy. In that context, whilst we remain in a state of waiting for the outcome of the complex debate in the Senate about how we put a price on carbon, the government moves forward with a key focus on the issue of technology. It is in that context that I remind the House that one of the key components of the government's budget last year was a $4.5 billion clean energy initiative. Central to that is a focus on carbon capture and storage. I also remind the House of key grants in areas such as trying to facilitate the development of a geothermal industry in Australia.That takes me back to a key component of the clean energy strategy, the government's $1.6 billion commitment to the Solar Flagships program, which is about bringing forward in a great leap the commercial deployment of solar energy in Australia. The program itself represents potentially the biggest commercial deployment of solar energy in the world -  - As the member for Flinders reminds me, this government is doing something that the Howard government failed to do - that is, trying to target the introduction of 1,000 megawatts of electricity generation from solar capacity. Hopefully, as a result of this program we will put four on-grid solar power stations in the commercial energy market, aimed not only at the commercial deployment of solar energy but also at a potential breakthrough on storage capacity which is central to the development of renewable energy in Australia.On that question, I was fortunate enough last Saturday to visit King Island with the member for Braddon where the government is focused on not only major on-grid solar energy development but also standalone small-grid capacity which is so important to remote areas of Australia. I saw on King Island an Australian government contribution of $15.2 million through the government's Renewable Energy Demonstration Program for a standalone grid operation bringing together solar, biomass and wind power aimed at both peak and base load capacity. This is potentially a very important project for King Island and also for Australia, especially remote communities.In the context of where we are going on the major Solar Flagships program, a world first, I am pleased to say that the government has now completed calling for interest in the first round aimed at targeting 400 megawatts of grid connected solar generation which closed on 15 February. I am pleased to report to the House that my department has received a total of 52 applications representing significant interests by state and territory governments and the business sector in this key clean energy initiative. The department's association with a committee of technical experts selected to assess these programs will now go forward with the initial assessments. I am delighted to report to the House that the quality of the applicants is exceptionally important, going to not only the potential testing of solar thermal but also potentially testing on-grid solar PVs.It also brings me to the question of the energy system in Australia, which requires certainty. We clearly have a responsibility to invest in technology, but in terms of actually resolving our energy questions there is also a primary need to resolve the debate about a price on carbon. I simply say that, from the point of view of the energy ministerial council of Australia, this is an issue of major significance because we have potentially $100 billion in new investment to maintain the reliability of the existing system over the next decade, which confronts the business sector, state and territory governments and the Commonwealth in Australia.In that context, I simply say to the House that the greatest risk to actually achieving that $100 billion in investment is the coalition, and that goes to decisions for investment in new generation - investments we actually require to ensure reliability of the electricity system in Australia. I understand from the nature of the ministerial council that, in terms of some of these investments, time is running out. I say that because we are fast approaching a significant reduction in the reserve base- and peak-load capacity in Australia, which potentially raises serious questions about energy reliability at particular times of the year.So I raise for the proper consideration of the Australian community the requirements not only to support the Australian government's clean energy strategy, including the solar energy strategy, but also to send a message to the coalition in no uncertain terms that they are the biggest risk to the reliability of the electricity system in Australia because without a price on carbon we will not attract the necessary investment to guarantee the operation of the system in the years to come. I say in conclusion that it is exceptionally important that we continue to proceed to make the necessary technological breakthroughs to ensure the commercial deployment of renewable energy on a large scale and, in doing so, to make practical endeavours to reduce greenhouse emissions in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question and the interest that he raises here on behalf of a constituent and an insulation company. If I take the member's statements to the House at face value and if they are accurate then they would reflect unacceptable treatment of the firm concerned. Therefore, the Commonwealth should be in the business of making sure that its bills are paid on time. Therefore, under the circumstances raised by the member, if they prove to be accurate then action will be taken to ensure that our contractual obligations are met.Secondly, in response to the other part of the honourable member's question, which goes to the specific circumstances of the firm and the financial pressures which the firm is under as a result of the government's decision to abolish this program - as called for by the opposition, including the honourable member himself - I would draw the honourable member's attention to the three specific sets of measures outlined in the government's statement yesterday on support for individual workers. That is relevant to firms and their ability to retain workers as well.Thirdly, in terms of transitional assistance for firms affected by this decision on the part of the government, we are still working through, with the industry, other appropriate forms of transitional assistance. But I would return to the initial part of my answer, which dealt with the concerns which the member has raised about bills not being paid on time. If that proves to be accurate, as I said, that is unacceptable and we will attend to ensuring that it is rectified as a matter of urgency.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. Foreign investment is very important for Australia's economy, particularly for creating jobs and generating wealth, and it has always been important for our economy. Foreign investment adds to the pool of investment in our economy, it adds to jobs, it adds to economic activity - it does not displace it - and Australia has always been a major capital importer in order to drive growth and job opportunities.It is therefore vital that we maintain international confidence in Australia's economy - absolutely crucial. I note with some pride in Australia - and I would like to think that the people on the other side would join me in this - that the OECD report on Australia's regulation and economy released last week broadly indicates that Australia is a role model for other countries in this regard.Unfortunately, not everybody who seeks to manage Australia's economy and public finances understands the importance of foreign investment and the importance of maintaining confidence in Australia's economy. This week the shadow finance minister, Senator Joyce, in fact raised doubts publicly about Australia's ability to repay its foreign debt - essentially private debt contracted to invest in Australia. I am not quite sure that, when he made these comments, he actually knew what he was talking about, because in these comments he referred to a new economic concept, the concept of 'gross net debt', which is something that was unknown to the world of economics until the shadow finance minister raised it. For his information, and for any others who are confused about these concepts, 'gross' is what I owe and 'net' is what I owe minus what I am owed. That is a simple statement for Senator Joyce of the difference between these two concepts. I note that the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, very quickly distanced himself from this new economic principle that Senator Joyce had announced.Senator Joyce has, of course, had a rather interesting week. When at the beginning of the week I noted in the House that he appeared to have gone a bit quiet and I joked that maybe he had been abducted by aliens, he felt the need to put out a press release demonstrating that he had not been abducted by aliens. It is a true story. I know it is pretty bizarre, but it is true. In fact, the press release was headed 'Aliens'. He felt obliged to point out that the evidence to disprove this suggestion was that he had put out two press releases in the last 24-hours and, therefore, the alleged abduction had not occurred. I am prepared to take it at face value that he has not been abducted, but they may have taken over his body!I note he also described a major government economic policy this week as 'a farcical, poisonous piece of pathos'. That is a tongue twister to rival all tongue twisters. I am not quite sure yet what it means; nonetheless he is having a go. This drivel may at one level be entertaining, but for Australia it is very serious, because international markets are, as we all know, fragile. The global economy is still fragile. The attitudes that international investors have to Australia's economy and to the state of our finances, both private and public, are critical to the price of capital that private investors have to pay. They are critical to the value of the Australian dollar. They are critical to generating jobs. They are critical to generating economic growth. Any suggestion that Australia will be unable to pay its foreign debt in the future is simply playing with fire. If such a statement had been made by a finance minister or treasurer, positions that Senator Joyce and the member for North Sydney aspire to hold, the ramifications would have been extremely serious for Australia.In conclusion, I would like to make several things plain. As the Reserve Bank governor has stated clearly, the Australian government debt is low, it will remain low and the Australian government can comfortably repay that debt in the future. Second, the Australian government is committed to both getting the budget back into surplus as quickly as possible and repaying that debt. Thirdly, Australia's foreign debt is entirely sustainable and is driving growth and jobs. I remind the opposition that if they want to enter into a debate about our foreign debt they need to recall the fact that the most recently published figure for Australian foreign debt as a percentage of GDP was actually slightly lower than the figure that they left us when they left office. If you want to treat Senator Joyce's claim seriously then he is attacking the legacy that the Howard government left this government. The truth is that both government debt and foreign debt are entirely sustainable and Senator Joyce is off the planet.</DOC>

Secondly, I say to the honourable member in response to his question that, that decision having been taken and with the employment consequences and industry consequences flowing, those opposite now talk about the employment consequences as if it has been a continuing concern of theirs. I also say in response to the honourable member's question that the package of measures announced around the insulation workers assistance plan yesterday applies to all employees of the industry.

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question; it is indeed two years this week since we as the government introduced our legislation to create Infrastructure Australia, fulfilling yet another election commitment. Infrastructure Australia got to work immediately. - Indeed, the member for North Sydney, who has already been warned, knows full well that Infrastructure Australia go to work immediately. -  - We created the first national audit of infrastructure. - We created the first pipeline of projects. We introduced new policy and guidelines -  -  - Infrastructure Australia has brought together the three tiers of government with the private sector to advise the government on investment but also on regulatory and policy reform. Today we announced another milestone has been reached in our commitment to have single national transport regulators by 2013. This is important microeconomic reform that will have significant productivity benefits. -  - Those opposite dismiss this. They could not do it. They could not even try to do it in 12 years. We have replaced nine heavy vehicle regulators with one, replaced seven rail safety regulators with one and established a single national maritime safety regime. Today we announce that the Queensland government will host the future national heavy vehicle regulator. It is now setting up a project office to draft the necessary legislation and delivery arrangements. This will produce one set of rules delivered consistently - a one-stop shop for trucking companies to access the road network and a national centre to drive improvements in productivity. -  - Those opposite dismiss this reform, because they simply forgot about the productivity agenda during their last period in office. They may have their position, but the conservatives around the country do not agree with them. The New South Wales opposition has promised to introduce Infrastructure New South Wales. The Tasmanian opposition are running in the Tasmanian election on introducing Infrastructure Tasmania. Infrastructure Australia visited New Zealand to help the incoming conservative government establish a similar body in New Zealand. Elsewhere around the globe, the UK government have announced the creation of Infrastructure UK. All of these bodies have been created based on the model established here in Australia. That model has led to real investment - record investment, in road and rail. It is not acknowledged by those opposite. Indeed the shadow finance minister had this to say:Can you take me to the area where the massive new sort of rail infrastructure is or can you take me to the area where the major roads are. They're not there, and the money is gone, but we've got nothing for it.That is the attitude of those opposite. I say to them: go to the Ipswich Motorway, go to the Bruce Highway, go to the Pacific Highway, go to the Hume Highway and go to the national rail network, which now exists from Perth to Brisbane for the first time as a result of the economic stimulus plan of this government. They simply do not get it. That is why, in Senate estimates a couple of weeks ago, they asked no serious questions about infrastructure and they did not ask a single question about the national port strategy or the national freight strategy that Infrastructure Australia is delivering; they did spend half an hour asking about the number of pot plants in my office, because that was the priority of those opposite, because they simply do not take the infrastructure challenge of this country seriously.</DOC>

Given the record of those opposite on questions of providing Indigenous people with the opportunities to fulfil their aspirations, I am happy to take a question from them. If the honourable member had been paying any attention at all to the public statements by this government in respect of the World Heritage nomination, he should be well aware that the government has always made it perfectly clear that any negotiations going forward in terms of tentative listing are dependent upon the full consent and participation of Indigenous people in Cape York, and that is as it should be.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question, which I think is a very relevant one on a day when we have been treated to the remarkable spectacle of the party of Work Choices pretending that it cares about working people. On this side of the House, we will always stand for the principle of 'a fair days work deserves a fair days pay' and we will always stand for the principle that it is vital for working people to be able to get jobs, which is why we moved quickly and decisively to stimulate employment in the Australian economy during the global financial crisis and the global recession. Whereas, despite all of their feigned concern for working people, sitting opposite us is the party of Work Choices, the party that did not support economic stimulus and did not support Australian jobs. If they had had their way, more than 200,000 extra Australians would be out of work today.I am asked about recent commentary on industrial relations. I have studied recent commentary on industrial relations and am therefore in a position to tell the House - as remarkable as today's spectacle has been - about something even more remarkable. Of course, we know that the current Leader of the Opposition is the fourth person to lead the Liberal Party in two years. But I have discovered from looking at recent commentary that there are actually two Leaders of the Opposition at the moment. There are two Tonys, and the two Tonys say quite different things depending on the audiences that they are talking to. So, last Tuesday, when the Leader of the Opposition was out in the full glare of the press cameras, knowing that he was speaking to the Australian people, he said, 'Work Choices is dead.' He was full of reassurances - 'Work Choices is dead.'But there is another Tony Abbott, another Leader of the Opposition, and this is the Leader of the Opposition who was speaking at a Chamber of Commerce and Industry lunch in Brisbane. When he thought he was amongst friends and thought he was talking to employers, he thought he could get out the truth. In those circumstances, the Leader of the Opposition verified that, if he were elected Prime Minister, individual statutory employment agreements would be back - Australian workplace agreements would be back. And we know that one of the principal uses of these Australian workplace agreements was to strip away penalty rates. For working families under cost-of-living pressures, we on this side of the House understand that it is vital to have a job and it is vital to be fairly treated at work, including receiving penalty rates. On the other side of the House, they do not understand the importance of jobs, and the Leader of the Opposition has verified that, if he was Prime Minister, there would be individual statutory employment agreements that strip away penalty rates.As deeply divided as they are on so many questions, there is a unity ticket amongst those opposite on this. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, obviously having got the cue from the Leader of the Opposition, was on radio singing from the same song sheet. She said:Bringing back inflexible working conditions such as the penalty rates regime is costing employers more _So, from her point of view, this is all about taking costs away from employers. What she does not understand is that that is ripping money out of the pay packets of hardworking Australians. But the unity ticket continues. The Leader of the Opposition wants to knock off penalty rates, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wants to knock off penalty rates, and then they are supported by the current spokesperson for workplace relations, Senator Abetz, who got on the radio and said, 'Julie Bishop is absolutely right.' They have a unity ticket on knocking off penalty rates. That is what the Liberal Party stand for.We also have to remember that the Leader of the Opposition has not only confirmed individual statutory employment agreements to knock off penalty rates; he has also confirmed that he is going to rip away the ability of workers to complain about unfair dismissals. So you can see the two-act play here, can't you? If the current Leader of the Opposition becomes Prime Minister, on day one, the employer can tell you 'no more penalty rates' and, if you complain about it, on day two, you can be sacked without any reason or any remedy given to you.We all should have known this from having a look at the Leader of the Opposition's book Battle Lines. I know that not everybody was intrigued enough to buy a copy - and I certainly do not recommend that people do. - I cannot hear you. How many did you sell? - The Leader of the Opposition is verifying that there were 20,000 Australians with questionable taste who went and bought the book - not a significant percentage. -  - Of course, some had to buy it for work purposes. If you actually look at the book, there it is - all verified by the Leader of the Opposition. He is there saying, 'Work Choices wasn't all bad.' Well, now we know what he means: he did not like the title 'Work Choices' but he did like the substance of Work Choices. Maybe he did not like the mouse pads and what we will see from him these days are golf balls to sell his new industrial relations plan. But, whatever you call it and whatever propaganda you use to sell it, it is bad for working Australians - and they know that.</DOC>

 - I take it this is the policy which the member for North Sydney was consulted on prior to it being announced by the Leader of the Opposition over the last 24 hours - and the shadow minister for finance as well was consulted. We understand there has been a pretty active debate in the joint coalition party room this morning because they were not consulted on this policy or 'sort of' policy before it was dropped out.Can I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition as he seeks to try and rake over some of the difficulties which have arisen in what could be described as the 'policy development process' underpinning their approach to paid parental leave, paid maternity leave, that it follows that we on this side of the House are proud of the fact that we are the first government to introduce paid parental leave. For 12 years those opposite sat there and occasionally pontificated on the subject, occasionally bleated solidarity about the issue, but did absolutely nothing. The Leader of the Opposition of course was a cabinet minister in that government. One would have thought that if he was committed to paid maternity leave or paid parental leave that just something, just something, might have happened in the period when he was around the cabinet table. But nothing - until yesterday.There was fun and games in the joint party room today as people scratched their heads and said, 'Where did this policy come from?' What happened within, shall we say, the economic leadership of those opposite in deciding whether the approach they put forward was financially sustainable? It did not happen because, once again, this was policy making on the run, ill-considered and without any costings attached to it. -  - Regrettably, as they bleat their opposition, it would be nice to know that, just once, a fully costed and considered policy was put out by those opposite. We have not seen one so far.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the member for Solomon for his question. When it comes to health and hospitals, I had the privilege recently of being in Darwin for the opening of the new integrated cancer care centre. -  - Can I say to those opposite as they turn up the volume meter in this place -  - When I visited Darwin with the member for Solomon, what we did together was open a new integrated cancer care centre, which was at the Royal Darwin Hospital. Question: 'What happened under the 12 years that those opposite were in government in terms of cancer services for the good people of the Northern Territory?' What I was told on the ground in the Northern Territory is that, including for the four or five years when the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Health, for cancer related services people had to jump on the plane to Adelaide, drive to Adelaide - get to Adelaide somehow. But now, through the practical work on the ground by the minister for health and others and in response to the representations from the member for Solomon, we have delivered that real service for people on the ground.On health and hospitals, the health minister and I have been consulting public hospitals around the country over the last six months, including the Nepean in Western Sydney and hospitals in Lismore and Port Macquarie. The overwhelming response from doctors, nurses, patients and working families is that they want fundamental reform to the future of the hospital system of Australia. They do not want half-measures, they do not want bits of sticky tape, they do not want bandaids; they want to see the health and hospital system fundamentally reformed.When we look at the needs across the country, all of our hospital system is being confronted with this core challenge - an increasing population, an ageing population, an increase in chronic diseases as well as chronic workforce shortages. That is why we as a nation, including the state and territory health budgets, face this growing funding gap between the demand being put on our system and the existing supply of hospital and health services, including an inadequate supply of doctors, an inadequate supply of nurses and an inadequate supply of nursing beds. Yet some in this country still say that fundamental reform is not necessary. We say they are wrong.That is why the government, in the course of the last week, has announced the establishment of a new National Health and Hospitals Network, which will be funded nationally and run locally. That is the plan that we are putting to the Australian people. This is the single biggest reform to Australia's health and hospital system since the introduction of Medicare to deliver better hospitals and better health care for all Australians, nationally funded, locally run. The Australian government will, for the first time, become the dominant funder of the buildings, the equipment, the teaching, the training and the operating costs of Australia's public hospital system. That has not been the case in the past.The national network will enable all hospitals in Australia to comply with tough national standards on quality, performance and clinical standards. It also means that patients will not be shunted from one health service to another - one federally funded, one state funded - because, for the first time, we will have a single dominant national funder. Beyond that, we will have, through these local hospital networks, a national system which is capable of being run locally - run locally because local clinicians, local doctors, local nurses and local health experts are the individuals in the best position to know how local health services should be delivered. This is about maximising local decision-making power. That is why we have had the Australian Medical Association come out in support of the government's proposal. The president of the association said that this decision maximises local decision-making. The Australian Nurses Federation has come out and said:The move by the Commonwealth Government to become the majority funder of health care will help stop cost shifting and duplication in hospital funding.That is our plan for the future.Beyond hospitals, the Australian government is now becoming the 100 per cent funder of non-hospital health care in GP and GP related services. That is what the government proposes to do. The Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Health and Ageing for five years. What did he say to the Australian people back then? He said that the Australian government should take over the health and hospital system of the country. He had five years as health minister to act on that and he did not a thing - except this: when he had the opportunity, he reached into the pockets of the public hospitals of this country and ripped out $1 billion worth of funding. He then froze GP training places and, on top of that, he gave us all that rock-solid, ironclad guarantee that nothing - repeat: nothing - about the Medicare safety net would change. That is the Leader of the Opposition's record as health minister for four or five years. This government is getting on with fundamental reform of the health and hospital system and I recommend that those opposite get behind this important reform for the nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Murray for her question which began with the financial impact of the government's proposed paid parental leave. She asked why people would only get $9,788. I say to the member for Murray: that is $9,788 more than your government ever provided to anybody. That is because those opposite, in their 12 years in office, refused to lift a finger and do a thing for paid parental leave - not a thing.This debate about paid parental leave is particularly interesting because it goes to the credibility of those opposite on two fronts. Let us simply go to front number one, which is about this minor promise which those opposite, led by the Leader of the Opposition, gave on taxes. Six weeks ago, the Leader of the Opposition said he would not raise taxes to fund policy proposals. He said:We won't increase taxes. There will be no new taxes. There will be no increased taxes.Now there is to be a 1.7 per cent levy on businesses in Australia. How can the Leader of the Opposition stand there with any credibility on the question of his commitments about no new taxes when, six weeks later - he did not even make the 100 days mark - he is in there fundamentally violating one of his first commitments to the Australian people? He says, 'No new taxes' one day and then, suddenly, whacks a huge tax on business the next day.There is a more fundamental question of credibility because - those opposite and the member for Murray know exactly where I am going with this - the Leader of the Opposition has said in the past that there should be no such thing as paid maternity leave. Several years ago, he said:I am dead against paid maternity leave as a compulsory thing.That was the position of belief. That was 'straight-talking Tony'. That was the Leader of the Opposition who says he never changes his position, but suddenly, it seems, the circumstances change. Having been challenged on it since he became Leader of the Opposition, he went out and said, 'Well, of course, we would not be funding that from business.' Then the member for Murray says, 'Of course, he would not be funding it from business.' Now we find that they do propose to fund it from business. - On the $10,000 or thereabouts that the member for Murray referred to in her question, I go back to what I said at the outset - it is $10,000 more than was ever, ever offered by those opposite. Secondly, the member for Murray has asked why would working families want to receive such a small amount relative to what they suggest. Can I suggest that those same working families might be interested in something else - it is called penalty rates. It is called their basic working conditions. It is called unfair dismissal. It is called the introduction of AWAs. It is called Work Choices. When you take home your pay at the end of the week, you are confronted with a few things. One is whether your fundamental conditions of work have been blown apart, and working families depend on penalty rates. Those opposite have said that they will take them away. Secondly, if paid maternity leave is drawn upon, the $10,000 we are speaking of, taking the number at face value from what the member for Murray has just said, is $10,000 more than was ever offered by those opposite. It comes back to credibility. The Leader of the Opposition said he never believed in it - now he does. He said he would never increase taxes - now he will. The member for Murray said it would never be taken from business - now it is. Is it any wonder we all wonder what will next come forth from the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition, given that his crack economic team did not know about this scheme until he opened his mouth about it yesterday?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. The government is committed to restraining growth in government spending to two per cent real per annum once trend growth in the economy resumes, partly in order to avoid raising taxes and also to ensure that the government can continue to honour its commitment to keep taxation as a proportion of our total economy at or below the level we inherited from the former Howard government. I note that the Leader of the Opposition has just announced a new policy of increasing company tax on Australia's biggest employers in order to pay for an open-ended paid parental leave scheme. It is somewhat difficult to pin down the details of the proposal from the Leader of the Opposition; indeed, it is somewhat difficult to pin down the authorship of this proposal as well. It would appear that the opposition cannot agree whether this is a tax or a levy. The shadow finance minister, Senator Joyce, says it is a tax; the member for Murray says it is a levy.The Leader of the Opposition cannot even agree with himself about what the threshold is - one minute he says the threshold is $5 million per annum in income for the company and the next minute he says it is $5 million of tax paid by the company. He did not consult his shadow finance minister about the scheme, even though he has just indicated that he was on the phone to the shadow finance minister about other matters. It appears that nobody quite knows whether this proposal has been to the shadow cabinet. The member for Fadden says that it has, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says it has not but it will, and the shadow minister finance is not quite sure whether or not it has. The Leader of the Opposition has admitted that he has not consulted major business about this proposal, even though, according to the member for North Sydney, this proposal constitutes a huge windfall for big business. So somehow we are expected to believe that a huge windfall is something they want to hide from major business. Of course, most significantly of all, in all this chaos and confusion on the other side there is one fundamental point, and that is that only a few weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition stood up and swore with his hand on his heart, 'We will not increase taxes; we will not introduce any new taxes.' Within a month or so of that commitment, when we are still months away from the scheduled election, he has now broken that commitment.Even if some of the complete chaos and confusion that reigns on the opposition side about this proposal is clarified, it still contains within it fundamental problems. The $5 million threshold for taxpaying companies is a major problem. Companies, by the sheer nature of fluctuations in the economic cycle and the business cycle, will move in and out of range. There is a disincentive for companies that are slightly below the threshold to grow, to add new workers and to increase their investment, and of course there is a fantastic incentive for artificial avoidance arrangements like the kind they encouraged on the waterfront with Chris Corrigan and Patrick in order to ensure that companies can be broken up into constituent components to avoid this additional tax slug.The key point is this: for all of their posturing about debt and deficit and all of the blowhard performances we have had to put up with over past years, all we get from the opposition is big new spending commitments - three spending commitments alone worth $18 billion over the next four years - and when finally, after still not having come up with one single spending cut and not one single savings measure, they are shamed into actually explaining where the money is coming from, guess where it is coming from? A big tax increase. They still are unable to specify any spending cuts that they would put in place. They block the spending cuts that the government put in its budget, and their only answer to financing their big spending, freewheeling promises is to increase taxes. Tax to the max, Tony's strategy, is not going to help Australian workers; it will slug businesses and jobs in order to provide more money for higher income earners. The Leader of the Opposition's cavalier approach to economic management demonstrates that he cannot be trusted to manage the Australian economy and the public finances of this nation, and his chaotic approach to managing the affairs of his own party shows that he cannot be trusted to manage the affairs of the Australian nation.</DOC>

 - I think working families are interested in a couple of things, one of which is to make sure that the work laws of this country are fair. They are interested to know whether they will still be paid penalty rates. They will be very interested to know whether they are still going to be protected from unfair dismissal. They are going to be very concerned about whether or not they are going to be forced onto new style AWAs. That is what working families are concerned about, because each and very one of those things means dollars in the pay packet and the ability to put food on the table.The second thing they are concerned about is people being fair dinkum about what is going to be delivered to them. What we have said is that we are delivering not through a tax on business but through the government stepping up to the plate and providing the paid parental leave scheme that the government proudly announced during the course of last year. We have costed it; we have done the right things about it. It is in the forward estimates for us to deliver. It comes into operation in 2011. That is what normal policy development is about. That is what we have done, that is what we stand for, and it is $10,000 more than was ever, ever put on the table by those opposite. Those opposite duck and weave around this fundamental breach in their commitment about no new taxes. This morning we heard the member for Murray asked about this - 'Well, we don't call it a tax; we call it 'an investment in human capital''. Good old Barnaby Joyce, when asked the same question, said, 'Um, certainly we have to acknowledge that this is a tax.' Thank you, Barnaby. We got it nailed in one from Barnaby. Those opposite are squirming because they have sought to try and put forward a policy snapped out of thin air. - The government is committed to some $731 million for Australia's first comprehensive paid parental leave scheme from 1 January 2011 - the first in this country's history. Secondly, the scheme will cost approximately $260 million per annum and will not be imposed on business. Thirdly, the scheme will provide the primary carer with 18 weeks postnatal leave paid at the adult federal minimum wage, currently $543.78 per week, more than those opposite had ever proposed when they occupied the Treasury bench. This is a real commitment; it is not a Leader of the Opposition thought bubble which is plucked out of space on a Monday morning.If those opposite were concerned about the question of paid parental leave, why is it that in their entire period of office Australia ended up as only one of two OECD countries not to have a comprehensive paid parental leave scheme? That is the legacy those opposite left Australians, that is the legacy those opposite left working families, and they now stand up here and pretend that this has been their concern all along. The Leader of the Opposition has been on the record a thousand times saying he never believed in it, then he changed, then he said he would bring it in but not tax people for it and now he is bringing it in and taxing people for it. Is it any wonder that people scratch their heads and wonder what will next come out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition as he simply makes one piece of policy up after another? The government's commitment is real. It is $10,000 more than was offered by those opposite. The government stands by its policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question on health. I must say it comes as some surprise that not a single member opposite has asked a question on health, when the Prime Minister announced last week the biggest change to our health system since the introduction of Medicare more than three decades ago. The National Health and Hospitals Network is going to change the way the Commonwealth funds hospitals. We will be funding local hospitals directly, through the local hospital networks, for each service that they provide. Gone are the days when the Commonwealth would simply hand over a blank cheque - something that the member opposite used to do, or he used to pull a few zeroes off the end of it first before he handed his cheque over - hoping that the funding would end up at the front line, where it is needed.With our hospitals network, there will be funding nationally but there will be control and running of these services locally. Funding hospitals on this basis will make sure that health funding ends up where the patients are, so it is particularly appropriate that the member for Deakin would ask this question, representing our growing suburbs, where there has not always been the hospital infrastructure that is needed. This is a way of directing funding to where the patients will be. It will not be directed through a centralised bureaucracy that might farm the money off elsewhere.The health reform commission estimated that the introduction of activity based funding alone - just that change - could lead to savings of between $500 million and $1.3 billion every year. This equates to between 1,300 and 3,150 hospital beds a year. That is at a minimum. That is the equivalent of adding the capacity of four Sunshine Hospitals - where the Prime Minister and I, with the member for Maribyrnong, visited on the weekend. Through this system, we will be able to see why, for example, Victoria's hospital costs are lower than other states' costs and apply any lessons learned across the whole health system.The price for each service is going to be determined by an independent umpire operating at arm's length from the government. It will draw on expert advice and will, of course, strike an appropriate balance between reasonable access, clinical safety and efficiency. Very importantly - because we understand that the cost of delivering services varies significantly around the country, especially in rural and regional areas - country prices will not be set with city assumptions. There will be a national efficient price with special loadings for rural service delivery.I would like to focus a little bit on this very important change to the system. I have noticed, for example, that the National Party is already out - desperately looking for relevance - pretending that this is going to close country hospitals across the country, when in fact the establishment of local hospital networks is a way to reinforce local autonomy for hospital decision making.I would like to tell you that we have received some support from within this parliament for the reforms. I would like to read to you just a short excerpt from the member for Lyne's press release. The member for Lyne and his local doctors made a very great impression on the Prime Minister at Port Macquarie, because the Prime Minister has been referring to them ever since. The member for Lyne said in his press release:The Prime Minister's announcements this week very much reflect the advice of doctors, nurses and other health professionals at that meeting and are therefore very much welcome on the mid-North Coast.He went on:By placing an emphasis on efficiencies at local hospital network level, these reforms are a slam dunk for our region and deserve the parliament's support.Hear, hear. But we have also had support from other quarters within the parliament. I would like to read you another endorsement of this idea:For instance you could fund the public hospital system on a case mix basis. That would force them to focus on services rather than on global budgets and it would mean that you would be getting what you paid for in a way the Commonwealth can't be sure now._            _            _I think if we focus on funding services, rather than just shovel the enormous pot of money into the State's coffers, we're more likely to get good services delivered to patients.I wonder who said that? I am happy to run a TAB if anybody wants to guess who might have said that. Of course it was the Leader of the Opposition, back in the good old days when he was the health minister - at a time when he actually thought about health, even if he actually never did anything to reform the system. It might have been a reflective moment, on The 7.30 Report in 2007, but his words are very clear:_ if we focus on funding services _ we're more likely to get good services delivered to patients.Now, Mr Abbott, it is time for you to decide if you can still stick by those words and support this plan in the nation's interests.</DOC>

 - It is pretty interesting that during this question time we have not had a single question on health. We announced the biggest reform to the health and hospital system across the nation and the Leader of the Opposition woke up yesterday and said, 'How can I possibly not engage in this debate? I know; I'll take a thought bubble out there on paid parental leave and, whack, we'll stick it out there.' Let us just call a spade a spade: that is exactly what is happening here.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked a question about why a person in a given income category would put trust in a system which we say will provide $10,000. I would say again to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the $10,000 that we provide is $10,000 more than she ever provided, $10,000 more than the Leader of the Opposition ever provided and $10,000 more than the Liberal Party ever thought of in the past - because, historically, the Liberal Party has been opposed to the very notion of paid parental leave and paid maternity leave.Look at the ideological position of the Leader of the Opposition where he has said time and time again over the years that he does not believe in this one bit. How do we go about trusting a bloke who said four weeks ago, 'No new taxes,' and four weeks later here is a big new tax? How do we trust a bloke who a few weeks ago said, 'We're only going to have paid parental leave but no impost on business,' and then a few weeks later turns that on its head? How do you trust a bloke who says throughout his life that he has never believed in this and then suddenly, as we move into an election year, he has discovered conviction and commitment and has believed in it all along?People are beginning to ask themselves some questions about this Leader of the Opposition but one of the biggest questions over here at the moment is: why has the good old member for North Sydney been so silent during all this debate? Joe has been left to one side in all the deliberations on this recent thought bubble. Barnaby has said that he was not consulted - but maybe there is a virtue in that - and Joe was not consulted. It was only Tony out there with the thought bubble of the day in order to take attention away from health and hospitals. I would suggest that the Leader of the Opposition frame a question on health and hospitals, given that as health minister he conspicuously failed to do anything at all about health and hospitals.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. Fundamental, long-term economic reform is required in this country to deal with fundamental, long-term challenges such as the funding of our health system and the ageing of our population. Fundamental, sustainable, long-term reform is needed to assist families get the balance right between work and family. But these things must be sustainable. They must be done in a thoughtful way and they must be done in an economically responsible way. That is what the government is doing with health at the moment. Our health and hospitals reform plan puts in place a sustainable funding model which will deliver reform over the long term. We will get rid of the old, fuzzy responsibilities and blank cheques of the old system and replace them with a new system that is long overdue.We know from the Intergenerational report which was brought down some months ago that health costs are expected to grow from 9.1 per cent of GDP in 2007-08 to 19 per cent of GDP in 2050. So there is a very big reform task ahead of this country - a reform task that was squibbed by those opposite when they were in government. We had two Intergenerational reports during that time and we did not get any fundamental reform at all flowing from those reports - most particularly in this urgent area of health, where the now Leader of the Opposition ripped out $1 billion from the health system, making the funding model even more unsustainable over time. But, of course, we have seen in this House today that those opposite are not interested in long-term reform. They would rather see the health system buckle under its own weight than put in place a sustainable funding model to shape up to the big challenges for the future. We on this side of the House are facing up to those challenges. A responsible opposition would have said, 'We'll examine this in some detail,' before they replied. But what actually happened? Dr No over there said no even before this policy was published. He said no even before we published the proposal. What that demonstrates is that those opposite are not interested in fundamental, long-term reform. Our proposal is fully funded over the forward estimates. Our proposal is consistent with the fiscal strategy. Our proposal can be implemented over time. That is why we are going out and talking to the community about its importance and talking to the states - because the country simply cannot afford to not put this reform in place.We are going about this in a considered way. Compare and contrast this to those opposite. First of all, the Leader of the Opposition said no. He was not even going to consider what was in a document he had not yet even read. But, of course, now we have seen further evidence of this confused and erratic approach from those opposite. What we have here from those opposite is a proposal which is going to put a large tax on business - and it has not even been run past the shadow Treasurer. It did not go anywhere near the shadow Treasurer. When the shadow Treasurer was questioned about this tax he called it a 'windfall gain'. Not even Barnaby would be that stupid! Not even Barnaby would call a new tax a windfall gain to the business community. Let us look at what the business community has said today. John Roskam said today that 'ultimately taxes on businesses' - whether they are big business or small business - 'are passed on to the consumers.' - Mr Speaker, I was referring to the sloppy behaviour of the shadow Treasurer. That is what I was referring to. He is somehow wanting to pretend that a very significant increase in the company tax rate is a windfall gain for companies. Fair dinkum; these people have simply lost the plot! And it does not matter where you look. We had three spokespeople this morning who could not define whether or not it was a tax. Barnaby finally, for once, got it right - he said it was a tax; the shadow minister over there said it was not; and the shadow Treasurer said it was a windfall gain. How Orwellian can you get!This is the least qualified economics team from an opposition in this parliament in decades and decades and decades. And it has been on display in this House day after day, and on display in the Senate day after day. Of course, that brings us to the Leader of the Opposition, who thinks that economics is boring. Well, there is proof positive of that today, isn't there? This is an opposition leader who changes his mind like he changes his shirt. He simply cannot be believed in anything that he says. He said three weeks ago, 'There will be no new taxes,' and today he pops up with a new 'windfall gain'. Fair dinkum! They have no credibility and no standing and no rigour.I was asked by the member for Kingston why this country needed long-term reform. It needs long-term reform because of the ageing of our population. It needs long-term reform so that we can maximise the opportunities for wealth creation that will come from growth in this region in the decades ahead. We on this side of the House are putting forward a serious program to deliver that to Australia. But we have a destructive, untrustworthy, risky opposition, who are simply trying to torpedo the serious long-term agenda every step of the way, and for that they will be condemned by the Australian people.</DOC>

 - My Speaker, the member for North Sydney must be concussed. He must have done a couple of rounds with Barnaby - fair dinkum! I mean, this is just completely irrational.On an earlier occasion during this session, or late in the last session, it was raised with me whether the use of unparliamentary expressions towards members of the other place should be tolerated. On that occasion I accepted that my initial response was wrong - I am responding to a point of order; if it is taking time, I apologise. On that occasion I indicated that my initial response was wrong and that there was protection about the use of unparliamentary expressions towards members of the other place. I am in a serious dilemma about whether parliamentary titles as they are used have ever been required in relation to senators in this place. But, if that is the indication that we have and if that is to be the procedure, then the use of a title, being the senator's name with the title before it, is what I will ask the Treasurer to place in his answer.An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - It is good to see your family-friendly practices, Mr Speaker.It is a bit rich getting a question on tax from those opposite in today's environment, where they cannot work out whether they are going to fund their new levy by having a tax on companies that turn over $5 million or on companies that pay tax on $5 million, thereby having a difference of 2,500 companies that were lost. - We will release the Henry review in plenty of time for a full discussion in this parliament and a full national debate, which we on this side of the House absolutely welcome. It will be out there in plenty of time for a full public debate. We welcome that debate because of all of the incompetence that has been demonstrated by those opposite here today. They have not got a clue what they are doing in terms of economic policy. We will release this report, prepared by an independent committee chaired by Dr Henry, in good time and in plenty of time for a debate. I welcome the debate in this parliament with those opposite. I welcome it because it goes to the very core of the long-term challenges facing this country. -  - We will see whether we get the same mad, populist response from those opposite when this debate comes out or whether we can as a community and a country have a mature debate about something as fundamental as the long-term reform of our tax system. But, from their behaviour today, I do not think we have a chance in hell.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Shortland for her question. She was a member of the cross-parliamentary committee in the last parliament that delivered the Blame game report, a very important report which the national plan that was released last week deals with - and which the previous government neglected to respond to. The National Health and Hospitals Network announced by the Prime Minister last week has been shaped and informed by the work of the 'blame game' committee that the member for Shortland and others were part of, the detailed work of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission and the work of health professionals, front-line doctors, nurses, allied health professionals and, most importantly, the community - the people who are the patients in our health and hospital system.This plan will make all Australians stakeholders in the reform of our health system. The Prime Minister, other ministers and I conducted more than 100 consultations across the country following the release of the reform commission's report, to road test the recommendations of the report and to seek the views of staff and patients on the front line. It is why we have developed a plan where the health system is funded nationally but run locally. The response from stakeholders, which I have been asked about, has been very enthusiastic. The AMA, the ANF, the Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association and the Business Council of Australia are just some of the key stakeholders who have backed the National Health and Hospitals Network.This network is a bold reform. Like all health reform, we know that it will unleash much debate. The government welcomes this debate. After more than a decade of complete inaction and neglect of health reform by the former government, it is well overdue. This is why it is disappointing, but not particularly surprising, that the Liberal Party has chosen to oppose our plan from the outset. As I think some other ministers have already mentioned, Mr Abbott said in December that he was going to oppose any health reform -  - I beg your pardon. He was the Leader of the Opposition, but only just, in December. That would make up for my mistake. The Leader of the Opposition, as he now is, said that he would oppose any health reform plan that was released by the government. He has no intention of playing any constructive role in health reform. He did not do so as minister and he clearly is not going to now as opposition leader. When it comes to health reform, I fear he is a leopard who cannot change his spots.The Leader of the Opposition, when he was the health minister, did see some of these problems. In fact, he is on the record as having called our health system and its funding arrangements a 'dog's breakfast', but he took no action to fix any of the problems. I do have to confess to the parliament that when I was in opposition I used to wonder how the health minister had time - in fact, weeks at a time - to go off on bike rides around the country and to actually do his job. Now, as the health minister, I have uncovered the answer to that. It is simply because the Leader of the Opposition was not actually doing his day job. He was never interested in health reform. He had plenty of time to go off bike riding, just as he has had plenty of time to be out playing Leyland brothers this week -  - I am sure that there are a lot of people on this side of the House who would pay a lot of money to not see Tony in his lycra ever again. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was asked about the community response and the broader response to our health reform plan. Because the Leader of the Opposition was away last week in Central Australia, he left the shadow health spokesperson in charge of the Liberal Party's response. Of course, this was always going to be a risky thing to do. The member for Dickson's first response was to claim that doctors and nurses spent all their days on Facebook. This was an absolute insult to hardworking doctors and nurses, and he should be ashamed of himself for having that as his first response. To the member for Dickson's credit, he then actually bothered to read the plan that had been announced, and he told 2UE and 2SM last Friday, 'There are parts of this that are positive and that we could support.' I would like to ask the member for Dickson or the Leader of the Opposition to tell us which parts they are.The Leader of the Opposition returned from his time in Central Australia to declare that in fact he opposes all of the package. We are struggling to understand what the opposition's alternative health policy is. Of course, there are many of us on this side of the House who remember what this Leader of the Opposition's approach to health reform was when he was a minister. I do not think there is anyone on this side of the House who cannot remember the Mersey hospital. At the previous election, the then Minister for Health and Ageing had a plan for one hospital. Now that plan has been vastly expanded. The Leader of the Opposition now has a plan for about 20 or 30 hospitals, some in Queensland and some in New South Wales - not even 10 per cent of our public hospitals. This just is not good enough. He also said that he wants to revisit local hospital boards, to have every single hospital compete with each other for staff and for funding. This is a policy that is so far past its use-by date that the Leader of the Opposition should have left it in Fossil Creek, where he was last week, because that is where it belongs. He needs to come clean with the public. He needs to tell us what his view is on health reform. He was not prepared to reform the health system when he was the minister for nearly five years. Now he is the Leader of the Opposition and he should get out of our way and let us do the job in the nation's interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. She is one of those members who have been campaigning for paid parental leave for a very, very long time, because she understands that giving mums and dads extra support so that they can spend more time with their babies means that babies will get a better start in life.That, of course, is the fundamental reason why the Rudd Labor government is introducing the first national paid parental leave scheme in our country's history. It is a reform that Australian parents have long been waiting for. They know that for 12 years the current opposition, when they were in government, did nothing to deliver paid parental leave. Even more so, this opposition leader campaigned for years against paid parental leave. For years he campaigned against paid parental leave, and of course parents now know that it was this Leader of the Opposition who said that over his dead body would he introduce paid parental leave.By contrast with the Leader of the Opposition, we are actually delivering paid parental leave. We asked the Productivity Commission to develop a scheme that was in Australia's best interests. We asked them to consult employers, unions and, most importantly, families. We also asked them for recommendations that would underpin strong economic growth as well as provide support for families, and that is exactly what we are delivering. Our scheme is based on the expert recommendations of the Productivity Commission, it is economically responsible, it is fair to families and fair to business and it is fully costed and fully funded. Unlike the opposition's scheme, which you would have to say is just on the never-never, our scheme is going to start on 1 January 2011, and Australia will finally get its first national paid parental leave scheme.Over the last few days we have seen the opposition trying to catch up, but if there is one thing that Australian families know it is that they cannot trust this Leader of the Opposition on paid parental leave. They know that this is just another policy con job from the Leader of the Opposition. Here are some of the responses to his latest thought bubble from members of very important industry groups and members of the media. Peter Anderson of ACCI - not someone who normally knocks the Leader of the Opposition - said that this is 'a mistake', that it is 'wrong' and that it is 'unfair'. Heather Ridout from the Australian Industry Group -  -  - Of course they just want to ignore all of the companies that are members of the Australian Industry Group - all of those employers doing a great job making sure that they help their companies get out of the difficult times they have been in. What Heather Ridout said is that this is 'bad policy' and went on to say it is 'the sort of policy you have when you are not serious about having a policy'. Peter Hartcher in today's Sydney Morning Herald -  - No wonder they don't want to hear this, because he said it was 'a pile of policy rubbish'. Michelle Grattan in the Age -  
 -  - Michelle Grattan in the Age summed it up this way:This will reinforce fears Abbott is flaky _ - Samantha Maiden in the Australian: 'a policy that is just too dumb to fly'. The opposition leader wants to throw out the Productivity Commission's serious piece of substantial work and replace it. This is his policy - just a couple of pages of ramblings from the Leader of the Opposition. - This is more evidence of the Leader of the Opposition talking first and thinking later. No costings, no detail, no time line - there is nothing in these few pages of ramblings from the Leader of the Opposition. This is creating massive uncertainty for Australian families and Australian businesses. They want certainty. They want to know that they are going to get Labor's paid parental leave scheme delivered on 1 January next year. They have been waiting for decades for this scheme. It is time the opposition delivered their support.</DOC>

 - I welcome a question from the Leader of the Opposition based on his new-found commitment to taxation rigour and properly funded and costed policies. As I said last week when I launched the National Health and Hospitals Network, our proposal falls entirely within the funding parameters put down in the current budget. It is a fully costed and provided-for plan. That is the first thing.The second thing is that, as the Leader of the Opposition will know full well, in terms of the future transfer of taxation burden what we have said is that the GST - one-third of it, approximately - should be instead dedicated to a new National Hospitals Fund - that is, one which is able to get behind the future growth of our health and hospital system and those doctors and nurses who need that support.The third thing I would say on the future of local hospital networks is this, and again I go back to the example of Port Macquarie. In Port Macquarie, what they said to me on the ground is that the current area system in which they are located is simply too big. What they want is something which deals with a local community of interest, involving one large hospital and a varying number of smaller hospitals within that community of interest - in his particular area, from memory, one at Wauchope and the other one being at -  - Kempsey - there you go. Therefore, what we have said in the document, if the Leader of the Opposition would bother to read it, is that we would envisage somewhere between one and five hospitals within a local hospital network. Secondly, I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that we would fund this on the basis of no net addition to bureaucracy. We have said that quite explicitly. -  - Those opposite obviously stand behind the current health system, which has far too much money wasted in state health bureaucracies. What the Australian people want is that money to be dedicated increasingly to front-line services with doctors and nurses, as well as extra hospital beds. Instead, those opposite seem to be defending the current situation, which they seem to regard as fine and dandy. What did the Leader of the Opposition say recently? 'It would be good to get back to the good old days.' That is his forward vision on health.We have put forward a considered plan for the future. It is funded for the future. What we have had from those opposite was, firstly, an idle commitment five or seven years ago that the Australian government should take over the system. They did not act on that. Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'What I will do instead for you is rip $1 billion out of the public hospital system.' That was real action on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. And, thirdly, he then whacked a cap on GP training places.I say to the Leader of the Opposition on the health and hospitals debate that we welcome it. I notice it took him until question 8 or 9 to even raise the question of health and hospitals in this place. We are proud of the plan we put forward. Australia is crying out for fundamental reform for our health and hospital system for the future - one funded nationally and run locally. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition, with his five years of wasted experience as a health minister, that he get behind this program, which is designed to work for working families across Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. I was just wondering whether we could send out a search party for the shadow Treasurer, who seems to have disappeared. I would be delighted if he came in to listen to this very important question about the national accounts last week. I can say to the member for Longman and to all of those, certainly, on this side of the House that the Australian economy continued to outperform the rest of the advanced economies right around the world.I know that is welcomed by many on this side of the House because we know that what it means around Australia is that there are businesses with their doors open that would have otherwise closed. This is a consequence of the measures that have been put in place and working with the Australian people to boost our economy during calendar year '09. What it means is that there are tens of thousands of tradies out there in small businesses working on projects that otherwise would not be in existence right now and they would be out of work as well.Our economy grew by 0.9 per cent in the final quarter of 2009 and by 2.7 per cent over the year. That is an exceptional figure, considering what a devastating year it was in calendar year '09 in the global economy. It was the worst since the Great Depression and the second worst in modern global economic history. So it is an exceptional outcome. I think all Australians are proud of these numbers because this is something that we as a country did together: employers and workers came together, and businesses and their employees came together. Community groups all got behind a united effort not just to support jobs and business but to underline the importance of confidence. At the end of the day, that is what is so exceptional about Australia as we have come through this episode.The strength of confidence in our community and our belief in ourselves is something that we should value and it is something that we need to work with as we move forward. This is why this country needs the sort of reform of our health system that we have been talking about today, the sort of reform of our skills base that we have been talking about today and the serious reform of infrastructure and so many other areas of our economy, so we can maximise the opportunities and the wealth creation capacity of this country as we move forward to take advantage of the Asian century.In year average terms we grew by 1.4 per cent in 2009, and we ought to measure that against what occurred collectively in other advanced economies. They went backwards by 3.2 per cent - 1.4 per cent in Australia and minus 3.2 per cent for other advanced economies. The fact that we grew for every quarter of 2009 is exceptional when all of the other countries that we compare ourselves to contracted. Of course, part of this message here is stimulus. Stimulus was supporting jobs and small business. Without that stimulus we would have contracted for three of the four quarters in 2009 by something like 0.7 per cent. That is the report card of calendar year '09 that we saw in the national accounts from last week.There are just a couple of areas I want to draw attention to because they do point to opportunities and challenges as we move forward. The accounts point to the importance of infrastructure stimulus because it is certainly doing an exceptional job in areas of the economy that are soft. Our nation-building investments in our schools, roads, railways, ports and housing drove a 10.2 per cent increase in public investment in the quarter. This helped offset weakness in private building and construction activity, which fell by more than 20 per cent.What that means is that in so many communities around this country without that essential investment, many of those tradies who are pulling up each morning outside those school construction sites would not be pulling up anywhere else because of the weakness of private sector activity. So you have a very vivid demonstration here of the importance of the pipeline of activity to confidence and activity as we move forward. As we know, it is the policy of those opposite to cancel those contracts. What they will be doing is fracturing that pipeline of activity which is so important to wealth creation, so important to small business and so important to the employment outcomes that we are getting. It is simply stunning that in the last little while something like 180,000 jobs have been created in this country. And we celebrate every single one of them. However, we are not complacent about that because, while unemployment is at 5.3 per cent, we know there are many people in the community who are working fewer hours than they would like to work. Of course, that means a cut to their income. So we should not be lulled into a sense of false security by that one figure because the number of hours that are reduced in our community is the equivalent of 260,000 full-time positions. That means there is still spare capacity out there in the labour market.That investment - that infrastructure investment that this side supports and which is opposed by those opposite - is so important in securing those outcomes. Strong, sensible, well-judged economic policies are at the core of this outcome. And, of course, what we did not have when community groups got together and when employers came together with their employees, was the support of the opposition. I, for one, remember vividly the activities in this House last February when every one of them over there voted against the February stimulus package and then it was voted down in the Senate. In our hour of national need they went back to this negative, carping, oppositionist tone. If that had prevailed, they would have failed Australia. Fortunately for Australia, it did not prevail. The stimulus was put in place. The stimulus which they said would not create one job has created 180,000 jobs by the ABS figures. So it has been proved that they have comprehensively misjudged the Australian economy, just as we are seeing them comprehensively misjudging the very critical issue of paid paternity leave in this House. They are not able to fund it, they are not able to explain how they are going to fund it and they are not coming to grips with the fundamental incentive structures that are required to drive investment in this community, as well as having family friendly work practices and policies to support it. We have had today another demonstration of the monumental misjudgement of the Leader of the Opposition, his Shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance spokesman. They should be condemned for their irresponsibility.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. There are a few issues and I will go through them in turn. First of all, I will clarify what was contained in the question concerning any future abolition of the interest rate subsidy. The government has consistently said that any reform of drought policy is about how we deal with the next drought. It remains extremely important that people currently on assistance know that the work the government is doing on reform of drought policy is not about a change in how we would deal with people who are currently going through the toughest period of their lives. That guarantee, which has been given previously by the Prime Minister and myself, is important to keep in the framework on anything about how future drought policy should go forward.Secondly, the member for Kennedy refers to the banks and the best way to help farmers. Certainly, since the experience some years ago in both Victoria and South Australia, there is not a great appetite for government-run banks and the agricultural development banks. I am aware of the work that the member for Kennedy is very proud of during his time in the Queensland government and the legacy that was there, but it is not a pathway that the government is currently looking at. The pathway that has been adopted to date has been one of allowing lending decisions to be made by commercial banks and an interest rate subsidy then being paid. I want to point out a couple of challenges we have had with that. First of all, 30 per cent have been accessing the EC and 70 per cent have not. The vast majority of farmers have either not been eligible or have not been able to benefit because they have not had sufficient debt. One of the drivers of the current policy is the farmer who during good times makes some very tough decisions, who is not in a situation of large debt when a drought hits and who therefore actually receives no government assistance at all. That is one of the inequities in the way the current system works and the government is trying to find a way forward. The second of the two challenges regarding the way the system currently works is with declarations, as the member for Kennedy knows all too well with the experience of trying to get a declaration in the Gulf. The declaration process takes a very long time and hardship goes for a long period before anyone, even those 30 per cent, get any assistance under the current rules.The other thing is there are many areas of real hardship that are not covered, and the trade cycles that the member for Kennedy refers to are not reasons that someone is currently able to access EC. It simply does not become available to them, even though it may be a hardship completely beyond their planning or control.The way forward that the government is working its way through involves looking at how the government can have an engagement when people are in good times which will then lead to fewer people ever hitting a crisis. It is a harder point of policy to drive at because there is no pressure on government to do anything during good times, but that is the process that the government is trying to work through - to see how we can have a level of engagement during the good times so that, rather than waiting for the crisis and just holding people in that period of crisis for the duration of the hardship, we can actually work with farmers in the good times and fewer people will hit that hardship in the first place.On the final point raised by the member for Kennedy, where he referred to the high subsidies in the United States and Europe, I have to say that one of the outcomes of the highly subsidised farming systems in those parts of the world has been massive inefficiency. I would rate an Australian farmer against any United States or European farmer any day, because we farm smarter and we farm more effectively. A subsidy system runs completely counter to that.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Franklin for her question. In fact, the member for Franklin is the first female member for Franklin since the establishment of the seat in 1903. It is great to have this opportunity to talk a little bit about the government's achievements in this area following International Women's Day yesterday, because International Women's Day is an opportunity for us to celebrate the great advances that have been made but also to focus on the challenges that remain before we have truly achieved equality for women in Australia. - We are a longstanding leader in gender equality. Everyone knows that Australia was one of the first countries to introduce votes for women. Today we should be proud that we have a Deputy Prime Minister who is a woman, a Deputy Leader of the Opposition who is a woman, a female Governor-General and three women on the High Court. We also have the highest representation of women ever in our parliament today, and that is certainly something that all members, I am sure, would be proud of. But of course we should be proud but not complacent. We still have a long way to go. There is still much work to be done. As the member opposite mentioned, we continue to have a gender pay gap. I am sure all of us still agree that women experience violence in much too great numbers.We believe as a government that we need to support practical measures that give women options, allowing them and encouraging them to make the right choices for them in their stage of life, in their circumstances. We have returned fairness and flexibility to Australia's workplaces, including for the first time a right to request flexible and part-time work for parents. It is important that these conditions are available to men as well as women because we know that, without a better sharing of the joys and responsibilities of domestic life, women will not be able to achieve professionally all they deserve to achieve. We have made it much easier for parents to afford to return to work by increasing the child care tax rebate to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket expenses and making those payments quarterly instead of annually.For the first time, we have introduced a paid parental leave scheme, which will commence in January next year - a scheme that allows women to remain connected to the workforce while easing the financial burdens of taking time off to care for very young babies. The government's scheme is a fully funded scheme, a scheme that particularly supports financial security for the lowest paid women, and it contrasts very sharply with the scheme that the Leader of the Opposition floated yesterday. It is well worth asking why, in 12 years of government, the previous government never introduced paid parental leave, leaving us and the United States to be the only two developed countries that have never had paid parental leave schemes. At the same time, they introduced workplace laws that made it much, much harder for parents to balance their work and caring responsibilities. They reduced penalty rates. They got rid of unfair dismissal provisions. They introduced AWAs, which we know were phenomenally bad for working women.Of course, it is also worth asking why the Leader of the Opposition said that paid parental leave would be introduced 'over this government's dead body' when he had the opportunity to do it. It is worth commenting that the broken promise on taxes has meant that no business group in the country supports this proposal, particularly as they are struggling to emerge from the global financial crisis. It is not clear yet whether this is opposition policy or not. It is not clear whether this is another thought bubble or whether we now have a commitment from the opposition that this policy will be introduced. But what I can tell you is that there are women in the community now who are planning to have children next year who need certainty. They are planning their family finances now. They are trying to work out how the mortgage will be paid next year. They need certainty that the opposition will back the government's scheme and pass the government's scheme so payments can commence in January next year. Heather Ridout said of this scheme, 'It is the sort of policy' -  -  - It is worth quoting Heather twice, because she is so on the money. She said this is 'the policy you have when you are not serious about having a policy'. This policy is thinner than a pair of spandex bike shorts and everyone can see that. - The paid parental leave scheme, I am sure, is one that will have significant community debate over coming months, as people see how thin this proposal is. But it is worth saying that there are many, many good policies that do have bipartisan support, including the work that the Australian government is doing with business to encourage family-friendly conditions in workplaces.It was great to be with the Treasurer yesterday at the National Australia Bank as we announced the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency 'Employer of Choice for Women' award recipients -  -  - I know. It is shocking, isn't it, that 95 businesses around Australia would provide family friendly conditions for their employees! I can understand why that would have that sort of reaction from those opposite. We are committed to improving women's voices in public life and today I have announced the establishment of six new alliances that will contribute to that work.Finally, I want to say that all members of the House, and I am sure of the other place as well, and all members of the Australian community, understand that rates of violence against women in this country remain unacceptably high. Just, for example, in the last week the government has expanded programs run by the NRL and the AFL to work with players to encourage them to develop respectful relationships with women. This sort of work on the ground will complement the release later this year of our national plan to reduce violence against women and children. It is work that we can all be proud of.Of course we have a lot to be proud of in our record. We still have a long way to go. As Anne Manne said at The Sydney Institute:We will truly have equality when women no longer have to make impossible choices. When they are everywhere in public life and when both men and women are respected for their contribution to love's never-ending labour.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Firstly, Minister Combet, as the Leader of the Opposition would know, has been handed responsibility for the wind-up of the Home Insulation Program. Secondly, the department which has energy efficiency functions within it has also brought in a new departmental deputy secretary to deal with these matters. Thirdly, I say to the honourable Leader of the Opposition that the minister also intends to engage very closely with industry, unions and regulators to ensure that risks going forward are managed in the best possible way. Furthermore, could I advise the Leader of the Opposition that the minister's department will be guided in design and implementation of the scheme by an independent advisory panel. This will include Dr Ron Silverberg, ex-managing director of the HIA; Mr Peter Tighe, National Secretary of the Electrical Trades Union; and Mr Tony Arnel, the Victorian building and plumbing commissioner and Chair of the Green Building Council of Australia. This panel of experts has also been commissioned to advise on the proposed implementation arrangements for the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme.</DOC>

 - They had 12 years to do something about the health system of Australia and they did nothing - absolutely nothing. The Leader of the Opposition and I were privileged to be invited to last night's annual dinner of the Australian Medical Association. I listened very keenly to hear a policy speech from the Leader of the Opposition. What I heard again were a number of political one-liners destined for media consumption but not destined for real policy change.I also appreciate the support for the government's plan which we received last night from the head of the AMA, Dr Pesce, who said:We are heading for a once-in-a-generation change to the way health services are delivered and funded and managed in this country._            _            _From the top, the Commonwealth must have a greater funding and national planning role.And from the grassroots, there must be more local clinician input to decision-making at the local level, to ensure funding meets local needs.That is what the head of the AMA said last night in support of the government's plan. In the months leading up to the release of the government's plan only last week, the Minister for Health and Ageing and I travelled across the country to speak with doctors, nurses, patients and those who are intimately associated with the health and hospital system of Australia.Whether it is in Hobart or in Darwin or in Perth or in Parramatta, right across the country there is one clear message: not enough hospital beds, not enough doctors and not enough nurses. On the question of nurses, in 2008 Access Economics estimated that around 6,000 additional nurses would be needed each year to 2025 over and above the current graduations of 9,000 a year. On GPs, the health department estimated that demand for GP services is likely to increase by around 15 per cent by 2020 on current trends and the current GP training pipeline will not meet this demand growth. These are the workforce challenges that we now face. Of course, if you have an insufficient supply of doctors and nurses, what results is longer waiting times. The NHHRC reported that data indicates that the median waiting time across all types of elective surgery was 34 days in 2007-08, up from 28 days in 2003-04 - getting worse and worse. On emergency departments, 31 per cent of patients presenting in emergency departments in 2007-08 were not seen within clinically acceptable times. This is the direct product of sustained underinvestment in the system by the Australian government and governments across the nation.Back in July of 2006, when a certain Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Health and Ageing, he got a letter from the head of the AMA warning him and warning the government of the looming crisis in medical training. This is what the head of the AMA had to say to the Leader of the Opposition when he was discharging such a fine set of responsibilities as health minister of Australia. This is what the AMA warned back in 2006:_ without urgent action by all governments, Australia will have a new generation of doctors who _ will struggle to gain the detailed education and significant clinical skills needed to practise independently.He went on to say that this would:_ have catastrophic effects on the medical workforce, our hospitals, and the access to quality health care that patients rightly expect.That is what the head of the AMA wrote to the Leader of the Opposition when he was in the position of health minister of Australia. What did the Leader of the Opposition as health minister of Australia do in response to this representation from the AMA? Nothing. Instead, the then health minister decided to rip out $1 billion from the public hospital system, and that $1 billion is the equivalent of 1,025 hospital beds. They do not like this number - $1 billion ripped out by Tony Abbott when he was minister for health, which is the equivalent of 1,025 -  -  -  -  -  -  -  - For the information of the Leader of the Opposition, I draw his attention to the budget papers of 2003-04. On page 179, under the Australian healthcare agreement itemised at that time, for 2003-04, 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07, the following figures are listed -  - In 2003-04, minus $108 million; 2004-05, minus $172 million; 2005-06, minus $264 million; 2006-07, minus $372 million. I simply go through those figures to draw them to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition. I also draw to the Leader of the Opposition's attention that when he was minister for health, while he may be uncomfortable about his record, he also imposed a cap on GP training places. I can understand full well why the Leader of the Opposition is sensitive about his record as health minister - a sensitivity which is only underpinned and surpassed by his undertaking to the Australian people, that absolute ironclad guarantee, that there would be no change to the Medicare safety net - a rock solid, ironclad guarantee, until after the election. That is what the Leader of the Opposition did when he was health minister. What we have done in the two years we have been in office through the agency of the minister for health is increase the number of GP training places by some 35 per cent. That is what we have done. From 2009 universities offered an additional 1,094 undergraduate nursing places. That is what we have done. On top of that, in terms of funding to our public hospitals, we have increased our allocation to hospitals in the states and territories by some 50 per cent. If you want three concrete pieces of action, those are they.Those opposite, not content with their record on health and hospitals reform, which is a dismal record, right now in another place, in the Senate, are seeking to block important pieces of legislation and stand in the way of further reform to the health and hospital system. They are blocking changes to PHI - a blocking which will result in taxpayers paying $2 billion, money which could be better invested in public hospital beds across Australia. On top of that, they in the Senate have refused to pass landmark legislation giving more support and recognition to our midwives and nurse practitioners. This is unacceptable. Those opposite find this to be a passing irritant; they do not think that nurse practitioners and midwives are important. We on this side of the House do. Dental services have been blocked by those in the Senate; they have refused to pass legislation for Australia's first ever preventative healthcare agency.I say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is time on health and hospitals reform that he just got out of the road, that he actually allowed the government to get on with the business of fundamental health and hospital reform for the future. We intend to get on with the business of bringing about this reform for Australia. I will be consulting with the premiers and chief ministers in the days ahead, prior to COAG in April. We have a plan for the future. I will begin that process with the Premier of New South Wales in Sydney tomorrow. I will travel to every state capital in the country and every territory capital to bring about the needed reforms for our health and hospital system for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I also draw the honourable member's attention to a statement delivered in this place by the minister responsible for energy efficiency, Minister Combet, yesterday. Based on advice received by that minister, I would also say to the honourable member who has asked the question that those who have received foil insulation will have the option of having either that foil insulation removed or safety switches installed. That will apply to all the homes he has referred to. This also is based on advice from the Master Electricians of Australia and the National Electrical Contractors Association. The minister will make further statements to the House as appropriate in terms of further action that may be needed.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. - This is an important question -  - because it goes to the vital issue -  - of cost shifting and blame shifting -  - between the states and the Commonwealth. - This is something that the Leader of the Opposition never paid any attention to. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I can understand why those opposite have a raw nerve when it comes to talking about health care because they did nothing in government and they have done nothing in opposition and now they want to stand in the way of some of the biggest reforms to the healthcare system since a Labor government introduced Medicare 30 years ago. That is why they are touchy and that is why they do not want to hear the answer to this question. - The question that was asked by the member for Bonner -  - goes to the absolute fundamentals of our health reform proposals, and that is that we must end the cost shifting and blame shifting between the states and the Commonwealth. When we came to government we inherited a Commonwealth-state share of financing the health system which had plummeted to an all-time low because of the irresponsible actions of the Leader of the Opposition. He ripped $1 billion out of the public hospital system and what happened is that it got to an all-time low with the Commonwealth contributing just below 35 per cent of the share of funding of public hospitals.The Prime Minister announced last week that our government is determined to take on the dominant funding role from hereon into the future of 60 per cent of the share of hospital funding - a major change to the way hospital services are funded and run across this country. The key thing that this fixes is the argument over the Commonwealth doing a negotiation with the states at the start of a five-year period, fixing in what they pay for a five-year period, handing it over to the states and then saying, 'It doesn't matter what happens with changing demographics, doesn't matter what happens with the cost of health expenditure, doesn't matter what happens where the population moves.'  We are not prepared to leave our communities in that situation anymore. We are prepared to take on a dominant funding role and to make sure that we are bearing responsibility for a bigger share of the growth both in population and in the cost of providing health care. We must do this. We must get to the bottom of building an incentive into the system that allows cost shifting and blame shifting. We are determined to fix this problem because we think cost shifting and blame shifting are wasting scarce health resources that need to be spent in the system.Unfortunately, not everybody in this place believes that resolving the problem of cost shifting is important. We know that not everybody believes this because the Leader of the Opposition himself, in 2006, wrote in an article in the Australian: 'Cost shifting is unavoidable. You can't stop it so you might as well just live with it.' What a lazy approach. What a defeatist approach. What an absolutely irresponsible approach to take to the most important delivery of services to our community across the country and that is our health services. Our government is not prepared to just live with it.We understand that we were elected to do the opposite, to fix the problems that the Liberal government handed us for 11 years. In total, over the next decade the Commonwealth will be responsible for billions of extra dollars of expenditure that otherwise would burden state budgets. In the short term, people are already benefiting from the $20 billion investment of extra funding flowing through to front-line health services. This is a 50 per cent increase on the position that we inherited when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister. This is the 50 per cent increase that the shadow Treasurer, who does not appear to be here today, has said he would not sign onto. He said he did not agree to pay this money to the states and territories - did not agree to the Commonwealth investing more in hospital services. We are going to do the heavy lifting on health. We are going to help ensure that generations to come will enjoy world-class universally accessible health care. The contrast could not be clearer with the Leader of the Opposition, who turned the blame game into an Olympic sport. We are not going to have any more of it and it is time for him to get out of the way and let us get on with the job.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Can I say in response to the honourable member's question that the policy work which led to the establishment of the Home Insulation Program began in August 2008 and continued through to the launch of the full program 11 months later, on 1 July 2009. Furthermore, in August 2008 the government launched a cross-departmental Energy Efficiency Taskforce. That in turn recommended a national energy efficiency strategy, which in turn had within it a sustainable homes assistance package, worth $2.9 billion. Furthermore, in early 2009 the government developed the Energy Efficient Homes program as part of its Nation Building and Jobs Plan. On 3 February 2009 that package was announced. Between 3 February and 1 July 2009 - in response to the member's question - the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts spent five months designing the final policy implementation. - The honourable member asked me a question about this project control group. What I was seeking to do was to provide the honourable member with the context within which this group operated. Can I say, in response further to the honourable member's question, that I am advised the project control group was established in April 2009 to enhance cross-departmental coordination of the project design implementation. I am further advised that this is the normal practice within government - to establish a project control group or interdepartmental committee to develop and implement major projects. Furthermore, the chair of the project control group was the deputy secretary of the department of the environment -  - The chair of that group, as the member for Flinders asked me before, was the deputy secretary of the department of the environment. The member for Flinders asked me questions about its reporting and accountability arrangements. I am simply advising the member for Flinders that the terms of reference of the project control group require the chair or the representative of that group to report to the executive management of the department of the environment. I have nothing before me which would indicate that that group in any way did anything other than the advice that they received on the question of safety standards.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I know that he would have followed today's news that the unemployment number for last month, the month of February, remained effectively steady at 5.3 per cent, in line with market expectations. This unemployment number obviously indicates that our economy has done far better than many would have expected at the start of the global financial crisis and global recession, the worst global recession in more than 75 years. These figures show that our economy has outperformed virtually every other advanced economy during the global recession. We know that this performance would not have been as strong if it had not been for the quick and decisive action of this government in investing in our economy and supporting Australian jobs. Without that quick and decisive action, hundreds of thousands more Australians would have been unemployed. This action has helped give Australian families certainty during very uncertain times.But, whilst today's figures are encouraging, they remind us that there is nothing that should be taken for granted. There are 128,000 Australians who have become unemployed since the global financial crisis hit in September 2008. What these unemployment figures are telling us and what we know from around the nation is that many working families face significant pressures and uncertainties as they seek to build a future for themselves. That is why the government is so determined to continue to invest in nation-building infrastructure to stimulate local economies and to support jobs, and it is why our reforms are well designed and costed, because we believe in providing certainty and support for working families around the country.This is a stark contrast to the attitude of the opposition, which is not focused on building the nation; it is focused on saying no to absolutely everything - no to economic stimulus to support the jobs of working Australians; no to the Fair Work Act, because it would rather go back to Work Choices; and then this week we have seen a debate break out about the opposition acting to deny working parents paid parental leave. We know that the risk to paid parental leave in this parliament is the Leader of the Opposition, who is shaping up to block the bill to deliver paid parental leave. Out of his own mouth, the Leader of the Opposition has said, 'We'll be amending it to try and make it our scheme' - his scheme being one that would put cost of living pressures on working families because it would put up the price of bread and milk and the basic groceries that they rely on. I thank the members of the opposition backbench who are nodding their heads in agreement because they understand that.The Leader of the Opposition is a risk to the budgets of working families. This is a man that the former Treasurer Peter Costello viewed as being such a risk to the economy that he would not even have trusted him to be his deputy. No doubt the former Treasurer Peter Costello formed that view because, when the Leader of the Opposition was minister for health and he used to be asked about how they were going to fund health policies, he would just shrug his shoulders and say: 'Peter will provide. He always does.' Well, Peter has gone now and, with Peter gone, the Leader of the Opposition is looking to put these burdens directly onto working families to fund his hastily cobbled together schemes. When I say 'hastily cobbled together', no-one in the Liberal Party knew about it. You really have to try hard to make the member for Wentworth look like a model of inclusiveness and consultation, but that is what the Leader of the Opposition -  - On other occasions such comments have been permitted. -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I can guarantee to the House that comprehension will figure prominently in the national curriculum. The reason that I am commenting on the policy of the opposition is that it does seem to me a little bit interesting that now they do not want to talk about paid parental leave, as the policy has crumbled before the eyes of the Leader of the Opposition. On Monday he made his big announcement, on Tuesday he thought it was okay and now, of course, they do not really want to talk about it anymore. The problem with their policy is that it is a threat in the Senate to us delivering our paid parental leave scheme. There was no consultation on this policy. There was no consultation with the member who approaches the despatch box.On other occasions such comments have been permitted.But I would read the rest of it, which says:... although a question should not ask a Minister about opposition policy as the Minister is not responsible for it.It is clearly out of order. - In conclusion, I was asked about certainty for working families and risks for working families. A clear risk is that our paid parental leave scheme legislation will be blocked and we will be unable to pay benefits to people next year. Of course, this is because of the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition - the man who says he will consult with his back bench and then does not; the man who says that there will be no new taxes and then announces a huge, new tax; the man who actually explains all of this by saying - his words not mine: 'You have to make departures from principles.' I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his straight talk about his lack of principle, but working women will not thank him if he blocks paid parental leave.</DOC>

 - On the question of the policy and the design features around it, as I indicated in my response to the member for Flinders before, they were determined by cabinet in February 2009. I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that, in the period between the taking of that decision by the cabinet and the implementation of the scheme on 1 July 2009, the implementation features were then designed by the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts.On the development of the program in the period in between then - and the Leader of the Opposition specifically goes to the question of advice back to me as a member of cabinet - can I advise the Leader of the Opposition of this: the Nation Building and Jobs Plan implementation reports were received by the relevant cabinet committee. I am advised that the first implementation report was provided on 18 February 2009 and it was considered by the committee then. The implementation report referred to no safety issues related to the Home Insulation Program, which by that stage had not commenced.A further report was delivered to the relevant cabinet committee on 10 March. The March implementation report referred to no safety issues related to the Home Insulation Program. A third report was delivered to the cabinet committee, which I chair, on 11 June 2009. That report referred to no safety issues related to the Home Insulation Program. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Shortland for her question. The paid parental leave scheme being put forward by those opposite has at its core a $10.8 billion tax, which will harm the economy and, of course, will risk family budgets. The Leader of the Opposition has spent a lot of time talking about big new taxes - well, this one is a whopper. It is the Big Mac of taxes. Of course it will impact on business, it will impact on employment and it will impact on family budgets.I think we can all celebrate today's employment figures, which were spoken about before by the Deputy Prime Minister. But this big tax is a risk to investment. This big tax is a risk to growth. This big tax is a risk to jobs. Those opposite are having a few problems coordinating their discussions on economic policy. I note that the Leader of the Opposition said that the shadow Treasurer and the finance spokesman should have known about this scheme because they could have read it in his book - which was published a year ago. We know they do not actually read very often, and this is part of the problem.We know that last December the shadow Treasurer actually missed a very substantial revision to the national accounts - billions of dollars just went past him and he did not notice. So they do not do a lot of reading. But there is some reading they should do - for example, a recent report from the OECD, which said:Corporate taxes are found to be the most harmful for growth ...This is something that those opposite do not appear to understand: the need to invest for growth, the need to invest to employ Australians.They have proven, through what has occurred over the last couple of days, what a serious risk to our national economy they have become. They could not even work out whether the tax is going to be imposed on businesses with a $5 million turnover or on businesses that paid $5 million worth of tax - thereby leaving something like 2,500 businesses in limbo. This demonstrates that they are a risk to investment and a risk to business. What they do not appear to understand is that this tax will be passed on to families - passed on at the supermarket, passed on at the petrol station and of course passed on at the local bank. That demonstrates just how out of touch they are.What this is all about is trying to prove that somehow they are pro family - after they supported Work Choices which ripped away fundamental conditions for families. On this side of the House, we are proud of the first-ever commitment to a paid parental leave scheme from an Australian government, from the Rudd government - a scheme which is affordable, a scheme which is sustainable and a scheme which does not require a big tax which will cost jobs. - </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. In my earlier answer to his question, I outlined the government's decision-making process leading up to the commencement of the scheme on 1 July 2009. The honourable Leader of the Opposition asked questions about subsequent safety and compliance matters which arose. Let me provide him with the following information.On 14 August, I received a letter from the then minister in relation to the Home Insulation Program proposing increased compliance requirements for the program. On 17 August, the relevant cabinet committee considered the compliance issues raised by the minister in his 14 August letter. The committee approved changes to the program guidelines which included requiring the following: physical site inspections prior to giving quotes, increased inspections and scrutiny of trainer qualifications, increased compliance communications and processes for suspending and deregistering non-compliant installers.On 27 August 2009, I received a letter from the minister drawing my attention to concerns about new entrants to the market not adequately meeting required standards on work undertaken. The minister proposed changes to the program to require installers to provide physical evidence of qualifications and/or competencies before they were registered. On 28 August, I am advised, these changes to the program guidelines were released and, on 4 September, I wrote to the minister noting that these changes had been made.On 22 October 2009, the relevant cabinet committee again considered the Home Insulation Program and discussed increasing the requirements on installers to increase compliance. On 28 October, the minister wrote to me to indicate the actions he intended to take in response. These included requiring householders to get two quotes and to publish a public list of deregistered installers. On 29 October, I responded to this letter, agreeing to the minister's proposals to tighten the guidelines. On 30 October, Minister Garrett wrote to me in relation to safety issues in the Home Insulation Program, a proposal to roll out an electrical safety testing program for homes that have had foil insulation, a proposed ban on metal fasteners, and a proposal to mandate the use of covers over downlights and other ceiling appliances.On 2 November 2009, I replied to the minister, noting the package of safety measures which he had outlined. On 30 November 2009, Minister Garrett announced mandatory training or minimum skill requirements would be developed further. On 17 December, Minister Garrett announced increased training requirements: all installers going into ceilings must have either a trade-specific competency, prior insulation industry experience or must have completed a registered or accredited training course. That commenced as of 12 February 2010. On 9 February 2010, Minister Garrett banned the use of foil insulation under the Home Insulation Program and, on 10 February 2010, Minister Garrett announced that every home that had foil insulation installed under the government's Home Insulation Program would undergo an electrical safety inspection. On 19 February 2010, the relevant cabinet committee made the decision to close the program.These are the steps which occurred during the process of decision making leading up to the commencement of the program on 1 July 2009. That, I am advised, is the correspondence between myself and the minister on this matter over the period since then.I would also draw the honourable Leader of the Opposition's attention to the statement made in the House yesterday by Minister Combet, the minister responsible for energy efficiency, and the measures which he has now put in place concerning the wind-up of the existing program and any guidelines which will be developed relevant to a replacement program.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. The government is always open to considering new policy ideas, whether they be from the opposition or from any other sources. In fact, in my own portfolio I am eagerly awaiting savings suggestions from the opposition. It has been almost seven years since a Liberal shadow finance minister or finance minister advanced a substantial savings initiative. In fact, the 2003 budget was the last time, so I am eagerly awaiting some new ideas on that front.We do not pick up just any old idea or any old garbled bit of gobbledegook that gets thrown at us. We apply a quality control test. Unfortunately, the proposal which the opposition most recently put forward, with respect to paid maternity leave, fails to meet that test. It is interesting today that, after a sudden burst of enthusiasm a couple of days ago, we have had not one single question promoting the new paid parental leave by the Leader of the Opposition. Some of the points I will now advance may help explain why they have dropped it like a stone. To begin with, the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition completely repudiates past positions taken by not only him but also the shadow minister in charge of the program. In government the Leader of the Opposition said, 'I'm dead against paid maternity leave.' In January this year, the shadow minister, the member for Murray, said that they would be developing a proposal that would not put any tax burden on the business sector. Only about six weeks ago, notoriously, the Leader of the Opposition stated that the opposition committed itself to a promise of no new taxes and no increases in taxes. When confronted with the breaking of that promise yesterday, he said, 'Sometimes you have to depart from principle.'The flaws in the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition are quite manifest. He did not consult the business community. He did not consult his economics team - the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister - he did not consult his own shadow cabinet and, indeed, one of his own Liberal MPs, when confronted with the proposition by the Australian, described it as 'a typical 1930s socialist impost on big business' and was then surprised to discover that it was his own leader's proposal. The detail of the proposal also does not withstand scrutiny. There has been complete confusion about the threshold. We know the threshold involves the figure of $5 million, the tax threshold above which the tax slug hits business. We know the figure is $5 million; we do not quite know what it is $5 million of. Is it turnover? Is it taxable income? Is it profit? We do not quite know, because the Leader of the Opposition has had several different positions. - It is good to see that the member for O'Connor is on the job; it is very good to see. If it is taxable income it is about 3,500 companies. If it is tax being paid it is only about 900, 950 or so. There is a big difference between these possibilities. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition cannot quite say when his paid parental leave would start - maybe sometime around 2013. He cannot say whether the tax impost would be permanent or temporary; he described it as a 'temporary levy'. And he cannot say whether or not he would support the legislation the government is putting to the Senate and to this House to introduce our paid parental leave scheme. He cannot say how he would prevent abuse of the $5 million threshold or unfairness that would flow from it. How would he stop companies from restructuring to avoid the tax? How would he protect companies that are above the threshold, and hit by the tax, from competition from companies that they compete with that are below the threshold? How would he remove the implicit disincentive involved with his tax impost for companies to merge? How would he prevent the tax being passed on to consumers?I note that the head of the Institute of Public Affairs, prominent Liberal Party figure John Roskam, said the following in response, describing his proposal as disastrous because 'ultimately tax on businesses' - whether they are big businesses or small businesses - 'gets passed through to the consumer, and what we are going to see, as Lindsay Tanner identified, is massive compliance issues'. This is a prominent figure in the Liberal Party agreeing with me. A very prominent figure who has some political and policy substance actually agrees with my assessment and the government's assessment of the policy merits of the scheme.Over the last few months we have seen the Leader of the Opposition out there on the quad bike, in the speedos, in the swimming pool. No doubt we are going to see him abseiling and bungee jumping and all those other kinds of things in due course. He should start paying some attention to his day job. If he is going to put forward policy propositions that he expects the government to adopt, that involve big slugs on business and that threaten jobs and the economy, and he proposes to block the government's own initiative, he needs to do some very serious homework. This will not cut the mustard, and it means he will be a substantial threat to the economy and to the budget, a risk to the future prosperity of this nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. He refers to the then minister's letter to me of 14 August -  - The then minister responsible for this program. In response to the honourable Leader of the Opposition's question, I received a letter from the minister, in relation to the Home Insulation Program, proposing increased compliance requirements for the program. On 17 August the relevant cabinet committee considered these compliance matters raised by the minister in his 14 August letter. - That is the question the Leader of the Opposition asked. These contained the following elements: (1) physical site inspections prior to giving quotes; (2) increased inspections and scrutiny of trainer qualifications - which goes directly to safety considerations -  - In answering the Leader of the Opposition's question: this correspondence dealt also with, secondly, increased inspections and scrutiny of trainer qualifications; thirdly, increased compliance; and, fourthly, processes for suspending and deregistering non-compliant installers. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that the relevance of training standards and the relevance of the inspections regime go directly to the question of overall safety considerations associated with the program. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, both in relation to these matters and to the cabinet documents that I referred to before, that these obviously are associated with the cabinet process and will be appropriately protected.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question, because she understands very well that couples who are planning to have children are making one of the biggest decisions of their lives. I am sure I do not have to remind members of the House, many of us parents ourselves, what it is like to take that step either to start a family or to have another child. For many families, when they are deciding when to start a family or when to have another child, there are many, many critical things that they have to take into account. They have to think about what they are going to do with their employment, with family matters, and with the various financial commitments that have to be considered. The job that we have, of course, is to support families as they make those decisions, not to make their lives more complicated.In a little over nine months time, Australia's first paid parental leave scheme is due to start, on 1 January. In case the Leader of the Opposition does not get the subtlety here, that is in just about nine months time. I am sure everybody here can do the maths. - Maybe not. That means any couple who are thinking about or planning to have a baby want to know what is going to happen. Are they going to have a paid parental leave scheme that they can depend on on 1 January next year? That is why they need certainty now. They want to know whether or not the paid parental leave scheme is going to be there for them in nine months time.The Leader of the Opposition, of course, is threatening to leave parents with nothing. What they know is that this Leader of the Opposition is the biggest risk to families and their certainty. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition does not seem to care that families have been waiting decades for a paid parental leave scheme. We know that the Liberals in government refused to introduce a paid parental leave scheme. We know what the views of the Leader of the Opposition are. It has been very well reported that he said over his dead body would paid parental leave be introduced.I must say his comments yesterday demonstrate further that he really has no clue about how his latest thought bubble of a scheme is going to happen. He said that he would be amazed if he could not get his scheme up and running by 2013. I would have to say that I would be absolutely amazed if his half-baked scheme had been given any more than half a minute's thought. There is no question that that applies to some members of his frontbench.If you have a look at Senator Joyce today, the shadow minister for finance, he said: 'You know, let's talk about it once I've read it. I don't like talking about things I haven't read.' A sham policy with no detail, no costings, no time line and no deal for Australian families is what the Liberal Party is offering. By contrast, this government has proposed a paid parental leave scheme for the first time that this country has ever seen. It is going to be fair for families and fair for business. Families know that this Leader of the Opposition cannot be trusted on paid parental leave.</DOC>

 - I say in response to the Leader of the Opposition that, if you go through the list of correspondence I referred to in my earlier answer, many of them go to training requirements, many of them go to site inspections, and of course these are therefore related to safety and other concerns. The second point I would say is that, as I said to the House the previous time that these matters were debated, there is nothing before me which suggests that the minister did not act in response to the advice that he had received from his department at the time. That is the position I put to the House then; that is the position I put to the House now. Furthermore, I draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the work which is currently being done by Dr Hawke in his review of the implementation of this scheme and to the statement which was delivered to the House yesterday by the minister responsible, Minister Combet, dealing with the wind-up of this scheme and guidelines for any replacement scheme.I also say in response to the Leader of the Opposition that we intend to get on with the business of accepting responsibility for the problems which have arisen from the implementation of this scheme. Mr Combet has outlined the mechanism by which that will be undertaken. We will not shirk these responsibilities. We intend to get on the job. Given the fact that it is Thursday, I presume the censure motion is coming soon.</DOC>

 - I have been urged that there be no more Mr Nice Guy. I will do my best, Mr Speaker, to be as nice as I possibly can to the opposition. I thank the member for Lowe for his kind question and his concern for consumers in Strathfield, in Burwood and in all the suburbs in the inner-west of Sydney, including - I understand - the good people of Five Dock, and all those consumers about whom the Australian people and the Labor Party care but, of course, about whom the opposition has no interest and no compassion.In response to the member for Lowe's question, the government's paid parental leave scheme is funded from the budget and involves no increase in taxation to be passed on to consumers. On the other hand, the coalition's paid parental scheme is funded by a 1.7 percentage point slug in the company tax rate for larger companies. As the Treasurer pointed out, this is a $10.8 billion great big new tax to be passed on by large companies. This was confirmed today by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, when Greg Evans said that 'the impact of a new tax or levy imposed on businesses cannot be quarantined and these changes end up having an impact on overall prices and employment'.The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is right and the coalition is wrong. Yet the opposition leader persists with his argument that Australia's largest companies would absorb this great big new tax. Hello, Leader of the Opposition? What planet are you on that you believe that Australia's largest companies - Woolworths, Coles, BP, Shell, Mobil, Caltex - through the goodness of their hearts and in the national interest will absorb this great big new tax and say, 'We're not going to pass that onto consumers'?Obviously the opposition leader is again treating the Australian people like mugs. Every working Australian and every young mother knows that these large companies will pass this tax hike on in the form of higher consumer prices, higher grocery prices, higher petrol prices and higher department store prices. We know that, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry knows that - and guess who else knows it? Well, it is my melancholy duty to advise the House that the member for O'Connor knows that, because he said today that it is a tax on profits and that if Coles and Woolworths intend to put up their prices they will increase their profits and they will therefore pay more tax from that particular arrangement.I do not quite understand what he is going on about. It is sort of 'Abbottonomics' but as I far as I can understand, he says there will be this perpetual cycle of tax increases, increased profits and then further price increases. But his neighbour sitting there, the member for Triton, has actually come in and supported, as he should, the member for O'Connor because he said today that it is an impost on industry and that, any impost will ultimately flow through to consumers. That is a fact. I do not often agree with the member for Triton but on this occasion he is right. - The member for Tangney; thank you, Mr Speaker. On this occasion the member for Tangney is right: of course it will be passed on to consumers. By conceding that grocery and petrol prices will go up, the coalition's mad uncle and the member for Tangney have let the cat out of the bag. They have let the cat out of the bag again - and what a dirty, smelly animal it is! The Leader of the Opposition's paid parental leave scheme is nothing but a great big new tax on everything.This is an opposition leader who feigns concern for working families and mothers. It is a funny way to show your concern for working families and mothers - to whack them with a great big new tax on everything. The government's paid parental leave scheme is affordable and it is responsible. If the opposition leader was fair dinkum he would support our responsible, affordable paid parental leave scheme instead of his great big new tax on everything. - I pretty well winged it, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyne for his question. Since the release of the House committee report the government has sought to work actively on these questions. In November last year the government, through Minister Wong, released the first national assessment of the implications of climate change for Australia's coasts. That report was entitled Climate change risks to Australia's coasts. It was the first attempt at continent-wide mapping of the risks posed to residential buildings as a consequence of climate change. The report also went to the challenge that this sort of coastal erosion would present to infrastructure, services and industry. We all know that a number of our road networks hug the coast very closely.The honourable member also asked a question about further action by the government on this matter. What we have done is create a Coasts and Climate Change Council, to be chaired by Professor Tim Flannery. It is designed to engage with the community and local stakeholders in the lead-up to what will be an important climate change and coastal impact forum which is to be held.Can I also say in response to the honourable member's question that we take seriously this challenge for the future, as we do the overall challenge of climate change. The government has released a comprehensive adaptation policy that identifies the role of the federal government in adapting to climate change. It identifies the following priorities: how we deal with natural systems of national significance; how we deal with prevention, preparedness and response, particularly with regard to natural disasters impacting on a weakened coastline; and the impact on agriculture, water and more broadly on coastal management.The member should be assured that the government takes this challenge as one of the adaptation implications flowing from climate change very seriously. It potentially affects residences right across Australia. It potentially affects a whole range of infrastructure projects and existing infrastructure right around the country. Therefore the government will have further to say on our action for further preparedness in this area.This is one of the costs of climate change. It is not unique to Australia. If we go to other countries around the world we see them wrestling with the impact on their coastlines caused by the change in the climate and by the increasing level of the sea. We know in particular of our near neighbours in the Pacific and the impact that it potentially has on the very survival of a number of island states, such as Kiribati, Tuvalu and elsewhere. So, while this is a challenge for Australia, it is also a challenge for the region and the world. The government will continue to discharge its responsibilities in this area.</DOC>

 - I appreciate the question from the member for Lyons, a person who represents a large regional seat that is very much dependent on the vibrancy of the tourism industry. With that context I acknowledge the resilience of the industry in the face of many challenges, yet again, over the last 12 months. I also remind the House that, as we come out of the global financial crisis, the industry yet again confronts a huge challenge in the context of the strength of the Australian dollar. We should also have regard for the fact that there are actually good value holidays in Australia. Rather than thinking about having a holiday overseas as we regain confidence economically we should have regard for staying at home, supporting Australian workers and also supporting the Australian government's No Leave, No Life campaign, which has broad industry support, given that we currently have accumulated 123 million days of leave, worth $33 billion.But what of the resilience of the industry over the last 12 months? Last year the industry had to confront a situation in which the global economy actually contracted for the first time since World War II. That effectively meant in normal circumstances a very tough year for an industry that directly employs half a million Australians and represents just under four per cent of Australia's GDP.During the course of the year, international tourism in terms of arrivals worldwide actually fell four per cent. Interestingly, visitor arrivals were down six per cent for Europe, five per cent for the Americas and two per cent for the Asia-Pacific. I am pleased to report to the House that the Australian tourism industry actually outperformed the rest of the world with international visitation, which is very important to jobs for ordinary Australians, meeting an arrival rate in 2009 virtually equivalent to that of 2008, at 5.6 million.Perhaps more importantly it is not just about numbers. Visitor arrivals increased by six per cent and visitor expenditure increased by five per cent. It is this performance on the international tourism front in association with the government's decisive action in underpinning the Australian economy through our response to the global financial crisis that has done the industry well in securing and supporting Australian employment. By way of example, domestically, Restaurant and Catering Australia estimate that at least $80 million was injected into the restaurant and catering industry from the stimulus package, and they have appropriately given full credit to the government's economic stimulus package. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has also reported that in the 11 months to November 2009 we saw a 9.5 per cent increase in turnover for restaurants, cafes and take-away food services compared to the same period in 2008.In terms of employment, I also express my appreciation to the industry itself. Whilst we have done exceptionally well internationally given the global financial crisis, there was a sharp decline, for example, in visitor travel in the Australian community. Yet, despite the global financial crisis, the Australian tourism industry achieved an overall increase of 36,000 jobs in the 12 months to November 2009. I do acknowledge in that context that some of those jobs were changes from full-time to part-time employment because the industry on this occasion resolved, having invested in the training of their workforce - many of whom are women - to go out of their way to retain their employment given the challenge of actually keeping people when we think about the better wages and conditions that are currently available in competitive industries such as the resources and energy projects around Australia at the moment.I also note in passing that this is an industry that represents a huge number of jobs for women workers. They are not historically highly paid workers and they are a group of workers that will be tremendously disappointed if the opposition does not get out of the government's way when it comes to putting in place a guaranteed minimum opportunity for paid parental leave in Australia. It is about time the opposition understood not only the importance of the tourism industry from the point of view of employment in Australia but also the importance of the safety net for women workers in the Australian tourism industry, who have long sought decisive government action to extend to them paid parental leave, just like we extended superannuation, in a previous government, to workers who historically did not have opportunities for what the better off in the Australian community expect as part of their employment packages. I simply say to the Australian tourism industry: thanks for a job well done in supporting the Australian government initiatives to shore up employment in a tough global situation.</DOC>

 - It is pretty interesting when the Leader of the Opposition asks a question about health and demonstrates that he does not understand the first thing about casemix funding. He does not understand the first thing about activity based funding. I would have thought that, having been the Minister for Health and Ageing for four or five years, he would demonstrate an elementary level of understanding. I will say to the Leader of the Opposition that why we are bringing about fundamental reform to the health and hospital system is as follows. We will not in the future be providing blank cheques as he did to state and territory governments in the hope that something might happen in the actual delivery of services on the ground. We are proposing to introduce, by contrast, activity based funding which enables the government to directly pay local hospital networks for the actual hospital services that they deliver.This is a reform which working families want on the ground because it enables them to respond to this certainty of budgetary supply in order to increase the hospital services delivered on the ground. The Australian people have been saying to the government that they do not have enough hospital beds, doctors or nurses and that they are sick and tired of the waste, duplication and overlap that currently characterises our system. One of the reasons we have this waste, duplication and overlap - something which the Leader of the Opposition, if he were faintly interested in reform, would have done something about -  - It is always good to hear from the member for Boothby and we hope to see him back on the front bench before long - once he has a reconciliation meeting with the Leader of the Opposition. I say in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question about casemix funding that we are about providing funding to local hospital networks which actually provides support for the hospital services delivered on the ground. We will not support in the future the system he backed for five years which provided a blank cheque, a block grant, to state and territory health bureaucracies to spend wherever - maybe not even on health. This is the fundamental nature of the reform that we are bringing about.The second point I would make to the Leader of the Opposition is that if he were really interested in health reform we might have heard just an element of his alternative policy when he addressed the AMA last night. Instead, we had one exercise -  - The response we have had from the medical profession, from nurses right across the country, has been to get behind this reform for the nation because they want more resources to go to front-line health and hospital services, not into bureaucracies in state capitals across the country. That is what the people of Australia are calling out for.In response to the member for Boothby's intervention, coming on top of the Leader of the Opposition's question, can I say as follows: (1) bring in activity based funding and (2) make sure that the Australian government takes on its shoulders, for the first time in Australia's history, the burden of becoming the dominant funder of the public hospital system of Australia. We are for the first time in our history becoming the dominant funder of the capital needs of Australia's public hospital system, for the first time becoming the dominant funder of the equipment needs of Australia's public hospital system and for the first time becoming the dominant funder of the research and teaching needs of the public hospital system of Australia.People want an end to business as usual. The Leader of the Opposition, who had five years as health minister, is content with the status quo. He is content with not changing a thing. He thinks the system is just good enough. I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the member for Boothby: (1) we take on this reform to deliver money directly to the coalface, (2) we take on our shoulders the burden of long-term growth in the system and (3) as the minister for health and others have indicated, we have further say on additional growth in the system in the future as well. This is in stark contrast to a Leader of the Opposition who ripped $1 billion out of the public hospital system of Australia and stands here and pretends that he never, ever did it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise his long experience as a small business person. In opposition, the Labor Party promised to reduce the paperwork burden for small business in making payments to superannuation funds and we are acting on that commitment. Currently small businesses often have difficulty in making their payments to superannuation funds when they have to make payments to various different funds for various different employees, creating a red-tape nightmare. Pending passage of legislation that will shortly be before the Senate, a free superannuation clearing house will operate from 1 July, implementing that election commitment.Medicare has been chosen by the government to run the small business clearing house because it is well placed, as one of the government's best service delivery agencies with significant electronic and payment processing capacity, to deliver that service while ensuring the privacy of information and the security of funds. If we get this legislation implementing the election commitment through the parliament, then we will be helping to ease the compliance burden for small business and letting them do what they do best, which is to get on with the job and employ more Australians.When I announced last year that Medicare would run the small business superannuation clearing house, it was a decision which received strong endorsement from the superannuation and small business sectors. The chief executive of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, Pauline Vamos, said:This will lower costs for both employers and funds and allow more employees to exercise choice.Just last week, the CEO of COSBOA, the small business peak group, said:We think the legislation will improve the efficiency of business-to-government dealings and, as I said earlier, will help improve small business compliance with their super obligations more generally.Even today we saw a significant agreement being announced between three of Australia's largest superannuation administrators to make it easier to roll over funds between different superannuation funds. The administrators make it clear in their statement that the agreement flows from the opportunity created by the government decision to appoint Medicare to run the small business clearing house. So this is a good policy - a pro-small business policy. It has important flow-on benefits for efficiency and employment.I am asked what risks there are to implementing this policy and the risks lie opposite. It might seem hard to believe that the opposition would block a small business measure, but they are planning to do so in the Senate. A pro-small business measure is being stopped by the Leader of the Opposition and members opposite. The business community has the right to ask what they have done to deserve this Leader of the Opposition. One day he is whacking a tax on business and the next day he is standing in the way of a measure to reduce small business compliance costs.On this issue, the opposition have reached new heights of hypocrisy. Yesterday in this House, my shadow minister, the member for Cowper, criticised the government for taking so long to implement this superannuation clearing house and then said he would oppose it in the other place. They cannot even get their stories straight in one sentence, let alone one speech or one day. They criticise us for taking too long and then say, 'By the way, we're not going to support it.'This all appears to be part of the Leader of the Opposition's cunning plan. He has got it all worked out. They are going to use their numbers in the Senate to block our implementation of election commitments and then criticise us for not implementing election commitments. He has got it all sorted! He must take the Australian people for mugs. The Leader of the Opposition takes the Australian people for fools.The former Prime Minister, John Howard, promised to reduce the red-tape burden on small business by 50 per cent, and he failed. He did not achieve that election promise. But it is not too late for the opposition. They can get out of the way and they can support the government in supporting small business. They can get out of the way and let the government implement this election commitment. If they do not, the small business community of Australia is entitled to conclude that the Leader of the Opposition puts his rashness, his obstructionism and his cheap politics in front of the interests of Australian small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for education for his question. I would note, of course, that since the launch of the national curriculum the shadow minister for education has not inquired about it. Maybe that is because he is aware that teachers across the country are blogging about the hollowness of his response to the national curriculum - about how truly galling it was to see someone treat a major national reform with such contempt that all he did was have a staff member work out the word 'Indigenous' and then criticise the curriculum. - In answer to the shadow minister's question, can I say this and say it very clearly to him. I do not think you, Mr Speaker, are going to be surprised when I say this, although maybe the shadow minister is going to be surprised, but I do not myself deliver demountable buildings. I do not myself lay concrete foundations. That is true; he is correct in that. I am not individually building each of the 24,000 projects around the country. What we as a government are doing, through our guidelines and our auditing systems, is monitoring the rollout of Building the Education Revolution. When there are problems - and there was a problem with the construction of the foundation at the school that the shadow minister mentions - then, of course, they are rectified. That problem is being rectified by the contractor who made the error. That is being rectified at no additional cost to the government. That is what one would expect a contractor who has made an error to do. That would happen if one was engaged in Building the Education Revolution, if one was a businessperson engaged in building a commercial building or if one was a householder who was building a home renovation. An error was made and that error is being rectified without an additional cost to the government.It does seem to me to be really bordering on the pathetic that, on a day in which this nation received unemployment numbers of 5.3 per cent as a result of the economic stimulus that enabled hundreds of thousands of Australians to go home at the end of a working week with a pay packet in their hands, the best the opposition can do is point to one error by one contractor, out of 24,000 projects in more than 9,000 schools, that is not costing one extra dollar. It says everything about the shadow minister for education, everything about the hollowness of this opposition. They do not care about jobs. They do not care about health. They do not care about education. They do not care about cost pressures on families. And of course their greatest achievement this week is Tony's new tax on everything a family buys.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Werriwa for his question, and indeed I am pleased to inform the House that the division that we had just before question time, where once again those opposite opposed the legislation - this time put forward by the Minister for Resources and Energy - was the 44th piece of legislation passed through this House this year already. Indeed, last year this chamber passed 207 pieces of legislation - the highest number of bills this century, setting a new benchmark for this century at its beginning. But it is not surprising because this government has a big agenda for the nation.However, when bills pass this House we do have a problem getting them adopted by the parliament as a whole. Indeed, some 37 bills have been rejected by the Senate. Thirty-seven pieces of legislation have been either directly rejected or passed with amendments that were unacceptable to the House of Representatives. And that does not include the 18 bills that we had to reintroduce into the House of Representatives and which had to go back a second time to the other place. The fact is that the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party have the most obstructionist attitude in the Senate in three decades. Indeed, it is a fact that last year the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party blocked four times as many bills as in any year for 30 years. That is what is occurring from those opposite.I went into politics to make a difference. In 2007 the government promoted a program of making a positive agenda. Tories go into politics to block - particularly those opposite. They are only defined by what they oppose. In government, the current Leader of the Opposition ripped a billion dollars out of hospitals, he froze places for GPs, and now that he is in opposition he has been elected on a platform, in his own words, of simply opposing. He told 2GB on 11 January:Now sure, come election time people are entitled to know what we would do differently but at this stage of the political cycle our job is to ferociously criticise and where necessary oppose the Government. I mean, if in doubt our job is to oppose.PHI - oppose. Dental reform - oppose. Midwives - oppose. CPRS - oppose. Youth Allowance - oppose. Electoral reform - oppose. Paid paternity leave - oppose. NBN - oppose. Those opposite are simply led by the Dr No of Australian politics; they are simply defined by what they are opposed to. That shows how petty and how untrustworthy the Leader of the Opposition is - petty, untrustworthy and bloody-minded in his opposition to the reforms of this government.The member for Flinders then left the chamber. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. They did indeed oppose the economic stimulus plan; they did indeed oppose Building the Education Revolution. They opposed the increased spending for 14 roads; they opposed the rail safety program - they opposed the $1.2 billion to the ARTC; they opposed support for public housing; they opposed the tripling of the black spots program -  - Obstruction and opposition - they are the same thing, particularly when you look at those opposite. There are currently 51 pieces of legislation that have been carried by this House that are sitting over in the Senate waiting to be dealt with - 51 pieces of legislation. This morning, when I debated the Manager of Opposition Business on Sky News and this issue came up, he said on the CPRS, 'Why didn't you negotiate with the Greens?' Well, we negotiated in good faith and did a deal, in good faith, with the other major political party in this country. They walked away from it on the basis that the Leader of the Opposition was elected by his party on a platform of not standing for anything, of not worrying about policy but simply of opposing for opposition's sake.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition has no shame. They had 12 years to act on paid parental leave and what do we get? A big fat zero. This government, after two years in office, has made plain its plans for a paid parental leave scheme, one which will become active as of 1 January 2011, if those opposite choose to back it.The Leader of the Opposition, I think, has been on a road to Damascus on this one. It seems that when our policy came out he was probably in the position of his historical view of paid parental leave, which is not on his dead body. That was his historical principle position but something happened on the road to Damascus and he discovered paid parental leave. The second evolution was that he said, 'If there's going to be one, there'll be no new taxes.' How long did that position of principle last? Four weeks, and then that one was canned as well. Thirdly, he came out with a position which delivered his paid parental leave scheme which says that certain income earners will get something like $2,800 a week in exchange for average families having to pay increased prices for bread and increased prices for petrol through his great big new tax on everything. - The Leader of the Opposition is flipping and flopping between a position of principled opposition, then principled support for paid parental leave and principled opposition to any taxes on businesses that support parental leave, and then suddenly we discover those principles have gone out the back door. That one took only four weeks, Tony. Then on top of that we have his position last week. Initially, he was totally opposed to the government's position, but then after the blowtorch was applied over the course of the weekend they may now support it. We look forward to the opposition's support for what will be the first paid parental leave scheme in Australia's history and one which we have implemented in two years in office after they had 12 years to act. I look forward to their support.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The Australian government is committed to a strong economy protecting working families' jobs - hundreds of thousands of them - and keeping this economy out of recession, unlike those other economies around the world which went into recession through the global financial crisis. This Australian government is also committed to delivering on basics for working families in education, in health and in hospitals. That is why the Australian government has put forward a new National Health and Hospitals Network, funded nationally, run locally and, for the first time in the history of Australia, with the Australian government taking the dominant funding role for the future of the public hospital system. It is for these reasons that, in the last three days, I have been in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne talking to the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland trying to forge a national agreement with the government's plan, and that is why I will be heading to Western Australia before long as well - because those opposite had 12 years to act on the needs of our national health and hospital system and failed to do so.For working families there is nothing more basic than having enough doctors, enough GPs and enough specialists. That is what the government is delivering through its policy today. Six in 10 Australians live in an area where there are shortages of available doctors. This applied when the now Leader of the Opposition, then Minister for Health and Ageing, occupied that position for four to five years. When we travel to regional Australia we hear time and time again right across the nation about the shortage of doctors, the shortage of GPs. I was told that doctors in rural Australia are caring for 137 more patients a year than their city counterparts. In some of our capital cities we have had comments emailed to the yourHealth website to say that a particular patient has had to wait for more than a week to get access to a GP - and that was from a patient in one of our capital cities. This is simply not good enough and the time for action has well and truly come. The government will be delivering more than 6,000 new GPs and medical specialists to deliver better health services and better hospitals for working families. - They interject with 'When?' For 12 years they had time to act on this - the government's plan begins now. There is a serious shortage of doctors in Australia. According to the Department of Health and Ageing, to maintain current levels of GP and primary care services it is estimated that an additional 3,000 GPs will be needed over the course of the next decade. Furthermore, the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee and the medical colleges indicate that there will be a shortage of around 1,280 specialists over the next decade as well. This sort of advice is not new. Honourable members may be interested to know what the Leader of the Opposition was advised of when he was minister for health in 2005. The Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee's report 'The general practice workforce in Australia: supply and requirements to 2013' stated there will be:_ an annual requirement of between approximately 1,100 and 1,200 workforce entrants between 2007 and 2013. The current estimated entrants are in the range of 700 per year _The House will be interested to know that was the advice that the Leader of the Opposition as minister for health received in the year 2005, but instead of responding to these warnings what did the Leader of the Opposition do? He froze GP training places at 600. The Labor government, in its two years in office, has acted already in these areas. We increased the number of GP training places in 2009 by 12 per cent. We have provided 600 more scholarships for doctors since 2007. We have also funded 1,134 new training places for nurses and from 2009 universities have offered an additional 1,094 undergraduate nursing places.I say to the Leader of the Opposition, as he squirms in his seat over his appalling record on health and as a leader of the opposition who as minister for health has a very poor record to defend and, more importantly, has no plans for the future: what this government has done is to deliver $632 million to train an additional 6,000-plus doctors and specialists. This will double the number of GP training places to 1,200 a year. We will more than double the number of specialist training places to 850 places a year. This will deliver an additional 5½ thousand new or training general practitioners, 680 specialists and, through other reforms we have introduced, 5,400 prevocational places for training our next generation of doctors.These are fundamental and big reforms for the future. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: on GP training places alone, we will be investing $339 million to increase GP training places to 1,200 students per year, starting with 900 per year from next year. We will be doubling the number of GP training places we inherited from when Tony Abbott was minister for health. This is a fundamental and basic change for the future. - We are doing the same with specialist training places. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, who had four to five years to act on workforce shortages as minister for health, four to five years to act on GP shortages, four to five years to act on the shortages of specialists when he did effectively nothing other than to freeze the number of GP training places: this government is committed to delivering fundamental reforms to the health and hospital system for Australia, a national health and hospital network funded nationally, run locally and for the first time the Australian government is taking the dominant funding role for the future of Australia's public hospital system.</DOC>

 - I say to the Leader of the Opposition that I as Prime Minister accept full responsibility for problems which have arisen in the implementation of the Home Insulation Program. The Leader of the Opposition will be aware of what I referred to in the House last week about the briefings to the cabinet by the Coordinator-General, the correspondence between me and the Minister for Health and Ageing, and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet throughout that period was also engaged with other departments in the development and refinement of the Home Insulation Program. I as Prime Minister accept full responsibility for problems which have arisen. The reason Minister Combet has been appointed as the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency is to deal with problems in the system and we intend to get on with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for this question, because she has actually been campaigning for a very long time on health issues in her electorate, and I know that since the plan was announced 10 days ago she has been on radio and meeting with her doctors and nurses and at her local hospital, where there has been a keen interest in how this package will deliver benefits for regional communities, including regional hospitals. But, to add to those benefits, today the announcement that the Prime Minister has already mentioned is delivering significant changes through our health workforce into the future: more GP training places for all those communities across the country who cannot provide access to a GP for ordinary working families who just want to get some assistance and are forced to turn up at emergency departments across the country because they cannot access their GP. This is going to help ease that problem by doubling the number of GP training places. But, importantly, in rural and regional Australia - where it is actually those very same GPs who are working in our country hospitals - it will provide assistance to have more of those people available to service those very rural and regional hospitals.Importantly, we are also doubling the number of places the Commonwealth supports for medical specialists, and we have unapologetically said that those places will go where there are shortages in a particular specialty, like obstetrics and gynaecology, pathology or general surgery, and where there are shortages in particular regions. We have had very supportive comments from the colleges to indicate that they are very keen to work with us on these sorts of initiatives. We are also increasing the number of training places for junior doctors to make sure that they are getting experience not just in hospital clinical settings but also in general practice.This could not be a stronger contrast to the past. Of course the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister for many years. He did not tackle these problems; in fact he kept a cap on GP training places. -  - But there is something that was similar. I do not think this is what they are interjecting about, but I did realise there was a similarity in the number. The 6,000 number is something that is common, and the choice is: would you like 6,000 doctors or 6,000 golf balls? That is the choice between our side of the House and yours. Our answer is: actually tackle the shortage of doctors; do not just print some paraphernalia that does not help solve the problem. This package is us providing funding to support more than 6,000 GPs and specialists and more than another 5,000 places in training for doctor places.The Leader of the Opposition can say this is trivialising it, but what it highlights is the stark contrast between us and them. When presented with the very same problem, our answer is to do something about it; their answer is to pretend that this can be solved on the golf course. That is not how it can be solved, and we are taking real action to make a real difference. It is already underway. A hundred and seventy-five extra doctors are working in communities across the country because we have already invested. We have announced today that we are investing even more, and we will compare our record with theirs any day he chooses.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Expenditure on Medicare in Australia was over $14 billion in 2008-09. Given the size of this expenditure, it is important that every responsible government take steps to ensure the integrity of the Medicare payment system and ensure that taxpayers' funds are spent appropriately through a tough and thorough compliance program. But the current compliance program is voluntary, so, if Medicare Australia gets in contact with a medical practitioner, that practitioner can choose not to cooperate with the audit or not to substantiate their claim. At present, most medical practitioners do cooperate, but on average around 20 per cent of medical practitioners simply refuse to cooperate with a Medicare audit and do not supply the documents requested by Medicare.The government does not believe this approach is acceptable, so accordingly we have introduced a bill to fix this problem and to make it compulsory for medical practitioners to cooperate with a Medicare audit. The government has worked closely with stakeholders, including the Australian Medical Association, the Privacy Commissioner and the Consumers Health Forum, to balance privacy concerns with the public interest and to ensure that the integrity of the public revenue is protected while protecting privacy.You would have presumed - and the government presumed - that a measure to improve the integrity of Australia's Medicare payments would have been welcomed and supported by those opposite, and you would assume correctly: it was supported by those opposite. The opposition did have some sensible amendments to suggest, and these were negotiated through in good faith by the opposition and the government and supported by the government. But a funny thing happened on the way to the Senate: the Liberal Party changed leaders. Now we have a situation where the opposition, through the member for Dickson, are saying they will continue to block this measure unless their amendments are accepted - amendments which have absolutely nothing to do with the bill; amendments about a completely different measure that the member for Dickson has moved in this House and that the opposition have moved in the other place.But there is one little problem with the opposition's approach: it is called the Australian Constitution. The Speaker informed the House when the Senate amendments were discussed in the House that legal advice shows that these amendments would be a breach of the Constitution. But the Leader of the Opposition is not the sort of bloke to let a little thing like the Constitution get in his way when it comes to blocking important government legislation.It is a familiar story: the government and the opposition sit down and negotiate a public policy issue in good faith, the opposition suggests amendments, the government accepts them and we strike a deal. It sounds familiar, doesn't it? Whether it is climate change or the integrity of Medicare, the opposition is prepared to rip up agreements and to put politics before good public policy. We know it was politics first when it came to climate change. I understand tonight there is a program on the ABC - we cannot have advertising for the ABC - where the member for Wentworth talks about the opposition's change of heart when it comes to climate change. He says:I think it was entirely political in Tony's case.What a ripsnorter of a program that is going to be tonight.I do accept that the Leader of the Opposition is a conviction politician. But his only conviction is winning the next election: doing or saying whatever it takes to win the next election. He parades as opposing out of principle but his only principle is opposition. That is what we get from this Leader of the Opposition. When in doubt: block. Actually, when you are not in doubt: block; when you are supportive: block - do whatever it takes. He has become the Geoffrey Boycott of Australian politics: the great blocker - not good for much except blocking.He has gone from being the man who gouged a billion dollars out of the Australian health system to the man who is prepared to let fraud and non-compliance continue for his own political purposes; the man who is prepared to block a sensible bill, supported by the Australian Medical Association and supported by privacy advocates, for his own purposes. We know what damage he did to the Australian health system when he was minister for health. We know he gouged a billion dollars out of the health system: $172 million in 2004-05, $264 million in 2005-06 and $372 million in 2006-07 - all when the member for Warringah was the minister for health. He denies it now. We know what damage he did when he was minister for health and he seems determined to keep it up as Leader of the Opposition: the great weathervane, the great blocker - no policy alternatives, just his own political ends.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his very important question because this side of the House is focused on providing and putting forward sustainable health reform to make sure that the health system does not buckle under its own weight. Indeed, there is plenty of evidence from the 12 years of those opposite that that is precisely what was happening as the Leader of the Opposition ripped over a billion dollars out of our hospital system.We are determined to tackle this key intergenerational challenge. The challenge has been outlined before in two intergenerational reports, which were ignored by those opposite. But we on this side of the House take our responsibilities seriously. We understand there does need to be fundamental reform of our health and hospital system, in particular the funding of our health and hospital system. We need to ensure that the money is spent in the right place and in the right way. That is why the Prime Minister and the health minister have put forward this reform program.But of course we must put the finances of this program on a sustainable footing. That is why the government have been very busy over the past couple of budgets, making sure that we made the savings that were necessary so that we can fund future investments. There was $55 billion worth of savings over two budgets and savings that have also been made in the area of health. We understand how important it is to run a strict fiscal policy, particularly when we are faced with the ageing of our population and the consequences of that for future budgets. But of course many of these savings have been opposed by those opposite. They have opposed the means testing of the private health insurance rebate at a cost to the budget bottom line of $2 billion. That, more than anything else, shows how irresponsible and reckless those opposite are when it comes to this essential task of funding health and hospital reform.It is not just their opposition in the Senate to the means testing of the private health insurance rebate. As the minister previously said, there are at least half a dozen bills being blocked in the Senate with consequences for the fiscal stability of this country. Those opposite are turning out to be fiscal wreckers, and it is not just the opposition to the means testing of the private health insurance rebate. It is also their opposition to the attempts by the government to crack down on rorts in the chronic disease dental scheme, and that has been at a very significant cost to the budget.This was a scheme announced by those opposite in 2007, and it was supposed to cost $377 million over four years. Of course, it has cost far more than that: it is going to cost something like $800 million over the last two years alone. We have repeatedly tried in the Senate to push this legislation through to stop the rorts at public expense which are going to the bottom line of our budget. They come into this House and pretend to be fiscally responsible, then go up into the Senate and behave as fiscal vandals. We cannot fund a sustainable health system with that attitude. They are incapable of doing the right thing by the families of Australia and they are incapable of putting in place a fiscal strategy which is responsible and which delivers for Australian families, particularly in terms of their health care. They are blowing a hole in the budget to the tune of $11 billion over the forward estimates and they pretend to be fiscally responsible. What they have proven is that they are financial wreckers incapable of managing the finances of this country.</DOC>

I notice the questions on the paid parental leave revolution seem to have died on Tuesday of last week and after one question in question time today. The Leader of the Opposition asks me about the pagination of a report. I cannot comment on the pagination of a report. I cannot present on the order in which it is presented.

 - I thank the member for Moreton for the question about health reform. He has had a small taste of investments in health reform in his electorate already with the announcement of the Brisbane Southside GP superclinic. The University of Queensland is involved in that very important service which will be delivered to those communities in Moreton and the surrounds. The Commonwealth has released its historic national health reform plan, which is going to establish the National Health and Hospitals Network, which is funded nationally and run locally. Of course, our plan builds on two years of reform work already undertaken. The Rudd government is very proud of that work, which is already delivering benefits in hospitals, to the workforce, in preventative care in primary care and in dental heath as we speak.Unfortunately, though, not all of our plans have been implemented, as a number of them have been met with obstruction and game playing by the Liberal Party in the Senate. I would like to go through a short list of shame for the Liberal Party and their approach in the Senate. Early in our term they delayed closing the alcopops loophole for more than 12 months at the bidding of the distilling industry. They tried to block changes to the Medicare levy surcharge which were designed to provide relief to low-income earners. They backed the ophthalmologists when the government tried to adjust rebates for simple procedures. They rejected our sensible reforms to the private health insurance rebate - which, as the Treasurer has already mentioned, is costing the budget $2 billion over the forward estimates. And they are stalling the preventative health agency bill.Just last week we heard some worrying further reports of the rorting of the chronic disease dental scheme by some dentists and some GPs. Since this scheme began in November 2007 we know of a doctor who has referred approximately 13,000 services and one dentist who has received approximately $4 million in benefits This scheme was originally projected, as the Treasurer has mentioned, to cost $377 million over four years; instead, it is actually costing close to that per year and over $800 million in the last two years alone. The government have attempted to close this flawed scheme twice, but the Liberal Party has blocked both of our attempts. Our proposed alternative scheme would provide around a million dental services and treatments to needy Australians if the Liberals would stop blocking our attempts to implement it.Again this week in the Senate the coalition gets the chance to pass a landmark nursing and midwifery package. This will provide for the first time Medicare rebates and prescribing rights under the PBS for our hard-working midwives and highly skilled nurse practitioners. We know that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow health minister are anti-nurse. They have not agreed to pass this legislation. They have been delaying it at every turn, and if they did support nurses, they would have supported the passage of this important piece of legislation through the Senate by now. I highlight not only that this landmark reform is being delayed and mucked around by those opposite but also that, while on 1 July we would for the first time ever have been introducing a Commonwealth funded insurance package for midwives, that cannot happen if this legislation is not passed this week. It will be the Liberal Party who are being anti-nurse and anti-midwife by blocking that legislation. We need it to pass this week. It is the opportunity to show that you are not anti-nurse. We call on the Liberal Party to support this legislation, allow the insurance product for midwives to be passed and stop blocking these important reforms for thousands of nurses and midwives across the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for this question because it is a very real issue for regional communities, who can rest assured that there is not a single thing in our plan which will require the closure of any hospital across the country. In fact, quite to the contrary, what this plan will do is see the Commonwealth step up to shoulder the major burden of responsibility for funding hospital services. When you look not only at the extra funding of hospital services but also the autonomy that we are seeking to give to local communities to be able to make decisions which are closer to home - whether it is in Mt Isa or Cloncurry or in the examples that the member for Kennedy used - so that services can be planned within very vast but often not very populated regions, it will make sure that health services can be delivered to communities when and where they need them.Add this part of the package that was announced 10 days ago to the very important package which was announced today, which is particularly targeting the shortage of both GPs and medical specialists in rural and regional Australia, and add on top of that the rural health incentives that were in last year's budget and come online on 1 July, and you can see that there is a lot of good news for regional Australia. I understand that it is a lot of good news that has been long time coming. It will take a lot of effort and energy from people on this side of House, and from our doctors, nurses and local administrators across the country, to make sure that these incentives are taken advantage of and that we are able to plan decent services in communities like the examples that have been raised by the member for Kennedy.I am very proud of how this package actually secures funding for the first time in a long time, with the Commonwealth shouldering the vast burden of responsibility for that. We are prepared to step into that gap. We are prepared to make sure that regional Queensland, regional New South Wales, regional Western Australia, regional South Australia and all of the regional communities across the country actually get the services that they deserve. It is important to make sure that they can get services outside hospital and it is important to make sure they can access services in a hospital when they are needed. This plan makes that possible and sustainable into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question. I know he is a great supporter of his local schools and a great supporter of the difference that the more than $16 billion in the Building the Education Revolution Program is making to schools in his community and around the country. This scheme is good for jobs, as the Treasurer indicated when he released the national accounts earlier this month and noted:The infrastructure stimulus in _ schools helped to offset continued weakness in non-residential buildings.As well as being good for jobs, this program is good for schools. Let us listen to the voices of school communities themselves. For example, Peter and Susan Patchin from Holland Park, in the electorate of Bonner, wrote to me on 16 February saying:We were overwhelmed by the wonderful new facilities. They are already making a huge difference to the daily life of both the students and the community.That is a typical reaction to this school modernisation program. Or there is the reaction of Mr Jeffs, who is the Principal of the Korumburra Primary School in the electorate of McMillan. He said on 2 March:Everyone is really excited about our new facilities. One of the most exciting projects has been the quadrangle roofing that has created an all-weather physical activity area. It's been sensational. On hot days kids can play under it and normally on a hot day there would be no kids playing in the quadrangle because it's just too hot.Again, that is another typical example of the reaction of school communities to the Building the Education Revolution Program. I am asked about reactions to this BER program and risks to its further implementation. Of course, the main risk to its implementation is the quandary the opposition finds itself in on the question of whether or not the program should be continued.On some days, opposition members come into this House and demand an end to the school stimulus spending because they make airy-fairy references as to how cutting this spending would enable them to fund their reckless promises. Then on other days, members of the opposition are running around their electorates wanting to be as associated with this school expenditure as much as they possibly can be.But this hypocrisy has reached new heights - heights we have never seen before. There is the Leader of the Opposition who has described this expenditure as low-grade spending. When challenged on his lack of costings and lack of funding for his promises, with a wave of his hand he says, 'Oh, we could cut some of the stimulus money and somehow that would fix it all'. That is what the Leader of the Opposition says. The shadow Treasurer has said this:For example, in schools all around Australia construction hasn't even started yet on replacement school halls. Now it's time to look again at the massive stimulus spending.And the shadow Minister for Finance, in his even more forthright way, says:I'd like really to go through this and try and start trimming back some of that $21 billion they're about to spend.Clearly leaders of the opposition, people at the leadership level - the leader himself, the shadow Treasurer, the shadow finance minister - have indicated they believe that this program is ripe for cutback, that if they came to government they would be prepared to rip money out, to leave half-constructed school facilities decaying, open to the wind and the rain.Interestingly, now the shadow minister for education has said the complete reverse. He has written to the Australian Primary Principals Association's March newsletter and said this, and mark these words:A Coalition Government will not stop phase three of the BER, but we will be rigorously examining every dollar spent to ensure schools receive value for money.There we have it: hypocrisy laid absolutely bare by the shadow minister for education, who is trying to pretend to primary principals that the opposition supports this expenditure at the same time that the leader, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister for finance threaten this expenditure.I say to the shadow minister for education: if his leader gets his way and cuts this expenditure back, what is he going to say to St Joseph's, St Paul's and St Francis in his electorate? Will they get their school projects? What will he say to Athelstone primary or Trinity Gardens? To the Leader of the Opposition, the man with the least credibility on economics ever to lead the Liberal Party, I say: how is it that he and his finance and economics team can point to hacking money out of schools as a savings measure when, at the same time, his shadow minister for education verifies to primary principals that every dollar will be spent? You cannot have it both ways, and there is the economic credibility of the opposition in tatters yet again.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and particularly for the hard work that he does on behalf of the more than 25,000 pensioners in his electorate. This government does understand that pensioners do it tough. That is why we have delivered for pensioners. We delivered a pension increase in last year's budget, and that was worth more than $70 a fortnight for singles on the maximum rate. From this Saturday, of course, pensions will rise again. Regular indexation will increase the maximum single rate by $29.20 a fortnight, and the maximum rate for couples combined will increase by $44 a fortnight. If you add together the budget increase for pensioners and indexation, single pensioners on the maximum rate are up to $100 a fortnight better off than they were in August last year. That, I have to say, is on top of the increase to the utilities allowance of almost $400 which we also delivered. So we certainly have delivered for pensioners and we will continue to do so.One of the things we know is that pensioners certainly do feel any increase in the cost of living, whether it is to essentials like food, petrol or utility bills. That is one of the reasons that we introduced a special measure for pensioners last year to make sure that the value of the pension really kept up with the cost of living of pensioners. What pensioners cannot afford is a brand-new tax delivered by the Leader of the Opposition that would push up prices. But, of course, we know that is exactly what this Leader of the Opposition has in mind for them: a big new tax on the very companies that sell food to pensioners. The opposition wants to put a tax on supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths, two of the companies being targeted by this Leader of the Opposition's great big new tax. As the chamber of commerce said last week:The impact of a new tax or levy imposed upon business cannot be quarantined and these changes end up having an impact on overall prices _That is crystal clear to every single pensioner in the country. One thing is for certain about this Leader of the Opposition: he has a giant new tax that is going to apply to supermarkets, and that will mean increased prices for pensioners.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question. The government does not support new spending being financed by the introduction of distortions into the tax system. The key reason why we have rejected the demand made to us by the opposition to support the great big tax being proposed by the opposition to finance paid parental leave is that the proposal does involve the introduction of major new distortions into Australia's taxation system. Companies who fall above the $5 million per annum taxable income threshold will inevitably, in many cases, be competing with companies who fall below that threshold, therefore suffering a significant competitive disadvantage. The threshold of $5 million would act as a significant disincentive for companies just below the threshold to grow, to increase employment or, indeed, to merge with other companies. The threshold would distort investment decisions and it is quite unclear what connection there would be between that changed company tax rate and the existing arrangements with respect to dividend imputation and franking credits in the tax system. Perhaps at some point the Leader of the Opposition may wish to explain that particular aspect.This proposal would also constitute an excellent incentive for phoney restructuring of companies in order to avoid the tax threshold. But, most importantly of all, this proposal would inevitably lead to the increased tax being passed on to consumers, whether it is through major supermarkets like Woolworths and Coles, petrol stations via Shell and BP, or Telstra. Major companies are big providers of essential products to households around the country. Of course, they also provide substantial inputs to small business. So, the increased cost impact for consumers would flow through directly via larger businesses and also indirectly through smaller businesses.Actually, it is something of a furphy that this proposal applies only to so-called big business. In fact, of the 3½ thousand or so businesses that are above the threshold, I understand that 400 or so actually employ 20 or fewer employees - hardly big business. In fact, when the opposition were in government, under their infamous Work Choices approach, they set the threshold for what they saw as smaller business at 100 employees and they exempted any company that had fewer than 100 employees from unfair dismissal laws. But in this case they defined big business as companies that have as few as 20, or even fewer, employees.I am delighted that at least one aspect of the confusion that has been generated over the past week on this issue has belatedly been cleared up by the opposition, and that is the indication that they are prepared to pass the government's paid parental leave scheme in the Senate. That is a positive development, and I look forward to this new-found commitment to responsibility transferring to other proposals that are also before the Senate. For example, the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Bill, which is proposing to introduce greater integrity and accountability into Australia's electoral system, is before the Senate this week.In all of this there is an object lesson for the opposition on the dangers of making it up on the run and making it up as you go along. They did not consult business. They did not consult their own party. The Leader of the Opposition did not consult his shadow cabinet or his economic shadow ministers - the shadow minister for finance or the shadow Treasurer. The end result is a flaky, flabby, sloppy policy. But it does not look like the Leader of the Opposition is about to change. On Friday, he was asked: 'You've broken your promise not to introduce any new taxes; will you promise now not to do it again?' His response was very interesting. His response was, 'That's not my intention.' He has learned his lesson here. He has worked this one out.The Leader of the Opposition is very keen on exercise. He is a very physical kind of guy. We see him on our TV sets night after night in the speedos, in the swimming pool or on the quad bike. I have even seen him jogging inside Parliament House from time to time. But there is one part of his body that does not get much exercise, and that is the brain - and it is long overdue that it got a work-out in the interests of the Australian nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. We understand that there are many candidates for the job of shadow minister for education, and we have just found another one - and he may well be better at it. I say to the member that I am aware that there has been some publicity locally about the school that he refers to. When we look at that kind of comparison, frequently we find when people are talking about construction costs that we are not getting an apples-to-apples comparison. People would be aware that it is common to quote per metre costs to lock-up stage; whereas, of course, the per metre costs for Building the Education Revolution are for the fully fitted out facility - that is, the teacher walks in the door, turns on the lights, the students walk in behind him or her and everything they need to conduct the class is already there in the facility and the fittings are there.Obviously, if the member wishes me to look at the example, I will. But I say to the member opposite that there is an essential hypocrisy at the centre of this that really needs to have a light shined on it. I hope he says to the P&amp;C at that school: 'If I'd had my way, you wouldn't have got one dollar of this expenditure. We wouldn't be debating what it is that your school is getting because you would not have got one dollar of this expenditure.' And I hope he says to the workers on that construction site -  - I will give him points for loyalty to his leader, because his leader is on the record describing expenditure on schools generally as 'low-grade expenditure'. Clearly, there is a view throughout the opposition that, if you spend a dollar on schools, it is a dollar ill spent. Heaven knows, that was their track record in government. That is why as a government we have come in and almost doubled the amount of expenditure on Australia's schools. We have done that because we think they are a great place to put new resources. We think they are a great place to put new facilities. We think they are a great place to encourage better teaching, literacy and numeracy. We think it is a good thing to give more money to disadvantaged schools.We know those beliefs are not shared by those opposite, but can I say to the member for Cowper that I hope he has the guts and the honesty to go to the P&amp;C at that school and say, 'I didn't support a dollar being spent on this school.' I hope he has the guts to go to the workers who work on that construction site and look them in the eye and say, 'I didn't support you having a job during the global recession.' I hope he has the guts to go and say to any apprentices employed on that site, 'I didn't support you having a job and getting training during the global recession.' That is the position of his political party.Let us remember that, despite the mealy-mouthed assurances of the shadow minister for education, which are contradicted every day by his leader, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister, each and every one of those opposite is on the record in this place, on 
Hansard, name by name, seat by seat, as having voted against this expenditure on schools, and every member of their electorate is going to know it by polling day.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Denison for his question. Today, the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology have released the State of the climate 
report on the science that underpins climate change. It is the latest in a long list of credible, peer reviewed scientific reports into the science of climate change. The report shows that Australia has warmed significantly over the last 50 years and, in fact, that some areas have experienced a warming of 1.5 to two degrees Celsius over that period. The report notes that the evidence indicates a mean increase across the country over 50 years of 0.7 degrees Celsius. The report also examines the evidence of human influence and finds that it has been detected in the results concerning ocean warming, sea level rise, continental average temperatures, temperature extremes and wind patterns. This is the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology.The report also finds that about half of the observed reduction in winter rainfall in south-west Western Australia can be explained by higher carbon pollution levels. It confirms that climate change is real and that we do need to reduce our contribution to it and to adapt to its impact. It shows that climate change is already beginning to impact Australians and will affect us significantly in coming years. Megan Clark, the CSIRO chief executive, had this to say:Climate change is real. Our records show there is no disputing that, and the next step is to meet this challenge through mitigation and adaptation.As I have indicated on previous occasions, in answer to questions in the House, no government that is responsible can ignore the evidence before it, ignore the facts. It must be recognised that action on climate change is needed and that we need to take it now. We need to reduce carbon emissions and we need to act as part of an international effort in that regard.All of the evidence, including this from the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, is in stark contrast to the utterances of the Leader of the Opposition on this issue. He, notoriously, has contributed that the evidence about climate change is 'absolute crap' but that some kind of fig leaf is needed because the politics of the issue are difficult for the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition does not accept the climate science and is more worried about the politics. We know, and the community knows, that that side of politics remains split into two camps. Apparently, as my colleague the Minister for Human Services indicated in an earlier answer in question time, in a program to air on the ABC this evening the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, averts to this again by confirming that he thinks the stance that the Leader of the Opposition took was entirely political - nothing to do with policy but all about politics.Yet the evidence continues to mount about the need for policy responses to deal with climate change. The national interest of this country is best served by taking credible and economically responsible action to reduce carbon emissions - not the grab bag of picked winners that has been articulated by the Leader of the Opposition as a fig leaf political response to this important issue. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation is in the Senate. The evidence has mounted. You should support the legislation.</DOC>

 - We always welcome questions from the member for Sturt. What is interesting about question time today, though, is that, on the day the government announces the biggest addition to the workforce of doctors in Australia, there is not one question on health, not one question on doctors and not one question on specialists. In fact, since we announced our plans for a new National Health and Hospitals Network, we have had maybe two or three questions altogether, because they know that their record on health and hospitals is appalling and they know as well that they have no plan for the future on health and hospitals.The member for Sturt asked about Building the Education Revolution. This government is proud of Building the Education Revolution. This government is proud of the fact that we have stepped in to make a difference right across the country for this economy at a time when economies around the world were going into recession, one by one. What we did was step up to the plate to make a difference.What was the alternative script advocated by those opposite? The alternative script advocated by those opposite was to do nothing. They would have happily seen hundreds of thousands of working families go into unemployment. They would have liked to have seen tradies across the country with no work. They would have liked to have seen apprentices dismissed from their firms. That is the direct consequence of the policy put forward by those opposite.The member for Sturt asked specifically about individual schools. As I and members on our side of the House have travelled around the nation, one P&amp;C, one P&amp;F, after the other has said: 'Thank God the government has acted to help us with our school. Thank God that we have a government which wants to give us new libraries, new language centres, new science centres, new multipurpose halls and state-of-the-art libraries.' In fact, many of the schools that I have visited have never had a purpose-built library in their history. That is about equipping our kids to have a decent education for the 21st century.Those opposite have no interest in delivering the basics: no interest whatsoever in supporting our economy and protecting jobs, no interest in delivering the basics on schools, and no interest in delivering the basics on health and hospitals. They have one interest alone, and that is to score cheap and tawdry political points in question time. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, who has not had the courage today to stand up and ask a single question on health - not a single question on hospitals - that it is about time he got real with the agenda and the challenges facing Australia for the future. We have seen none of it so far.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question and I acknowledge her interest in and commitment to this area. I am pleased to report to the House that today the government has tabled the Disability (Access to Premises - Building) Standards 2010 and earlier in the day, with my colleagues Senator Kim Carr, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, and Parliamentary Secretaries Shorten and Marles, I launched the access to premises standards. Indeed, we launched them at the National Museum, which itself is a public building which represents a tangible example of what the standards aim to achieve.Work on establishing these standards has been going on for over 10 years, but since coming to office the government has made this a clear priority. The standards will, for the first time, provide minimum access requirements for persons with a disability in respect of a range of new buildings and upgraded buildings such as workplaces, schools, universities, shopping centres, entertainment venues and certain accommodation. The standards will ensure that people with a disability can access employment, general services and entertainment and become involved in the community on an equal basis.The standards will apply to new buildings and also existing buildings that are undergoing significant upgrade. They will not, accordingly, represent an impost on existing building owners. Our approach is essentially based on common sense and good faith, and we believe the standards strike the right balance for both the disability sector and the building industry sector. Indeed, the standards for the sector will provide greater certainty for business by providing for a national consistency and reducing the different regulatory arrangements. They will be achieved through harmonisation of the Building Code of Australia and the disability standards.The standards essentially recognise the practical realities of what can be reasonably required and also enforced. For example, they contain an exemption to cover situations where meeting the standard would cause unjustifiable hardship for persons undertaking the upgrade. The standards will come into operation on 1 May next year, and until then the government will work with industry to ensure that industry has all the necessary information prior to the implementation of the standards.I take the opportunity to commend the work of Senator the Hon. Kim Carr, who has worked with me on the standards, the Hon. Bill Shorten, Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, and also Richard Marles, Parliamentary Secretary for Innovation and Industry, who have worked very closely with Senator Carr. I also acknowledge the work of the Human Rights Commission and, in particular, Mr Graeme Innes and his staff in developing these standards. I would also like to thank members from both sides of the House who participated in the consideration of the standards through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.The standards are a concrete example of the government's work to achieve more consistent, systemic and widespread improvements in building access for people with a disability. There are currently over four million people in Australia with a disability, and this figure is going to increase with the ageing of the population. The finalisation of these standards represents an important part of ensuring an inclusive Australian society. The government will continue to work hard to improve those rights and fully include all people in the social, economic and cultural life of the country. I thank all those involved in this important milestone.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I inform the honourable member of the following in response to his question: the highest number of boats arriving in Australia in any one year was, in fact, in the year 1999 when 3,700 asylum seekers arrived on 86 boats. That is one measure. The highest number of asylum seekers arriving in Australia in any one year was in 2001 under the previous Howard government. - In response to the honourable member who refers I believe to recent statistics, in November 1999 there were 14 boat arrivals - the highest number of boats in any one month on record. This was followed by a further 10 arrivals in December 1999. I refer to a quote from the then minister who said that in the period following:_ 1 November 1999, 29 boats and 2 245 people have arrived illegally in Australia, mostly from the Middle East and the sub continent.When the Leader of the Opposition asks questions about the effectiveness of government policy at different times and under different security circumstances, I would draw his attention to the historical record of his own party when in government. Furthermore, in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question, firstly, the Australian government has more naval and air assets patrolling our borders than any other government. Secondly, we are investing more in international and regional action to counter people smuggling than any other government. Thirdly, we have arrested more people smugglers than any other government, I am advised, with 117 arrests of which 89 are currently before the courts. Fourthly, I am advised that under this government we are seeing more people-smuggling ventures disrupted than under any other government.I say to those opposite that the responsibility of any elected government of Australia is to take appropriate action in response to whatever global security circumstances and regional security circumstances present to that government at the time. Mr Howard when he was Prime Minister did so in the surge in people-smuggling activity which occurred in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. This government is doing so today in response to the challenges which have, in particular, arisen from Sri Lanka. In response to the Leader of the Opposition, this government will continue to take a responsible approach in dealing with the challenge of people smuggling and those who are found not to be genuine asylum seekers will be sent back home as, in fact, we have already done in a number of cases.</DOC>

 - I always like that fact that when a question on health and hospitals is asked in this parliament those opposite have one response, which is to laugh. Those opposite do not actually have a lot to laugh about when you reflect upon their 12 years of inaction in office. The government yesterday announced that we would be investing in more than 6,000 new doctors on the ground: 5,500 new or training general practitioners, 680 specialists and 5,400 pre-vocational general practice placements. Can I also say to those opposite that this follows on the 35 per cent increase in GP training places already in this government's first two years in office.Those opposite should pay some attention to the indications of support which the government has received in response to the announcement it made yesterday. Firstly, from the AMA president:This is a very strong investment in medical training and an acknowledgement by the Government of the vital role that GPs will play in meeting the future health needs of the Australian population.Furthermore, from the President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners:This is a very important investment by the government into general practice _                   _              _              _The evidence is clear that more GPs will lead to better health outcomes, enhanced health prevention, better management of chronic illness and lower rates of unnecessary hospital admissions.Furthermore, we have a statement from the Australian Medical Students Association:Medical students around Australia, especially those set to graduate from 2012 onwards, will breathe a collective sigh of relief when hearing these announcements and will now be more optimistic and certain about the future of their training in Australia.This is the action the government has undertaken in its first two years in office and our planned proposed action when it comes to additional GP training places and specialist training places for the future.On the question of health workforce shortages, I draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to the number of warnings he received in the four years plus that he was health minister of Australia. In 2005 there was a Productivity Commission report warning him of the acute emerging shortage in the health workforce of Australia. This followed a 2003 warning by the President of the AMA, who said:The workforce shortage is a direct consequence of restricting the number of medical students and medical provider numbers - together with the underfunding of Medicare - especially since the mid-1990s.But these are just two warnings. If you go to the entire list of the warnings which the Leader of the Opposition received when he was health minister, it is a staggering length of warnings that he received in those four years plus that he was minister. He got seven warnings on the shortage of doctors, nine warnings on the shortage of nurses, three warnings on the shortage of specialists, four warnings on the shortage of funding, two warnings on the shortage of surgeons and three warnings on the state of the health system but, despite all of that, what is the sterling defence used by the Leader of the Opposition today as to why he did nothing? He said today when asked this question, 'We were about to start tackling the public hospital system when we lost office.' He had been in office for 12 years and he had been the health minister for four or five years, and the one line of defence he comes up with today of all days, fifteen years later, is, 'We were about to start tackling the public hospital system.'Is it any wonder that no-one in the public believes the Leader of the Opposition on health and hospitals? His record is appalling. He gouged a billion dollars out of the public hospital system, he froze GP training places and his one line of defence is, 'I was going to do something about it on the eve of the last election.' We are interested in what you are going to do now as well!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I assume he would also of course be concerned about the fact that during the period of the Howard government we had in given years 3,700 people arrive, 2,900 people arrive, 5,500 people arrive - in fact, the gold, silver and bronze awards when it comes to the arrival of individuals in this country by boat goes to the Howard government one, two and three. -  - The honourable member also asked about the use of onshore facilities. I draw the honourable member's attention to the following. In fact, in 2006-07 - notwithstanding what was then described as the Pacific solution - we had the transfer of asylum seekers from Christmas Island, Nauru and Manus to various mainland centres. That occurred during the period when the Leader of the Opposition's party was in government. But of course we could not possibly expect consistency on the part of those opposite on these questions; nor could we expect consistency on the part of those opposite when, not long after this government was elected and we changed the Pacific solution, the then shadow minister for immigration and citizenship came out and publicly welcomed the changes we had embraced. But that seems to have been airbrushed from history as political opportunity presents its face right now to the Leader of the Opposition.I also draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the following statement:It is timely to remember that the use of people smugglers to get around a country's rules about who can come and who can stay is a worldwide problem. Australia is not alone.That was said by none other than Phillip Ruddock when he had charge and responsibility for the immigration system of Australia. Therefore, when it comes to consistency when confronted with the challenges of global push factors from the Middle East and from the region and dealing with them on the ground, those opposite were confronted with the same sorts of challenges that this government has been confronted with as well.I draw their attention to their practice - that is, their use of various facilities. I draw their attention to the statements made by Phillip Ruddock and by others. And I draw their attention also to the fact that, when it comes to the numbers of people arriving here by boat and by other means, during their period in government there were quite a considerable number of arrivals in this country. As I said, based on those numbers that I presented to the parliament before, they were most significant indeed - running into the thousands - and across a single three-year period there were almost 12,000 in total.These are practical challenges faced by governments across the world. This government will continue to implement a responsible policy - one which deals with the challenges that present themselves through global circumstances. We continue to maintain a policy which includes offshore processing, which includes mandatory detention, which includes stringent health, identity and security checks, which protects our national security and one in which we also act consistently with this country's international obligations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. She always has a strong interest in this as her electorate of Ballarat does have a number of shortages, as do the electorates of many people in this House, which we unfortunately inherited from the previous government. When a person known to everyone in this House was the health minister, 74 per cent of the country was suffering a shortage of doctors and 60 per cent of the population were affected by that shortage. So of course the announcement made yesterday would be welcome news for many people in the community.I must admit that I have not seen any welcoming comments from those opposite. Unlike the member for Ballarat, who is clearly interested in what this announcement can deliver for her electorate, I do wonder whether the member for Dickson - I know parts of his electorate are areas with workforce shortage but I think he is too busy tweeting at the moment to be able to consider his constituents - is going to advocate or oppose funding that will go towards more doctors in his electorate. I know the member for Cowper has had a very keen interest in the shortage of doctors in his electorate and I imagine that as a leader in the National Party he will be advocating to Mr Abbott that they should be supporting this plan.There are plenty of other examples - whether we look at a town like Yea in McEwen, whether we look down to Port Macquarie or whether we look at a range of other electorates. When you have 60 per cent of the population affected by a shortage that was ignored time after time by the Leader of the Opposition, is it any wonder that you have very strong praise from the AMA, the College of General Practitioners, the students, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists welcoming this as an important step forward?I wanted to also flag for people's attention the comment that the Prime Minister has mentioned - that is, that Mr Abbott has said: 'Really, everything was running pretty well in our health system when I was the minister, except for our public hospitals - just this minor issue that we were going to turn our minds to next.' But I would like to remind the Leader of the Opposition, who was the health minister, that to assert that the federally run parts of our health system were working pretty well under the Howard government when 74 per cent of the country were suffering from a workforce shortage is just to show how blind the Leader of the Opposition remains to this problem.He did not see it as a problem when he was in government and he still does not see it as a problem. That is why he has not come out and welcomed these investments. He has not acknowledged that there are already more doctors being trained because his cap was removed by us when we were elected to government. He has not had the decency to acknowledge that this is a problem that he failed to fix and that we are now taking action to fix. It was not because he did not know about it. As the Prime Minister said, there were 31 different warnings, seven of them on the shortage of doctors, and these were just public warnings and public reports. I am sure he was urged time after time in private meetings to take action, as we have been urged to and as we have been doing.For the benefit of the House, and given that the Leader of the Opposition allowed all of these problems to fall on deaf ears when he was the health minister, I might also report to the House that just moments before coming into question time the other place finally agreed to pass the Health Legislation Amendment (Midwives and Nurse Practitioners) Bill 2009. It is a vital reform to our health system that has been opposed by those opposite. Finally, they have conceded that this is an important and historic occasion for nurses and midwives and will be welcomed. I report it to the House because it reflects exactly the same approach taken by the opposition to the problems that were raised with this shortage of doctors. As I say, those opposite could not quite bring themselves to support the package but they did concede that they would not oppose the package. Finally, one of the Liberal senators gave the game away and said with a sigh, 'This is better than nothing,' and nothing is what Mr Abbott obviously gave everybody else.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Presumably he would be referring also to the 5,800 who arrived here as asylum seekers in 2002, the 4,400 who arrived here in 2003 and the 3,200 who arrived here in 2004 et cetera. Can I say also to those opposite in response to the question concerning people-smuggling activities that in Indonesia - and we were pleased, I believe, in this parliament to welcome the President of the Indonesian Republic last week - the total number of disruptions undertaken by our partners since September 2008 is 107. That involved - how many people? - 2,828 people and 54 separate arrests. In Malaysia, there were 21 disruptions involving 645 people, and, in Sri Lanka, there were 14 disruptions involving 270 people and 63 arrests. So I would say to the honourable member in response to his question that these are the concrete actions the government is undertaking in its activities in partnership with our regional partners in South-East Asia. It is the practical work which the previous government sought to do from time to time. We will take appropriate national actions, regional actions and international actions to deal with a problem which is being confronted by many countries around the world at present.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question. Accuracy in budget reporting of Commonwealth funding of public hospitals is extremely important, so I am somewhat distressed at recent disputes as to whether or not that reporting has been accurate. You will be aware that the government has consistently pointed out in recent times that while the Leader of the Opposition was minister for health, more than $1 billion was ripped out of federal government funding of public hospitals. As you will know from his demeanour at the dispatch box, the Leader of the Opposition suggests that this is not true. In fact, he stated that the billion dollars being removed from the public hospital system was in fact removed by the Howard government in the 1996 budget.I had a look at the 1996 budget papers, because I happen to have them with me here, and in fact the total amount cut from Commonwealth funding for public hospitals - he clearly was not trying - was only about $312 million in the 1996 budget estimates. I also decided that, having had a look at those, I had probably better have a look at the budget papers that applied to the period when the Leader of the Opposition was health minister. I should remind the House that that was from 7 October 2003 to 3 December 2007, and the relevant healthcare agreement for the Commonwealth funding of public hospitals was from July 2003 to July 2008. The 2003 budget papers show that over that relevant period there were in fact significant cuts in projected spending on public hospitals and there were downgrades of the forward estimates for those periods, and I will run through them for you. For 2003-04, a cut of $109 million -  - I point out for the benefit of the House that I am in fact quoting from Howard government budget papers. I will start the sequence again. The forward estimates for spending on public hospitals were reduced for the year 2003-04 by $109 million, for the year 2004-05 by $172 million, for the year 2005-06 by $265 million and for the year 2006-07 by $373 million. A quick calculation shows that they add up to roughly $920 million, so not quite $1 billion and the Leader of the Opposition was not health minister for the first three months of that period. However, the agreement was for five years and according to the department the cut in the forward estimates for 2007-08 was $497 million. Even though the Leader of the Opposition was only minister for the first half of that period, whichever way you do the sums on this it is absolutely plain on the budget record of the Howard government that the Leader of the Opposition, as health minister, presided over more than $1 billion being ripped out of the projected forward spending estimates for the public hospitals of Australia. It is there in black and white on page 179 of Budget Paper No. 2 2003-04 circulated by the Hon. Peter Costello and the Hon. Nick Minchin. In case they really need it explained I will table the budget paper -  -  -  - In case there is any doubt about the true meaning of Budget Paper No. 2 page 179, I would refer the Leader of the Opposition to the explanation for these cuts in projected spending - and that is, expected lower growth in public hospital usage because of the shift to private hospitals expected because of the government's 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and Lifetime Health Cover. So this is not some technical readjustment, reassessment of hospital costs or anything like that, it is a deliberate ideological decision by the former government in which he was health minister to move money away from public hospitals. -  - I note that on the doors today the Leader of the Opposition was sliding around a bit and he said:At one stage there was an adjustment to the forward estimates_The facts are very clear. The previous budget projected a certain level of forward spending on public hospitals. The Howard government introduced the private health insurance rebate and cut that projected spending to the tune of over $1 billion over the period for which the Leader of the Opposition was health minister. No amount of slick and slimy sophistry can change the truth that every time he gets up and does a personal explanation on these issues he is deliberately and directly misrepresenting the facts. The truth is that the Howard government with the Leader of the Opposition as health minister ripped out over $1 billion from projected public hospital funding and he is nothing other than a complete policy fraud. If he spent more time focusing on patients and less time buffing up his pecs for the cameras we might treat him seriously. - I withdraw, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canning for his question given his well-known commitment to the defence of a proper and balanced policy when it comes to asylum seekers and Australia's national security. We know that he has been out there with the member for Berowra on these questions for a long, long time.The honourable member asks about the arrival of asylum seekers in Australia. I say to the honourable member that all governments past have been confronted with arrivals by boat and by other means. I also refer to the fact that, in the period following the introduction of the so-called Pacific solution by those opposite, in each year following that we had thousands upon thousands upon thousands of asylum seekers arrive in Australia. I would say in response to the honourable member that global security circumstances constantly change, as they did for the Howard government, as they will do for this government and as they will do into the future as well. Therefore, it is important to respond appropriately to the practical circumstances which present themselves and we will continue to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for this very important question, because the Australian economy has come through this global recession in stronger shape than any other advanced economy - the strongest growing of 33 advanced economies, and one of only two that did not contract during the calendar year 2009. Of course, we have unemployment rates that are the envy of the United States and Europe, and there have been something like 180,000 jobs created over the past year. I think that is supported strongly by everyone on this side of the House that has supported the government's economic stimulus.The fact is that Australians have worked together - employers and employees. The community has come together to produce this outcome, and this has been a remarkable achievement. It has been commented on today by the Reserve Bank in their minutes that have been released today. This is what they had to say:It now appeared that the peak unemployment rate in the recent downturn had been equal to around the low point in the previous three cycles.That is a fantastic result for Australia. This has been commented upon by the Commonwealth Bank and their chief economist, Michael Blythe, who had this to say a couple of days ago:The Australian economy withstood the full force of the global financial crisis and recession remarkably well. Australia dodged the recession bullet.That is what Michael Blythe had to say. He then went on to comment as to how that was the case, and he had this to say:A year ago, consumer sentiment in Australia was collapsing, much as it was everywhere else. The extreme pessimism proved relatively short lived, however. A large part of the divergence between expectations and reality reflects the fact that aggressive policy action worked, and it worked quickly.That was the impact of the government stimulus.Of course, what the events of the past 18 months show is the importance of maintaining confidence through responsible economic management. Of course, what we have seen from those opposite is exactly the opposite. What we have seen is a glimpse of erratic and reckless decisions from the Leader of the Opposition and what he might do if he were in government. We have seen total disarray. Those opposite could not describe the size of the tax, who it would apply to or when it would start. They have simply been in disarray.But the really good news is that Senator Joyce came back today. He came back to make it all crystal clear. He was asked by Lyndal Curtis on AM this question:Business _ will pass on this tax if you are taxing companies like Woolworths and Coles. That will feed into the _ price of bread and milk, won't it?Senator Joyce said:_ it will _Of course, what he has confirmed is what we have been saying: the price will be paid by pensioners and families - all of this so somebody on $150,000 a year can receive $2,800 per week. He is not content with pulling a billion dollars out of public hospitals. Pulling a billion dollars out of public hospitals is fine, but he wants to pay $2,800 per week to somebody on $150,000 a year. That just tells you the twisted priorities of this Leader of the Opposition and how out of touch he is with the lifestyles of average Australians.He said something very revealing in the party room last week. We discovered what was under the budgie smugglers: a big new tax. -  -  - I withdraw. When the Leader of the Opposition was speaking in the party room last week - and I think he has made these remarks before - he said that he would always prefer to apologise after, rather than seek permission before, a policy announcement. That should send a chill down the spine of every business in this country. He would prefer not to seek permission before - not be upfront with the people of Australia and the business community, but take a decision and then somehow make it right by apologising later.His arrogance in those statements was only exceeded by the statements from the shadow Treasurer. The shadow Treasurer, when he was asked about this 'big new tax', said it was a windfall gain for business. A big new tax becomes a windfall gain for business. We all know that Senator Joyce has also been out there putting his points of view, inventing new definitions of debt - 'net gross public private debt'. So what we have here is the 'Three Stooges' of the opposition frontbench. They have no credibility - no credibility with the business community and no credibility with the wider community - because they came into this House when this country was in its hour of need and they opposed the stimulus that saved our country. They opposed the stimulus that has created 180,000 jobs and now they propose to put a big tax on business which will push up prices for pensioners and families. The whole community will suffer. What they have demonstrated over the past few weeks is just how reckless and erratic they are and how incapable they are of managing the economy of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In response to his question and to various newspaper reports today, I say to the honourable member that Christmas Island is currently not at capacity. Furthermore, I would say to the honourable member, as the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has said on multiple occasions -  - Further to my answer to the honourable member's question: as the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has said multiple times in the parliament and outside the parliament, the government has for a long period indicated that, if further capacity is needed at various other locations within the country, of course we would have recourse to that. I would draw the honourable member's attention to my earlier answer, in which I pointed out that, on previous occasions during the time of the 'Pacific solution', the government at that stage brought various asylum seekers to processing centres within Australia.I say to the honourable member therefore: I know consistency is not the first virtue of the opposition on any matter of policy. I know it is not the first virtue of the opposition when it comes to asylum seekers policy. I know it is not the first virtue of the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to any policy, but I say this to the honourable member who asked the question: the government, through the immigration minister, has been absolutely consistent about the measures which any proper government would put in place against future contingencies. I say again to the honourable member, as I did at the outset of my answer, that Christmas Island at present is not at capacity.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - The government is committed to ensuring that payments made by Medicare Australia to medical practitioners for services rendered to Australians are legitimate, accurate and timely. Yesterday I reported to the House that the government is committed to improving the powers of Medicare to ensure illegitimate payments can be recouped and returned to the government. However, findings from investigations by Medicare raised significant compliance concerns in relation to one of the schemes under Medicare's responsibility, a scheme implemented by the former government - that is, the chronic disease dental scheme. This potential noncompliance has been identified through the investigation of claiming data, information supplied to the Medicare fraud tip-off line and complaints by state law enforcement agencies.In November 2008 Medicare commenced a two-phase investigation to determine the level of compliance with the scheme, analysing the claims of 28 dental providers. This first phase found that approximately $17 million in payments had been made to just 26 practitioners. An initial analysis suggests that none of these 26 practitioners fully met the requirements of the scheme and 12 had lodged claims for benefits prior to completing the services for which they were claiming, which is in breach of the guidelines of the scheme. I am advised that, following these disturbing initial results, the concerns around the level of possible noncompliance led Medicare to conduct a further survey of dental practitioners from the general population, and this found that up to 50 per cent of dental practitioners surveyed may have failed to comply with the requirements of the scheme.I am not suggesting for one second that all or even the majority of these dentists have been doing the wrong thing. Many would have been trying to comply with the scheme and making honest mistakes. But the fact is that this is a poorly designed scheme with significant potential for rorting. When the former minister for health, the member for Warringah, announced the chronic disease dental scheme, it was projected to cost $377 million over four years. But it is costing close to that each year, and the total cost has been more than $800 million over the last two years alone. These figures starkly underline why this badly designed program needs to be scrapped and replaced with the Commonwealth dental scheme. This government wants to close down the former government's scheme and implement our election commitment to promote the Commonwealth dental health scheme, which would be a means tested scheme that would provide up to a million dental services to pensioners and concession card holders. This has been twice blocked in the Senate.The bill for the opposition's financial irresponsibility in health and their recklessness now stands at more than $2 billion and, because of their recklessness in opposing the government's move to close down this scheme, this rises every day. This is one of the many legacies from the member for Warringah's time as minister for health. I can just imagine the Liberal ads at the next election. They might go something like this: 'This man is Tony Abbott. He can't show you his face on television. It is not because he's a dentist; it's because he's so embarrassed about his record as health minister of Australia.' We know he is embarrassed about his record because he comes out and he says, incorrectly, that the billion dollars cut from the health system in 1996 was before his time. He claims, falsely, that it was not him - 'Wasn't me, Gov; my hands are clean' - when we know that is not the case.It is not too late for the Leader of the Opposition to atone for some of his mistakes. It is too late to atone for ripping out $1 billion from Australia's health system and then falsely claiming it was not him. It is too late to atone for freezing the GP places in Australia. But it is not too late to atone for his mistakes in the dental health scheme. It is not too late to atone, because he can atone by admitting he was wrong and instructing his senators to pass the government's bill. It is time for the Leader of the Opposition to man up and say, 'I got it wrong.' And it is time for him to instruct his senators to get out of the way and let the government clean up his mess.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable member will be aware of the fact that when it comes to foil insulation the government has undertaken responsibility for conducting inspections for all foil insulations which have occurred. Secondly, the government has also undertaken responsibility to deal with any of the practical problems which arise with the restoration of the houses concerned, particularly when it comes to anything which has arisen as a direct consequence of the government's program. Can I say to the honourable member, given that I am not familiar with the details of the case, that he should raise it directly with the minister who is responsible, the Minister for Climate Change, Energy Efficiency and Water, and we will seek to deal with the individual concerned to make sure there is a satisfactory resolution to her concerns.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. For those opposite, who have shown no interest in health reform to date, I am not surprised that you could not understand the question. You ignored every warning that there was about the need to reform our health system. You ignored every warning that there was about the need for GPs. You refused to listen to nurses wanting more responsibility, and you have become the opposition's absolute -  - Quite right, Mr Speaker. I understand your record in health is impeccable. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition's record on health is not impeccable - and that goes to the question that has been asked: what response has there been to our reform announcement, what obstacles are the way and how is this different to the approach that the Leader of the Opposition took when he was a minister? We can go through these one after the other. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition himself is on the record, at times when he was feeling like being a little more frank with the public, admitting that the health system was a dog's breakfast and that sooner or later someone would need to fix it. Of course, it is sooner now rather than later - in contrast to when he was the health minister - because we believe it is time to fix the system.The Leader of the Opposition is on the record as acknowledging that his government's decision to restrict the number of young Australians who could go into our medical schools in universities across the country was, with hindsight, 'a mistake'. He is on the record as acknowledging that there are workforce shortages. But somehow now, miraculously, when he is the Leader of the Opposition, he wants to pretend that his record as the health minister was perfect. In fact, he ripped a billion dollars out of our public health system, but he wants to deny that. He had a cap on GP places, but he wants to deny that as well. In fact, he has become not just the opposition's chief climate change denier but also the opposition's chief denier about his record in health. Well, those of us on this side of the House know that our public hospitals have been in need.It is probably appropriate that Ralph Willis, the chair of one of the health service boards in Victoria covering my electorate, was acknowledged earlier. A number of other members here would know the struggle that public hospitals had when that money was pulled out of the system - a billion dollars less than even their own government thought they were going to spend only six months before that. That is how it is a budget cut, and he cannot deny that that happened and that it has consequences. Members opposite have written letters to me in the last two years - and there are very many of you - pleading for the district workforce shortage rules to apply to them and pleading for access to more GPs. I can see the member for Bowman nodding his head, because he knows that he has done it. I can see the member for Gippsland nodding his head because he has done it. I can also see the member for Gilmore. You can all put up your hands if you like because there are plenty of you. Those members opposite need to ask this question of their leader: why, after having failed to acknowledge 31 warnings and having put a cap on GP training places, is he now going to stand in the way of us finally fixing the problem? Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, cannot afford to keep denying his record. It will catch up with him eventually, and the public will see him for what he is - standing in the way of much needed reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Could I say to the honourable member in response to his question that he should look carefully at what the Minister for Energy Efficiency has said recently about the question and the challenge of fraud both in relation to this program and others. I say to the honourable member that if he has particular information relevant to any allegation of fraud concerning this program, he has a responsibility to make that information available directly to the minister so that appropriate action can be taken by the relevant law enforcement authorities. I would say the same to all other members of this place because, when it comes to any fraudulent treatment of taxpayer money, we want to make sure that the law enforcement agencies have all that information available to them so that appropriate action can be taken.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for his question, in particular on behalf of the 5,000 disability support pensioners and around 1,000 people on the carer payment in his electorate. As he knows, the government certainly does support people with a disability and carers. In the pension increases which were announced in last year's budget, we delivered a pension rise to around 700,000 people on the disability support pension and around 150,000 carers on the carer payment. All of them received an increase of just over $70 a fortnight for singles on the maximum rate. From this Saturday these pensioners will also receive another increase as a result of indexation. If you add together the budget rise and this coming indexation rise, pensioners who are disability support pensioners and those on the carer payment will receive an increase of around $100 compared to August last year. That has been an important increase for both carers and people on the disability support pension. Carers will also receive the new $600 annual carer supplement.These are some of the most vulnerable people in our community, and these are the people who will end up paying the Leader of the Opposition's great big new tax. It is these pensioners who will pay more for a loaf of bread or a litre of milk. We have to go no further than the shadow finance spokesperson, Barnaby Joyce, who very helpfully today confirmed on ABC radio that, as the Treasurer has previously indicated, it will be the case that the Leader of the Opposition's great big new tax will lead to an increase in the price of milk and the price of bread that pensioners have to pay. Well, Barnaby seems to understand. It only seems to be the Leader of the Opposition that has no idea that pensioners - disability support pensioners, aged pensioners and those on the carer payment - are going to end up paying for his great big new tax.We saw another piece of evidence last night on Four Corners of just how out of touch this Leader of the Opposition is. He point-blank refused to repudiate previous comments that he had made on women's inferiority. This is what he said:_ it would be folly to expect that women will ever _ approach equal representation in a large number of areas simply because their aptitudes, abilities and interests are different for physiological reasons.It is absolutely mind-boggling that this Leader of the Opposition is still living in the Dark Ages. Looking at some of the women members opposite, I see that I am not alone in this view. This Leader of the Opposition spends more time on thinking about how he is going to get his shirt off than on serious policy work. - This is yet further evidence that this Leader of the Opposition cannot be trusted on paid parental leave.</DOC>

 - Of course, the source of that anonymous quote is an article in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning, recording the views of the Australian Education Union, the same Australian Education Union opposed to My School and so many of the government's reforms. There is an interesting cabal developing over on that side, isn't there? I presume we will see some more of that. On that anonymous quote, if the member has a scintilla of evidence to support it, please send it around to me, and then we will investigate it through my department. Should that investigation raise anything, we will forward it to the New South Wales government's audit committee.On the question of auditing in New South Wales, assuming the member is interested in something more than she has read in the newspaper this morning, the New South Wales audit squad are conducting spot audits of BER projects covering every region, every project type and every managing contractor. To date they have audited 102 schools. Seventy-nine of those are individual site audits where the audit squad have attended the building site to investigate the delivery of the project on site. Twenty-five of those audits are of managing contractors either at their head office or at their regional delivery office. There are 36 site audits planned for next week alone. Projects will be assessed on time, cost and quality. The audit squad are being funded in a way that does not cost schools any money. No money due to go to schools is being used to fund the audit squad.The New South Wales audit squad of course is an additional audit method on top of the New South Wales Department of Education and Training's audit directorate; the Nation Building and Jobs Plan Taskforce probity auditor, Deloitte; and the New South Wales Audit Office. And, should the member have any evidence that she wishes to raise, she might want to forward it through to ICAC. The federal government may request the audit squad conduct investigations of individual project anomalies brought to my attention, and I am very happy to do that. Should the member have anything other than the clip out of the Sydney Morning Herald, which records an unsourced quote in the context of an article placed by the Australian Education Union, she should feel free to send it round.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Of course, she does understand the fundamental importance of growth in international trade not only for growth in this economy but for jobs and living standards. - I will elaborate. One in five jobs in Australia is dependent upon international trade: 1.4 million jobs are related to exports and 1.1 million to imports. So international trade is terribly important for job opportunities in this country. Our efforts to further liberalise trade opportunities are important to that jobs growth, but they are also important to living standards. A report that I issued last year by the Centre for International Economics showed that average households are now up to $3,900 per year better off as a result of the trade liberalisation efforts over the past two decades.I am then asked: what are we doing to advance this agenda? On 1 January this year the coming into effect of the Australia-New Zealand free trade agreement with ASEAN was a terribly important milestone. This is a trade agreement covering 600 million people. Collectively, two-way trade in this region is already bigger than our two-way trade with China, our largest individual trading partner. With trade liberalisation in respect of all of those 10 markets, there are important opportunities going forward. Last week we commenced the 14th round of trade negotiations with China, and they made important progress. This week we commenced the fourth round of trade negotiations with Korea, and they too are making important progress.The Trans-Pacific Partnership, which the member alludes to, also commenced its negotiations this week here in Canberra. Trans-Pacific Partnership is designed to be a high quality, comprehensive trade agreement - a trade agreement covering goods, services and investment. Done properly, this can be a bridge to a broader transpacific agreement covering the whole of the countries across the Pacific. For those in this Trans-Pacific Partnership so far, 470 million people are represented and a combined GDP of A$18 trillion. What is significant about this agreement is the fact that the US has given important buy-in to this opportunity. President Obama has indicated that the US is strongly behind advancing this high quality, comprehensive transpacific partnership. Given the importance of that economy, in terms of the overall economic growth going into the future, that is an important buy-in. The final point I make in terms of the overall advancement of the job opportunities, is the conclusion that we seek of the Doha Round. We welcome also recent statements by the President of the United States to redouble the efforts of export growth in that country and to find a balanced conclusion to the Doha Round. Doha is the economic stimulus the global recovery needs. It is a stimulus that does not have an impact on the budget. The fact that the US is strongly in partnership with us in this conclusion and is together with us on the TPP, the prospects of going forward are very strong indeed.</DOC>

 - If you live long enough, you hear absolutely everything, don't you? Now we have confirmed on the record in this parliament today the Liberal Party and the Australian Education Union in a cabal on education policy. Now I have heard everything. It would actually strike me as more strange if this cabal had not first come about regarding the My School website, where Australian parents in their millions - literally - got onto the My School website. Parents and the community were enthusiastic about getting this information. We on this side of the House, the government, are standing shoulder to shoulder with parents who want this information and, of course, facing -  -  - I take the fact that I am chastised by the member for O'Connor, so I will immediately begin blaggarding people in this House. The point goes to the education policy that is being advanced by the opposition, who are opposed to My School in a cabal with the Australian Education Union, the Greens and the Shooters Party to suppress this information in New South Wales. They are being invited by the New South Wales minister for education to lift the restrictions on the publication of this information in New South Wales. But there they are in their little cabal, with the AEU, the Liberal Party, the Shooters Party and the Greens -  - I know I said the word 'union' and that has got Mr Work Choices going -  -  - On the question, can I say to the shadow minister that if he has any evidence that he believes should be investigated then we will investigate it. If he has a clip from the Sydney Morning Herald recording allegations from the Australian Education Union - which he knows nothing about and which he has not checked in any way, shape or form - we will investigate it. All he has done this morning is roll out bed and read the newspaper, and thought that that was enough for a question. The Australian people and his colleagues on the backbench, who are looking a bit cross-eyed at this point, will judge him on the weakness of that performance.Meanwhile, we will get on with the job of delivering an education revolution to this country, including all of the things the opposition have opposed: the Building the Education Revolution; the national curriculum they want to rip up; the My School website, which has been described as a white elephant; our new money to disadvantaged schools - they have never used the word 'disadvantaged'; our new money for teacher quality - they have never done anything about teacher quality; our new reforms, meaning that we pay the best teachers more to go to the disadvantaged classrooms that need them the most; our new reforms to bring the highest performing graduates into the teaching service; and new reforms to spread literacy and numeracy. - And they describe that work as 'blah, blah, blah'. Well, these are reforms that matter to the Australian community, Australian kids and the future of this nation. With going, 'blah, blah, blah,' you have just shown the Australian people the contempt in which you hold them - parents, children, teachers and principals in this country. You could not show more how unfit you are for office if you tried.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question and acknowledge her longstanding interest in Burma and her longstanding efforts to see Burma fully embrace democracy. The member asked about any progress on Burma's so-called road map to democracy since my statement to the House last month. Members would of course recall that part of this process included the referendum in Burma, which regrettably was conducted in the context of the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis. As a consequence of that, I have previously described that referendum process as a sham.In my statement last month, I said to the House that, whilst we had reservations about the Burmese authorities fully embracing a genuine return to democracy, we would not come to a concluded view so far as the election processes and outcome were concerned in advance of that taking place. That of course was motivated by the international community sentiment that we had to do everything we could not just by way of sanctions, for example, but also by way of encouragement to see if the authorities in Burma would embrace a genuine process.Last week the Burmese authorities published five electoral laws which will govern the conduct of the election. Whilst in some respects it is not surprising, I very much regret to advise the House that, on the basis of the publication of these electoral laws, I have very grave reservations as to whether it is possible for an election to be conducted appropriately in Burma with the full, free and fair participation of all those concerned.The election laws - five of them - place what seem to be very severe restrictions on political parties. In particular, by implication they place restrictions on the National League for Democracy participating in the election process, particularly if Aung San Suu Kyi continues to be a member of the National League for Democracy. There is, in addition, no guarantee of access to media for the conduct of the election.Bearing in mind these matters, as I say, we are now very gravely concerned as to any potential for an election to be conducted in a full, free and fair manner. In the first instance, of course, it will be a matter for the political parties, in particular the National League for Democracy, to make a judgment about whether to participate in the election under those circumstances. Under the published laws, it is a matter for the NLD to make a judgment by 6 May. I am not proposing to give gratuitous public advice to the NLD. That is a matter for them to determine. It will be a very difficult decision for them to judge whether they should participate in such an election under very restrictive circumstances or whether to decline to take that opportunity.I very much regret this development. We had in some respects hoped very much that the authorities were more completely embracing a genuine return to democracy. This is a disappointment, and we await the decision of the NLD in early May.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition very much for that question. I suppose I begin by saying: what has happened to the great Liberal Party of Australia where it now invokes, as its total authority, either the New South Wales Teachers Federation, the Australian Education Union or - as I think we had last week - Unions New South Wales? One by one, those opposite invoke unionists, who now they regard as their friends, when they spent their period in office trying to abolish the entire Australian trade union movement as a matter of law. But I thank Comrade Tony for his question, because it goes -  - to the New South Wales Teachers Federation and their credibility as a source of advice. I would note also that the New South Wales Teachers Federation, together with the Liberal Party of New South Wales, stand in the face of the reform of the Australian education system, with their total opposition to the publication of school based performance, through their actions in the New South Wales parliament.Yet today what we have is the federal Liberal Party linking themselves with the Liberal Party in New South Wales, with the Greens, with the New South Wales Teachers Federation - and let's never forget the Shooters Party - in order to stand in the way of fundamental reform to education in Australia. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, if he has real evidence of fraud in the system, what he should do is refer -  -  - The My School website if you want it correctly. Let me add to that -  - I think that what it tells the House is that the member for O'Connor is finally really losing it altogether. - Of course I withdraw, Mr Speaker. In response to the honourable member's interjection about those computer -  - Further to the interjection by the member for O'Connor on those computer 'thingies', we are currently putting in about 220,000 of those computer thingies in schools. We are pretty proud of those computer thingies because we think those thingies will help the students of tomorrow. That might be regarded as a modernist remark, but I think the rest of the world would understand what we mean.In response to the Leader of the Opposition and his question, should he have any further evidence of fraud in relation to any government program, his responsibility, like that of any other member of this place, is to provide that information either directly to the relevant police authority or, if he chooses not to, to the office of the relevant minister. I would suggest that he do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Chifley for his question because we have had today not a single question from those opposite on health and hospital reform - not a single question. We stand here as a government that, within its two years in office, have delivered a 50 per cent increase in funding to public hospitals and of that the government is proud. What the government have done in our two years in office is to increase our overall training for GPs by a 35 per cent increase in GP training places. The government are proud of the fact that we have increased the number of training places for nurses. We have invested some $3 billion in the capital needs of our system and more than $1 billion in the overall cancer related infrastructure that we need right across Australia both in our larger cities and in our regional centres. That is what we have done in two years in office.I say to those opposite, in particular the Leader of the Opposition, who did act as health minister for four to five years, he has been very touchy indeed today on his $1 billion gouge from the system. I think what we have had from the Leader of the Opposition is someone who has been somewhat loose with the truth on this question. What did the Leader of the Opposition actually say when first confronted with this? On 10 February when asked this question on radio, Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, said, 'I did not rip a billion dollars out of health, the rate of growth was slowed somewhat.' That was the excuse back then. Then we go to excuse No. 2 on the billion-dollar gouge from the system. In a penetrating and provocative interview, very searching in its questions from Alan Jones, on 2GB the Leader of the Opposition when asked this question about his billion-dollar gouge from the system -  - What did the Leader of the Opposition have to say? He said as follows, 'I did not rip a billion dollars out of health.' He went on to say, 'What happened was that in 1996, long before I was health minister, the forward estimates were reduced by $1 billion.' But that is not true. Let us go back again to the budget papers referred to earlier today by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. What do the 1996-97 budget papers actually show was the reduction in health expenditure then? The 1996-97 budget papers show a reduction of $312 billion. That was a misleading statement by the Leader of the Opposition on the radio program as he sought simply to slough it off and say, 'Not my responsibility, it was those bad people back in 1996.' Peter Costello was Treasurer at the time and later made some reflections about the overall level of economic competence of the current Leader of the Opposition which were that, in fact, he had none at all.We then move on to excuse No. 3, and that is the Leader of the Opposition out there, day after day, saying he had nothing whatsoever to do with the billion-dollar gouge out of the system. But once again facts confront us. - He says, 'Wrong, wrong, wrong' again. Why could you dispute the accuracy of the Howard government's budget papers 2003-04 - not a production of the Australian Labor Party in opposition, not the production of the tooth fairy but the production of the Howard government itself. It says in 2003-04 that the health budget had $108.9 million taken out of it. That was Tony Abbott's first year as health minister. In 2004-05 $172 million was taken out of it. That was Tony Abbott's second year as health minister. - In 2005-06 there was $264 million. That was his third year as health minister. In 2006-07 there was $372 million. That was his fourth year as health minister. But, as the Minister for Finance and Deregulation informed the House, the parliament and the country today, if you went to the Department of Health and Ageing and sought clarification about what was in the forward estimates for 2007-08, it was another $497 million taken out. This adds up to a figure in excess of $1 billion; we have been generous in what we have said about the gouge out of the system by the Leader of the Opposition.On each one of these things what we have had is a Leader of the Opposition caught out in absolute embarrassment, not telling the truth to the parliament about these matters. But on the overall reform of the system - the overall gouge and its impact on the health and hospital system of Australia - what was the ultimate excuse of the Leader of the Opposition today, not 1996, not any of that but this one - the pearler of them all? Yes, it was, 'We were about to start tackling the public hospital system when we lost office.' Is it any wonder no-one has any confidence in anything this Leader of the Opposition has to say about health and hospitals reform? He has not told the truth about his billion-dollar gouge, he has no plan for the future and he only said he was going to act five minutes before the last election.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Concerning the causes of specific fires to which the honourable member refers, it is important that individual investigations are left to be concluded. Furthermore, I say in relation to the honourable member's question that I am advised that the current rate of fire concerning insulation in houses is about one in 10,000 homes. I would also say to the honourable member in response to his question that, prior to this program commencing, there were some 80 to 85 fires which arose from 60,000 to 70,000 homes being retrofitted with insulation in the previous year.The honourable member goes to the question of the inspections regime. I draw his attention to the fact that, when it comes to all houses which have been installed with foil insulation, all of those homes will be inspected. I will also draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that the government will undertake all inspections that are necessary -  - In terms of non-foil insulation, I advise the honourable member that the government thus far has committed to 150,000 inspections. I say in response to the honourable member's question that, based on inspections to date, 92 per cent of those that have been concluded have had no safety issue related to them. I would also say to the honourable member what we said at the beginning of this matter - namely, that the government will undertake all home inspections that are necessary. We say to members of the public who are concerned about these matters: contact the government through the appropriate numbers, which have been indicated in earlier statements by the minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Braddon for his question, because, having visited his electorate on a number of occasions, I know that one of the top priorities in that part of Tasmania is the proper delivery of health and hospital services to his community. What I find right across the country is that people are crying out for national leadership to improve the health and hospital services of the nation, so that working families can have confidence in the level of services delivered by their local health professionals.That is why the government has put forward its plan for a National Health and Hospitals Network, one which is funded nationally, one which is run locally and, for the first time, one where the Australian government takes on the dominant funding responsibility for the public hospital system of Australia; the dominant funding responsibility for its recurrent costs; the dominant funding responsibility for its capital costs - that is, the building of new hospitals; the dominant funding responsibility for equipment costs - for example, operating theatres and the most expensive of the investigatory and diagnostic machinery that you see in modern hospitals today; and also, for the first time, the dominant responsibility for the teaching and training costs associated with hospitals as well.This morning, together with the health minister, I met GPs in training and medical students at the annual conference of the General Practice Students Network. It was here in the Great Hall in Parliament House. It was a great opportunity to be able to talk for a while with those young medical graduates about their future careers, possibly as GPs, and what they are doing is benefiting from support provided by government at present. But, most critically, what they are concerned about is their futures, as well - whether there will be enough GP training places in the community. That is why a couple of days ago the government announced its new plan for a record investment in the expansion of GP and medical specialist training places right across Australia. We are investing in 6,000 additional training places for doctors - for GPs and specialists - right across Australia. We need to act in this area, since we have been advised that, with the shortage of doctors in the decade ahead, simply to maintain things as they are would require an additional 3,000 GPs, but if we are to improve the level of services then we have to do much better than that. That is why within the program I have just referred to we are investing in support of 5½ thousand new GP training places. This will cost the government some $632 million, but we believe that this is an important program to get on with. -  - I notice that some of those opposite are interjecting already about the fact that this is a program for the future, as if for two years the government has been inactive on this matter. I would say to the honourable members interjecting that, over the course of the last two years, the government has already increased GP training places by 35 per cent. That is in our first two years in office. In our first two years in office we have increased the overall Australian government investment in the public hospital system by 50 per cent. That is some $64 billion. For the first time the Australian government is out there investing in the nation's cancer related infrastructure, a $1 billion-plus investment, not just in the big cities but in integrated cancer care centres right across the nation as well. Those opposite interject with 'What have you been doing for two years?' I say: a lot more than the previous government ever did in 12 years.When it comes to the future, we believe that properly funding a National Health and Hospitals Network is the right course of action for Australia. We need to ensure that we have a system which is properly funded nationally and that is properly run locally through local hospital networks, that we have sufficient hospital beds, that we have sufficient doctors and that we have sufficient nurses. You cannot do that if you simply stand to one side and say, 'We just hope it gets fixed up in the morning,' or 'We're gunna do something about it,' on the eve of the next election, which is what a certain 'gunna'-represented officer said he would do on the eve of the last election, having been health minister for four or five years.I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to the parliament at large: the government has put forward a plan, a National Health and Hospitals Network for the future, funded nationally, run locally and building on the record investments we have already undertaken in health and hospitals in our first two years in office. That stands in stark contrast to someone who, as health minister of Australia, reached in and gouged $1 billion out of the public hospital system of Australia. They can run - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I would say in response to the honourable member's question that the government stands by its commitment to undertake as many inspections as are necessary. We have indicated already that, when it comes to foil insulation in people's ceilings, those will all be inspected in relation to non-foil insulation. We have indicated already that 150,000 will be inspected.The honourable member also referred to matters of insurance. I draw her attention also to the fact that, under the Home Insulation Program, all insulation installers were required to have insurance that covered property damage, including damage from fires. As a requirement to be registered under the HIP, companies needed to maintain for the entire period they remained on the register property damage insurance with a limited liability for occurrence or event of not less than $10 million. The government accepts responsibility for difficulties and problems which have arisen in the implementation of this program, and we stand ready to take further action as is necessary.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The House will be aware of the Leader of the Opposition's vehement rejection of the government's assertion that he presided over a $1 billion cut to public hospital spending while he was minister for health. I would remind the House of evidence I put to the House yesterday - in fact, the Howard government's 2003 budget papers - which showed progressive cuts to the projected spending on public hospitals of $109 million, $172 million, $265 million and $373 million and, of course, further advice from the department of health that the final year of the agreement saw a cut of $497 million, all of which was presided over by the then minister for health, now Leader of the Opposition.I reminded the House yesterday that in the 2003-04 budget papers of the Howard government it was explicitly stated that the reason these cuts were being made was the expected lower patronage of public hospitals because of a shift to private hospitals that would be driven by the private health insurance rebate that the then government was putting in place. All this is in black and white in very clear English on page 179 of Budget Paper No. 2 of 2003-04.The vehement rejection of this by the Leader of the Opposition, amplified today by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in her point of order on the Prime Minister's answer a minute ago, raises a very interesting question - that is, when is a cut not a cut? We had cuts to the budget by the Howard government that the then minister for health, who was the person responsible for implementing those cuts, is saying were not actually cuts. It caused me to wonder how the opposition deal with equivalent issues of this kind when they are criticising cuts being made by the government rather than defending what they say were not cuts by their government. This is reasonably significant because the 2003 budget was in fact the last Howard government budget in which there were any significant savings. It is almost seven years since the last Liberal finance minister or shadow finance minister proposed any serious savings.In the 2008 budget there were substantial savings and in the 2009 budget there were substantial savings. We were criticised for making those savings and, indeed, the opposition has endeavoured to block some of those savings - for example, the cuts to the private health insurance rebate for higher income earners. I came across one interesting example of how the opposition handles these matters when the roles are reversed. It is a National Party press release of 13 May 2008 alleging that country Australia would take a $1 billion hit in Labor's budget. It says:_Labor has stripped more than $1 billion from regional and rural Australia.The primary piece of evidence for this is the cancellation of the OPEL contract for wireless broadband - a $960 million contract that the former government entered into - and one of the key reasons this was cancelled was the Rudd government putting in place a much more comprehensive broadband strategy for all Australians. -  - Not only is he warned but also he should remember that he does not work for Optus anymore. The interesting thing is that, according to the opposition, when they remove $1 billion from forward-spending projections that is 'an adjustment to the forward estimates' but when we remove $1 billion from projected forward spending that is stripping $1 billion away, that is vandalism. The Leader of the Opposition, in pointing out the facts to the Australian people that he presided over the stripping away of more than $1 billion from funding for public hospitals, alleges that the government is telling lies. Unfortunately, we have his own government's budget papers, his own opposition's approach to equivalent issues when the boot is on the other foot and, more than anything else, the ordinary meaning of the English language. Those all count against him. I would suggest that there is one party to this dispute that is not telling the truth, but it is not the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for this question because she is aware that in Tasmania getting the right mix of doctors and nurses and skilled workforce is very important, so I know that she wants to have the answer to this question. The Prime Minister has mentioned already in question time today the $632 million package to train a record number of doctors and to grow a strong health workforce. Our plan, as he noted, is going to deliver more than 6,000 new doctors over the decade. Importantly - and I think all members of the House will be interested to know this - those new doctors will deliver around five million extra services to families across the country by 2013. That is five million extra services for families, particularly those with young children, and elderly Australians who rely very much on our GP services and would not necessarily be able to access those services without this investment being made by the government. This is going to relieve pressure on existing GPs and also relieve pressure on busy hospital emergency departments.Yesterday was also a historic day for our nurses. Another critical part of our health workforce strategy has now fallen into place. The Senate finally passed legislation to boost the role of nurses and midwives and improve patient access to health care. We are working hard to build this sustainable health workforce into the future after a decade of neglect by the previous government and particularly the erratic then Minister for Health and Ageing. The Australian people clearly want to see this sort of change. A poll released today found that 76 per cent of voters agree with the Rudd government's reforms to the health system to fund nationally and run locally.The community, of course, clearly does not share the view of the Leader of the Opposition, who said yesterday that the health system was working pretty well back when he was the health minister. They do not think the good old days when GP training places were capped, or when 60 per cent of Australians struggled to see a doctor, were that good. Of course, those good old days were the days when public hospitals were reeling from a billion-dollar daylight robbery by the current Leader of the Opposition.Interestingly, the member for Dickson actually does not believe that either. He told the Australian General Practice Network Conference in 2008:_ 
we made mistakes in Indigenous health, in areas like workforce planning and in hospital management.So nobody except the shoot-from-the-hip opposition leader thinks that elective surgery waiting list queues are caused by nurses going to ACTU indoctrination classes, which was his view in 2007. I might just read that little gem to the House, because I think it does reflect the anti-nurse view that is dominant from the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow health spokesperson:No wonder the elective surgery lists are blowing out so badly in New South Wales' hospitals - it is because the nurses are all at ACTU indoctrination lessons.What an offensive comment to make about our nurses.If he does not have a solution to a problem he just makes it up. Nobody, not even the member for Dickson, thinks our nurses or doctors should be treated badly. He took great offence yesterday when the message came back from the Senate that we suggested that he was anti-nurse. But then, of course, he was on the record only days ago saying that he did not think doctors and nurses should spend all their time on Facebook. This is the person who wants to be the health minister of this country going around slagging off at nurses and doctors when he should be supporting the investments that we are making in the health system. The opposition just cannot bring themselves to actually support our nurses, despite the opportunity yesterday to put their support on the record.Not all of us share the nostalgia of days gone by. The opposition leader thinks that the days of those doctor and nurse shortages or of cutting funding for hospitals were days of plenty. We just do not agree with him. But I do know that the Leader of the Opposition likes to push things to the extreme - whether it is on his bike, whether it is in the outback or whether it is the boundaries of good taste - but his claims to have a credible health record are really just pushing the limits of credibility way too far.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. His comments go to the release of the coroner's report in the Northern Territory today. They also go to various contents of the report and actions which he argues arise from it.First of all, I go to the content of the report. Firstly, I am advised that the coroner's finding is that crimes may have been committed in connection with the explosion. The coroner proposes to refer these findings to the NT Commissioner of Police and the NT Director of Public Prosecutions. The coroner noted that he only has to have a belief about a crime being committed and that the question of whether or not there is sufficient basis for further investigation and prosecution is a matter for them. Therefore, I would say in response to the honourable member that it is important to proceed cautiously in public comments on a matter which has been referred to the relevant legal authorities.The second point I would make is that the Northern Territory coroner has also concluded that the explosion was caused when a passenger or passengers deliberately ignited petrol which had collected in the bilge area below the deck of SIEV 36. I also say in response to this that in relation to certain other matters canvassed by the coroner I reiterate what I said earlier in this place: we should all remember that under these difficult circumstances our ADF personnel are working under very difficult and trying circumstances. I think all members of this House would agree with that.Furthermore, I refer to another element of what the NT coroner's findings have contained. The coroner's findings have said that the action taken by Navy personnel was appropriate, and more passengers may have died but for the action they took. In terms of subsequent action, that should be considered on a case-by-case basis by the relevant minister.There may be members of the frontbench on my left that have a crusade about matters. The major point of order that can arise during an answer is the matter of relevance. In this case, I can assure you that the remarks made by the Prime Minister related to the question. So there was nothing surprising in my actions._ the Minister reasonably suspects that the person does not pass the character test _It is a test of 'reasonably suspects'. You have had a coroner say, 'They committed a crime.'Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question. I am in a position to inform the House that we are now on course to have the student income support legislation pass the parliament this week. This is good news for Australian students and for Australian families. This means that we can pay 150,000 start-up scholarships to students who are waiting for them and we can pay increased youth allowance - or youth allowance for the first time - to 100,000 students. This is good news indeed.I would like to acknowledge those people who have played a role in making sure that this beneficial legislation passes the parliament. As members of this House would recall, these changes were first heralded by the government in the May budget and, of course, there was an issue raised after the May budget on the question of transition from the old system to the new system. The issue about the question of transition was raised with me by a number of Labor members and I thank them for raising it with me. It was also raised with me by the Independents in the House of Representatives who represent rural electorates and it was raised with me in good faith by a number of members of the coalition.Then we worked here in the House of Representatives and in the Senate to address this issue of transition. Most particularly, we worked with the Australian Greens and Senator Nick Xenophon, and I thank the Australian Greens and Senator Xenophon for the mature and straightforward approach that they brought to dealing with this matter. In the legislation, what we ultimately agreed with the Greens and Senator Xenophon, the Independents here and members of the government was that there would be no retrospectivity - that is, any student who had made their arrangements before the legislation came into effect on 1 July and who had qualified for independence under the old criteria would qualify under those criteria. If anybody is in any doubt about that, I refer them to the amendments that were circulated in the Senate on 23 February when all transition matters were resolved.Where were the opposition while all this was going on? The opposition were out campaigning for a change which would have cost more than a billion dollars. They were campaigning for a change that would have meant that any student who chose to move would get full youth allowance. That means a student from a home of multimillionaires who chose to move from Melbourne to Sydney to study would have got full youth allowance. We said to the opposition very clearly that this was not fiscally responsible. They had not spent this extra billion dollars on student income support when they were in government and it offended against the principle of equity - that is, lower income Australians should not have to pay for full youth allowance for multimillionaires who choose to move from Melbourne to Sydney.It was not until last Tuesday, after months of hounding the opposition for an amendment that would pass the test of being fiscally responsible and equitable, that the opposition, for the first time ever, settled down to talk about something meaningful. I am glad that, following those two discussions with the shadow minister, we did agree on something meaningful. The billion-dollar amendment was gone. This inequitable costly proposition about anybody who moved was gone. What the opposition agreed on with us is that for 1,900 students who live in very remote Australia, remote Australia or outer regional Australia under the Australian Standard Geographical Classification, if they come from families with incomes of less than $150,000, they would continue to be able to qualify under the old independence criteria. This is an amendment costing less than $100 million compared with the more than billion-dollar claim that the opposition started with.Today we are putting the legislation with this amendment in place. We agreed this with the opposition and it went through their joint party room, but obviously there are those in the opposition who are now greatly embarrassed that, after months of campaigning in their communities, they are making no difference whatsoever from the agreement that we had struck with the Greens and Senator Xenophon. I am talking about, for example, the member for Murray in the area of Shepparton, where there is no change arising from the opposition's amendments. There is Goulburn and the member for Hume, where there is no change arising from the opposition's amendments. There is Gympie in the electorate of Wide Bay, represented by the National Party, for example, and Cowra in the electorate of the member for Calare; there is not one single change in those communities as a result of the amendments moved by the opposition. There is not one thing that they could not have had as a result of the agreement that we entered into with the Greens and Senator Nick Xenophon.So, in order to cover this political embarrassment despite having entered an agreement with us yesterday, what the opposition does today is move an amendment in the Senate to cover these places. And at the very time it is being moved the shadow minister says to me and the Liberal Party in the Senate says to Senator Carr, 'If this happens to pass, we will not insist on it' - that is, 'It was all politics; all theatre'. Delay all these many months, costing students? This amendment? All politics; all theatre. This could just be a dispute between politicians who are all about argy-bargy in the eyes of the community - except for this. There are students in Shepparton and there are students in places around the country like Gympie who have had opposition members say to them that they believe that they should get full youth allowance if they need to move.As an opposition, they might say they cannot achieve that from opposition, and that would be an honourable position. What is not honourable is to go and raise those expectations and then, in terms of your own political party's promises, not promise to do that if you are elected as a government but promise to have a review. After all these months of campaigning, what the member for Murray, the member for Hume, the member for Wide Bay and the member for Calare have actually secured for their communities is a review if the opposition is elected. This is a cautionary and salutary tale for the Australian people about the nature of the opposition led by the current Leader of the Opposition, because what this salutary tale is telling you is that the Leader of the Opposition, if he sees a little bit of political advantage, will go and stand shoulder to shoulder with you, will expectation-raise, will campaign with you and then, when the politics shift and it suits him, will walk right away from you. He has walked away from a billion dollars in student income support. He has walked away from every promise given to every student in places like Shepparton and places like Gympie. This is the most disgraceful act - this from a man who says that he is full of straight talk. It is not straight talk to go around promising a billion dollars and then not deliver it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question, because it is very important that government, business and the community work together - work together to make sure that stimulus produces jobs and work together to make sure that our recovery is successful and continues to support employment. Today I met with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It is a group that is not usually associated with the Labor Party. It is strongly independent, but it is strongly supportive of stimulus - not just the stimulus that is in the system now but the future pipeline of activity that is so important to future confidence and the confidence of employers to continue to employ. So, generally, most of the major employer organisations in our community are supportive of stimulus, and they are supportive of the pipeline of activity that is in place now. The only group in the community that is not supportive of that is, of course, the Liberal and National parties in this House and in the Senate. But it is important, because confidence and leadership are required if we are going to maximise the possibilities that arise from the economic recovery.As we frame policies to go forward, there are two ways of going about it. We can do it in a considered and collective way or we can do it in a reckless, erratic way, which is the way in which the opposition is now going about framing public policy. We have a Leader of the Opposition who asks for forgiveness after he makes a decision rather than seeking permission before he makes a decision. Of course, nothing is more destructive of confidence, particularly when it comes to investment, than that sort of approach. We have a shadow Treasurer over there who says this 'big new tax' is, in reality, a windfall gain. We have the finance minister who described this big new tax as a 'small rise'. Those opposite really do live in an alternative economic universe. This is what the Productivity Commission had to say about paid parental leave: 'the actual burden of the levy will eventually fall on employees' and will possibly make 'some firms unviable'.That is what the Productivity Commission said. Here is what the other PC - Peter Costello - said about their big new tax. He said it 'should have set alarm bells ringing' - ringing in the ears of the Leader of the Opposition and the worst opposition frontbench team that we have seen in the history of this parliament. He went on to say:_ that alarm should have sounded like an air raid siren _That former Treasurer - the longest-serving Treasurer in the history of this country - has seen that they have so destroyed the economic credibility of the Liberal Party that he is prepared to bag them in public.But the Leader of the Opposition has done something that nobody else has succeeded in doing. The Leader of the Opposition is a miracle worker. He has united Peter Costello and Paul Keating. Nobody has ever succeeded in doing that before. They both think this is the dumbest idea they have ever seen. It is no mean feat for the Leader of the Opposition to have done that. Is it any wonder the business community is so terrified about the prospect of a Liberal Party coming to government? Those opposite have absolutely no idea about what is required to support investment and jobs in the Australian community. The business community is terrified about the lack of certainty and so too are the two longest-serving treasurers in our history.</DOC>

Concerning those who have already made applications under the program, the minister is now attending to how each of those applications is properly dealt with.

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question because she certainly knows that giving mums and dads more support when they have a new baby in their home is going to be very good for their children and will give them a much better start in life. That is why this government is delivering Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme. It is our scheme that is going to be both fair for families and fair for business. It also lets families make their own work and family choices. One of the characteristics of our scheme is that parents are going to be able to transfer or share their leave so that mums and dads have more options about how they organise their work and family responsibilities.It is the case that families in Australia have been waiting decades for paid parental leave - 12 years. We know that those opposite refused to introduce paid parental leave, and everybody here knows that it was this Leader of the Opposition who said that paid parental leave would happen 'over his dead body'. Well, we know that the Leader of the Opposition has now come up with a sham of a scheme, a sham that will not let mums and dads actually make decisions themselves about how they organise their work and family choices, because he really does not support the work and family choices that so many Australian families make. We saw in the Australian 
newspaper where he was justifying his latest views by saying that paid parental leave will mean that more women are in what he described as 'the most traditional role of all'. We know that this Leader of the Opposition is just so stuck in the past and just wants to preach to Australian families about their work and family choices.I know people on this side of the parliament will not be surprised to learn that he is not alone. Today we have an absolute gem from - you guessed it - Senator Barnaby Joyce. Barnaby Joyce was on ABC TV this morning trying to ignore Peter Costello's scathing attack on the Leader of the Opposition. This is a real original from Senator Joyce. This is what he said:Unless we can figure out another way to create babies, then we have to realise that ladies have babies and we've got to make sure that we create the environment that gives them financial protection to go through the process of having that child.Thank you very much for the biology lesson, Barnaby, but I have to say it is not all about ladies. There are certainly men involved in the process too. This might be news to the Leader of the Opposition but, in most homes today, mums and dads actually decide what is best for their baby and what is best for their family. Of course, in the bizarre, old-fashioned world that this lot live in, they are demonstrating yet again just how out of touch they are with modern Australian family life. Peter Costello got it so right today when he said:Abbott undoubtedly thought he had to say something on International Women's Day - he keeps being told he needs to appeal more to female voters. So he adopts the Crocodile Dundee approach.</DOC>

 - In terms of the process for decision making on the matters which the member has raised, I refer him to my earlier answer. In terms of the new matters that he raises concerning the original decision on visas, I am advised by the immigration minister that that decision was made independently by his department through a careful and rigorous assessment of the merits of each individual case.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. I know that she is a person of steadfast view about the need for fairness in Australian workplaces. Because we believe in fairness in Australian workplaces, we introduced the Fair Work Act and the Fair Work Ombudsman. We also provided economic stimulus to our economy so Australian people could have jobs under decent working conditions. This was opposed by the opposition. They opposed economic stimulus, they opposed jobs and, of course, they opposed our changes to get rid of Work Choices. The Leader of the Opposition is there harbouring a desire to bring back his own version of Work Choices.The Leader of the Opposition is not the only risk to Australian working families when it comes to decent working conditions. Today's Hobart Mercury 
tells us that the Tasmanian Liberals are being challenged to come clean on their hardline Work Choices policies. The Liberals in Tasmania and the Leader of the Opposition are pining for Work Choices. What we know about the Leader of the Opposition is that he flip-flops. He says one thing and then he says another thing. There is no straight talk; he just flip-flops. He said, 'The phrase Work Choices is dead.' Then, when he was speaking to a business audience and thought he could get away with it, he endorsed individual statutory agreements that can rip away pay and conditions and he endorsed ripping away from Australian workers the ability to make unfair dismissal claims.When the Leader of the Opposition was in government, he said about paid parental leave that it would happen over his 'dead body'. As Leader of the Opposition, when he thinks on International Women's Day he needs to come up with a hastily cobbled together policy announcement to try and create some appeal for Australian women, there he is announcing a paid parental leave scheme. He says one week that he does not believe tax should increase, that if he were Prime Minister he would not increase tax. Then, a few short weeks later, he announces a great big new tax on everything that his shadow finance minister has helpfully confirmed would feed into the price of bread and milk and add to the cost-of-living pressures on Australian working families.It is no wonder that this was all too much for former Treasurer Peter Costello, who knows a fair bit about the Leader of the Opposition and who concluded that he was such an economic vandal, so economically irresponsible, that he was not even competent to serve as his deputy. There are those in the Liberal Party who still say that they believe in the brand of the Liberal Party, and Peter Costello says he has never been to a Liberal Party meeting where people put the case for more tax. I say to those people in the Liberal Party in this House: how much damage are they going to let the Leader of the Opposition do to the brand of what it is to be a Liberal, as he flip-flops from one thing to another, no taxes and then a great big new tax?Should we be surprised? Of all the things that the Howard government misled Australians about during its 12 long years in office, nothing will stand out more in the public imagination than when the Leader of the Opposition, as minister for health, gave a rock-solid, ironclad guarantee before an election, only to trash his promise after the election. It is happening again. It has happened today on student income support. It just goes to show that when the Leader of the Opposition is talking it is not straight talk anybody is hearing.</DOC>

 - The process is that these matters have now been referred to the Northern Territory Police, as has been indicated by the Prime Minister. Due process indicates that the police should be able to investigate these very serious matters. As all members are aware, the honourable member who intervened was a member of the Queensland Police Service. He would understand full well that prejudicial comments with respect to someone facing very serious criminal allegations involving the death of five individuals and serious injury to others may well result in that prosecution being aborted. Indeed, he would be well aware, from cases that he was involved in, of applications being made to set aside jury trials because of prejudicial comments that have been made. In circumstances where three individuals are potentially facing criminal prosecutions as a result of the death of five individuals and the serious injury of others, it is with the greatest respect quite outrageous for politically motivated comments to be made that could potentially prejudice a criminal trial. Having said that, in answer to the question about the role of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, his decisions are obviously matters for him, but he has indicated in the briefing that I have been provided with that after the criminal process takes its course he will unquestionably examine the use of his powers under section 501.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question. The adoption of this government's legislative program is indeed important so that we can pursue our objective of Nation Building for Recovery, so that we can continue to put forward our legislative program that is about protecting jobs, so that we can continue to put forward our agenda for lifting productivity and for ensuring that development is sustainable. We currently have some 30 bills stuck in the Senate. We have a Leader of the Opposition who ripped a billion dollars out of the health system while he was Minister for Health and Ageing and who is determined to impose his extreme and out-of-touch views on the entire Australian community. There is a lot at risk as a result of the opposition leader's position. At risk is our investment in national infrastructure, with some $36 billion in my portfolio in road, rail, public transport and ports. At risk is the Community Infrastructure Program that those opposite wrote to me and campaigned for, but voted against, and have said that they would look at withdrawing were they to return to the Treasury bench. At risk is the Building the Education Revolution program, with the rolling out of computers and the largest school modernisation program in Australia's history. These are all at risk. We know that at risk is the Paid Parental Leave Scheme that has been put forward by the government. We know that those opposite, in an attempt to appear to be doing something - as Peter Costello who so effectively nailed the Leader of the Opposition this morning in the paper has indicated - on International Women's Day had this thought bubble. Even when they have an alternative plan, it is not thought through, it is not costed and it is, in the words of the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, just 'silly'. The fact is that this is an opposition leader who cannot be trusted. This is an opposition leader who would put at risk the recovery from the global financial crisis.During the Godwin Grech week I had a bit to say about the member for Wentworth. During that week I actually said that the member for Wentworth resembled the ghost of Mark Latham. I want to say to the member for Wentworth: I am sorry. It was quite clear that this was Mark Latham-like. What we have now is Tony Abbott, Mark Latham on steroids, being the bully boy standing at the doors of the Senate, happy for things to go in but making sure that no legislation comes out. The one policy that we know he will go back to is Work Choices, but he said that he will call it something else. I say good luck to him, because if he can get away with still calling it the Liberal Party I say maybe he can get away with anything.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I say to the member that if he wants this example looked at I would be very happy to have the department look at it. As I indicated to the parliament as recently as yesterday, there is a dedicated audit squad in New South Wales that is looking at cases as they are referred. Indeed, even before this parliament was sitting this week or last week, the audit squad was out checking on value for money. It has already checked 102 schools, and that process to verify value for money goes on.Can I also say to the member that, when we investigate claims made by members of the opposition in this place, we often find that people are not comparing apples to apples in terms of cost. I understand how that can happen. When a local builder is asked to quote they might quote to fit-out stage, because that is what they are used to quoting, but not give a quote that includes all of the internal fittings in the way that the Building the Education Revolution program does. So we often find that the figures given to us are not 'apples to apples' quotes. The member obviously wants this looked at. - If he stops yelling at some point and provides some information then we will ensure that the information is looked at by the department. If there are any issues arising from that look by the department, the matter will go to the New South Wales audit squad. -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for the question. The state native vegetation laws introduced more than a decade ago have for a long time provoked a good deal of concern and anger among many farmers throughout Australia. When they were introduced we were in opposition and did not complain about them. Some of those opposite - including the former Treasurer - when they were in government took credit for them. This debate received publicity in a new way over summer when one particular New South Wales farmer climbed up a pole on his property and engaged in an action of self-harm. For a long time in this place both governments and oppositions have observed the principle that when someone engages in an action of self-harm neither would gain a political dividend from it. I saw this many times as shadow minister for immigration, and I have no evidence that the current shadow minister for immigration has behaved in a different fashion. We get calls from the media saying: 'There has been an action of self-arm. This is a free kick for you. Why don't you go out and do some media.' The rule has always been that none of us in this place would engage in that way because we do not want to be the sort of country where self-harm is a way of getting political attention.There is no grey area in this. It has remained the situation that you do not say, 'I'll criticise the self-harm but I'll give them some publicity anyway,' because we know where that would lead. I do not know what level of self-obsession, erratic behaviour or twisted morality it would take for someone to view an action of self-harm as a political opportunity, but that is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition did a few weeks ago. I do not know how you can trust somebody who is willing to do that. -  - Let us remember that the rally held outside Parliament House by a number of farmers was no ordinary rally; it was directly linked to an action of self-harm. Indeed, the publicity for that rally described the place where the self-harm was being committed as 'a tower of hope'. And this was off the back of a situation in country Australia where issues of self-harm are well and truly alive, with men in country Australia at double the suicide rate of men in urban Australia. No-one from the government would have anything to do with that rally. The country Independents had nothing to do with that rally. Indeed, the National Farmers Federation -  - The National Farmers Federation, against great pressure from many of their own membership, refused to have anything to do with that rally, based on good principle. The attendance there taught us nothing about the issue but a lot about the Leader of the Opposition - erratic, self-obsessed and with twisted morality. It is a lesson which will not be forgotten.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. In answering his question, I also ask him and his relevant shadow minister to reflect carefully on the answer given by the Attorney-General to an earlier question. That is one point. Secondly, in relation to the visas to which the Leader of the Opposition -  - In relation to the matters raised just now by the Leader of the Opposition, I also draw his attention to the fact that the decision concerning those visas was also made after consultation with the NT police responsible for the investigation. I also refer the Leader of the Opposition to the following advice I have received from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship - that is, that under section 501 of the Migration Act people convicted of serious crimes who were found to have failed the character test can have their visa cancelled.The minister for immigration also advises me to remind members - and in his case senators - that, as applies in all similar cases, assessments under section 501 are contingent on convictions for serious crimes. That goes to the heart of it. I refer to the advice which I have been provided with by the minister for immigration. I refer the shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition to the earlier comments from the Attorney-General about the importance of ensuring that this legal process is properly protected.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. - I think the conclusion which people in this House are rapidly drawing is that, when it comes to health and hospitals, those opposite are very sensitive - indeed, exceptionally sensitive - because they are led by a leader who spent four to five years as the Minister for Health and Ageing, right up until the last election, and who has everything to be concerned about when it comes to his record, a record on health and hospitals which includes a billion dollars ripped out of the public hospital system.

I would also say, in addition to the answer I gave him yesterday, that the decision taken by the department of immigration on 7 October 2009 was consistent with the advice received from the Northern Territory Police. They said, 'The NT Police supports the granting of permanent visas for the passengers.'This advice was received one week before the 42 asylum seekers were granted protection. In taking decisions, obviously, the department of immigration has been exceptionally mindful of also the law enforcement mechanisms of the country including where those procedures may lead in terms of the individuals who were on that vessel, particularly those against whom particular allegations have been made which are now subject to judicial process.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I well remember our visit recently to Darwin and the inspection of the new integrated cancer centre which is now next to the Royal Darwin Hospital. It reminds me of a visit I undertook the other day to the Royal North Shore Hospital. - I can hear already the interjections from the Leader of the Opposition on this question. The Royal North Shore Hospital is a pretty interesting example of what we have been talking about with health and hospital reform because the hospital has been engaged in representations to the previous Australian government from 1997 in order to obtain a PET scanner.I was pleased to actually be present with the member for Bennelong for the opening of that PET scanner last Friday. To be true it was operating for three days before that, but it had been installed during the period of this government. Before the Leader of the Opposition again intervenes on his own particular role here, multiple representations, as advised by the Royal North Shore Hospital, were made to the previous government from 1997 on, but nothing happened until the eve of the 2007 election, when the previous government said, based on representations from the indefatigable member for North Sydney, that they were going to do something about it. It only took 12 years before the previous government said they were going to do something about it. Which government actually did something about it? This Australian Labor government did something about it.I spoke with an 80-year-old man, whose name was Gordon, who has cancer. He was one of the first patients to use the services provided by the new PET scanner. Gordon and others like him are now benefiting from this facility at the Royal North Shore Hospital. I thank the member for Bennelong for her strong representations, the commitments that she undertook, and the delivery on those commitments when it comes to the Royal North Shore Hospital.This goes of course to the much wider challenge of how we properly fund our health and hospital system for the future. I heard, as I came into the chamber today, one of the other honourable members from the opposition benches speaking about the problem of juvenile diabetes. Together with the health minister, many members opposite and many members on our side of the House, I attended an event called Kids in the House, which was held in the Great Hall in Parliament House today, and I see many of the participants in the gallery today. These are great kids who come from all over Australia. I commend members opposite and members on this side of the House for being with their kids as they attended that event today. It was about one thing: how do we make it better for kids who are diagnosed with juvenile diabetes to deal with the challenges of that disease?What I outlined to the gathering today in the Great Hall in Parliament House was the action that the government has now taken in terms of the subsidisation of the cost of insulin pumps. I outlined this to those who were gathered in the Great Hall today. These comments, as I indicated in the House, relate to a particular and significant increase in the amount of the subsidy for insulin pumps. I say to those opposite that all efforts need to be made by governments at all levels to support kids who are suffering from this condition. That is how we deal with those who are currently living with this condition. The other part of my comments today went to how we properly fund research for juvenile diabetes in the future. I indicated the Australian government was currently funding some 360-odd researchers, I think, to the tune of some $63 million to try and find a cure for juvenile diabetes.These are the bread and butter concerns of working families right across Australia - the bread and butter concerns about how we properly fund medical research in the future; the bread and butter concerns about how we deliver PET scanners in hospitals like the Royal North Shore in the future. I say to those opposite that what we must ensure for the future is that we have a properly funded, properly structured health and hospital system for Australia.That is why the Australian government has put forward its plan for a new National Health and Hospitals Network - one which will be funded nationally and run locally with, for the first time, the Australian government becoming the dominant funder of the Australian public hospital system, which means that in the future, when you are looking at the need for PET scanners at hospitals like the Royal North Shore Hospital, the Australian government will not just stand to one side; it will be there as a partner in making sure that those projects are delivered. It means that in the teaching and research function of our hospitals we are partners in ensuring that those services are delivered and that, when it comes to the capital needs of our public hospital system in the future, we are ensuring that we are partners - and the dominant funding partners - to make sure that those hospital services are delivered. That is our plan for the future. That is what we propose to do. That is why we have put forward this plan for the nation.But I could say to those opposite that, nearly two weeks into this debate on health and hospitals, I have a simple question for the Leader of the Opposition, which is this: does he support or does he oppose this plan? We have waited for two weeks now to hear what the answer is: does he support or does he oppose? - The interjection from the Leader of the Opposition is, 'Let me see the plan.' I say to the Leader of the Opposition that a 72-page document outlining this plan in detail is there for all to see. I would note that the Leader of the Opposition, the day before the plan was released, said he was opposed to it - before he even saw it and before anyone else in the country had seen it. But my question again today, two weeks into this debate - plenty of time to review its content - is: does the Leader of the Opposition support this plan or oppose it? The Leader of the Opposition remains stoically silent. Let me try another question. If the Leader of the Opposition - </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I do welcome these questions from the Leader of the Opposition. He has more front than Myer. At the last election there was a certain debate on health. I remember on the eve of the election the shadow minister for health showing up for a debate on time and no-one else was there. I wonder why that was the case? I wonder who the minister for health was at the time? Could it have been the Leader of the Opposition? It was the Leader of the Opposition; my memory does not fail me! There was a debate - I think I was at the National Press Club - and the shadow minister for health was there, ready to go, but no minister for health was there. Instead, he chose to utter unkind remarks -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would have thought if the Leader of the Opposition is committed to the principle of transparency in debates he might have shown up for the last one. But let us let that question of consistency slide by. We know that consistency is not his first suit; it is not even his second suit. In fact, it is not even within his political repertoire: make a claim today and forget about it tomorrow. - In fact, on that day when he failed to front for the debate with the shadow minister for health, his recourse was to swear at the shadow minister for health. That is obviously his preferred debating style. I will leave that to him to resolve come the next election. I also seem to recall in that period that the Leader of the Opposition, then the minister for health, had some interesting exchanges with Bernie Banton as well. I seem to remember that it was about that time that he had to apologise for what he had said in relation to Bernie Banton. On the question of transparency, at the last election we asked and asked again whether we could have a debate - more than one, but two or three - with the then Prime Minister, Mr Howard. I welcome debating the Leader of the Opposition - all three occasions I committed to last time, and I look forward to the first of those debates next week on health and hospitals.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for that question. It is particularly pertinent, because the question asks about us delivering on health in a number of ways, but particularly in general practice. I note that we have just heard from the Leader of the Opposition for 15 minutes and there was one word that did not pass his lips, and that was 'doctors'. The reason that word did not pass his lips in 15 minutes is that the Leader of the Opposition knows that, when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing, he ignored one of the biggest problems that the country faced, and that was the shortage of GPs. He did not just ignore the shortage of GPs; he capped the number of young Australians who could come from medical school and go into general practice. In the whole 15 minutes of the health debate, he did not take any opportunity to correct that. He did not want to say one word about the announcement made this week - $632 million to get rid of that cap to make sure that double that number of young students can go into general practice in the future.I think the first question that will have to be answered in this debate between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition is: does he support us doubling the cap that he put on students wanting to go into general practice? He has not said a word about it. That is the same approach he took he took when we announced our National Health and Hospital Network plan, which was to duck for cover and to look for a diversion - everything but singing and dancing. He will have to turn up to the debate and he will have to answer whether he supports this investment in general practice.In his heart of hearts, the reason he did not mention it for the last 15 minutes is that he knows his record is appalling. He put that cap in place. He was pleaded with time after time by the AMA, by the divisions of general practice and by the student associations, but it fell on deaf ears because the Leader of the Opposition, as the health minister, had other things he was more interested in. What else could he have possibly been more interested in? You might imagine that he might have delivered some other changes to the system, but of course, despite the presumed pleadings of the previous member for Bennelong, and perhaps of the member for North Shore, to invest in the PET scanner, it was ignored until the eve of the election. I noticed that the member for North Shore was interjecting that, in fact, a former health minister, Michael Wooldridge, attended twice and still did not deliver the PET scanner - 12 whole years and they could not do it.We see the same thing from the member for Solomon - happy to promise and promise, election after election, and not deliver. We have seen this again. We see the Leader of the Opposition having the audacity, when the young kids are here from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, to say again that he was going to do something about it - never in a budget, never funded, only a promise, never delivered. Now we are able to assist hundreds of young Australians - supported, I might say, by people on both sides of the House passionately interested in delivering for young people with type 1 diabetes. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition does not appear to be one of those people.I was also lucky, this morning, to be able to attend a breast care nurse conference in Sydney - 300 women supporting and providing fabulous services to women and some men across the country diagnosed with breast cancer. Again, I have asked the Leader of the Opposition and I ask those members opposite to consider: who is it that actually funded those breast care nurses? Which government is it that delivered on breast care nurses, for example, in Shoalhaven in the seat of Gilmore, in Hervey Bay in the seat of Hinkler and at Victor Harbor in the seat of Mayo? I see the member for Mayo has his hand on his head -  - as he well might, because it was not delivered by his government, despite the protestations of the Leader of the Opposition. We have them in Geraldton. I am sure the member for O'Connor welcomes the fact that there is a breast care nurse in these areas - 44 nurses across the country providing services. In a short time, they have already provided care for more than 1,700 women and I hope that this will be supported -  - It is hard to believe that the interjections opposite are that we should not politicise the health debate. We shouldn't, should we? We should not politicise it. We should pretend that the then health minister delivered the PET scanner at Royal North Shore. We should pretend that he actually opened that cancer centre in Darwin which, I might tell you, is actually named after a leading doctor in the Northern Territory. No doubt he and his family would be very offended that Mr Abbott should think that the centre should be named after him. - I just ask you: who is politicising this debate? We have a record we are proud of; you have a record you are ashamed of. I can understand why the Leader of the Opposition gets very touchy and I understand why he did not want to turn up to the debate before the last election, because it would have been shown that every promise about what he was going to do was something that had not been delivered over the previous 12 years. - </DOC>

As the government and the minister responsible have said on many occasions, the government will undertake as many inspections of homes as is necessary.The member for O'Connor then left the chamber. - What we have said is that initially that will focus on the 50,000 or so homes with foil insulation. We have also indicated that we will provide inspections concerning a further 150,000 homes as relates to the particular matters in the particular household which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has referred to.

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. I am delighted to get a question about health spending. As finance minister, it seems beyond the capability of the opposition to ask any questions of anybody about health matters - so I am delighted to have the opportunity to address them.In recent days in the chamber there has been some controversy about the 2003 budget papers: Did the Howard government, or did it not, cut funding for public hospitals for a period of five years, the vast bulk of which was under the stewardship of the now Leader of the Opposition, the then health minister? The Leader of the Opposition is extremely agitated about this question, even more agitated than he usually is. We have had him taking points of order. We have had them moving gag motions on the Prime Minister. We have had personal explanations. We have had fancy charts being waved around in the chamber over several days. He and his team are extremely agitated about this point. There is one aspect of the debate that has not had a great deal of focus - The member for Mayo then left the chamber. - and that is: why in the 2003 budget papers of the Howard government of Peter Costello and Senator Nick Minchin, the then Treasurer and the then finance minister, do we find a very substantial cut to projected spending on public hospitals? There is a very important explanation for this in the Howard government's budget papers, and I will quote. It reads as follows:_ a reduction in public hospital usage growth beyond growth resulting from demographic changes. This change in usage growth reflects in part the fact that more services are being provided in private hospitals following the introduction of the Government's 30 per cent Private Health Insurance Rebate and Lifetime Health Cover.In other words, there was a deliberate decision by the Howard government to move resources out of public hospitals, and that is where the $1 billion of funding that was stripped out of public hospitals came from. It was a deliberate decision by the Howard government to remove that funding from public hospitals - over a $1 billion over a period of five years, the vast bulk of which was when the Leader of the Opposition was health minister.That shows just how phoney his vociferous protestations are in this debate. This was not some kind of technical revision based on revised demographic assessments or changed calculations with respect to the cost of health technology; this was a deliberate, ideological decision by the Howard government to run down investment in public hospitals. It is there in black and white in the 2003 budget papers that I tabled yesterday - more than $1 billion ripped out of the public hospital by the Howard government. That is why the Leader of the Opposition wants to talk about everything else but health. That is why he has asked no questions of the government about its health reform and its hospitals plans. That is why we had to force him today to come to the dispatch box to debate health issues in this parliament. The Leader of the Opposition has an appalling track record on health and hospitals. He was responsible for more than $1 billion being ripped out of the public hospital system, and he is now trying to deny that fact. The truth is there for all to see in the Howard government's budget papers.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for her question because it will enable me to clarify some claims made about the Building the Education Revolution Program. On the claim made by the member about Berridale Public School, I am very happy to answer that claim - very happy to answer it. The details of this are actually very obvious and could have been obvious to anybody who made some basic inquiries.There has been a comparison published about construction at the Berridale Public School of a toilet block and there have been some suggestions that the construction costs for this mean that the construction costs for the new library there are somehow not right. I inform the House that the toilet block there is 36 square metres and the new library facility is 162 square metres. They are not comparable buildings. When you go down to the square metre cost, on the square metre cost you find that one comes in at $4,766 and the other comes in at $5,500 - not significantly different.Then on the question of comparison with residential construction, I inform the honourable member that there are different building codes and different standards for school construction than for residential construction - different glass, different safety standards. All of the things about the building are different and more costly because it will be there for children. -  - On the question of the Building the Education Revolution - The members for Wakefield and Canning then left the chamber. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Of course, I have just been dealing with the question of costs at the Berridale Public School - exactly what I was asked. On the question of the Building the Education Revolution, I say to the House the following: a question was raised with me yesterday by the member for Bradfield about costs and construction at the Gordon East Public School. So serious was this matter - I would have thought they would have wanted an answer but obviously not; you do not really care, do you? - I was asked about the question of costs and the Building the Education Revolution program. I have been dealing with the matter involving Berridale and I am very keen to deal with the matter involving Gordon East Public School, a matter about which the member was so concerned that he personally delivered a letter to my office requiring me to attend -  - I was asked yesterday by the member for Bradfield about Gordon East Public School. So concerned was he about this matter that he brought a letter round to my office asking for an audit team to attend at the school at 8.30 on Friday morning. I can report to the House that I have investigated the matter. I rang the school principal. I would have thought he would have wanted to know what the school principal had to say. - Given I do have extensive information about this matter and that clearly the opposition is not interested in what a school principal has to say, I will deal with this matter separately in the House. Obviously, its desperation to cover it up will just mean than I will be continually interrupted if I try to do it now.</DOC>

 - I really thank the member for his question because as it so happens I have met with the principal of St Lucy's this morning. And as it happens, Jo, the principal of St Lucy's, said the following to me about her Building the Education Revolution project. These are direct words from the principal, so I presume if the member is genuinely interested in the plight of special schools he will be interested in the words of the principal of St Lucy's. She said to me that their BER money had enabled them to install a lift and refurbish the toilets. When the school was first built, it was built as a school for the blind - The member for Oxley  then left the chamber. - I am recounting the words said to me this morning by the principal of St Lucy's. I would have thought that people would want to hear what the principal of St Lucy's has got to say. What she had to say about the Building the Education Revolution project is that it had enabled them to install a lift and refurbish the toilets. This was important because when the school was first built, it was built as a school for the blind. It now mainly caters for children with autism and developmental delays. The old 1960 toilets were consequently not suitable to assist with the current cohort of students, many of whom are bigger children who are still incontinent. So normal-size toilets did not enable them to have the kind of change facilities that are necessary.It should not require me to explain to this House why, in a special school, a lift to move students and staff between the floors of the school is important. The words of the principal of St Lucy's were, 'It has made such a difference to the staff and the students to have these new facilities'. - I just make the point on funding of BER and special schools - and I think this is an important point, and would be celebrated by people of good will - we deliberately drew this program up so that all special schools could benefit from the greater amount of money available under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. So even secondary schools that are special schools can get the bigger grants, which I think is fantastic news for special schools around the country that have not had money for capital for a very long period of time.I will answer the member's question on recurrent funding. We have increased recurrent funding for students with disabilities. We provide that funding to block grant authorities. In the case of Catholic schools we provide it to the Catholic Education Office, and it works out the division from the Catholic Education Office to Catholic schools - the identical disbursement system for schools' money operated by the Howard government. If the member wants to be heard to say that the Catholic Education Office cannot be trusted to properly disperse funds, then I would have thought that was a very controversial call. But, given the Leader of the Opposition has somehow said that he has now converted to paid parental leave, I suppose bashing the Catholic Education Office will be next.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question because all members would be aware that this is the last question time before the budget. It is good to receive so many questions about the economy from this side of the House - there have been so few from that side of the House. I do not think we have had a question on the economy from the Leader of the Opposition. I think there may have been two questions in six months from the shadow Treasurer.The member for Longman asked me about the budget. The budget will be about capitalising on our recent successes, sticking to our fiscal strategy and continuing to build sturdier foundations for our economy. We do face substantial challenges. We saw that with the Intergenerational report. We have seen the government fronting up to the very big challenges of health reform and the ageing of the population. I can report something like two-thirds of all submissions in the budget process do relate to these challenges. I think we can all be confident that we can go on to meet these challenges because we are in a far stronger position than many other countries coming out of this global recession.We do not have to go through the rubble of a recession to meet these challenges as so many other advanced economies are doing at the moment. We have preserved our skills base; we have preserved our capital base. That does put us in a very good position to deal with these challenges, so we are confident, but we are not complacent. The fact is that those opposite have no interest in these challenges. For example, the Leader of the Opposition has been in the job something like 108 days. Not only have we not had a single question about the economy but we have not had a single speech about the economy One hundred and eight days without anything substantial to say about the economy except that he has got a big, new tax. That is the only substantial thing in 108 days that the Leader of the Opposition has said about the economy.When it comes to the shadow Treasurer, his record is not much better. He was not here last Thursday and I notice that he was off giving a speech at the Grattan Institute. I thought that we might find something that he has to say about the economy, but he said nothing about the economy in that speech at all. It was like a first year lecture on modern political ideologies: nothing about the economy, nothing whatsoever - but a bit of a bid, I think, to put himself over to the left of the Liberal Party and separate himself a little from the Leader of the Opposition. We have had two questions on the economy in six months - one in November and one in March - a stunning record. - A heavy lifter. That brings us to Senator Joyce. Senator Joyce has had more to say about the sovereign debt of the United States than the whole economic team has had to say about the Australian economy. I wonder whether Senator Joyce might repeat those remarks next week. I guess we will see. In the bizarre economic universe in which those opposite live, nothing is too bizarre for them. This is what Senator Joyce said on the doors this morning referring to stimulus. He said, 'They're spending money on something that doesn't provide an outcome; there is no outcome from stimulus.' What is an unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent? Breadwinners are continuing to take a pay check home so that they can sit at their kitchen table and pay the bills.These things are not important to those opposite. There are all of the small businesses that were able to keep their doors open: small businesses in Longman and right around this country that are there today because this government had the courage, working with the community, to put in place policies which supported small business and supported employment. But they are not important to those opposite. If they could so comprehensively misjudge a global recession, they most certainly cannot be trusted to deal with a global recovery. What we have seen is how reckless they are. The final word on this came from the former Treasurer, Peter Costello. He says that they have trashed their economic credibility. Their silence in this House every day for the last six months demonstrates that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. Earlier this week the member for Sturt and I spoke on the phone and he asked me in somewhat excited tones whether I had listened to him on Fran Kelly on Radio National that morning. I did have to inform him that I had not had the opportunity to listen to him and I was very sorry for that. It appears today that he has returned the compliment because if he had bothered to listen to Fran Kelly on Radio National this morning or at any point in the course of the morning read my transcript, he would have been aware of the circumstance of Hastings Public School. I will now just catch him up with the news cycle.What is happening at Hastings Public School is that an audit is already in progress. The audit had commenced well before the question involving Hastings Public School was in the media at all. It was not associated with the opposition, the New South Wales Teachers Federation or any of the joint claims that they are raising in the public debate at the moment.Well before this was in the media, the audit processes in New South Wales had identified Hastings Public School for an audit. Indeed, the audit processes in New South Wales have audited 102 schools, and they will continue to audit as necessary. This is obviously all big news to those opposite, but they really do need to catch up, because this was announced. The fact that there would be these audits to ensure robustness in the program was announced by the New South Wales government. - There we go: the future of modern liberalism at it again. - If she just tried to stay up with the information cycle, it would be of help to all of us. Obviously Building the Education Revolution is a huge program: 9,500 schools and around 24,000 projects. There have been audit arrangements built in through the program. Obviously there are checks that we run. There is the value for money in the guidelines. Then, of course, there are checks taken by block grant authorities. The question of having an audit squad and having these audits was announced by the New South Wales government in - wait for it - September last year. Following the announcement in September last year, do you know what happens when you announce an audit squad? Well, go figure: they go and they conduct audits. That is what they have been doing: auditing 102 schools. They had identified the Hastings Public School for an audit. That audit is taking place now, well before any of these matters were in the media, and it is a fabulous example of the system working exactly as it was designed to do.</DOC>

 - I thank my friend the member for Hunter for his question, and I acknowledge his contribution to our nation's national security. Protecting the safety and security of its citizens is the highest priority for a government, and a crucial part of that responsibility is ensuring that there is a legal framework in place that gives our law enforcement and security agencies the right tools that they need to protect our community but, at the same time, ensuring that our laws are balanced, that they have safeguards and that they are accountable in their operation.In August of last year I released a discussion paper outlining how the government proposed to respond to four key reports, including two reports that were bipartisan, from committees during the time of the former government. One of the more recent reports, of course, was that of the Hon. John Clarke QC in respect of the matter of Dr Mohammed Haneef.The bills responding to those reports and operational recommendations are extensive, and obviously I will not go through the details of all, but in some cases there is an enhancement of powers, including, for instance, new powers for the police to enter premises without a warrant in an emergency situation where it is necessary to do so to render safe a substance or piece of equipment that could cause danger to the public. There is also provision for an extension of time to re-enter premises, as we would expect, in a potential terror situation if it is necessary to evacuate it for the purpose of exercising a warrant. Significantly, there is also an expansion of the 'urging violence' offence so that it applies to individuals as well as groups who incite violence on the basis of race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin or political opinion.As I have noted, the bill also contains safeguards. As recommended by the Clarke inquiry, we will be establishing a maximum seven-day limit on the amount of time that can be specified by a magistrate and disregarded from the investigation period when a person has been arrested for a terrorism offence. We have also extended the 'good faith' defence in respect of the new crime of urging violence to specifically include artistic, journalistic or academic work that has been prepared and undertaken in good faith. Also in terms of accountability, we have established the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement, which will have oversight of not only the Australian Crime Commission but also the Australian Federal Police. In that context, we will be empowering the Prime Minister to refer to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security the ability to inquire into any other Commonwealth agency, including the Federal Police.I should indicate that it is not simply legislation that we have amended as a result of the four inquiries. A lot of work has been done by the agencies to implement recommendations of the Street review and the Clarke review in terms of working together cooperatively. For instance, there is a joint operations protocol between ASIO and the Australian Federal Police and a new counterterrorism prosecution guideline in terms of their relationship with the Director of Public Prosecutions. I think the success of those operations, their expertise and their working cooperatively are demonstrated in the recent successful prosecutions. The government is pleased to have introduced this important legislation, which represents a significant move to a safer and more secure Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, because it goes to the government's proposal to introduce a resource super profits tax. The reason the government is proposing to do that is that we need to do three things: (1) provide proper super for working families across Australia (2) provide tax cuts for all businesses in Australia and (3) properly fund the future infrastructure needs of Australia. These are the three reasons we are proposing this tax and doing so consistent with the advice provided by the Secretary of the Treasury in his review.I say to the Leader of the Opposition that as he goes through project by project it would be useful for him to reflect on what others have said in the commentary in recent days about a fear campaign being run by those opposite and by some in the mining industry on the impact of this proposal. I draw his attention, for example, to the comments the other day by the former chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia, David Buckingham, who described the current fear campaign as 'utterly baseless'. I also draw his attention to those comments today in the Financial Review 
from the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia.It follows logically that, if you are going to impose a new tax to fund these three priorities of nation building for the future, you are going to have opposition from some of the mining companies concerned. We have outlined our tax proposal and we have outlined a consultation process with the mining industry which will go to detail, which will go to implementation and which will go to transition. We are embarked on that process and will continue it into the period ahead.</DOC>

 - When it comes to health and hospitals it seems that those opposite only have one response, which is to guffaw. But, bearing in mind that we face a Leader of the Opposition who gouged $1 billion from the public hospital system, we do understand what they have to guffaw about.I ask the Leader of the Opposition to suspend his cynicism for just one moment and reflect on the historical significance of the health and hospitals deal which was arrived at among the states and territories in Canberra on 20 April. This was a historic reform. This is the largest change to the health and hospital system since the introduction of Medicare. We know where those opposite stand in their commitment to Medicare, because in years past they tried in election after election after election to get rid of Medicare. This government introduced it and this government sustained it, despite their successive attempts to get rid of it.The questions which are often asked are: 'What is this reform about? Why are we doing it?' Point number one is that this system of ours is at a tipping point, partly because our predecessors, when the Leader of the Opposition was health minister, ripped $1 billion out of the system. The system was underfunded and under stress. But I go to the core element -  - The core of this reform, when it comes down to the nuts and bolts, is this: we are going to have 1,300 more hospital beds, we are going to have 2,500 additional aged-care places, we are going to have 6,000 additional doctors, we are going to progressively introduce a four-hour waiting time target at A&amp;E and we are going to bring in a target for elective surgery to be delivered on time for 95 per cent of patients. Furthermore, if a patient cannot receive their elective surgery within the clinically recommended time, we have undertaken that they would receive free treatment at a public or private hospital to get that surgery done. Beyond that, for those suffering from mental health complaints, an additional 20,000 young people will get access to mental health services. This is the bread and butter of what we are putting forward to the Australian people.At the level of structural reform, this is of fundamental importance. First of all, we have brought about a nationally funded system for the first time. The primary healthcare system of Australia will be funded exclusively by the Australian government, the Australia government will be the dominant funder of the acute hospital system, and the aged-care network will be funded exclusively by the Australian government. Having a system funded nationally is one thing; having it run locally is in fact equally critical. Under these reforms local hospital networks will take on the primary role for local decisions on the delivery of these improved healthcare services for working Australians. This is an important national reform - funded nationally, run locally. For the first time the Australian government will be the dominant funder of the Australian hospital system.On top of that, there will be new national standards. These standards will mean shorter waiting times in our hospitals. We have outlined with the states and the territories new arrangements for national access targets and elective surgery targets, and there will be additional investments to make these things happen on the ground. These are reforms which mean things to working families across the country. Of course, when we began this debate in this parliament some years ago, it was about ending the blame game between the states and the Commonwealth. Those opposite scoffed at the possibility of any such agreement ever being reached. This government has delivered that agreement. It goes to the heart of cost shift, blame shift between the two levels of government. With the Australian government now being the exclusive funder of the primary system, the dominant funder of the acute system and the exclusive funder of the aged-care system, the financial incentives which have existed for decades and decades to shift patients from one system to another are removed. That is why this is a historic reform.However, the rubber hits the road when we talk about what happens for the individual communities around Australia - for the 764 local public hospitals of Australia - and what it means, for example, for the people of Blacktown, who already in their local hospital have had 19 additional subacute beds added since the announcement of the government's decision the other day. There is the addition of further investments for accident and emergency departments, the needs of Cairns Base Hospital and the new cancer treatment services at Townsville Base Hospital, Rockhampton, Gosford and Tamworth - all across the country. Also, there are the further investments that we are making in the expansion of services in hospitals in Darwin, Hobart and Launceston. These are not just structural reforms; they are bread and butter reforms. They are bread and butter reforms to make a difference for working families on the ground right across Australia - for pensioners and carers who have not been able to get decent access to the system so far. This is a fundamental reform. The Leader of the Opposition stood up four or five years ago as health minister and said it was time for the Commonwealth to bring about a fundamental reform to the system. For five years he failed to act; in two years this government has acted.</DOC>

 - As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would be aware, the resources regime in this country deals with non-renewable resources which are taxed separately, and it has been done so for more than 100 years, either through (a) the royalties regimes of states (b) the petroleum resource rent tax or (c) proposed with this resource rent tax for onshore resources as well. That is why it is taxed separately, and I would have thought the Leader of the Opposition and the deputy would have known that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I would draw the House's attention to developments in the international economy and specifically in global financial markets over the last several weeks, particularly as they have related to Greece and, most recently and more broadly, across Europe. These have been grave and concerning developments for all those concerned with the stability of our financial markets. Developments in Europe have been of great concern to the International Monetary Fund, they have been of concern to the World Bank and they have been of concern to the whole raft of financial institutions, not least of which are the European Central Bank and the European Union. The reason for that is always the risk of contagion from one financial market to another in times of great financial instability. That is why we have been watching developments in Europe particularly closely, including over the course of the last weekend.The statement by European finance ministers under the chairmanship of the current chair of the European community was a critical statement containing a package of stabilisation measures which are of direct relevance to credit markets and financial markets in this country. It underlines the absolute importance, therefore, of maintaining Australia's position as one of the strongest economies in the advanced world. We have the strongest growth compared with all of the major advanced economies. We have the second-lowest unemployment, the lowest debt and the lowest deficit and we are the only country to have avoided recession - and all the time while maintaining this country's AAA credit rating. To build on this strength for the future, what we need to do is also deal with three core challenges for the future: (1) the challenge to secure our recovery through the full implementation of stimulus (2) the challenge to keep our public finances strong through a responsible budget and (3) the challenge to reform our economy for the future by continuing a program of productivity based reform for the future.When it comes to securing the recovery, I notice that those opposite call for an immediate abolition of all stimulus. This is completely contrary to the advice of any and every international financial institution. Their argument is that the global recovery is too insecure as of yet to pull the rug from underneath it. Treasury's advice is that the government stimulus package has protected more than 200,000 jobs. Secondly, our challenge for the future is to keep our public finances strong, and this, of course, is something of which turmoil in Europe has reminded us. The stimulus strategy that we have implemented peaked at the end of the second quarter last year. In the budget last year we articulated tough fiscal rules to guide and return this budget to surplus. Those rules have been adhered to meticulously since that time, and will be into the future. This budget will not be a pre-election Liberal Party style spend-a-thon; this budget will be a no-frills, fiscally responsible budget to demonstrate responsible economic leadership.Also the challenge for the future is to continue the process of reform, and questions have already come in this place about the nature of taxation reform. I draw the attention of those opposite to the fundamental need to ensure that we have for Australia an adequate pool of retirement savings for the long-term future. One of the great enduring reforms of the previous Labor government was to introduce the superannuation guarantee. It rose, against the opposition of those opposite, from three per cent to six per cent to nine per cent, and for 12 years they did nothing further about it. This government has resolved to raise the SGL from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This is not just a reform for working families; it is also a reform to boost our level of national savings.In the midst of the most recent financial crisis, I remind those opposite of one core fact: the accumulation of our pool of national savings was absolutely critical for Australian companies to draw upon in their own capital raisings when capital markets froze around the world. My advice is that, during the course of last year, $90 billion to $100 billion was raised domestically onshore drawing from this pool of savings. These reforms will add up to an extra $108,000 on retirement super for an average worker aged 30 now. Critically, in aggregate it adds a further $85 billion to our pool of national savings.Furthermore, the rationale for reform for the future is to bring down the company tax rate for the future as well, to make sure that our company tax rate is globally competitive, which is why the reforms we are putting forward on the basis of the tax plan advanced by the Treasurer is to bring the tax rate down to 28c with the object of heading further as public finance resources permit - an additional benefit for small business. This government has become the friend of small business. This government has put forward a tax package for small business, involving the immediate write-off -  -  - I thought that would get them going, and it did! - of the $5,000 tax break affecting 2.4 million small businesses and, for the 30 per cent of small businesses that are incorporated, in addition to that the reduction of their rate to 28c. That is the second arm of reform.The third is the long-term funding of infrastructure. Those opposite say: 'Where do we fund our railroad and ports? Where do we ensure that the key economic infrastructure of Australia is funded and laid out to underpin the next level of economic growth for Australia?' What we are doing through this tax reform is building a $5.6 billion national investment fund for the infrastructure needs of the states, in particular the resource states. So what we are proposing, to take the current strength of this economy further, is, first and foremost, bringing down the tax rate for all companies, in particular to provide a tax break for small business; second, boosting the retirement income savings of all working Australians; and, third, funding the future infrastructure needs for our roads, rail and ports for the future - building on the strength we currently have, setting up Australia for long-term strong economic growth.</DOC>

 - I thank the Minister for Resources and Energy for his sterling work in recent days in working with a mining industry which is comprised of miners who want to get on with the business of their work. There are a number of them out there who have been making a range of public statements, some of which have been true and others not. As I said in response to the question asked before on the implementation of the government's new proposed Resource Super Profits Tax, we are engaged in a process of consultation with the mining industry, as I said before, and as I have said before in Perth and elsewhere, on the detail of, the implementation of and the transition to these arrangements. That is what we intend to do. We are currently in the process, through the minister and through the Treasurer, of doing so with a large number of companies right across Australia.I would also say to the member for Groom, who has just asked this question, that he should pay very close attention to the submission given to the Henry review by the head of the mining industry council himself when he recommended a resource rent tax for the future. It is interesting to see how things change once action is taken in order to bring about fundamental tax reform. I noticed in particular that the member for Groom has not referred to the measures contained in the government's tax reform proposal to assist the exploration industry - $1.1 billion of additional assistance. I noticed also that the member for Groom did not draw attention to the fact that we are also assisting smaller to medium miners who may not be bringing in profits in their initial years of operation. I would draw the member for Groom's attention to the modelling done independently through Econtech for the Treasury in producing this set of reforms. For the mining industry it is projected that this will result in an overall growth in the industry of some 6.5 per cent. Those opposite do not care about these individual elements of reform. Consistent with so many other things they do in this place, they are first and foremost about a fear campaign devoid of fact. We intend to get on with the business of reform, and reform which does three things: provides super savings for working Australians - all of them; secondly, provides tax breaks for corporate Australia, including small business; and, thirdly, provides support for investment in our long-term infrastructure needs. These are the three driving elements of the reform, broadening the base of the mining industry through a series of changes which we have reflected on carefully based on submissions from the mining industry as well. We intend to get on with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question. Clearly from the Australian government's point of view, and I might say from the point of view of the non-renewables sector of the Australian economy, the time has come for fundamental reform of the Australian taxation system when it comes to the petroleum and mining industry in Australia. That is not just the view of the Australian government; it is also the view of the Minerals Council of Australia in its submission to the Henry review. When it comes to tough decisions and fundamental reform which goes to where Australia goes in the 21st century, the government is prepared to make the hard decisions. The opposition is never prepared to meet us halfway. Having said that, the Australian government understands that this is a complex issue. For those reasons we are committed to not only putting in place a genuine process of consultation but also in engaging in open consultation to make sure we get the system right. - I remind the House that this proposal is no different from the controversy that surrounded the decision of the then government 25 years ago to introduce a national petroleum resource rent tax. - That tax is now regarded as one of the most stable systems in the world. - Exploration and development in the oil and gas industries have flourished under that system. That is the very tax that brought to Australia the $12 billion Pluto petroleum investment in 2007 and the $43 billion petroleum investment in Gorgon by the joint venture partners in 2009. Compare that with the inconsistencies that exist at a state and territory level when it comes to mining and resources in Australia. There are complex arrangements with no consistency across state and territory boundaries. If you have any doubts about that, just think about the coalmining industry in New South Wales and Queensland. The systems of coal royalties are different and complex. I also remind you, Mr Speaker, that both those state governments have increased coal royalties over the last 12 months. But that is no different from the state of Western Australia, where we have in place a coalition Premier and where we have yet another variable royalty system. We should also appreciate that in many ways the Western Australian Premier actually supports the endeavours of the Australian government to front up with some hard decisions when it comes to royalties. On 25 February of this year the Western Australian Premier said:I have to say that a few people who work around the mining industry came up to me over summer and said, 'By the way, Colin, the mining companies are getting away with murder; they're not paying enough'.It is for that very reason that in the forthcoming Western Australian budget that will be brought down next week the Western Australian government is going to rip out of two major iron ore companies an increase in iron ore royalties of the order of $300 million. We will put in place a new tax regime which creates certainty and a proper investment horizon for the resources sector in Australia. But, perhaps more importantly, we will be investing in things with part of the proceeds of that new tax regime that the previous government absolutely failed to invest in.First, let us go to the issue of infrastructure. Over the previous decade, because of lack of action by the Howard government, we lived off the back of increases in resource commodity prices whilst we lost market share because the Howard government failed to invest in infrastructure. A key part of the Australian government's proposal will be to establish for the first time ever, through a budget process, a resource infrastructure fund aimed at working with state and territory governments and, I might say, the private sector to actually bring forward resource infrastructure investment, which has held back the expansion of the industry in the past. I would also say that the resources sector, like the rest of the Australian business community, will benefit from a reduction in corporate taxation.But then we go to the issue of exploration, something that I am sure the member for Groom is vitally interested in because he, like other resources ministers, sought on a number of occasions, during the 12 long years of the Howard government, to put in place resource exploration incentives to encourage brownfields and greenfields exploration in Australia. For the first time ever we will be putting in place a new resource exploration rebate that benefits small preprofit exploration companies. -  - Also, for the information for the member for Flinders, that will be extended to the geothermal industry from 1 July next year to also facilitate investment in renewable energy in Australia. I accept that our responsibility is to actually get the balance right between promoting investment in the mining sector and ensuring a fair return to the Australian community for the development of their resources. It is a privilege for these mining companies to actually be able to develop our resources. All the Australian community expects is a fair return for the development of those resources. We have consulted and we will continue to consult to actually get the finer detail of this proposal right for the purposes of guaranteeing Australia's economic future.</DOC>

 - On the question of tax reform for the mining industry, can I go to one core point as was elaborated on and advanced just then by the minister for resources. For the mining industry itself why are we doing this? To make sure that we move from a regime which is based on volume to one which is based on profit. -  - I know that the Leader of the Opposition has no interest in economics; he has said so. I know that the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, said he could never have him as a Treasurer because he has no interest in economics. But I will ask him to focus on one core concept, which is this: a tax based on volume in the resources sector penalises those firms which do not generate profits in their early years and throttles the long-term development of the industry. That is why we are moving to a profits based tax. That is why, for example, the work done a quarter of a century ago on the petroleum resource rent tax was right, because in the period since then we have seen the phenomenal growth of our offshore developments. That is the reason we have done this. It is good intrinsically for the long-term development of the industry because the tax regime changes the architecture to one which is profit based and not volume based. Secondly, as I said before in relation to companies, we will also of course be consulting the state governments on detail, on implementation and on transition and my advice from the Treasurer is that those consultations are proceeding well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. Members of the House would be well aware that global prices for Australia's commodities, Australia's resources, have soared in recent years and that, after a dip during the global financial crisis, those prices have returned to record levels and are expected to be at very high levels for some years to come. As a result of that, the proportion of the returns that the Australian community, the owners of those resources, get from the sale of those resources has dropped significantly. It is critical to note that these resources are non-renewable; they can only be sold once. A tonne of coal or a tonne of iron ore, once it is extracted and sold, cannot be sold again. The mining boom has also been putting pressure on other sectors of the economy. It inevitably draws labour and capital from other sectors and increases prices for labour in particular, thereby generating higher costs for other sectors. It puts upward pressure on the Australian dollar, which in turn puts pressure on other sectors like tourism and manufacturing, and of course it increases the cost to governments, both state and federal, due to the provision costs of infrastructure and skills.Last week the Australian government announced a new taxation regime with respect to resources, a resource superprofits tax. It is designed to impact on profits above a basic return on capital and is similar to the petroleum resource rent tax, which has been in place for 25 years. It is a more efficient regime than royalties which tax volume and which tax production. It is a more efficient regime of taxation because it taxes profits and therefore gets a genuine return to the Australian community, the owners of these resources, in return for the exploitation of these resources. Independent economic modelling by KPMG Econtech, which is up on their website, has indicated that in the long haul this change in taxation will improve Australia's output, it will improve investment, it will improve jobs in the sector and it will increase our GDP by 0.7 per cent in the longer term. But there is a critical point here that the opposition need to really understand before they embark on yet another sabotage effort, yet another attempt to block reform by this government.The question is: where are the proceeds from this tax reform going? The proceeds of this tax are not going to reduce the deficit and they are not going towards social spending. They are going towards wealth creation overwhelmingly through cuts in business taxes, cuts in tax on small business and cuts in tax on business generally through greater investment in superannuation as a result of cuts in tax and through greater investment in infrastructure for resource states. That is where the proceeds of the government's Resource Super Profits Tax are headed.The opposition - the party that says it is the party of small business - is proposing to stand in the way of a company tax cut for small business. It is proposing to stand right in the way of a big increase in the amount that small businesses can write off immediately for tax purposes from capital expenditures from $1,000, where it is at the moment, to $5,000. It is proposing to stand right in the way of major new investment in infrastructure in mining dominated states. It is proposing to stand right in the way of a big increase in Australia's superannuation system which, in turn, feeds into investment in Australia's economy. The member for Dunkley then left the chamber . 
 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I can correct the observation made by the member for Dunkley. The increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent does, in fact, have a significant cost to the budget of lost revenue because of increased concessionality of superannuation contributions. And guess how that cost to the budget is going to be paid? From revenue from the Resource Super Profits Tax along with a cut in tax on small business, along with a cut in company tax generally and along with a greater investment in infrastructure for resource dominated states. That is where the money is going.In conclusion, the Australian people deserve a better return from the resources that are exploited in their name and they deserve that return being dedicated to investment in wealth creation for the long-term sustainable growth of the Australian economy. That is precisely what this government is proposing to do, and that is precisely what the opposition is trying to stop.</DOC>

 - I welcome any question from the Leader of the Opposition on climate change, any question whatsoever that he may wish to ask on climate change, particularly given his recent discussions in Sunday school with little children, telling them that it was hotter in Jesus' time - and right on cue the guy up the back says, 'It's true.'No credible scientist in the world believes that it was hotter in Jesus' time than it is 2,000 years later after 250 years of the industrial revolution. You know those things called factories with smokestacks and things coming out of the top? That is what is making the world hotter. It is called climate change through global warming. What I find disturbing about all this - and the position of the government on previous statements remains unchanged -  -  - This new twist on the part of the Leader of the Opposition to substantiate his policy positions on religious beliefs I find interesting. There was a debate earlier on about homelessness - am I right? - where he said, in justifying his position, that they would not support our position to bring down homelessness. He again invoked Jesus of Nazareth to say, 'The poor you have with you always.' - As I said in response to the question from the Leader of the Opposition before, on both of the matters he raised, neither my position nor that of the government has changed. Can I say in response, though - to the man who stood in this place and assassinated the member for Wentworth in order to obtain the leadership of the Liberal Party and then proceeded to vote down this government's emissions trading scheme and has the gall to stand at the dispatch box and provide a moral lecture on climate change - what moral planet does he live on? Having himself destroyed bipartisan consensus on emissions trading, having assassinated the member for Wentworth on the basis of that and having said just before that emissions trading must be passed before this parliament, he stands there as if he occupies a position of moral principle. I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition he reflect again on climate conditions in Palestine in the year 32 AD. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for his question. The government will deliver an historic boost to the retirement incomes of Australians to deal with the ageing population and to give Australians a chance for a more comfortable retirement. This is a big reform. These are the biggest reforms since the introduction of our national superannuation system in 1992 - 8.4 million Australians will benefit from an increase in their retirement incomes and 3.5 million Australians will pay little or no tax on their superannuation as the government effectively reduces the contributions tax for low-income earners to zero.These are reforms of today to meet the challenges of tomorrow, and they have been very widely welcomed. The former Governor of the Reserve Bank and former Secretary to the Treasury, Bernie Fraser, had this to say. He said that he was very encouraged by that move because it will make a significant contribution to more Australians having the chance of a half decent retirement income. He said that, really, nine per cent is not sufficient for the vast majority of Australians; 12 per cent will be better. And the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association of New South Wales said that pensioners and superannuants welcome the Australian government's response to the Henry review as it will make the superannuation system fairer for low-income earners and will boost retirement incomes. They said that they call on all MPs to pass on these reforms. Bernie Fraser was a Labor mate - maybe the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association are Labor mates too.So we have had Bernie Fraser and we have had the superannuants. They said Bernie Fraser was a Labor mate. Let us see what that other well-known Labor mate John Brogden, the Chief Executive of the Investment and Financial Services Association, had to say about the reforms of this government. He said that the policy announced by the government eight days ago is good for Australia and good for Australians. He said that it will deliver an extraordinary benefit to the economy. He went on to say that this is a visionary policy, that it is visionary for Australians' retirement outcomes and it is visionary for the Australian economy. He said that they support this strongly and call on the opposition to join with the government in supporting this important policy. That is that well-known Labor mate John Brogden.The reason why these reforms have been so well received is that ordinary Australians stand to benefit so much from these reforms. An employee aged 30 today, on average weekly earnings, will receive an extra $108,000 when they come to retire. And a female aged 30 today, on average weekly earnings, who may have her working pattern interrupted by maternity leave and other issues, stands to gain $78,000 when she comes to retire. But the opposition opposes these important reforms and opposes this boost to the retirement incomes of Australians.I have seen the opposition, and saw it again a few moments ago, arguing that there is no link between the resources super profit tax and these reforms. The shadow minister for superannuation, the member for Cowper, who is now more accurately known as the shadow minister against superannuation, has issued a press release saying there is no link, and I saw the shadow Treasurer arguing this on Insiders on Sunday. Winter is coming to Canberra and it is time to get your sloppy joe out once again - because there he was, arguing on Insiders that there is no link. He said there was no government money going into the superannuation guarantee. The opposition so lacks an understanding of basic economics and so lacks an understanding of public finance that it seems not to realise that superannuation in Australia attracts a tax concession, and when you increase the amount of money on superannuation you increase the cost of the tax concession. That is how it works and a half a percent increase in the superannuation guarantee sees the cost of the tax concession go up by $500 million.The opposition stands against improved superannuation in two ways: it opposes the increase in the superannuation guarantee and it opposes the super profits tax on the resources sector, which will fund the improved and increased tax concessions. Now, there is something deeper going on here because the opposition, the Liberal Party, hates superannuation. It opposed superannuation when the Keating government introduced it. It opposed the increase in the superannuation guarantee all through the Howard years. It stopped Australian working families getting an improved retirement income all through the Howard years.This Leader of the Opposition particularly hates superannuation. This Leader of the Opposition argued in his book Battlelines 
that the tax concessions for superannuation should be abolished. He would put a wrecking ball through the retirement incomes of Australians - a wrecking ball. He would abolish the tax concessions for superannuation and make Australian workers pay tax on superannuation at their full marginal tax rate. The Australian people have a very clear choice at the next election: a government which believes in promoting and boosting the retirement incomes of Australians or an opposition which stands against boosting the retirement incomes of Australians and stands against working Australians having a more comfortable retirement.</DOC>

 - A minister - finance minister, I recall - of the previous government, the highest taxing government in Australia's history, providing any lecture on fiscal conservatism is remarkable. The projects concerned formed part of the government's school modernisation program. I noticed from the tone of the question from the shadow minister for education that he is deeply disappointed by the contents of the APPA report. The APPA report has a number of observations within it, including the following: 97 per cent of principals said students would benefit from the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program; 96 per cent of students would benefit from the National School Pride Program; 90 per cent of principals agreed that the projects undertaken matched community needs; et cetera. This has been a remarkably successful program right across the country.Only last week I was in the electorate of the member for Deakin, opening the new library at the School of St Luke the Evangelist. I listened very carefully to the teachers, the local priest and others talking about them having something decent added to their school for the first time in decades and decades. I also went outside and looked at what had happened via the improvement program which had funded the astroturfing of an oval that had previously been completely unusable due to there not being enough water to have grass there. For the first time, the kids can go out there and not have their knees skinned if they fall over once. These stories are being repeated across the nation in the 24,000 projects that are underway under the Building the Education Revolution program.This government is proud of the school modernisation program. This government is proud of the libraries that are being built across Australia. We are proud of the fact that we are adding science centres across Australia. We are proud of the fact that we are also assisting local school communities deal with needs that have been banking up year after year. The government has looked carefully at the Audit Office's report. The Deputy Prime Minister has taken note of its recommendations. The government will continue to implement these projects.I would like to say something to the shadow minister for education and the Leader of the Opposition while they are together in this chamber. On the one hand, the Leader of the Opposition says that he will cancel all stimulus. - Nonsense? I say that those opposite are walking two sides of the street. On the question of the Building the Education Revolution program, those opposite have one responsibility if they are being fair dinkum: in each electorate across the Australia, they must itemise each one of the schools at which they will cease the construction program. Otherwise, the Leader of the Opposition's statement about halting stimulus payments across the country is revealed for what it is: a piece of utterly fraudulent politics. That is the challenge for those opposite. If you are going to say this in Canberra, do it at the local level. Every local newspaper editor will chase you down and ask which schools you will stop funding, which of those where construction has not started will you pull the plug on and how many tradies will you throw out of work.I go back again to the School of St Luke the Evangelist. I spoke to the local builder, who said to me that, were it not for this program, he and so many other people who worked on it - up to 30 subbies on a given day - would have had no work last year. Why do you think that this country - unique among the major advanced economies - emerged from the global economic crisis with positive growth, as the only economy not to go into recession and as the only economy to continue to generate high levels of employment, with an unemployment level about half of what we see in Europe and the United States? The answer lies in getting on with the business of implementing stimulus projects on the ground, ones that have provided real and tangible returns for the kids of the 21st century. That is why the government unapologetically supports this program.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. I acknowledge his interest in infrastructure issues, particularly in his regional community. Australia does indeed need world-class infrastructure, especially in our resource rich states. The Rudd government is determined to manage the next resources boom better than the previous government managed the last one, making sure that we have long-lasting productivity and sustainable growth. Through the resources rent tax, we will be able to establish a $5.6 billion state infrastructure fund aimed at doing just that. This will build better road and rail infrastructure and more efficient ports. It will tackle the capacity constraints that the Reserve Bank warned on 20 separate occasions during the last boom were holding back Australia's economic growth.This fund is about boosting productivity across the economy. It will provide vital infrastructure reform for our economic future. It will deliver critical funds for infrastructure funding when they are most needed: as resource projects are built, not years down the track after production has come on line. But yet again we have those opposite opposing reform and opposing investment in infrastructure.We know that public investment in infrastructure fell by 20 per cent as a proportion of national income during their term in office. Every time this government has attempted infrastructure reform, it has been opposed by those opposite. They opposed the establishment of Infrastructure Australia, they opposed the Building Australia Fund and they opposed the record spending through the Nation Building Program. It is not surprising when you look at what they say. The Leader of the Opposition has justified their opposition to spending when it comes to rail with this quote: 'But normally state governments can do all that.' That was their attitude during their period in office - it was someone else's problem. Under their watch, super profits went up by $80 billion over the last decade, but there was a failure to invest in infrastructure. The way the government has structured this package will ensure that infrastructure is looked after, and that is in the interests of the national economy, just as Australians getting a fair share from their resources is in the interests of all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It goes to the government's arrangements to work with the industry arising from the Home Insulation Program. I refer the honourable member to the Hawke review, which produced its findings concerning the inadvisability of proceeding with a continuing program. They did so because they believed that the government's resources should be dedicated in the meantime to ensuring that all safety matters arising from the previous program were properly dealt with. Furthermore, the government has already provided, by way of assistance to firms within the industry, $15 million in insulation industry assistance package support, together with arrangements with the Commissioner for Taxation on GST payment obligations for eligible insulation companies. In addition to that -  - One of the three elements of the government's response is the $56 million to assist insulation workers and companies affected by the closure of the Home Insulation Program. There are specific programs which affect workers, and they were detailed earlier by ministers in the House. For companies, I referred to the $15 million industry assistance package, and of course there are the additional measures through the Australian Taxation Office.These are difficult times for various parts of the industry. The government fully recognises that fact. A number of firms are already assisting with the Home Insulation Program inspection arrangements. I am advised by the minister that a number of those firms are obtaining further work as a consequence of that. The minister responsible, the Minister Assisting the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, Mr Combet, will continue to keep the House informed on the progress of implementation of that program.</DOC>

 - I particularly thank the member for Forde for that question. Of course, we have already heard from the Prime Minister about the historic COAG deal that was reached on 20 April. But the important backing-in of that agreement is made by the question asked by the member for Forde, because his electorate, which includes Logan Hospital, has already received $44 million to upgrade its emergency department. It is one of the busiest hospitals in Queensland. This comes from the $750 million that was already committed to taking pressure off emergency departments from the 2008 COAG agreement. Thirty-seven hospitals across the country are receiving upgrades. Many of them are already in fact operating. Royal Darwin Hospital, for example, is expanding its emergency department with a $2.3 million upgrade. New medical assessment units have already opened across New South Wales in hospitals, including the Calvary Mater in Newcastle and in Mona Vale and Liverpool.What we see with the recent agreement is a $750 million additional investment in emergency departments to bring about our commitment that patients be seen, admitted or discharged within four hours - a new first-time target for the nation in emergency departments. We can look across the spectrum for this. We can look at our new investments in elective surgery - $800 million extra, as the Prime Minister mentioned, with a new guarantee to provide elective surgeries within the clinically recommended time. But of course we already had made a $600 million investment in elective surgery, which has already provided 62,000 additional elective surgeries, and more than 120 hospitals across the country have received new equipment or upgrades. Patients are already enjoying the benefits of this investment in hospitals such as Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Frankston Hospital and Canberra Hospital.In fact, I am disappointed that the member for Dunkley is not here, because I was fortunate to be able to visit Frankston Hospital in just the last few weeks. They already have a new, dedicated elective surgery ward which is assisting them to deal with their throughput and the growing demand for elective surgery. I was told by the director of elective surgery at Frankston Hospital that since our investment was made and they opened that ward they have not had to cancel one elective surgery operation. This is a really important achievement for the people of Frankston, and this is going to be replicated across the country.So we are very proud that the additional significant investments that will deliver for patients across the country are building on significant investments that have already been made and that are rolling out across the country. But what you can see from the new investment is not just the guarantee for elective surgery. It is not just the new access targets for emergency departments. It is more than 1,300 new subacute beds across the country. Our investments are going to support over a million extra emergency department services and more than 90,000 extra elective surgeries and will deliver an estimated 24,900 services just through the additional subacute beds. This is a lot of people. It is a lot of families. It is a lot of relief for people who are in pain and, often, suffering. We would invite those opposite to start representing their constituents. Encourage people - the member for Dunkley, I am sure, will be doing this about Frankston Hospital - to support these important investments that are delivering for patients across the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Can I also draw her attention to the fact, when it comes to the affordability of child care, that the government has increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. This has been a huge boon to working families. We have some 77,000 families that have benefited from the government's policy to lift that, meaning up to a threshold of $7,500 a year. Secondly, on the question of centres -  - I am advised that four years ago there were some 1,000 fewer long day care centres and child care was of course less affordable, for the reason I just referred to. Since then we have increased the childcare rebate, ABC Learning has collapsed and the government has helped re-establish the market by ensuring as many centres as possible kept their doors open. Following reassessment of the market, the data has indicated that supply is largely keeping pace with demand. The government, therefore, will remain attentive to any particular emergence of supply gaps in parts of the nation. We have, however, acted on the basis of close consultation with the industry.The Child Care Vacancies Quarterly snapshot showed that 91 per cent of reporting long day care services recorded vacancies, including 90 per cent in major cities and 98 per cent in very remote and remote areas. In light of this evidence, the government reached the decision that has been articulated by the minister in recent days. Again I would draw the honourable member's attention to the circumstances which the Deputy Prime Minister and others had to confront following the collapse of ABC Learning. My advice or recollection is that that was about one-quarter or one-third of centres right across the nation. The fact that the government stepped in and kept that network afloat in terms of making sure that so many families out there were not left in the lurch is an extraordinary achievement in itself. That, on top of the other factors I referred to, goes to the whole range of provision of centres across the country, the vacancy snapshots that we referred to - the basis, therefore, for the government's decision.Finally, on the affordability question, I believe it speaks for itself - a 30 per cent to 50 per cent increase in the childcare rebate up to a threshold of $7,500 per child per year, a significant pre-election commitment by this government which we have honoured in full because working families need access to affordable child care.</DOC>

 - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his enthusiasm as well. The House may be pleased to hear that today in classrooms around the nation more than a million children are sitting down to do the first day of the national tests - children in grades 3, 5, 7 and 9 right around the country starting today, the first day of national testing. Of course national testing continues today, tomorrow and the next day, and children will be tested in sequence on writing, on reading and on numeracy skills. This is important for the individual children involved because it will lead to them and their parents having an individual report card about how that child is going against the benchmarks of the nation and national standards. I understand - and indeed I have met with some schoolchildren today who sat the national test - that going to school and doing tests is not necessarily fun for kids. Some of the kids said the test was fun. A few of the kids said they were a little bit scared. But it is important that children sit these tests and get that report card for mum and dad.It is also important that their teachers end up with the information from what is a world-leading diagnostic tool. It is a world-leading diagnostic tool that enables their teachers to then work through what it is that can be done to best promote that child's individual learning in areas that the test has examined in that child's education. This information is vital for the next version of the My School website, which will be available by the end of the year.As members would know, and people listening would know, the Australian Education Union had at one point contemplated a boycott of the national tests. I am very pleased that the Australian Education Union did not pursue that boycott and the national tests are going ahead today without any threat of disruption. In terms of that threat of a boycott, can I assure members of the House that everything on the My School website will stay and it will be updated with the 2010 test information. We will also be adding additional information to My School including, importantly, the amount of funding going in per school, and we will be able to add value-added measures. Because we are now in the third year of national testing, we will be able to show the journey of children in the two years of learning since they were last tested.One would have thought that this was unambiguously a good news story that would be celebrated by all members of the House. But, of course, when we come to the question of education, there is always opposition from those across the chamber. In particular, let me direct the House's attention to the attitude of the member for Parkes. The member for Parkes, last month, said in the 
Daily Liberal:I whole-heartedly support any teacher that decides to take a stand against this discrimination by refusing to oversee the NAPLAN tests _And, even when the Australian Education Union backed away from their plan to boycott the national tests, the member for Parkes was on 2DU, Dubbo radio, on Friday last week, saying he was disappointed that the union had called off the ban. We know that the Liberal Party does not support transparency. Barry O'Farrell has already proved that for us in New South Wales. Now we have it as a matter of record that members opposite do not support transparency.This is a website that the shadow minister has referred to as a white elephant. Well, let me say very directly to members opposite: Australian parents believe you are wrong. This website has been visited by Australian parents in record numbers, recording over three million visitors. On this side of the House, we will get on with the job of delivering an education revolution, as parents want to see it after 12 long years of neglect. Over there they are opposed to My School, opposed to Building the Education Revolution, opposed to Computers in Schools, opposed to lifting teacher quality, opposed to literacy and numeracy, opposed to more money for disadvantaged schools - actually, opposed to everything parents want in this country for their children's education.</DOC>

 - I welcome the contribution to the debate today by the member for Cook. Just a few facts: the three years with the largest number of asylum seekers over the last 15 years were under the Howard government - 1999, 2000 and 2001. The highest number of boats in any one year arriving in Australia was under the Howard government, in 1999. The largest number of asylum seekers in one year was under the Howard government, in 2001. The single-largest vessel to arrive in Australia was under the Howard government, with 359 people. So let us just put all that into a bit of context.Secondly, what I would say in response to the member for Cook is as follows. He referred to asylum seekers who are in various processing centres on the mainland. He has been contributing to this debate in recent days. In fact, he was on 2GB - I presume - where he said the following:Now, it is not for the first time this has happened - He is referring to people being processed onshore and being accommodated temporarily in some form of hotel or motel accommodation. He said:I should be upfront with the people about this, Ray - I presume that is Ray Hadley - when there was that massive surge of arrivals that occurred back in 1999,2000 and 2001, we had to do that when we were in government for that very brief period of time.The problem is, as he knows, they kept doing it. It did not stop in 1999; it did not stop in 2000. It went on to 2001. And here are the facts: in 2004-05 - this is what the member for Cook neglected to tell Ray Hadley this morning - the Howard government budgeted $1.8 million for community and hotel based detention. That was in 2004-05. Then in 2004 the Howard government was spending approximately $80,000 a month to house two asylum seekers at the Arkaba Hotel in Adelaide. I hope it was a nice hotel! What the member for Cook neglected, I am sure, to tell 2GB this morning was that, in December 2006, under the Howard government there were something like 20 or 30 detainees living in private hotels and serviced apartments and 57 detainees living in residential housing. Hotels like the Comfort Asti Inn in Darwin, the Colonel in Brisbane -  - The reason I refer to these matters is that the member for Cook asked in his question about the number of asylum seekers being processed within Australia. That goes to a debate in which he has also been participating, which is how they are being accommodated. This morning on national radio he did not tell the truth. That is the bottom line: he fundamentally misled the Australian public. He said that this practice was only in emergency times, finishing in 2001. He has been found out today to be an absolute political fraud, because this practice was pursued under the Howard government in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. - The member for Cook will resume his seat. I am not persuaded at this stage by the member for Sturt's learned submission to me to change my mind. -  -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. To assist the House I will withdraw. The member for Cook just said in his remarks then, 'I told the truth.' Can I ask the House to form their own independent judgement of the following. This morning on radio he said: 'I should be upfront with people about that, Ray. When there was that massive surge of arrivals that occurred back in 1999, 2000 and 2001 we had to do that' - that is, accommodate people in hotels - 'when we were in government, for a brief period of time.' What we now know from the facts is that this practice continued extensively in 2004, 2005 2006 and 2007. I would submit to the House that on any reasonable person's reading this, in fact, was not a truthful statement.The reason I highlight this point in this debate on asylum seekers is that it goes to the heart of the truthfulness in which they engage in this debate around the country right now, which is entirely fear based - a debate around the country which is designed to instil fear and intimidation in the community.The member for Cook then left the chamber. - The reason I have dwelt on this matter for some time is that it goes to the core question of whether those opposite are being truthful in this debate on asylum seekers. What we had this morning was a deliberate attempt by the member for Cook to engage in this debate and not to extend to the Australian public the full benefit of the truth concerning their time in office.I noticed that the member for Berowra was just mentioned by you, Mr Speaker. The member for Berowra was, of course, immigration minister when this practice of accommodating asylum seekers onshore in hotel and motel accommodation occurred under him and under the member for Menzies - I am so advised - as well. Let us therefore reflect carefully on what this says about the truthfulness with which those opposite are engaging in the debate about asylum seekers. On this -  - If we are looking for a member with integrity on this question, we should look to the former member for Cook who said this morning:_ I certainly do not support the fear mongering that we see in those ads. I've spoken to my successor in Cook, Scott Morrison, and expressed my views to him.There stands an honourable Liberal, unlike those who sit opposite.</DOC>

 - I take this opportunity to thank the member for Moreton for his question. I also note that the member for Moreton's five-year-old son, Stan, has just started playing soccer, and we certainly hope that, if all goes to plan, little Stan might have the chance to play in the big league on home soil in days to come.I am really pleased to advise the House that we now find ourselves at crunch time in terms of Australia's efforts to host the 2018 or 2022 FIFA World Cup, with our bid being formalised this week. On Friday in Zurich, Australia will not only lodge the official World Cup bid book but also have the opportunity to provide our first presentation to the FIFA executive committee on the case for why Australia is the best place in the world to host this enormous sporting event.I can inform the House of another milestone in the bidding process, where just recently we have seen the successful completion of a memorandum of understanding between the Australian government, the AFL, Cricket Australia, the ARU, the NRL and the FFA in respect of this bid. This agreement covers a number of areas and includes costs associated with any code displacement, a guarantee for seasons continuity and an agreement to minimise the disruption to any other of our Australian codes.It has previously been noted internationally that one of the real strengths of the Australian bid has been the bipartisan political support and the support at the level of the Australian government as well as from our state and territory governments. But, on top of this, the completion of the MOU in the past week is a clear indication that this bid is also supported by a united sporting community. I would like to acknowledge the efforts and contributions of all those who were involved in the negotiations and thank the leaders of Australian sport for getting behind this important bid.Whilst now the very hard work begins, this is a pivotal time in the bid process, and it shows that a huge amount has already been achieved. The bid has been finalised, our pitch has been prepared, negotiations have been conducted between the state and territory governments, understandings have been reached with the major Australian sports and the case has been finalised for bringing the World Cup to Australia. I have noted the opposition's support, and I note the Leader of the Opposition once more in stating that we are very clearly saying to the international community that both sides of Australian politics are very much behind that.All this would not have been achieved if it were not for the hard work and determination of Frank Lowy and the FFA, the cooperation of other sports, commitments from our state and territory governments and also the dedicated efforts of people like Jeff Dixon and Ron Harvey, who have been assisting in negotiations. I take this opportunity to thank our tireless World Cup task force led by Richard Eccles, all of whom I commend to the House, because now we get to the business end of this: the lobbying and convincing the world that there is no better place than right here in Australia. We are absolutely in this to win it, and that is the message that Australia will send very clearly both when we present in Zurich on Friday and also constantly until the decision is made in December.Whilst on the topic of the bid, I would like to very quickly congratulate the boys who were named earlier today in the Socceroos team to play in South Africa in just a few weeks time. This, of course, is an enormous honour, and I know that we all wish them all very best for a strong preparation. I would like to reiterate to all sports lovers in Australia and the international football movement that Australia is very, very serious in this endeavour. We are in it to win it. We know that there is no better place on the planet to host major sporting events, and we will absolutely be going all out to convince the rest of the world of that.</DOC>

 - All honourable members would be familiar with the impact of drought. Many members would not be familiar with some of the impacts which happen following welcomed rain. Many of our farmers throughout Australia have been dealing with that in previous months. When I was given this job, one of my first visits was to the Plague Locust Commission at Broken Hill, where I was told that the locust problem was not so much of a problem because of the extent of drought that we had at the time but that, once rains came, it would provide a breeding ground and we could well find ourselves hit by a particularly severe plague of locusts throughout the agricultural areas along the east coast. That is precisely what happened.In March the Plague Locust Commission was involved in aerial spraying in an area around Tibooburra - some 200,000 hectares in all. Notwithstanding that fairly major effort, there was breeding to capacity in an area around Balranald which then followed the warm weather systems, through the Riverina and into South Australia and Victoria. We are looking at damage in the order of - and there are different estimates of this - $40 million. I want to acknowledge the members of parliament from each side of the House who have been in contact with me over the break to provide me with information as to what was happening on the ground and to make sure that their concerns were being fed back to the Plague Locust Commission and its work.For those not familiar, we are talking about something like a dark storm cloud hovering about four metres above a paddock that takes out absolutely everything. The challenge that we have had may well be nothing to the challenge that is ahead of us. The plague that we have seen has now largely left its eggs in the ground. You get a very brief window in the nymph stage when spraying can do something about the next infestation. It is expected that the nymph stage will arrive in late September to mid-October, precisely the time that many of these areas will be looking at harvest, and then we will be faced with very real problems if they do undergo spraying: what that means to the value of crops and whether the residue limits are hit.With that in mind, we are expecting to increase our funding by around 15 per cent at our end - that is, for the joint funding for the Plague Locust Commission. The first line of defence, when it comes to spraying at the nymph stage later this year, will be the farmers themselves, as is always the case. I would encourage any farmers to make contact with the Australian Plague Locust Commission on the toll-free number: 1800635962. While droughts, floods and fires always receive the most publicity, in terms of economic damage there is a very real risk to the harvest later this year as a result of the eggs already in the ground. I would encourage members of parliament to continue to be in touch with producers in their regions to try to make sure that the targeted effort required later this year takes place.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Let us go to the facts first. In this budget, spending as a share of GDP falls from 26.2 per cent of GDP in 2009-10 to 23.6 per cent of GDP in 2013-14. That is less than the average under the Howard government, of 24 per cent of GDP. That first point is a matter of fact. Secondly, I would draw the attention of those opposite to this: when they were pursuing expansionary fiscal policy, the economy itself was expanding. They were being pro-cyclical; they were fuelling the fires of inflation. As a result, we had 10 interest rate rises in a row. What is the hallmark of an economic conservative? Acting counter-cyclically. When you have a global economic crisis of the type which has come in, what you do is you support the economy. That is what we have done. That is why, in the course of the global financial crisis, the Australian economy has emerged with the fastest growth, the second lowest unemployment, the lowest debt and the lowest deficit, and is the only economy of the major advanced economies not to go into recession. The reason why is that this government stepped up to the plate and injected a national economic stimulus strategy. That is why, if you look around the world today, they constantly ask this question: how did Australia do it?This government is proud of the fact that we negotiated this economy through the worst global economic recession since the Great Depression. This government is proud of the fact that we kept unemployment down, to now 5.3 per cent. This government is proud of the fact that we defended hundreds and thousands of small businesses from going bust. This government is proud of the fact that it has engaged in the building of the biggest school modernisation program in the country's history. And this government is proud of the fact that, unique of  the major advanced economies, we kept this economy out of recession. This is a budget of responsible economic management, and I challenge those opposite to reflect on how the previous government fuelled the fires of inflation, with one pro-cyclical, pro-inflationary budget after another, particularly in pre-election years. We are proud of our economic record and determined to prosecute the case of long-term economic reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The numbers in the responsible budget that I handed down last night are the outcome of the efforts of all Australians to make our economy strong and to make our economy the envy of the developed world. Of course the credit for that goes to employers and to employees, who all came together at a very critical time for our economy. It is a budget which says to all Australians, let us turn the successes of the recent past into a stronger economy for working families. It is a budget that returns to surplus and pays down debt ahead of every other major advanced economy. The government will halve peak debt and will get the budget in the black in three years - three years early. This is part of the fastest positive turnaround in the fiscal position since the 1960s. How has this been done? It has been done by imposing a two per cent spending cap over the forward estimates, and it has also been done by offsetting all new spending - unlike those opposite, who went into the election year every time spending like drunken sailors.What we have done is impose on ourselves the discipline that we said we would impose on the budget last year when we took the responsible action to stimulate our economy to support small business and to support employment. So the policy successes of the past 18 months now mean that the Australian economy is recovering powerfully. The budget forecasts growth of 3¼ per cent in 2010-11 and four per cent in 2011-12 and, as the Prime Minister said before, an unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent, the envy of the developed world. If you look around the world you can see what an extraordinary effort that has been: employers and employees cooperating to make sure that breadwinners had a job, to make sure that they had a pay packet coming in to put food on the table, to make sure that small businesses had a pipeline of activity.That is what we did last year and, now the economy is recovering, what we need to do and are doing in this budget is putting in place a very strict fiscal discipline. Of course that strict fiscal discipline means that we can get on with our reform program. That means that we can put in place the biggest improvements to health and hospitals in over 30 years, something supported very strongly on this side of the House and certainly not understood by the Leader of the Opposition. It means we can invest in the skills of our workforce, that we can invest in infrastructure and that we can invest in renewable energy and clean energy and it means that we can boost savings through boosting superannuation. Of course it means that we can give a real boost to the small business sector. These are all important reforms for the future and they are all built on fiscal discipline, on financial discipline, so much so that this is what the rating agency Standard and Poor's had to say last night: this budget ensures Australia's public finances 'remain among the strongest of its peer group'. So this side of the House is proud of Australia's economic performance and we are very optimistic about the years ahead. This responsible budget puts in place the framework for strong growth and it means that we can turn the success during the global financial crisis into a stronger economy for working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Can I draw his attention to the fact that there have been a range of statements on the budget by a range of peak industry bodies. First of all, the Australian Industry Group refers to this budget as 'a credible budget'. -  - Those opposite seem to regard the peak body of Australian manufacturing as irrelevant to the national economic debate. Try this one. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia says that it provides 'certainty' for small businesses and that they can ill-afford more instability or change as they are recovering from the global financial crisis. Also, Standard and Poor's, which the Treasurer just referred to a minute ago, says:The deficits and additional borrowings do not alter the sound profile of Australia's public finances, which remain among the strongest of its peer group - in the world. Therefore when it comes to third-party commentary, and I do not go to the various other groups who have commented positively on initiatives in health, education and elsewhere, let us go to the core proposition advanced by the Leader of the Opposition concerning the resources superprofits tax. First of all I would say to the Leader of the Opposition he should study carefully the fact that that tax - in other words, one on profits - was in the first instance advanced by the Mining Industry Council to the Henry tax review. That is one point. The second is this. I will draw his attention to this fact: the petroleum resource rent tax was introduced some 25 years ago and introduced at a rate of 40 per cent. Can I say to those opposite that in the subsequent 25 years we have seen one huge expansion of the resource projects on the North West Shelf and beyond, including the biggest resource project we have ever seen, the Gorgon project. Thirdly, I would draw his attention to the fact that when we are dealing with a tax on profits it is in fact a better arrangement than a tax on volume, which is what royalties are about. The reason for it makes basic economic sense, namely that if you have got small to medium companies starting up they are sometimes excessively penalised by the volume that they extract from the ground, as opposed to a tax on profits which means that when the company later develops they in fact have a greater financial base to sustain that payment to the general revenue. That is why we had an underpinning economic logic to this proposed tax reform.Finally, I would say to the Leader of the Opposition this: if you look carefully at the modelling contained within Treasury's response to the analysis contained in the Henry report, namely the modelling of Econtech commissioned by the Treasury in relation to the impact of this tax arrangement on the mining sector overall and taking into account also the additional tax benefits for the exploration sector, it actually predicts a 5.5 per cent increase in the overall level of mining activity in the Australian economy. Therefore I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that I know these four sets of facts present a problem when it comes to his core rhetorical argument, but I would also conclude on this. The Australian people actually own these resources. The Australian people deserve a fair share from these resources. The Australian people deserve a fair share when it comes to their super. The Australian people deserve a fair share when it comes to reducing the tax on small business. The Australian people also deserve a fair share when it comes to the most profitable mining companies in Australia contributing more to the long-term infrastructure of our nation. Miners deserve a fair share. It is a great industry. The Australian people deserve a fair share because they own this resource and it is their entitlement to obtain a fair share for themselves and for their children and for the nation's future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, because it goes to what a budget is all about at the end of the day. It goes to what you are seeking to do for the future of the nation. The values which have driven this government in putting together this budget are: firstly, how do you bring about long-term sustainable economic growth through responsible economic management; secondly, how do you bring about a budget which delivers for all Australians a fair share of the natural wealth of our country; and, on top of that, how do you, through a budget, also make sure that we are investing in the future needs of our economy? These are the enduring and underlying values which have governed not just the budget brought down by the Treasurer last night but the three budgets that we have brought down so far in the history of this government.I say to those opposite: when it comes to building a surplus for the future, it is absolutely important to make sure that we are entrenching our long-term prosperity in strong economic management. It is entirely appropriate to underpin growth when we have a situation where the global economic recession was threatening the very survival of our economy. The challenge now is to ensure that we build the surplus for the future, and that is what this budget does. With responsible management, the government will halve peak debt and get the budget back into black in three years - three years earlier than we predicted last year. I congratulate both the Treasurer and the finance minister for their work in producing the analysis and the policy discipline underpinning the document.I also say to those opposite that what we have here is Australia returning to surplus faster than any other major advanced economy in the world. We will emerge from the global recession with less than one-tenth their average debt. Getting it right in terms of strong, long-term economic management is a core value for this government because it underpins what we can then do for working families, for all Australian families, for pensioners, for carers and for those who rely upon government to secure their future. Fairness for our country's future - and this was part and parcel of the question that was asked before by the Leader of the Opposition - is why in this budget we have produced further tax cuts for families. If you are on $50,000 a year, you are paying 18 per cent less tax than you did three years ago. The budget also rewards savings for families, with a 50 per cent tax cut on bank interest up to $1,000. It also simplifies tax returns for 6½ million Australians. It also increases superannuation for Australian workers. They deserve decent security in their retirement. On top of that, we are investing in the future of our health and hospital system. The development of the new 'A national health and hospitals network for Australia's future' is fundamental to the future security and health security of Australian people. This is a document of fundamental reform. There is $7.3 billion worth of investment contained within the budget in order to produce more doctors, more nurses and, of course, more hospital beds for the future. That is what we are doing in terms of fairness through this budget. Beyond that, it is not just about strong economic management; it is not just about delivering fairness for the future; it is also about how we secure our future against the long-term challenges that we face.Again, the Leader of the Opposition asked questions about tax. We have an obligation to make sure that the overall tax impost on Australian businesses remains globally competitive. That is why we are unapologetically bringing down the company rate for businesses large and small. It is why we are unapologetically bringing about tax breaks for small business. It is why we are unapologetically investing in the future of our infrastructure - road, rail and port. We are unapologetically investing in the future of our skills. We are unapologetically investing in the future of renewable energy in this country, because our country depends on those investments. As the Treasurer reminded us before, it is what we do for the future in bringing about strong economic management we believe in; what we do in bringing about a fairer Australia we believe in; securing Australia for the challenges of the future we believe to be our duty as the elected government of the country - and we are doing so on the basis of securing our international economic reputation and entrenching it for the future.This year our budget deficit is 2.9 per cent of GDP and coming to surplus in three years. The average of the major advanced economies is 9.5 per cent of GDP. Not one of them is forecast to come into surplus in the next three years. Our debt in 2015 will be 3.4 per cent of GDP. The average of the major advanced economies is 93.9 per cent of GDP in 2015. Our growth in 2010-11 is 3.25 per cent of GDP. The average of the major advanced economies is 2.4 per cent of GDP. Where the rubber really hits the road is on how we actually protected jobs. Unemployment is at 5.3 per cent here; the average of the major advanced economies is 8.4 per cent. In the United States, unemployment is nearly 10 per cent, and in many countries in Europe it is 10 per cent.These are the values which guide this budget. It is about securing our future; it is about fairness for the future. It is also about strong economic management. And it is about entrenching this country's international economic reputation, which now remains unparallel across the advanced economies of the world.</DOC>

 - I think the shadow Treasurer should give up karaoke and take up policy. Every set of budget papers, every budget, contains a sensitivity analysis. This is simply the case in the budget papers every year. The fact there is a sensitivity analysis that says, 'If this set of events happens it might have that impact,' does not in any way erode the credibility and the standing of the forecast in this budget. In no way at all does it do that. The forecasts in this budget across the board are cautious, they are credible and they are realistic.What did the opposition say last year when they were attacking the budget? They claimed our forecasts were too optimistic. They trashed the budget in this House and they trashed it around the country for being too optimistic, because the first refuge of a scoundrel is to trash the forecasts. The forecasts are prepared by the same Treasury that the opposition worked with for something like 12 years. It is the same Treasury that produced sensitivity analyses like that for 12 years. So these are forecasts of the Treasury which are credible and realistic. They are forecasts of the Treasury which match the forecasts of the Reserve Bank generally. They are forecasts which generally match the forecasts of the International Monetary Fund.But this year like last year, the opposition want people to come in here and somehow believe that there is something wrong with the forecasts, because they cannot get their act together when it comes to economic policy. They cannot tell us when they would bring the budget back to surplus. They cannot tell us what savings they would make in the budget. They cannot answer the most simple questions about an alternative macroeconomic framework because they simply do not have one.They have been coming into this parliament for years talking about the need for savings whilst they have been up in the Senate blocking the savings that are essential in our budget. They simply are not credible at all when it comes to economic policy, and their having no alternative framework means that they want to come in here and trash the Treasury, trash the Reserve Bank and trash the International Monetary Fund. There is simply no alternative framework among those opposite. They have so little credibility that nobody listens to them any more.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I also say how delighted I am to see Mary Easson in the chamber today, and I am sure I speak on behalf of many members in saying that. The government has put in place some very strict fiscal rules in order to ensure that we get the budget back in a strong position after the impact of the global financial crisis. The rules that we have put in place are these. First, we will not allow tax as a proportion of the total economy to go above the level we inherited from the former government. What has happened? The levels of tax as a proportion of the economy now and across the forward estimates are substantially lower than the level we inherited from the Howard government. Second, we will not allow spending growth to go beyond a two per cent real increase until such time as the budget returns to surplus. What has happened? We have adhered in this budget to that rule and we have extended it so that now that rule will continue to apply until such time as the budget surplus reaches one per cent of GDP.Third, when tax revenue recovers from the impact of the global financial crisis - and it has partly recovered - we will not spend that revenue but allow it to help drive the budget back into surplus early. What has happened? That is precisely what has occurred. Finally, new spending will be offset by saving. What has happened? Across the forward estimates period, the aggregate excess of saving above spending is $544 million - half a billion dollars. So all these rules have been adhered to, and one of them has not only been adhered to but been extended.The result is that we are back in surplus three years ahead of schedule in three years time and the level of debt Australia has will be half of what was initially projected. It will be 6.1 per cent of GDP, which is less than one-tenth of the average of developed world economies.I notice that the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, was on Insiders last weekend indicating that he would set the bar for the government about when we returned to surplus. He said that it would be reasonable to return to surplus within three or four years. Guess what, Mr Speaker: we have jumped over his bar, we have leaped over that bar, and got the budget heading towards surplus in three years.I take this opportunity to welcome the new shadow minister for finance, the member for Goldstein, to the podium. He is my fifth shadow minister for finance. I have had five. And who knows - there may be more. I am up against a basketball team. We have had five shadow finance ministers. I shared a platform with the new shadow finance minister last night on Lateline and this morning at the annual accountants breakfast. Do you know the interesting thing, Mr Speaker: in both of these contributions I do not recall the words 'debt and deficit' passing the lips of the shadow finance minister. Why? Because the infamous debt and deficit scare campaign is dead - stone dead. What has killed it? The budget is heading back to surplus three years ahead of schedule and debt is peaking at six per cent of GDP. The scare campaign of the opposition has been exposed for the giant fraud that it is.The opposition has a single political strategy. It is simple and it is straightforward. It is to block, blame and bluster. That is all that the Leader of the Opposition and his team are contributing to Australian politics. There is a lot of rhetoric, there is a lot of fluff and there is a lot of flim flam, but we are approaching the business end of the season where the Australian community is going to start asking for some detail. We have had virtually no detail from the Leader of the Opposition yet, but he has a big test on Thursday night and that is to come up with some detail and to come up with some specific costed savings - not just one-liners and colourful, glib grabs but some specific costed savings. - I return to the point I was making. The budget rules the government put in place put a real constraint on spending. They require governments and prospective governments to match spending with savings. We have had a sequence of dog-ate-my homework excuses about when we are going to get some serious savings and when we are going to get some explicit commitments about how the opposition is going to pay for all the promises it is putting forward, but thus far we have had very few commitments. By this stage in 2007, the then Leader of the Opposition, now the Prime Minister, had $3 billion worth of explicit savings commitments out there, virtually all of which have since been delivered.I have a couple of final tips for the Leader of the Opposition. Investments do not hit the bottom line and therefore cannot be used for spending. So, whether it is the Australian Rail Track Corporation equity investment -  - or the National Broadband Network, you cannot spend the proceeds by cancelling them. You might like to come up with a glib one-liner suggesting that you can, but you cannot spend the proceeds. My final suggestion is that, if you want to be treated seriously, you have got to have some costed, four-year, over the forward estimates savings in your budget reply to show where the money is coming from.</DOC>

 - I welcome the member for Curtin and Deputy Leader of the Opposition returning to the subject of China, because the last time she stood at the dispatch box to talk about China I think it was in defence of China's human rights record, or was it in defence of Chinese human rights activists? It depended on which day we were talking about. One day we were too hard; the next day we were too soft.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition refers to my engagement with the business community of Western Australia. Of course I spoke to them about the long-term challenges which we face in North-East Asia. I said that, therefore, broadening the economic base of Australia by making sure that the corporate tax rate was brought down across the country was a sensible course of action on the part of any reforming government. That means that, if you do face a rising Australian dollar which is affecting the international competitiveness of all companies which are exporting, one way this government can assist in enhancing their competitiveness is to bring down the company rate. That is what we have done.The second thing I would say in response to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is: when she looks at the question of the government's assumptions, based on Treasury advice, about the future trajectory of commodity prices, these fall at the conservative end of the spectrum based on what market analysts are saying. There are commentators out there in the marketplace who this morning have affirmed and affirmed again that this falls within the range of what most people analyse to be long-term demand for Australian commodities. In fact, the commodity price projections contained within the budget papers, I recall, also after a period of time come down, as you would expect in any rational analysis of where the price would go over a period of time. Therefore, the Treasury, in putting together this analysis, has been entirely mindful of where these prices will go over time.For example, I would draw her attention to the fact that the budget forecast when it comes to the terms of trade is up 14¼ per cent in 2010-11 and then down 3¾ per cent in 2011-12 and, for the medium term, there is a decline by 20 per cent over 15 years and a return to just under 2006-07 levels. This is the sort of discipline which the Treasury officials apply. The Treasury officials applied it in their provision of advice to the previous government. The only thing that has changed on this occasion is that that does not suit the political case being advanced by that lion of Chinese human rights, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member the Curtin.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question because I know on this side of the House people are delighted with the announcements from last night to invest more money in primary care, the front line of our health system. Whether it is more money for GPs, whether it is more money for infrastructure for general practice or whether it is more money for practice nurses, all of these initiatives are vital for making sure that constituents in our electorates can get the health care they need when they need it.One of the key initiatives from last night deals with the very fact that we know people do not get sick just between nine and five, Monday to Friday. People need care and access to nurses and doctors after hours. Unfortunately, what many of us might think is anecdotal when people come to our electorate offices and say, 'I can't get access to a GP,' or, 'My GP stopped opening late on work days,' or, 'My GP doesn't open on the weekends any longer,' is not anecdotal; this is real.What we know is that in the last decade, during the watch of the Leader of the Opposition as the health minister, the percentage of doctors providing their own after-hours services reduced from around 50 per cent to 28 per cent. So what we have committed, as part of a $2.2 billion investment into primary care, is the expansion of an online and phone service to be able to get immediate advice from a nurse, follow-up advice from a GP and referral through our Medicare Locals to a local GP if someone who rings the service needs to have a GP visit. - I hear an interjection opposite: what if we don't have one? This is the whole point. This is actually why we are investing millions and millions of dollars in training more GPs, because your leader, when he was the health minister, put a cap on GP training places. That is why we are investing in funding for more than 5,500 new GPs, because electorates like those of the member interjecting do not have enough GPs. He perhaps might ask the Leader of the Opposition why he neglected this issue for so long and left it for us to pick up the pieces.Of course, those opposite might say, 'What happens if we don't have a GP in our electorate right now?' That means that the constituents - the mums and dads who are worried about a child with a temperature or someone who perhaps does not drive who gets sick at night - will be able to phone up and get advice from a nurse and a GP immediately. Those opposite might be dismissive of this, but anyone who has young children knows that having someone on the end of the line to give them a bit of quick advice - to tell them that it does sound serious and they should go to hospital or that they need not worry and a bit of Panadol might work - is important. These issues are day-to-day issues for our constituents and for all Australians, and those opposite neglected these issues.What has also been a very significant investment is another $355 million into infrastructure for GP services - more GP superclinics and of course 400 general practices that will be able to expand their own services. I thought that perhaps I might take the opportunity to ask members on the shadow frontbench, as we are progressively opening these superclinics across the country, whether they might have more guts to turn up and represent their electorates than the shadow minister for health did! - I would like to emphasise that on Monday -  - The member for Dickson is appropriately sensitive about this issue because he has a superclinic operating in his electorate that has provided thousands of services to young families who are in his electorate and otherwise have to travel to hospital for services on weekends. But on Monday I am going to Port Stephens to open a superclinic -  - and I thought perhaps the local member, who has been very supportive in his electorate, would like to attend. - I am issuing it to you right now. I would be delighted if you would come. - I cannot let the opportunity pass because I know that the member for Petrie would not forgive me. On Friday we turned the first sod for the Redcliffe superclinic at the hospital site in her electorate. It was covered on the Redcliffe and Bayside Herald front page with, 'Super boost for GPs: $5 million clinic to ease the strain on hospitals'. What the local community in Redcliffe told us is this will be the first time ever that GPs will be trained in the electorate of Petrie - the first time ever. Twenty medical trainees going through this superclinic, year after year, making sure that the shortages in the region will be able to be met. This is fundamentally good news and I am sure that those communities are very happy with the timetabling of this GP superclinic.Finally, I would like to make mention of the fact that today is International Nurses Day, and the nurses who work very hard across our country should be congratulated for the hard work that they do. I know that many nurses were very excited about the investments in the budget last night, probably most importantly the $390 million for better supporting practice nurses. These are nurses who work with our doctors in general practice to provide extra services, particularly for chronic disease and prevention. This investment will allow up to 3.8 million additional GP services to be provided because of the time that is freed up while nurses provide important care to members of our community.I would also like to encourage members of this House - I know the member for Lyons and a number of others have already put in their requests for new GP superclinics. And I am sure that, like the member for Parkes and the former leader of the National Party, John Anderson, who made pretty fast tracks to our doors to ask for a superclinic in Gunnedah, we will have backbenchers and others arguing for these investments to be made in their electorates. We will welcome those requests, we will take each of them seriously and we look forward to providing more support for members of the community who need access to GP and nursing care.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question, and I do not think he was listening to the answer I gave to an earlier question about the Treasury's assumptions about the change in commodities prices over the short, medium and long term. This, by the way, is the same Treasury which provided advice on future courses for commodity prices for the previous government.The other part of his question goes to the underpinning assumptions for the budget itself. This has been the subject of some interesting discussion today, as the member for North Sydney would be well aware. On the underpinning assumptions of the budget 12 months ago, in May 2009, the member for North Sydney had this to say:The Treasury has some pretty heroic assumptions in their forecasts of how quickly we come out of recession. - That was 12 months ago. What did he say today?Last year the Treasury was immensely pessimistic about the budget. - Joe, Joe, Joe. How sloppy can you get? -  - You cannot on the one hand last year say that they were monstrously optimistic and then this year say that last year they were monstrously pessimistic. It does not add up. It is a bit like what the member for North Sydney had to say when he set us that benchmark to meet for the budget the other day. When asked on Insiders what is the benchmark the government must meet, he said:Well they could do it if they tried - that is, bring the budget into surplus - in three to four years.Joe, we are doing it in three. - We actually got to the inner margin of what you set as the benchmark. Can I just say that, in this entire debate about economic credibility, assumptions and the budget, what we see is a federal opposition which is the least economically literate federal opposition we have seen for decades. On the Liberal Party, we also have some interesting comments about the level of literacy and the question of financial conservatism. My attention was drawn to a comment recently, contained in the Sydney Morning Herald, which refers to the economic literacy of the Leader of the Opposition. This is what was said in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 10 April -  -  - I draw my answer to a conclusion. The comment which is contained in the herald reads:When he lost a fight with Peter Costello in the expenditure review committee over some expensive proposal or other he'd go straight into John Howard's office to try to get the decision overturned _ He never really understood the meaning of fiscal conservatism _ - Resources have been around for a long time, both when the previous government was in as well as under this government. The point that I am making is that, when it comes to responsible economic management, we have relied upon the same Treasury advice as Peter Costello relied upon. We are relying on the same Treasury advice, which is to serve independently the governments of both political persuasions, and we have acted professionally based on that advice concerning future assumptions for commodity prices. But, as a former long-term cabinet colleague of the Leader of the Opposition said, he never really understood the meaning of the term fiscal conservatism.</DOC>

 - I am certainly a member of the member for Leichhardt's fan club and I thank him for this important question. Of course, the member for Leichhardt knows, and I have spoken to him on many occasions, about the need for investment in skills in this country, and last night's budget contains an important skills package. Today I want to highlight just one part of this important skills package. It is the right time to be generating even more investment in skills, as the budget papers show we are moving towards a full employment environment. In this environment, we want to make sure that young people get a start in life, that they get a trade - an opportunity for a start in life.Last time our country went through an economic downturn, apprenticeship commencements went through the floor. The really bad news is that, after they went through the floor, it took 14 years for commencements to recover - so sharply down and 14 years to recover. As a result of the global recession, apprenticeships were threatened once again. As a government, we became very concerned as we saw signs, in the 12 months following September 2008, like apprentice and trainee commencements falling by 20 per cent - worrying signs for all.We could have stood back and done nothing in these circumstances, but, just as we took quick and decisive action to support jobs, we took quick and decisive action to support apprenticeships. This included in October 2009 our $100 million Apprentice Kickstart program, designed to reverse the decline in traditional trade commencements, aimed squarely at young Australians leaving school and provided over the summer months. We also invested in a $145 million package to secure Australian apprenticeships for those apprentices who had become out of trade because of the economic circumstances their employer was facing and needed a new opportunity in order to complete their apprenticeship. The great news is that, taken together, these measures have assisted more than 40,000 businesses in national skill shortage areas, enabled more than 49,000 apprentices to remain in work or complete their training and ensured that around 24,400 young apprentices started in the trades over the summer. That is great news.As a result of last night's budget, today we are opening the second phase of Apprentice Kickstart. Today, employers can put on a young person and get special new incentives for doing so. The incentives for putting on that young person have more than tripled. We expect this phase of Apprentice Kickstart over the next six months to support 22,500 commencements. We are focusing this initiative on small- and medium-sized businesses, businesses with fewer than 200 employees. Once again, our target is young Australians aged 19 years and under in the key areas of construction, automotive, mechanical engineering, hospitality and electrotechnology. These are real opportunities for young people, available from today.Today, together with the member for Eden-Monaro and my ministerial colleague Senator Mark Arbib, I went to Country Energy and I met with a young apprentice called Thomas Watson. I met with his supervisor, who started life as an apprentice, a man called John Bruce, and I met with the overall boss, a man who also started his life as an apprentice, Phillip Green. This proves that getting a trade gives you employment support for life. It is the doorway to great opportunities. We have acted decisively to save jobs. We have acted decisively to save skills. Today I ask Australian employers to get in and take advantage of this program and give a young Australian a fantastic start in life through a trade apprenticeship.</DOC>

 - No, I do not endorse that statement at all. Our ambition for economic growth in this country is for all our industries and for a very strong mining and mineral-producing industry. In fact, if you look at the material we published last Sunday week, we talked about how we as a country will deal with the two-speed economy that comes from mining boom mark 2. We talked a lot about the mistakes made by those opposite in mining boom mark 1. They failed to put in place the necessary investments in the capacity-producing stuff. They failed to put in place the essential investment in infrastructure and left this country with a very serious infrastructure deficit which has put upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates. That was the legacy that they left to us as we came to power at the end of 2007. This government is determined to put in place an economic framework which will cope with mining boom mark 2. At the moment, we have had the tail end of the global recession on the one hand and a mining boom coming on the other, off the back of very strong growth in this region - not just Chinese growth, not just Indian growth but growth right across the region.The one thing that sensible people who study these things know is that a greater percentage of global growth is going to come from the Asia-Pacific as we move forward. It is not going to come from Europe, and we have seen evidence of that. The United States is recovering, but what the global economy is waiting for and relying on is greater growth in this region, and that is a great thing for Australia. What it means for Australia is that if we get the domestic settings right we can maximise the prosperity that flows from that and we can spread the opportunities around to ensure that all of our economy grows - not just some parts growing very strongly but all of our economy growing. This is why the Prime Minister talked before about using the revenue from the Resource Super Profits Tax to cut the corporate rate, to do something for small businesses so that we grow together.So we have an ambition for a very strong mining industry in this country - a fair system of taxation that returns fair value to the Australian people for their resources, not the resources of the mining companies. We have put forward a perfectly reasonable proposition. We are discussing that with the mining industry. We will work our way through those issues. The sorts of statements that are being made by some opposite and some of the industry were made when this matter was raised in the late 1980s. The whole roof of the economy was going to fall in, but it did not. The biggest single project approved in this country's history was the Gorgon project approved at the end of last year - a $50 billion project approved under a resource profits tax. We on this side of the House will defend the national interest. Our national interest is to make sure that we grow our economy sustainably to make sure that the Australian people get a fair share of their resources and to make sure that we grow together, and that is what we are doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie very much for her question, because this is a government that delivers for working families. Earlier today I introduced legislation into the parliament for Australia's first paid parental leave scheme, a milestone reform and a major win for parents and their babies - and our scheme is fair to business. The Leader of the Opposition, by contrast, wants to impose a great big new tax on business to pay for his paid parental leave scheme. This government's Paid Parental Leave scheme is economically responsible and was funded in last year's budget. Australian families have had to wait far too long for a national paid parental leave scheme, after 12 years of inaction from those opposite. It is this government that is going to deliver Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme.Last night's budget builds on this major reform for Australian families. Another round of tax cuts will help Australian working families. A worker on $50,000 per year will be $1,750 better off as a result of three rounds of tax cuts. And a new standard deduction for work related expenses will make tax time that much simpler for six million families. The standard deduction will be $500 in 2012-13 and $1,000 in 2013-14. The standard deduction will reduce a family's taxable income. As taxable income reduces, family payments increase. This will see around 280,000 families receiving on average around $250 more per year in family tax benefit part A in addition to the benefit that they receive from the standard deduction. This will be a double win for Australian families. It will also see around 15,000 additional families become eligible for family tax benefit part A for the first time as a result of having a lower taxable income.Families will also be able to claim a tax deduction equal to 50 per cent of interest earned on $1,000 in deposits. These are deposits in approved banks, building societies and credit unions. This will lower the taxable incomes and taxes of an estimated 5.7 million depositors, three-quarters of whom have incomes of less than $80,000 a year. Around 200,000 families paying less tax on their deposit interest will have reduced taxable income, and these families will receive around $85 more in family tax benefit part A each year. This is a government that continues to deliver for Australian working families through paid parental leave that will support parents and their children and through a fiscally responsible budget that will see more families benefit from family payments.</DOC>

 - Very sloppy again, Joe. - In fact, all of the initiatives we have announced that are dependent on that do add up to the revenue over the forward estimates, so I do not know what figures you are reading. But one thing I do know is that we are not doing in this budget what those opposite always did in election year budgets. I have done a bit of research about spending and what has happened in previous budgets. Between the Liberal Party's 2006 budget and their 2007 election year budget, they committed almost $90 billion in new policy. Think about that: $90 billion between their 2006 budget and their 2007 election year budget. - I certainly am. It was a question about spending. Between the Liberal Party's 2006 budget and their 2007 election year budget they committed an extra $90 billion. What have we done between the last budget and this one in terms of extra spending? We have offset the lot - game, set and match.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for his question. On behalf of the Australian community last year I had the privilege of being one of the signatories witnessing the biggest ever investment in Australia's history in a single project, the Gorgon LNG project, which is now bringing benefits to many businesses in Australia and opportunities for employment and training to thousands of Australians. That investment decision proved that taking on a fight 25 years ago, in terms of putting in place a tax regime for the petroleum industry, meant that we actually got the balance right. It is in that context I can say that no-one can deny that the resources sector is a key part of Australia's future. The current debate is about getting the balance right. The difference between the government and the opposition is that we actually believe the Australian community at the moment is not getting a fair share with respect to its return on the development of its national resources from a non-renewable sector point of view. I simply say that the government is absolutely committed to ongoing engagement for the resources sector for the purposes of getting the balance which not only means we continue to attract investment but also guarantees that the Australian community gets a fair return for the development of its resources that can also be used to invest in our future, invest in company tax cuts, invest in infrastructure and invest in skills, to name a few opportunities.Let us go to some of the scare campaigns at the moment with respect to the supposed impact on the Australian economy of what the government has announced to date. I start by going to the Treasury's independent modelling by KPMG Econtech - I might say, the preferred economic modeller of the previous government. Let us deal with a few facts with respect to their modelling. I go to that modelling which says that cutting the company tax rate to 28 per cent and introducing the resources superprofits tax, combined with the removal of the impact of royalties, would actually expand mining output by 6.6 per cent in the long run. It also goes on to say:All other industries are expected to expand by 0.3 per cent in the long run.The report further says that the combined effect of introducing the resources superprofits tax and cutting the company tax rate by 2 percentage points will add 0.7 per cent to Australia's GDP over the next five to 10 years. That independent modelling clearly indicates that this reform will strengthen the Australian economy as a whole.That is no different, I might say, to the history of the petroleum resource rent tax, which tells the same story: the industry has flourished as a result of the tough tax debate we took on 25 years ago. I appreciate that, from the government's point of view, this is going to be a long, tough tax debate. That is because our government is absolutely committed to getting the balance right - not only ensuring appropriate investment for Australia that creates jobs and prosperity but also correctly ensuring, unlike the opposition leader, who finds economics boring, and actually guaranteeing the Australian community a fair return for the development of its resources.We as a government stand in support of the Australian community's right for a fair return for the development of their resources. The opposition, unlike the Western Australian Premier, currently believes that the resources sector should not pay higher tax for the opportunity to develop our resources. I am pleased to say this government stands in support of the Australian community in ensuring they get a fair return for the development of their resources. The opposition leader should hang his head in shame. He is more concerned about corporate donations than the proper return on the development of Australia's resources. - Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyne for his question. He is right that I had the opportunity to visit the Port Macquarie Base Hospital, in his electorate, on two occasions - first to speak with his local health experts on the needs of their particular hospital. It is a growth region; there are a huge number of people moving there. But it was one of those things that have been left behind in longterm planning. That is not the particular fault of one side of politics or the other in the New South Wales government, but it frankly has not kept pace with the longterm needs of that growth region.One of the things I was also able to do when I visited the honourable member's electorate was to announce an allocation of $5 million or thereabouts for, I think, a second linear accelerator, in the Port Macquarie Base Hospital. This doubles the cancer treatment services available to his constituents, given what is currently there. Of course, there is more to be done. That is part and parcel of a much wider program of regional integrated cancer care centres, announced by the Minister for Health and Ageing a month or so ago, which went to some 22 different locations across the country. In fact, Bunbury, in Western Australia, was one of the recipients; Tamworth, I seem to recall, was another recipient; along with other areas right across the country, to improve cancer services in regional areas. - I note the interjection from the Leader of the National Party that it did not go to his electorate. This is a $560 million investment which went nationwide, to seats where this government has no representatives and is unlikely to obtain representatives in the future. It was based on a needs analysis in the health department. If you look at places like Bunbury, if you look at places like Tamworth, if you look at places we have located these regional cancer care centres, you see that these are important centres for the Australian population - and the one core value at work is that people in non-metro Australia should have access to decent cancer care. The overwhelming feedback from them is: why should we have to travel to our capital cities when we get diagnosed with one form of cancer or another? It is bad enough getting a cancer diagnosis. Having to rip up your family, go to the capital city for weeks, sometimes months, on end, to get even basic diagnostics or cancer treatment, is one of the reasons many people do not bother. Do you know what the terrible statistic is? And I say this to the Leader of the National Party: if you live in non-metro Australia, in regional and remote Australia, you are three times more likely to die within the first five years of your diagnosis of cancer than if you live in one of our capital cities. That is unjust. It is wrong. That is why the Minister for Health and Ageing announced a $560 million investment right across the country.The first of the three points contained in the honourable member's question went to the input into the definition of local hospital authority boundaries. That is an important matter when it comes to the proper allocation of resources to, for example, the Port Macquarie Base Hospital. I have been on the record already as saying that the area in which this hospital is currently located is too big. In our discussions with the New South Wales government they have concurred that these current areas are far too large to be sensitive to local health needs. That is why a fundamental reform will occur. When it comes to Port Macquarie Base Hospital, therefore, it is critical that the needs of that region become central to the local health authority which is constructed in that area. We will be reflecting that view to our friends in the New South Wales government when those delineation questions occur.The second point he raised was about growth funding. It is a growth region. The reason we have introduced activity based funding is to make sure that the money flows to those hospitals which are actually delivering the services. When I spoke to his local health professionals up there they welcomed activity based funding because, rather than just being given an administrative grant once a year - they are out there working hard delivering a large number of elective surgery procedures and treating a whole lot of patients - the money will flow after the number of services they deliver. Therefore, the overall allocation of resources to that hospital would go up. Therefore, introducing activity based funding for the first time in New South Wales - and for the first time in every state except Victoria - will assist hospitals such as his at Port Macquarie get a proper investment of funds consistent with the delivery of services in those hospitals.The third point is about immediate investment. I draw the honourable member's attention to the $7.2 billion additional investment outlined in the Treasurer's statement last night. This is investment in more hospital beds, more doctors and more nurses and the enhancement of elective surgery procedures and accident and emergency. In his particular hospital, noting the shortage of beds which exists, I am very mindful of the fact that New South Wales would have received an allocation of approximately, I think, one third of the 1,300 sub-acute beds which are fully funded in the budget. I would therefore strongly suggest to the honourable member that he make his representations very clearly known about the need for additional beds in his area, because I have spoken to his local health professionals and they know that their hospital - Port Macquarie Base Hospital - is at its limit.The last thing I would say in response to the honourable member's question is to do with a point referred to before by the Minister for Health and Ageing. It goes to the other arm of healthcare reform - that is, the reform of primary care. The health minister last night, to the derision of those opposite, announced details for the large-scale expansion of not just investments in GP superclinics but further investments in GP practices. Also, if you look carefully at the statement which has been put out on nurses you will see that we provide further investments into GPs and their local clinics to make it more financially possible for them to engage practice nurses in those clinics.These are really important reforms for delivering GP related services on the ground. Again, the honourable member, I am sure, in consultation with his local GPs, will make a submission to the government - the health department - to make sure that proper funding flows on the basis of needs analysis across the country for the enhancement of GPs and GP related services, and we welcome his expression of interest in it. In fact, I would say to all members opposite: if you are facing problems and challenges in your electorates when it comes to GP services, you should take seriously what the Minister for Health and Ageing has put forward and get your submissions in from your local GPs so that we can enhance and roll out a much more flexible delivery of health care services for the entire Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and his ongoing interest in these issues. Indeed, last night's budget delivered another $1 billion injection into the Australian Rail Track Corporation. That lifts our contribution to some $3.4 billion over six years - twice as much funding as was given for the national rail freight system by the previous government in half the time. Twice the funding in half the time! This will support some 1,500 jobs in regional Australia. We are fixing the rail lines between Maitland and the Queensland border - some 58 separate projects towards the border; in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales; between Whyalla and Broken Hill and between Broken Hill and Parks; between Albury, down through Melbourne to Geelong; and between Gheringhap and Maroona and between Koolyanobbing and Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. We are straightening the rail lines, we are building new passing loops and we are ripping out the old wooden sleepers -  - and replacing them with new concrete sleepers. Stick to trying to add up, Joe.We are doing all of this in order to raise productivity, support jobs and ensure a national return. This is an investment. This will lead to higher productivity and a higher return to the Australian Rail Track Corporation over a period of time. It is good for jobs and good for the economy, particularly in regional Australia. This brings our nation-building investment in rail, roads and ports to some $37 billion. We have now more than quadrupled the investment in rail and more than doubled the investment in roads over a similar period of time. And we have done all this within the budget and fiscal framework of ensuring that we return to surplus in just three years.</DOC>

 - As I have outlined to the House earlier today, we have put in place a very strict fiscal discipline. And we are adhering to the strict fiscal discipline. We have made cuts - some of them have been painful - and we have restrained spending right across the forward estimates. Not only that, but, as the finance minister was saying before, we intend to do that and extend that out until the budget comes back to one percentage point of GDP.We are doing something that those opposite were utterly incapable of doing, particularly at the height of a boom. We have a strict fiscal discipline in place, which has brought this budget back to surplus in three years - and three years early. And we have halved debt. We have put forward a credible plan. It is so ironic for those opposite to ask a question like that. When are they going to bring the budget back to surplus? Can they answer that question? We look forward to Thursday night for a few answers from those opposite.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank my friend and colleague the member for Braddon for his question and for his continued commitment to small business, the backbone of northern Tasmania. The Rudd government supported small business through the global recession, the deepest global recession in 75 years. We did that through the economic stimulus package, including the small business tax break. Now we want to support small business through the recovery phase and that is what we are determined to do. From 1 July 2012 every small business in this country would get the ability to write-off the value of any asset up to $5,000 instantly - not spread over time, but instantly, in the year in which they buy it. That is a very good initiative for every small business in this country.I refer to a statement made by the Leader of the Opposition when he announced that they would oppose these small business tax breaks by denying the funding that would be used to fund those small business tax breaks. The opposition leader said that only incorporated small businesses, only companies, would benefit from the tax initiatives that have been announced. That is completely untrue. Sole traders, partnerships and companies all would benefit from the ability to write-off assets to the value of $5,000 each. In addition to that, the government would provide a head-start reduction in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent for all incorporated small businesses - that is, 720,000 incorporated small businesses. So 2.4 million out of 2.4 million would get the instant write-off; 720,000 would get this small business tax reduction head start.I was asked about reaction to it. Reaction, I am pleased to report, has been very favourable indeed. The Council of Small Business of Australia said:The new tax measures are set to help improve small business cash flow, support increases in production and productivity and promote innovation and entrepreneurial activity.That is good. That is terrific. Even just yesterday, the Australian Newsagents Federation issued a warning that said:The Australian Newsagents' Federation (ANF) is concerned that small businesses may lose the urgently needed tax relief that has been recently announced by the Federal Government.How would they lose that initiative, that tax relief? They would lose it at the hands of the opposition leader. The opposition leader has said that he will try to use the coalition's numbers in the Senate to block the passage of the Resource Super Profits Tax, which is financing these small business tax breaks. What has the opposition leader got against small business? He does not care about small business because it is the revenue source. Let us find a little bit more about reactions to this tax initiative and the stance of the opposition leader on it. When he made his headland speech very recently on 30 March he said this:The economic stimulus wasn't necessary to strengthen Australia's economy at a time of global recession.He is saying that economic stimulus was not necessary. We know their position on the economic stimulus that supported small business. They are opposed to it. They voted against it and they remain opposed to economic stimulus. He said that if you look across the Tasman New Zealand has done just as well as Australia. New Zealand had five quarters of negative growth. New Zealand went into recession. The opposition leader says, 'If it is good for New Zealand it is good for Australia.' This is a man who has cultivated this ironman image. He has an iron fist in the face of small business. He has an iron fist in the face of working Australians and says: 'Here's a bit of discipline for you, pal. Here's one up the bracket. We'll show you a little bit of discipline. We'll make you hurt. We'll make you work harder.' That is the attitude of the opposition leader, because he is extreme, he is erratic, he is risky and he is dangerous. He is an extreme, erratic, risky, dangerous opposition leader and he would be an extreme, erratic, risky and dangerous Prime Minister. He betrayed small businesses and the Australian people during the global economic recession and he wants to betray small business and the Australian people during the recovery. The Rudd government is the best friend that small business has ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. The government does believe it is important to provide assistance and support to Australians who are saving for the future. As the Treasurer announced last night, the government is improving the taxation treatment of savings by Australians by cutting the tax rate on their savings by 50 per cent for the first $1,000 of savings. Almost 5.7 million Australian taxpayers will benefit from this measure, and around one-third of the beneficiaries will have incomes below $37,000. Importantly, about 3.3 million Australians will have all of their interest income below the $1,000 cap, therefore receiving the full discount.For too long interest on deposits and other mechanisms has been unfavourably treated compared to capital gains, which are already concessionally taxed. Those capital gains are often out of reach of low- and middle-income earners. This is a very important measure in improving the equity of our tax system. For a taxpayer with a taxable income of around $50,000, the measure will reduce their annual tax liability by up to $177.50. If they reinvest this benefit into their savings account, after five years they will have almost an extra $1,000 in savings.This measure, announced last night, is a very important complement to the superannuation measures announced by the government on 2 May and also contained in last night's budget. These measures boost superannuation not only by increasing the superannuation guarantee but also by giving the contributions tax back to low-income earners and allowing people who are over 50 with low balances in their superannuation accounts to top them up at a concessional tax rate. These are all measures funded by the resource rent superprofits tax, as is the tax concession on savings more generally. They are all measures that the Liberal Party would deny Australians; all measures that the Liberal Party would try and stop Australians having the benefit of. We know that the Leader of the Opposition does not support Australians saving for the future. We know he does not support the increase in the superannuation guarantee, and we also know he does not support tax concessions for superannuation. This is what he had to say in his book, Battlelines:At some point, saving money by keeping people off the pension while forgoing revenue to encourage them to make alternative provision becomes counter-productive.He says:It could be simpler and fairer for the revenue provided in superannuation concessions to be paid as a pension instead.So the Leader of the Opposition would wipe out the tax concessions on the savings of millions of Australians. He would wipe out the tax concessions of people nearing retirement so he could fund the abolition of the age pension means test. The Leader of the Opposition and the shadow treasurer, in what we have seen today, have engaged in what has to go down as the weakest response to a federal budget in living memory; the weakest and most pathetic response we have seen in this House on the day after a budget for a long, long time. What we see from the Leader of the Opposition is a plan to cut a swathe through the retirement incomes of Australians, and oppose this government's measures to improve incentives for Australians to save. The Leader of the Opposition said this morning on AM:Everyone will know where we stand. They'll also know what we're against _Well, they are against Australians saving more. We know that. We know they are against superannuation. We know they are against somebody who is aged 30 now on average weekly earnings having $108,000 more in their retirement income. We know this risky and erratic man wants to cut a swathe through the retirement incomes of Australians and oppose incentives for hardworking Australians to look after themselves and save more.</DOC>

 - Together with the Treasurer, I come from the great state of Queensland, and we are strongly supportive of the mining industry and its future. I am also advised that Dr Henry has rejected the reports of his comments and believes that the resource superprofits tax will grow the mining sector and the economy. I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that if he looked at the independent modelling provided by the Treasury on the impact of the tax measures that we have proposed he would see that they in fact result in an increase in overall activity in the mining sector. I draw his attention to the impact which the petroleum resource and rent tax has had on offshore investment in Australia in the 25 years since it was introduced. I would further draw his attention to the fact that by bringing in the new taxation concessionary treatment for the exploration industry, along with the impact on smaller miners of taxing profits not volumes, the overall activity in the sector will increase rather than decrease.The fundamental challenges of economic reform for Australia are boosting the competitiveness globally of our economy for the long term, making sure that we are boosting the competitiveness of our businesses and their tax rates - the same for our small businesses - and the various other reforms that will be funded by a resource superprofits tax.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is indeed committed to making major economic reforms to make the economy stronger and to build a fairer future for all Australians. As I travel round the country, what families want is an ability to work harder, save more and give greater opportunities to their kids. On top of that, they want something to look forward to for their retirement. The No. 1 priority which delivers on the above is to make sure that we are building the foundations of a strong economy. The government, through the budget and in actions taken earlier, is doing this in three specific ways. Firstly, we took strong and decisive action to keep Australia from falling into recession during the global financial crisis. Secondly, we took strong action in the budget to bring the budget back to surplus three years early and to bring it back to surplus before any other major advanced economy in the world. Thirdly, we have built a program of reform to set up Australia for the future.On the question of reform, we must ensure that we are building strong foundations for the future. The Leader of the Opposition just made reference to the Secretary of the Treasury. In his tax review, the Secretary of the Treasury told the Australian people that we face a challenge in terms of the long-term competitiveness of our companies. That goes to the decision that we have taken in response: ensuring that we bring the company tax rate down. In the past, under the previous government we saw the rate remain static, with Australia among the least competitive nations across the OECD. Now it will fall in the centre ground of the OECD.The Secretary of the Treasury also told us that Australia needed to boost its national savings. In response to that, we have done two things. Firstly, we are cutting the tax on bank savings. Secondly, we are also boosting superannuation for all Australians for decades and decades ahead, lifting the overall pool of national savings. We are also investing in our nation's future infrastructure, not just through the $22 billion package contained in the statements made by the infrastructure minister on budget day but through building a further $5.6 billion fund over time to build roads, rails and ports and provide the future foundation stones for long-term economic growth.Twenty-five years ago, when the Hawke Labor government introduced the petroleum resource rent tax, the Australian people and the Australian economy got behind that major reform because it was able to facilitate long-term and decent stability in the taxation system for our offshore resources. Most critically, it provided a fairer share for all Australians. That is what we seek to do with the resources superprofits tax.Again I go back to the recommendations of the Secretary of the Treasury. He has recommended that what we need to do is to reform the way in which our resources onshore are taxed. He said that we need to replace the patchwork of existing royalties right across the states with a better system. He said that we need to have a system which does better than royalties, which are based on volumes not profits. That means that less profitable mines pay as much in royalties as more profitable mines at present. Furthermore, royalties discourage the development of minerals deposits with larger extraction costs. This is the reason why within the industry we have had such a strong level of support for changing the overall regime. Furthermore, royalties are not flexible enough to adequately share the benefits of the boom. Royalties are based on volumes not profits, and they have not been keeping pace with the mining boom. Bear this in mind: royalties have gone from taking $1 in $3 in mining profits 10 years ago to taking $1 in $7 in mining profits today.Furthermore, the resources superprofit tax is a better way to share the profits of Australia's natural resources with all Australians. That is why we, the government, are embarked upon this fundamental reform - because this will enable major infrastructure projects to proceed. It will enable, on top of that, a way to fund the superannuation earnings of Australian workers; a way to fund the future tax cuts for all Australian companies, including small businesses; a way to fund the changes that take place when it comes to taxation simplification proposals for 6.5 million Australians; and a way to fund the new taxation treatment of Australian bank deposits.This is about not just delivering a reform to the mining industry which independent modelling demonstrates will boost activity, but building a fairer Australia for the future. This reform is good for the economy. This reform is good for the mining industry. It is also good for building the foundations of a fairer Australia for the future, because this government and this party in government believes in building a strong Australia, a secure Australia, a fair Australia - an Australia which will provide a proper future for our children.</DOC>

 - I welcome each and every question from the opposition on the question of climate change, because the Deputy Leader of the Opposition just stood up and addressed the parliament and asked this on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition, who has this as his core belief on climate change: that climate change is absolute crap. That is his view: that climate change is absolute crap, to which he has now added the proposition that, in fact, when you look at the history of climate change, the world was hotter in Jesus' time.Can I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, as she asks this question on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition, she also does so on behalf of a party which is now dominated by climate change sceptics. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, through his deputy, that this government looks forward to fighting the next election on climate change, against those opposite. We look forward to fighting it on climate change at the next election because we accept climate change science; those opposite reject climate change science. We, on this side of the House, have ratified Kyoto; those on that side of the House refused to ratify Kyoto. We, on this side of the House, boosted the renewable energy target to 20 per cent; those opposite failed to do so. We, on this side of the House, negotiated an emissions trading scheme in good faith; those opposite, led by the Leader of the Opposition, initially supported it -  -  - Here in this parliament we face the extraordinary spectacle of those opposite, having voted down the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, now blaming the Australian government for not passing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. That is the ultimate irony of the proposition which they put. When the member for Wentworth negotiated the passage of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the Leader of the Opposition stood up and said, 'This country needs a carbon pollution reduction scheme.' He said that it needed an ETS now, and then he spotted the political opportunity to assassinate the member for Wentworth, and that is what he then proceeded to do. On one occasion they voted it down; on a second occasion they voted against it, and then they did so again.At Copenhagen, the rest of the world sought to bring about an agreement; here in Australia they barracked in the hope that Copenhagen would fail. The government, notwithstanding the opposition from those opposite, remains committed to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, we intend to get on with the job of ensuring that we can bring about necessary action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But there is one thing we cannot change, and that is that this Leader of the Opposition stood up and assassinated his predecessor -  -  - This government, on the question of climate change, has confronted two realities. Firstly, those opposite decided to U-turn completely in supporting the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. They voted it down in the Senate and the Greens voted it down in the Senate. The second thing which occurred was that, at the Copenhagen conference, global action on climate change was not as substantial as the rest of the international community had hoped. As a consequence, if the government is re-elected, we will reintroduce the ETS legislation at the end of the current Kyoto commitment period. That is why we would do so, on the basis that global action on climate change is clear.On that note, I would draw the attention of the opposition and the parliament at large to reports today contained in the American media about the impending content of the American Power Act. The American Power Act also deals with the same question of climate change. It also deals with the question of putting a cap on carbon pollution, making polluters pay and compensating households. I would draw their attention also to the fact that, when it comes to the passage of this bill, the reports contained in the US media today indicate that the measures would become operational from 2013. That is the commencement of the new period subsequent to the Kyoto commitment period. So I draw to the attention of those opposite that the rest of the world is acting on climate change.The outcome from Copenhagen was not as substantial as those of us who participated in that conference wanted. The government's ETS legislation has been voted down by those opposite and by the Greens in the Senate. The government remains committed to its greenhouse gas reduction targets. The government remains committed to the principle of an emissions trading scheme as the best way of bringing about greenhouse gas reductions and the cheapest way of doing so.But my challenge to those opposite, if they have any skerrick of commitment on the question of climate change, is to answer this: how is it that, in the 21st century, you could support this Leader of the Opposition, who says that the world was hotter in Jesus' time? How could you actually hold to a belief, in defiance of total science around the world, that somehow in the last 2000 years the world has become cooler, not warmer? How could you stand behind a leader who says that the industrial revolution, in effect, did not happen? The core divide between us is that this Leader of the Opposition does not believe in climate change. He has said it is 'absolute crap'. He has rejected the science and he now tells us that it was hotter in the time of Jesus of Nazareth than it is today. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: that view is positively weird.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question because this government, through responsible economic management, is bringing the budget back into the black in three years - three years early. This represents the fastest positive turnaround in the budget since the early 1960s. That is because we take responsible economic management very seriously. We took it very seriously last year, when jobs were threatened in this economy. When we created jobs by putting in place the stimulus and worked with small business and the business community, we supported jobs in electorates like Longman. Electorates like Longman are usually the first types of electorate which feel the full steel of a recession, where many people are put out of work when demand falls off a cliff. But, because we supported people in electorates like Longman - we got in there with small business and supported employment - unemployment in this country is now the envy of the developed world.Of course, supporting jobs is the most fundamental thing a government can do. Putting the framework in place for the long-term is also a fundamental thing we can do to ensure the prosperity of all of our people, to ensure they have job security. We are providing that through our long-term economic frameworks. That is what we have done in the budget delivered this week. Because the economy is recovering, because there is a return to above-trend growth, we have put in place the very strict fiscal rules that we said we would put in place last year when we took the responsible action to support employment and small business in the Australian economy. The benefits of that have been felt right around this country and right around all of the electorates in this House.It is just a pity that, at that critical stage of our history, those opposite opposed all of those measures, because, as we build on that success and go forward, we are in a far better position than just about any other advanced economy. We are not wading through the rubble of a recession, of prolonged and high unemployment and of massive business closures, like they are in countries in Europe and like they are in the United States, because Australia did something special last year and Australia is doing something very special this year: putting in place our tight fiscal rules, a very big fiscal turnaround through expenditure restraint, through the application of our two per cent rule. That is so important.So the challenge for the opposition leader tonight, the challenge for the opposition, is to tell the whole of Australia when they will bring the budget back to surplus. When will they bring it back to surplus? And how will they bring it back to surplus? They have already had something like $15.7 billion worth of unfunded promises. How are they going to meet all of those and bring the budget back to surplus, to show the restraint we now need to build on the success of the last year or so? How are they going to do that? This is their day of reckoning.They come into this House time and time again and oppose essential savings measures, and then somehow pretend to be fiscal conservatives. It would make a cat laugh. These people opposite are just not serious when it comes to economic policy. They are not serious. This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say on Sky News. He was asked: 'If the Coalition were to win this year's election, would you have a surplus in 2011-12?' He said: 'We would move faster'. Well, we will see how fast they can move tonight. We will see how credible they are tonight. They must outline a fully-funded and fully-costed pathway to surplus. If they do not, they will reveal themselves for what they are: empty vessels and very risky for this country's future.</DOC>

 - I draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to my answer to his first question, concerning the impact of the range of measures contained in the government's response to the Henry-commissioned report. They go to preferential taxation arrangements now for the exploration industry, a new tax regime for smaller miners in the sense that they are now advantaged by a tax on profits rather than a tax on volume, as well as the overall impact of the decision to bring down the company tax rate. I would draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention, again, to the independent modelling commissioned by the Treasury through Econtech, which demonstrates that putting these measures together results in an overall increase in the level of mining activity in the economy. It makes that projection at 5.5 per cent over time. It is done by taking all those individual inputs into account.The second thing I would say to the Leader of the Opposition is that it is inevitable when you seek to bring about a new taxation regime for the mining industry in Australia, and one that involves higher taxes for a number of participants in that industry, they are going to object. They are going to complain, because they are going to be paying more money to the Australian people via the general revenue. For the overall impact on the Australian community, it is important to bear this in mind. What we are doing is ensuring that there is a fair share for the mining industry but, equally, a fair share for the Australian people, who own this resource. -  - The Leader of the Opposition's question went to the overall impact of this response to the Henry Review on the future of the mining industry and I responded specifically by pointing his attention to the conclusion of the Econtech modelling and the 5.5 per cent increase in mining activity, which results from that.My second response to the Leader of the Opposition's question went to the overall impact of what the government seeks to do through this reform. It is to ensure the Australian people also get a fair share from the resources - which, ultimately, they the Australian people own; a fairer share in terms of better superannuation for all working Australians; a fairer share in terms of bringing down the tax rate, including special tax breaks for our small businesses; and, furthermore, ensuring that we use those resources to invest in our country's future infrastructure needs, in the road, the rail and the port which, everywhere across the country, we hear representations about.I conclude my response to the Leader of the Opposition in these terms. I understand that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition suggested in question time that the Australian gas company Santos was not proceeding with a $15 billion LNG project in Gladstone because of the resources superprofits tax. I also draw the House's attention to what the CEO of Santos, Mr Knox, has said. He said, 'There are all sorts of factors. Obviously, the uncertainty of the supertax is something we are going to have to manage,' that is true, 'but I would not directly attribute it to that.' For transparency and clarity in the debate, if the Leader of the Opposition is going to report the comments of various mining executives around the country, he should do so with accuracy. This is an important debate for the future.I would also draw people's attention to what happened in our national debate in the mid-eighties, when we brought in the petroleum resource rent tax. Everyone at that stage predicted doom and gloom and the collapse of the entire offshore mining industry. It did not happen. It has produced, instead, one of the most vibrant exploration and production platforms that we have seen in the Australian resources sector in the last quarter of a century, including our largest resources project, the Gorgon Project - also under a tax at 40 per cent, I would note.I draw the attention of those opposite to the fact that, when it comes to superprofits from the resource industry, 60 per cent of those superprofits are retained by the companies concerned. I think it is important that we have some balance in this debate as the government seeks, responsibly, to negotiate the detail, the implementation and the transition of this proposed set of new arrangements with the mining industry. This is, however, part of a broader reform for the industry at large and for the general economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question. It is very important that we have bipartisan support for the government's strict fiscal rules and indeed for the government's commitment to get the budget back into surplus by 2012-13. Tonight, we will get some indication of whether or not we do have bipartisan support for those commitments. Tonight is the big test for the Leader of the Opposition. Is he going to put his money where his mouth is? This morning I released a chart, which shows the track record so far. The red is where the existing unfunded commitments of the opposition would take the budget deficit and would keep it in deficit in the two years when it is projected to be in surplus by the government.I have also released a table which outlines the specific commitments - the actual promises - made by the opposition over that period, which total $15.7 billion and have not been funded. There is no provision made for these promises in their projections thus far. The net effect of these promises would be to move the 2012-13 budget, currently projected to be in surplus to the tune of $1 billion, to a deficit of $4.4 billion and to move the 2013-14 budget, currently projected to be in surplus to the tune of $5.4 billion, to a $450 million deficit. That is before we even get to the very salient question of how the opposition is going to deal with the government's tax package, where they are clearly indicating that they are going to oppose the resource superprofits tax that delivers $12 billion to the forward estimates. But what are they going to do with respect to the actual things that it is dedicated to funding, such as the 28 per cent company tax, the improvements in tax for small business, the improvements in tax for the mining sector and the improvements in infrastructure for resource sector states? If they try to have a bob each way, as they typically do, then they are going to have to fund those things as well. So on top of the $15.7 billion black hole that is already there, there will be billions upon billions of dollars in extra commitments that they will have to fund.The outcome of their position thus far is that there would be no surpluses over the four years of the forward estimates. The deficit would be bigger in every year and it would take longer for the Australian government to pay off its debt. So there are four key tests that the Leader of the Opposition has to meet tonight. First, he has to explain where that $15.7 billion for past promises is coming from, let alone any that he chooses to make in his budget reply speech tonight. Second, if the opposition is proposing to oppose the resource superprofits tax, will they also oppose the cuts in business taxes, the cuts in small business taxes, the investment in infrastructure and the investment in superannuation through reduced taxes that that is funding? If they will not oppose those things, how do they propose to fund their commitment? Third, will they commit to matching all of the government's budget rules, including the extension of the two per cent spending cap to the point where the budget is in surplus to the tune of one per cent of GDP? Finally, will they guarantee that the 2012-13 and 2013-14 financial year budgets will be in surplus, notwithstanding the commitments that they choose to make prior to the election?Just today, the new and latest shadow finance minister - he is number five for this term of parliament - stated at the doors:A Coalition government would, under any circumstances, bring the budget back into surplus well before a Labor government could.He already has $15.7 billion to find, and his leader has not even delivered his budget reply speech. We have not had a response to the government's tax package, and he is promising he will have a surplus before the government is projecting it. But the facts, of course, tell a very different story.The amazing thing is that my words, literally as I was speaking them, were going out of date. I got back to the office and finally got around to reading today's Age, where I discovered that the opposition is proposing to block one of the government's saving measures, a modest cut in the childcare tax rebate of about $80 million over four years. They are proposing to block that as well, so the $15.7 billion black hole just keeps mounting. It is like a meter that keeps ticking over. Amusingly enough, this article had next to it another article, and it seems that the opposition are not unique in their inconsistency, because this article from the Age attacking the government for being too harsh in this spending cut was juxtaposed against another article, an opinion piece masquerading as a news story, attacking the government for not cutting enough in the budget. So inconsistency on these issues is not unique to the opposition.Tonight is 'put up or shut up' time for the Leader of the Opposition. The debt and deficit campaign is dead. Is he going to give it a decent funeral and a decent burial? Tonight we find out whether the Leader of the Opposition can be trusted with the nation's finances or whether our view, that he is a giant risk to the Australian economy and a giant risk to the nation's finances, will be dramatically confirmed.</DOC>

 - I would just make the point that the revenue figures take into account the rebating of the royalties. It is obvious to everyone except the member opposite. - I am not going into all the details of the funding of it. You have the net revenue. It is there for all to see. It is there for the shadow Treasurer to see. The royalties are rebated -  - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and his long interest in the retirement incomes of Australians. The government believes that Australians who save should be supported. Australians who take the initiative to put money aside should be encouraged, because we believe that saving is good for the individual and good for the nation.We have backed that belief with action to provide tax relief for people who save through bank accounts, credit unions, building societies, bonds, annuities and other savings vehicles, action to support low-income earners by effectively giving them back their contributions tax on superannuation, action to help people over 50 who want to put a little bit of extra money aside for their retirement, and action to increase the retirement incomes of Australians by increasing the superannuation guarantee.The costs to the government of these actions are funded by the Resource Super Profits Tax. The budget papers make it clear that the cost of our tax concessions for savers is $950 million over the next four years, a cost funded by the Resource Super Profits Tax. The budget papers make it clear that the cost of refunding the contributions tax to low-income earners is $830 million over the next four years, funded by the Resource Super Profits Tax. The cost of our measures to help people over 50 save is $1.3 billion over the next four years, funded by the Resource Super Profits Tax. This is a key point: the budget papers also make it clear - the shadow Treasurer either did not read them or did not understand them - that the cost to the government of increasing the superannuation guarantee reaches $3.6 billion a year when the superannuation guarantee hits 12 per cent, funded by the Resource Super Profits Tax.I am asked by the member for Deakin what the impact would be of blocking the Resource Super Profits Tax. I am happy to answer that question, but it is also a question that the Leader of the Opposition might care to answer this evening. He might care to explain, for example, to a 30-year-old on average weekly earnings why he wants to deny them an increase in their retirement income of $108,000. He might care to explain to a 30-year-old woman on average weekly earnings who has two periods of maternity leave and works for a while part-time why he wants to deny her $78,000 from her retirement lump sum. And he might want to explain to somebody over 50 nearing retirement who, now that the kids are off their hands and maybe they have paid off their mortgage, wants to put a little bit extra aside for their retirement. Maybe that is a woman who has missed out on some time at work because she has raised children. He might want to explain to them why he wants to deny them help to boost their superannuation.While the Leader of the Opposition is on his feet tonight, he might also want to explain his plan for retirement incomes. I shared with the House earlier the Leader of the Opposition's plan as outlined in his manifesto for the prime ministership, Battlelines. This is his plan to tax people on their superannuation at their marginal tax rate. What would this mean for Australians? The Leader of the Opposition might want to expand on it tonight, but I am happy to provide the House with some information. It would mean, for example, that a 30-year-old who under the current arrangements would retire with a lump sum of $456,000 would, under the Abbott plan, retire with $245,000. The Leader of the Opposition might want to explain why he wants to take $212,000 from an average worker today aged 30 on average weekly earnings.The Abbott plan would also mean less take-home pay - less pay in the wallets of Australians on a weekly basis. It would mean $1,900 a year less for somebody on average weekly earnings, which is $36 a week less. Well done, Tony! That is his plan, as outlined in his manifesto._ a Minister 'should not engage in irrelevances', such as contrasting the Government and Opposition _I would ask you to ask him to sit down or else answer the question as it was asked.On other occasions such comments have been permitted _ - Thank you, Mr Speaker. To be fair to the Leader of the Opposition, maybe he did not know this was the impact of the Abbott plan when he wrote it in Battlelines. Maybe he did not think it through, because we all know who does not understand economics. That is why one of his former cabinet colleagues told the Weekend Australian:It always drove us crazy that he is not financially minded. He'd get an idea, which was always big and grand, and he tended to ignore everyone's objections _Tonight he has a chance to correct his errors and actually back superannuation for Australians. But I have a feeling that at eight o'clock tonight it will be clear that, when it comes to governments and superannuation, Labor is not the best friend superannuation has ever had; Labor is the only friend superannuation has ever had.</DOC>

 - I would draw the member for Groom's attention to the reasons for the government embracing a resources superprofits tax. Firstly, within the mining industry itself, it seeks to reform the way in which this is done - a tax on volume is what underpins the existing royalties regime. We will replace that with a tax on profits because we want to expand the industry over time. Secondly, by bringing the other tax changes into the mining industry we are also expanding the base of the industry by encouraging smaller mining companies to get into their operations earlier and not be slugged with a tax on volumes up front. Furthermore, this also provides stability for the taxation regime long term, as the PRRT regime did 25 years ago. -  - I would also remind the member for Groom of one core fact: 10 years ago, for every dollar which was collected in mining royalties across Australia, $3 went in mining profits. Ten years later, for every dollar collected in mining royalties, now $7 goes in profits.I simply draw the attention of those opposite to the fact that what we are seeking to do through this reform is two things: providing a fair return for the mining industry on the one hand, but a fair return for all Australians on the other. That is a fair return for those who legitimately expect decent retirement income through better super for workers - people who also expect a better return when it comes to bringing down the tax rates currently being imposed on all Australian businesses, including 2.4 million small businesses. And, thirdly, making it possible for our economy to grow by building the infrastructure Australia needs for the 21st century. That is the underpinning rationale for what we are doing and, in terms of the particular comments from a representative of a particular company which the member for Groom reflects on, I would say to him again: in a debate where we the government are seeking to tax big mining companies more, they are going to object to it and they are going to complain about it and there is going to be a lot of noise about it. That is inevitable. Our responsibility is to make sure these reforms work for the long-term national interest, boost the competitiveness of our companies overall, boost our infrastructure, boost our pool of national savings. We the government intend to get on with the task.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Werriwa for his question and indeed for his consistent and ongoing interest in infrastructure development, both for the nation and for the south-west suburbs of Sydney. Some great progress is indeed being made on the F5 upgrade. The section between St Andrews Road and Raby Road is running some six months ahead of schedule and it is running on budget. The member for Werriwa has always voted for the Nation Building Program, as well as always supporting the community infrastructure measures that the government has put in place, including the $8 million that the government committed to upgrade Campbelltown stadium, which was completed in time for the West Tigers' first home game of this year. But those opposite are not quite as consistent.We know that the member for Werriwa supports the resources rent tax. We know that he supports the $5 billion in infrastructure that will come as a result of that. And those opposite? We are not quite sure. We are not sure whether they support the increase in nine per cent to 12 per cent in superannuation. We are not sure whether they support the cut in company tax because they have one message here and another in their electorates. In here they say they are concerned about debt and deficit, but right around the country they are in their electorates - particularly in the areas of my portfolio - making massive multi-billion-dollar commitments - unfunded, uncosted, just making those commitments out there. They are trying to con the electorate. - I am asked who made the commitment. I have had four shadow infrastructure ministers so far - not quite the same number as shadow finance ministers - and some of you might remember who the third shadow infrastructure minister was, even though there were no speeches, no questions in the parliament and just one media release, but there was one commitment. And to give the member for Groom credit, he made it on day 1. He peaked early. On day 1 in his own electorate he committed $1.75 billion for the Toowoomba bypass - day 1, in his electorate. So what we want to see tonight in the Leader of the Opposition's budget response is this. Will the $1.75 billion be there, or will he dump it just like he dumped the deal that was done by the member for Groom on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme? We will see that tonight. They had 12 years to act and did nothing about it, but on day 1 made a $1.75 billion commitment. There was of course a $6 billion commitment two weeks ago from the Leader of the National Party, but we might hear some more about that on another day. I am sure that will be there tonight as well.We do have some more creative coalition members across there - those who say one thing in the parliament and another in their electorate. They vote against projects here, but they are champions of them and claim victory when they go back to their electorate. There is no-one better at that than the member for Gippsland. There is a wealth of material on the member for Gippsland. Here he is in his newsletter: 'Princes Highway duplication gets started'. I wonder where the funding for that came from? The Nation Building Program that he voted against and that was brought forward as part of the economic stimulus plan that he voted against. So there he is, out there saying how terrific it is. But it does not have to be the big projects; it can be the smaller ones as well. He also voted against the community infrastructure part of the economic stimulus plan, but here he is, under the heading '$7 million boost for sport':Darren Chester discusses the benefits of the new sports complex with Joan Foot, Sale Netball Association and Johnny Paraskevas, Construction Manager _So we are creating jobs in his electorate under the program that he voted against. But there is more from the member for Gippsland. He has been out there promising extensions to the Princes Highway. There is not a day goes past that this bloke does not spend a million bucks. Not a day goes past - but we will see it all there in the opposition leader's response tonight.When it comes to waste, of course there is one program that comes to mind - the regional rorts program. We all recall it. We recall the Gunnedah ethanol plant that did not exist; we recall the train line that burned down; we recall the dog food - who could forget the dog food and the two-headed dog; and of course we recall the cheese factory in the electorate of Indi - the cheese factory that got $22,000 of taxpayers' money paid to it on 28 June 2007. There was only one problem - it had shut its doors in March 2007. You would think the member for Indi would know that this was a dodgy program and that now instead of paying for-profit organisations -  - The member for Indi has never seen a trough she didn't like. You would think that she would have learned -  - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. The member for Indi I think would know exactly what this program was about and why it is known as the regional rorts program. You would think, leading up to the Leader of the Opposition's speech tonight about fiscal responsibility and about how responsible they are going to be and how they are going to cut back that deficit and debt, that the last thing they would do is what the member for Indi did this week on ABC radio when she said, and I am not making this up, that she would like to see 'some sort of re-establishment of the regional partnership program'. You are kidding!</DOC>

 - We have made it very clear that if the tax is not passed and if the revenue is not there, we cannot proceed with the measures that we have outlined. We are confident the tax will raise the $12 billion and we can proceed with the measures that those opposite -  - I have made it very clear that every cent of the $12 billion raised from this tax over the forward estimates will be spent on the very important initiatives that the finance minister and other ministers were talking about before. Now I have the hypothetical question, 'Well what if it doesn't raise the $12 billion?' We are confident that it will. We are confident that this is a very fair tax, and we are going to invest the proceeds in economic reform.What those opposite are so embarrassed about is that we are up to the challenge of putting incentive in the tax system, cutting the corporate rate, giving a $5,000 instant write-off for small businesses and boosting superannuation in this country. They are acutely embarrassed that their negative position in this House, because they do not want to see Australians get a fair share of their mineral resources, is going to result in the fact that tax cuts will not go to small businesses or that other investment in infrastructure will not happen or that the corporate rate will not be cut. There is going to be a very high price paid by the opposition for them refusing to pass these very important initiatives which go to the heart of the economic reform challenge we face as a nation.</DOC>

 - Are there any threats! I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and acknowledge that the member for Parramatta ran a successful small business and we will be meeting with the Parramatta Chamber of Commerce to discuss small-business issues in the local area in the very near future. The government supported Australia's small businesses and our tradies during the global economic recession and we will support them again during the economic recovery. The instant write-off of assets valued at up to $5,000 will allow small businesses and tradies to immediately write off the full value of equipment and tools, like laptop computers, office equipment, welding equipment, ride-on lawnmowers, Makita table saws, Gentech electric generators, display cabinets for retailers, coffee-making machines for cafes, double-door fridges and industrial dishwashers for restaurants and, I am advised, 300-millimetre Birko meat slicers - that reminds me of the opposition leader, really. The instant write-off measures will improve cash flow and profitability for Australia's 2.4 million small businesses and our tradies. Australia's 720,000 small-business companies will benefit from an early start in the reduction in the company tax rate from 30c to 28c. That will start for small businesses on 1 July 2012.I was asked by the member for Parramatta whether there are any threats to these wonderful initiatives, to these tax breaks for small businesses. I have to report that there are threats in the form of the Leader of the Opposition. The small-business tax benefits are to be funded by the resource superprofits tax, but the Leader of the Opposition has said that he will attempt to use the coalition numbers in the Senate to block the passage of the resource superprofits tax. Of course, if the opposition leader succeeds in his attempts to block the resource superprofits tax, he will deny a tax break to every small business in this country. What has the coalition got against small business when we supported them through the economic downturn? Those opposite opposed the stimulus and opposed the support that we provided during the economic downturn, and when we want to give small business some credit for the way they managed the economic downturn and give them a tax break to invest in productive assets during the economic recovery, what does the opposition leader say? 'No - deny them those benefits.' He will do everything he possibly can to achieve that outcome by blocking the resource superprofits tax.The opposition leader must explain tonight, in his budget reply, why he would abandon small businesses and tradies. He must detail his spending cuts and explain his treachery to Australia's tradies and small businesses. This is a man who supports the New Zealand model of economic recession by telling Australian small businesses that a good old-fashioned recession will be great for them - a little bit of discipline, a little bit of leanness and a little bit of meanness in the tough world out there in the marketplace. This is what this right-wing extremist describes as tough love. The right-wing extremist sitting opposite describes this as tough love. My advice to small business is this: watch out if the opposition leader tries to embrace you with his tough love, because he will squeeze the life out of you and expect you to thank him for it in the morning.I have drafted some words for the opposition leader's budget reply speech tonight that he might find useful. I offer them in a spirit of generosity. He should say: 'Tonight I will explain why I intend to deny a much deserved tax break to every small business and tradie in Australia.' Mr Speaker, as you know, as I know and as everyone here knows, the Rudd government is the best friend small business has ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Earlier today I was at the Canberra Institute of Technology meeting with some apprentices and with Parliamentary Secretary Jason Clare was trying my hand at some trade skills. Needless to say I was not very good at the welding; Parliamentary Secretary Jason Clare was far better at it. But apart from trying our hand at trade skills, we were there to look at the great facilities and the new equipment that have been funded through the government's Better TAFE Facilities program as part of our nation-building infrastructure package. Of course, this investment is part of what has kept 200,000 Australians in work during these days of the global recession and these difficult economic times.Earlier today as well the labour force figures for the month of April were released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and they show that the unemployment rate has remained steady at 5.4 per cent. In April employment increased by 33,700 to just over 11 million Australians employed. We have got to look at this result in the context of what this nation has achieved during the global financial crisis and global recession. Let us remember that our Treasury predicted when this started that unemployment would reach 8½ per cent. Today's figures confirm the benefits of economic stimulus and the benefits of the nation working together to keep people employed during this economic challenge. And we should note that Australia has created 225,000 jobs in a period of time when nations around the world were shedding employment. The recent budget has updated our unemployment forecast. We expect unemployment to continue to fall and to be at 4¾ per cent by the June quarter of 2012.This does mean that economic stimulus has been supporting jobs, and I am asked about recognition of the investments for economic stimulus and the good that they have done. I am pleased that I can advise the House that I received a letter from Abbotsleigh, from a school, about their Building the Education Revolution program. The letter from Judith Poole, the headmistress, reads as follows:Thank you for your recent letter regarding the opening ceremony for the new Junior School infants wing and early learning centre last weekend. The chairman was delighted to read out your good wishes to the 1,100-strong crowd as part of the official ceremony. Please find enclosed a copy of the official program and photos of the plaque and unveiling. The weather was kind to us and we have received glowing reports from all that visit the Junior School on the high standard of facilities that government funding has enabled us to provide our local community.I thought that was a wonderful letter, a fantastic letter of recognition, and with some excitement I went to look at the photograph of the unveiling of the plaque. I thought, 'That's fantastic. I'm so sorry I could not be there but let's have a look at the moment when the plaque was unveiled.' What did I find? I found a photo, and who would you believe is on it? It is none other than the member for Bradfield - so famous for opposing Building the Education Revolution in this House that he actually got thrown out of the parliament because he was so opposed to Building the Education Revolution. There he is standing next to the unveiling of the plaque. - I am full of a spirit of goodwill towards the member for Bradfield, so I thought to myself, 'I'm sure he wouldn't have gone to an opening ceremony for a program he opposed. I'm sure he wouldn't have stood next to a plaque for a program that he did not vote for, that he did not want one dollar spent on, that he did not want one job created with. Obviously what has happened is that he just happened to be passing by and somehow someone has grabbed him and roped him into the photo.' I did not think the member for Bradfield would be exhibiting this kind of hypocrisy in his local electorate.Anyway, I kept looking at the things that I had been sent by Abbotsleigh and they had also sent me the program for the opening ceremony. So I had a good look at that and it was full of all sorts of interesting things. There was a balloon release and a school song, and people got to view the new spaces. I thought that was pretty good. But I was disappointed to see who the opening address of the Evelyn Forster Wing junior school resource centre and early learning centre was being given by - it was the member for Bradfield. What this does not tell me, and unfortunately I have not been sent a full tape recording of the event, is whether or not the member for Bradfield used the opportunity of his opening address to advise the audience of 1,100 people that he voted against every dollar in the program, he voted against every job and if the parliament had followed his lead then this project would never have come to fruition. -  - Hypocrisy on this scale is one thing, but there is another moment later on today when we have got to end some hypocrisy from the opposition. The Leader of the Opposition seems to still be desperately typing his address for later today. Well, he will be viewed as the same kind of hypocrite as the member for Bradfield unless in that address he names, school by school, every school they are going to cut when they cut the Building the Education Revolution program. We look forward to it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. She asked me a question about the proposed design of the Resource Super Profits Tax and the funding thereof. We have had a series of questions about this from the shadow Treasurer, and I have said that we have put the net revenue figures in the budget. What was taken into account in those net revenue figures is the proposed design that has been put forward by the Treasury. They have done all the work on that. - This is a resource rent tax and it has two features which are not understood by those opposite, so I will just go through them. They are different from the PRRT. Those two features are transferability and refundability. The member has asked me a question about the modelling of the revenue that the Treasury has done and how much of that may take into account the tax credits that are given to companies for their investments. She has asked me about that and she knows very well that there is no way anybody could give an answer to that question - nobody could.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck. She has a very good history of standing up for the men and women in her electorate and also a very good history of standing up in this parliament for important issues like pay equity, so it is very appropriate that she should ask this question. The Rudd government has committed to practical action to improve equality between men and women. One ongoing issue is the inequality in earnings between men and women and the lifelong effect that has, as women are less able to save for their retirement than men. Women's work patterns differ from men's in most cases, especially for the 80 per cent of Australian women who have kids. We know that it is usually mothers who have broken working patterns while caring for children and often other relatives as well. Australian men are in paid work for an average of 39 years, while women generally average 20 years in the paid workforce.New initiatives in the budget are part of our ongoing efforts to improve economic security across the lives of Australian women. The government's superannuation reforms in Stronger, Fairer, Simpler: a tax plan for our future will deliver substantial improvements in women's superannuation retirement savings. Increasing the superannuation guarantee to 12 per cent by 2020 is a big win for Australian women. It will mean more superannuation savings for women and will boost their lifelong economic security.We are also improving equity for low-income earners by in effect refunding contributions for those on marginal tax rates of 15 per cent or below. In 2012-13, around 2.1 million women will be eligible for the up to $500 low-income earner superannuation rebate. That is 60 per cent of all the recipients of the rebate. We are also helping over-50s top up their super. We know that a lot of women have that broken working pattern but that when their kids are older they are able to return to the workforce, are able to concentrate on paying off family debts and are able to focus on putting extra money into their super. We have allowed over-50s to top up their super balances when they are most able to do so by keeping their $50,000 concessional contributions tax.Because of these reforms, a woman who is now aged 30, who is likely to have two kids and maybe some part-time work with some time out of the workforce - a pretty typical pattern for many Australian women - will be $78,000 better off on retirement. That is a very significant boost, and it comes on top of last year's budget commitment to paid parental leave - a fully costed, fully funded scheme, not a $3 billion a year new tax on business despite a promise to not introduce new taxes on business. It comes on top of the IR changes that protect the most vulnerable workers, many of whom are women, and it comes on top of the pension reforms from last year. We know that the majority of single pensioners are women - 72 per cent of single pensioners. Because of Labor's changes, those people are $100 a fortnight better off. This is an ongoing program of building better economic security for Australian women across their lives - their working lives and their retirement. These super changes in particular will be super for those women.</DOC>

 - This is the fear campaign in full swing. We have seen it on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, we have seen it on industrial relations and now we are seeing it on a tax which has been designed in consultation with industry. We have not seen the final output of all of that. We have put forward a framework for a 40 per cent resource rent tax - and what are they doing? They are running a fear campaign.What we are doing is the responsible thing. We are sitting down and having a discussion with the mining industry. We have done modelling. The independent modelling has been published. The growth figures for that have been published. Yet somehow this man here expects that he can be credible by asking in here what the impact will be in two years time on fertiliser. I will be happy to answer all those questions when we have been through our consultation process, when we have finalised all of the detail with industry.We are happy to debate this tax. I will tell you why: because everybody over there is happy to see the Australian people not get the full value for their mining resources. As the Prime Minister was saying before, at the beginning of this decade there was $1 in royalties for every $3 of mining profits. Now it is one in seven. That is an enormous loss to the Australian people. We are sitting down in good faith, putting forward a responsible proposal that will give the Australian people fair value that we can invest in superannuation, that we can use to cut the company tax. - But what we are getting here is yet -  - Yes. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fremantle for her question and acknowledge her vigorous advocacy in this area. I am pleased to advise the House that the government will invest an additional $154 million over four years in legal assistance programs to improve access to justice. This is the largest and most significant injection of new funds into the legal assistance sector for well over a decade. The investment will play a key role in ensuring disadvantaged Australians have the means to resolve their disputes early, before they escalate and before they become entrenched.The additional funding will be provided from 1 July this year and it will include an additional $92.3 million over four years for legal aid, $34.9 million for Indigenous legal services and $26.8 million for community legal services programs. That is additional funding. It builds on the additional one-off funding totalling $70 million that has been provided to the sector over the past three years. It takes the Commonwealth's total funding for legal assistance services to over $1.2 billion and will give the sector greater certainty for their own planning over the next four years.The package will make a real difference. It will support legal aid commissions in their vital work of providing legal and mediation services for disadvantaged Australians. The new funding will also underpin the national partnership agreement that is currently being negotiated with the states and territories for the ongoing legal aid arrangements. It is anticipated that the new arrangements will include a number of innovations, including focusing on early intervention and education and providing for greater flexibility, including using Commonwealth funds for state related family violence and child protection related matters.The investment in legal aid will also increase the availability of assistance in a number of important areas, including in respect of veterans' entitlements, consumer credit and debt, and certain civil law matters. Importantly, additional resources will also be available for outreach work to rural and regional Australia, including the rapidly growing regions of Australia.The program will also include an investment of $34.9 million in Indigenous legal services. That will also make a real practical difference, through enhanced legal advice, duty lawyer programs and casework services in the civil, criminal and family law areas. Importantly, Indigenous women and children who are victims of domestic violence will also have greater access to assistance through the Family Violence Prevention Legal Services program. The investment is entirely consistent with the government's policy to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage.Finally, the government's additional $26 million investment in community legal centres will focus on supporting those experiencing family violence and homelessness. Communities in rural, regional and remote areas will benefit significantly from the package. Those members who are lucky enough to have a community legal service in their electorate will know the tremendous job they do and the value-add that they contribute with the volunteers that they enlist to assist those who are disadvantaged. These resources will provide a tremendous and well-deserved boost to their resources, I am sure all members will agree.In conclusion, all the evidence indicates that education and assistance provided early in someone's confronting the legal system avoids problems and additional expenses downstream. The $154 million investment, along with the $70 million the government has already injected into the sector over the last three years, demonstrates the government's real commitment to achieving an accessible justice system, which is necessary to underpin a fair and inclusive society.</DOC>

 - I welcome this question. I had a question yesterday from the shadow minister and Leader of the National Party about this. These were measures that were originally announced in the 2003 budget. They were announced by those opposite when the member over there was a minister in the Howard government. They were supposed to commence on 1 July 2008. This was an initiative of the coalition government. - They were originally supposed to apply from 1 July 2008. They were announced in the coalition budget of 2003. That is the first thing that happened - and it happened when the member opposite was a minister in that government. And he had the hide to get up and ask a question yesterday as if this was an initiative that had been put forward by this Labor government. It was not. The former Howard government subsequently deferred this until 1 July 2011 in the 2004 budget. Those changes have been an ongoing feature of government budget estimates ever since that time. I cannot believe that we are getting this question today from that frontbencher over there after the bungle yesterday.The industry has been aware of all of this since that time. This was an initiative that was agreed with industry at that time. The agreement was that the taxation arrangements would be gradually phased in over four years - a feature of budgets since the time that they were in government. And they have the hide to come in here and claim that somehow it is a government initiative. This has been a feature of budgets and has been incorporated in estimates since that time. You should be ashamed of yourself.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. This budget builds on the record of the Rudd Labor government in providing assistance to veterans and the ex-service community in the areas in which they really need them. In total terms, we are talking about a record budget on this occasion of some $12.1 billion. Let us not forgot that this is in a situation where, as many of our World War II veterans enter their twilight years, the overall size of our veteran community is shrinking.There is some $246 million plus in new initiatives. I would like to particularly address three of them today. Firstly, there is $152.7 million over four years to expand community based health services aimed at Australian veterans and war widows with chronic conditions, our frailest veterans and war widows. This is designed to keep them out of hospital and in their own homes in the environment where they are most comfortable for a longer period. This is a very positive step forward and builds on the record of improved services across this area in recent years.There are also two other particular initiatives that I would like to go to which address longstanding concerns and build on commitments made when in opposition and now in a government that we are proud to be part of. Members would know of the question around the issue of F111 deseal/reseal maintenance workers and the concerns that have been raised over a number of years with respect to them.There was a scheme under the previous government which dealt with the concerns of those who were seen to be formally part of the maintenance area. However, there have been a range of concerns raised about the fact that many workers who had an involvement in the area were denied access to that scheme. There were ex gratia payments available on an arbitrary basis to people according to the number of days that it was identified that they had spent in the tanks. But frankly there was not a proper recognition of the circumstances that these people faced with respect to the health conditions that they had subsequently developed.The government has fulfilled our commitment made in opposition - which, I remind people, was to have a parliamentary inquiry into that scheme. I would like to particularly note the chair of that committee, the member for Brisbane, and congratulate him on the work that he and others have done with respect to that process. I might also add that in the circumstances it should not be forgotten that when we made that commitment the opportunity was there for the opposition, then in government, to match that commitment. No commitment was made.The fact is, that inquiry identified a number of concerns. Those concerns were dealt with fairly and justly through the recommendations of that committee. Although we have not accepted all of the recommendations, we have accepted the key points from that inquiry. One of the key points is that some 2,400 workers were denied access to the scheme as a result of the way it had been designed. What is also clear is that a number of those people have developed conditions which have been identified through the SHOAMP health scheme as quite possibly - and almost certainly in many cases - related to their exposure to chemicals in these circumstances. By giving them access under the SRCA legislation and section 7.2, which identifies conditions recognised as being part of what could develop as a result of these exposures, the government estimates that some $55 million in additional compensation and healthcare support, including counselling for families, will be provided.This is an area that has caused enormous problems to the families involved and to the workers involved. And it is certainly true that some people feel there are concerns that certain circumstances have not been addressed. However, there is absolutely no doubt that this will mean that many workers who are dealing with the aftermath of their exposures will now be provided with real support.The second matter I would like to raise is the question of the government's response to the Clarke review recommendations which were not implemented by the previous government. Members would remember that in the early part of this century the previous government instigated a review under Justice Clarke around a broad-ranging set of recommendations which went to a whole range of issues within the ex-service community. A number of those were addressed. A number were not. The review that has come down has addressed several of those recommendations that are substantive, several more that, it is fair to say, are minor, and others that are still under consideration.The key point I go to here is the issue around participants in British nuclear tests. I want to make it very clear here that the government was asked, when in opposition, to accept that recommendation. The commitment that was made was that we would review the Clarke report with specific reference to that. The result of that consideration - I am very pleased to be able to say this, today - is that what we were asked to do by the nuclear veteran representatives, the government has now done. Again, other matters remain open for consideration, and there is no doubt that some nuclear test representatives have said that they intend to pursue other matters in other forums. That is their right.I am proud that this government took the step that the previous government would not take, and has recognised that it was identified though that independent inquiry that this was an issue that ought to be addressed, and has given these people the benefit of the doubt. We estimate, again, that somewhere in the region of in excess of $24 million in compensation and support will be provided by giving these people access to the Veterans' Entitlements Act under the headline of non-warlike hazardous service. I think it is a positive step forward. It will allow those who have developed conditions which can be related to their service to receive compensation, and I think that is something that is long overdue.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and I draw his attention to the sort of debate which occurred in this place, and more broadly, when we brought in the petroleum rent resource tax in the mid-1980s. There were loud threats across the nation and from abroad about the impact on the Australian offshore mining industry at that time through the introduction of the tax. That tax was a tax on profits. The proposed RSPT is a tax on profits. Every economic analyst concludes that a tax on profits is a more efficient tax than a tax on volumes.The second point that the Leader of the Opposition asked was about, I think, a reference to Fortescue Metals. Notice was given to the ASX by Fortescue last Wednesday noting that the projects in question had been placed on hold. I note the two paragraphs in the Australian newspaper on 20 May which said:Mr Forrest's move to delay the Solomon project was last night labelled a 'political statement' more than a genuine setback to the company's plans.It went on to say:Credit Suisse analyst Nathan Littlewood noted Fortescue had not abandoned its Solomon feasibility study due for completion later this year, by which time a federal election would have been held _I also draw attention to recent statements which have been made by Mr Forrest concerning China and the response which has been forthcoming on that as well. As the Leader of the Opposition will know, there will be many, many statements by many, many companies, and all of them may have this in common: they do not want to pay more tax.This government believes that the time has come for tax reform which delivers a fair return for all Australians, a fair return for those who depend on this tax for investing in our future infrastructure, a fair return from this tax to support super for working families and a fair return from this tax in order to bring down the taxation burden for Australian business. This reform, as the Leader of the Opposition knows full well, has been projected by independent modelling to bring about an overall increase in mining activity of 5.5 per cent as well as bringing about other deep reforms in the tax system, and incentives and global competitiveness to the Australian economy at large.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. In fact, we were in his electorate only last week at a community cabinet meeting where we heard loud and clear from a number of local businesses how they appreciate an Australian government that gets out there in support of local business to protect jobs in local communities, as we have been doing throughout the global financial crisis and, with reforms to the economy, how we will continue to do so into the future as well. I remember that we spent some time with a number of businesses in the honourable member's electorate. Penguin Composites comes to mind, a company which has benefited from a co-investment with the Australian government in the expansion of its operations.The member for Braddon asked a question about tax reform and where it fits within the overall priorities of the government, and responses to it. The first responsibility of government is to keep the Australian economy strong. That is what this government is committed to. We have done so by keeping Australia out of recession. We have done so also through a budget which halves our net peak debt and brings the budget back to surplus in three years time - three years ahead of time. Furthermore, the strength of the economy in the future depends on the continued reform of our economy - reforms in productivity, reforms in workforce participation, and reforms also in regulation and in tax.On the question of tax, if the opposition blocks this tax reform, Australia will look back in 10 years time and see that another opportunity to strengthen our economy and invest in our competitiveness in the future was passed up. No. 1, with this tax reform, we are aiming at boosting the overall national competitiveness of Australia. We are doing that by bringing down the company tax rate by two percentage points -  - The Leader of the Opposition interjects, 'How are you going to do that?' Not by increasing the company tax rate, as he is planning to do. We are bringing it down two percentage points; you are taking it up two percentage points. There is a big difference.Secondly, we are also boosting the competitiveness of the Australian economy by investing in infrastructure. That is necessary in order to underpin long-term productivity growth. We are investing also in the tax competitiveness of our small business sector. We will lose an opportunity to deliver a fair share for all Australians if the opposition blocks this legislation. If the Leader of the Opposition blocks this RSPT, he will be denying workers an increase in super from nine per cent to 12 per cent. He will be denying a worker on about average earnings an additional $108,000 a year. He will be denying working Australians better super on their retirement. He will be denying all those Australian companies a two percentage point tax cut. He will be denying Australian small business a $5,000 tax break. He will also be denying some 6.4 million Australian taxpayers a radical opportunity to simplify their tax arrangements and to throw the shoebox away, if they so choose, when it comes to tax time. That is what is at stake with these reforms.I was asked by the member for Braddon about other people's comments on these reforms and the need to tax the mining sector more. It seems that the Leader of the Opposition alone in this country believes that our mining sector is currently paying enough tax. His state political colleague recently said the following:The mining companies are aware of it and some of them have expressed their views. I have to say that a few people who work around the mining industry have come to me over the summer and said, 'By the way, Colin, the mining companies are getting away with murder; they're not paying enough.'So says Colin Barnett, the Liberal Premier of Western Australia.We go to Don Voelte, a leading representative of the mining industry in Western Australia, who said this:Your original question was, 'Can the miners give a little bit more?' In talking to the big miners and the mid-cap miners, I have not heard that they are not willing to negotiate a different tax and a higher tax back. They want to give a fair share back to the Australian citizens.Look at what Roger Corbett has had to say on the matter of tax reform. He said the following:These are resources owned by Australians and Australians should extract from those resources the best possible advantage that they can. In principle I support a resources tax. I support a taxing regime that allows redistribution and I support a taxing regime that retains some of the value of this asset that is going to be consumed to the point where there is nothing left so that they can have an asset base for the future.So said Mr Corbett, whom the previous government appointed to the Reserve Bank board.So there you have it: the WA Liberal Premier says that the mining industry - in his words, not mine - is getting away with murder. Don Voelte from Woodside says that it is entirely appropriate for mining companies to be paying more. Roger Corbett of the Reserve Bank, a leading Australian businessman, says that in-principle support for a resources rent tax is appropriate. There is only one person in this parliament who believes that our mining industry is paying enough, and that is the Leader of the Opposition. - Oh, and Wilson Tuckey - the dynamic duo when it comes to economic reform. The Leader of the Opposition stands in the way of tax reform for workers who want better super, stands in the way of small businesses who want decent tax cuts and stands in the way of decent infrastructure to underpin the future of the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his very important question. There is growing support for the resource super profits tax. Everybody on this side of the House recognises that there is a rolled-gold case for more tax to be paid. But you never hear those on that side of the House even whisper about the need for the Australian people to get a fairer share of the bounty of this country. The Leader of the Opposition was sitting in his office and all the mining companies came in. At that stage he did not have a word to say about it. They told him what to say, and you have seen the outcome here today. The opposition are simply doing what they have been told to by the mining companies. There is going to be a lot of loud noise made by those who are opposed to this tax, by those who are opposed to Australians sharing in the wealth.At the beginning of this decade, one dollar in three of mining company profits came through royalties and charges. At the end of the decade, it was one dollar in seven. But they do not care that the Australian people have missed out on a fair share of that. That much is obvious. There is one body that said very early that we needed a resource rent tax in this community. In fact, that was said by the Minerals Council. The Minerals Council, in their submission to the independent tax inquiry, had this to say:There is a strong argument to reform the basis of determining royalty payments to a profits based criteria from a revenue one.That was the mining sector; that was the Minerals Council of Australia. Of course, this is now widely recognised not only here but around the world. This is what the OECD has had to say:Whenever there is a period in which there is a price spike or a price hike then it is legitimate for a sharing of that bonanza and that benefit.That is what everybody on this side of the House believes. Nobody on the other side of the House believes that. And today we have had Roger Corbett, appointed by those opposite to the Reserve Bank board, saying:These are resources owned by Australians and Australia should extract from those resources the best possible advantage it can.Who can disagree with that? Everybody over there disagrees with that perfectly reasonable statement. And you have got Michael Hawker, a director of Macquarie Group, who had this to say:A royalties tax on the assets of Australia is a good policy position because the capital of the country should be there not just for this generation but for multiple generations.Who believes that? Everybody on this side of the House believes that. But it is not just people in business; it is many economists. This is what Mr John Freebairn had to say on 12 May:It is actually going to increase the level of investment and employment down the track, contrary to what the big mining companies are claiming.You have got the IMF, who had this to say:There is a case for this tax to promote investment and secure for government higher shares of resource rent in profitable projects.And we have Professor Garnaut. What has he had to say? -  - I thought you supported Professor Garnaut. He said:It is the right sort of tax. The Henry review made a strong case and a good case for taxing mineral rent. It is an elegant approach to the taxing of mineral rent.We go on. Even the banks are saying this. This is what Westpac had to say on 3 May:The RSPT is a more efficient way of extracting value for both the state and resource companies than a royalty system.So, in the face of all this evidence, what we now have is an unprecedented, hysterical scare campaign which has been sponsored by those opposite and paid for by the Minerals Council, paid for and authorised by the Minerals Council. There are many commentators who have belled the cat on that. This is what Professor John Quiggin has had to say:The tax is a good idea and the criticisms we have seen are what you would expect from rent seekers seeking to protect their rents.I think that describes those opposite. And you had the Secretary-General of the OECD, again, saying:If you look at these things strategically, of course it is a wise thing to invest in Australia.Mr John Brogden, the CEO of the Investment and Financial Services Association - not someone from our side of politics - said:This is a visionary policy. It is visionary for Australia's retirement outcomes and it is visionary for the Australian economy.So there is a strong tide of support for this tax in the business community, in the economics profession and among the Australian people. Those opposite are siding with the mining industry against the families of Australia, the workers of Australia and a national retirement savings plan. You hear those opposite claim to stand for families. Phony Tony over there claims to stand for families, but he will not support an initiative like this which will support Australian families. They are happy to see the profits walk out the door and not support Australian families. They should be condemned.</DOC>

 - I draw the honourable member's attention to the report which has already been released by the Treasury which contains copious information within it. Secondly, the underpinning of the Leader of the Opposition's question again is that the mining industry in this country does not need to pay more. This government has a different view, the Premier of Western Australia has a different view and in fact many representatives of the Australian business community have a different view. The Secretary-General of the OECD has a different view. Those opposite seem to be of the view that the only way in which to advance this country's economic interest for the long term is simply to leave things as they are, not to engineer fundamental reforms for the future. We stand for better taxation treatment for small business, better tax treatment for Australian companies and better super for Australian workers, and we also stand for better investment in Australian infrastructure. That is the basis of the reform we have put forward. The government stands by its reform plan.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question. Honourable members may recall that at the end of the last sitting week I issued a tally, a table, of existing coalition spending commitments that totalled $15.7 billion that had not been funded in any way by the opposition. They may also recall the Leader of the Opposition's budget speech in reply on Thursday of the last sitting week in which he only managed to refer to one significant saving, with a grossly inflated estimate of how much it would deliver, and that was the Public Service hiring freeze.Since that time, we have had a very, very interesting week. First, on the Monday of last week, we had the Leader of the Opposition on the 7.30 Report indicate that we should not treat anything that he says seriously; we should only treat his statements as gospel truth if they are in writing. Then, on the Wednesday, after the Leader of the Opposition had promised that the detail would be delivered by the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, at his traditional budget reply speech at the National Press Club, the member for North Sydney came along and there was a lot of verbiage and bluster but there was no detail in his speech. A few hours later in the day, this elaborate game of pass-the-parcel concluded and finally the shadow finance minister - the fifth shadow finance minister in this term of parliament - the member for Goldstein, launched a list of supposed budget savings, the vast bulk of which do not hit the budget bottom line. Finally, to make the week even more interesting, the member for Goldstein, late on Thursday, put out a press release entitled 'Tanner's numbers in tatters' - almost illiterate if not quite. It stated in a press release:These costings leave in tatters the desperate claims of the Finance Minister, Mr Tanner, that Coalition promises add up to $15.7 billion.It claimed that only $4.7 billion is the tally of coalition promises. Mr Speaker, as you can imagine, I found this rather interesting and rather puzzling - in fact, I was a bit mystified. How could there be such a big gap, $11 billion or so, between my tally and the opposition's? The answer was in the fine print in the member for Goldstein's press release because it contained this ripper phrase:_ other past commitments have been discontinued.The older members of the chamber will no doubt remember Ronald Ziegler, the famous press spokesman for Richard Nixon who came up with the immortal phrase, 'That previous statement was inoperative.' We now have a new equivalent, a new euphemism. It is, 'That commitment has been discontinued.' The promise last year to allow small businesses to carry back-tax losses has been discontinued. The commitment of the shadow families minister, the member for Menzies, to get rid of the means-testing initiatives of the government on the baby bonus and the family tax benefits has been discontinued. The superannuation spokesman, the member for Cowper, in a speech only on 19 April this year made a commitment to reverse the government's tightening of concessional superannuation tax treatment. That one has also been discontinued, not to mention the radical reduction in funding for the Leader of the Opposition's so-called green army commitment that he made in a speech to the Sydney Institute and the dramatic scale down in funding for the Toowoomba bypass.What we have is a simple explanation for the discrepancy between the costings that I announced a week and a half ago and what the opposition now says are the costs of their promises. They have junked most of their promises and given us a living example of phoney Tony's principle: if it was a statement, ignore it; you have got to have it pinned down in writing, in triplicate, and it has got to be there in a document before you should treat it seriously.There is a common thread across all of these events last week. It is this: panic under pressure. First, we have the Leader of the Opposition refusing to be accountable for anything he says, then we have got the pass-the-parcel game from the Leader of the Opposition to the member for North Sydney to the member for Goldstein, then we have got the phoney savings announcement and then the final nail in the coffin that previous promises have been discontinued. There is a lesson for everyone here and that is that the Leader of the Opposition is too risky, too erratic and too flaky to be trusted with managing the nation's finances.</DOC>

 - Once again, we have those opposite standing in defence of the existing taxation arrangements which apply to Australia's mining industry. The member for North Sydney referred to a statement made by the Treasurer on Sunday in reference to a report that had been put out by the National Bureau of Economic Research. My advice is that is a credible research institute. Secondly, I draw attention to the fact that, when it comes to the combined incidence of both royalties and the company tax rate on mining companies, the government has seen a 50 per cent drop in the share of tax taken from mining company profits over the past 10 years even if you factor in both company tax and royalties. Resource profits were over $80 billion higher in 2008-09 than in 1999-2000. Governments have only collected an additional $9 billion in revenue. These figures speak for themselves. We stand for reforming the system; those opposite stand for the status quo.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her important question and I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Grattan Institute today has released an important report on teacher evaluation and teacher quality. Unsurprisingly, like the reports and evidence from around the world, this report finds that the single most important thing for the quality of a child's education is the quality of the teacher in the classroom. That is why as a government we have been systematically investing in teacher quality and in the quality of school leadership. We needed to do this because, when we came to government, whilst over 12 long years the coalition had talked about teacher quality, it had got nothing done. That was not the only problem, of course. It had talked about national curriculum, and it had got nothing done. It had talked about school transparency, and it had got nothing done. Across more than 12 long years, what we saw in education from those opposite was a track record of all talk and shameful inaction - absolutely shameful inaction.This government has acted, as opposed to the talk, talk, talk from the other side. Our new reforms include bringing the highest quality graduates into teaching in disadvantaged schools through our Teach for Australia program. Today, as we stand here, Shaun Isbister is teaching maths at Mill Park Secondary College. Shaun got an ENTER score of 96.6 and a first-class honours degree in economics and commerce. His motto for his classroom is: results, not excuses. Shaun is one of 45 -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I expect them to not be interested in education; it was their track record for a decade. Today, Shaun and 45 others are out there teaching through our Teach for Australia program, with more to come. These reforms in teacher quality mean today that the best teachers are being paid more to go to the classrooms that need them the most, and there are trials of performance based rewards in schools, including the prospect of outstanding teachers in Victoria earning $6,000 more. It means today there are differences for principal autonomy in state schools, including measures announced by the ACT government last week about school based management of staff and budgets, and in the Northern Territory business consultants are being made available to assist principals to run their schools. Today in Western Australia, as a result of our resources and reforms, more than 30 state schools are now called independent public schools, with the principals in them having greater autonomy, including the power to hire and fire. It was an honour for me to meet some of those principals on a recent trip to Western Australia.I am asked about threats to these reforms. The threat to these reforms arises from the game of 'pass the parcel' played about the budget reply last week, because the $425 million which would enable us to continue these reforms is on the Leader of the Opposition's cuts list. No more investment in principal autonomy; no more investment in paying the best teachers more to reward them; no more investment in bringing the best graduates into teaching: that is the policy of the Leader of the Opposition.Just like the Leader of the Opposition, who believes everything he says is just dispensable, that it does not matter whether or not it is the truth, the shadow minister cannot be relied on when he makes statements. He has said, 'The coalition believe our teachers need to be appropriately resourced, supported and rewarded.' But they have pledged to cut the funding that makes that possible. He said today in the Australian newspaper:'_ disenchantment and disappointment teachers have in their profession will only get worse until there is a real revolution in education, which introduces competitive principals and gives schools more autonomy.'But he has pledged to cut the funding that makes that possible - a breathtaking act of hypocrisy from those failures in education when they were in government. Even other members of their political party think they are crazy, erratic and a risk to education. Adrian Piccoli, the coalition's shadow minister for education in New South Wales, said in the parliament of New South Wales last week:We support every measure that can be put in place to improve teacher quality. I do not believe it is a particularly good move by the Federal Coalition to announce that it will cut this funding should it be elected.The message to the Leader of the Opposition is clear. Even members of his own political party, the Liberal Party, believe he is a man drawn to extreme policies and crazy, erratic cuts. This just proves that the coalition are now pledged to diminish the quality of Australian education as a result of their budget reply. It is now crystal clear they are a risk to the economy, they are a risk to local schools and they are a risk to the services that working families rely on.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her new-found interest in accuracy. I refer to the statements which the honourable member referred to. As I said in response to an earlier question, when we are in a process of consultation with the mining industry about a new tax, a range of corporate executives will make a range of statements about that proposition. I also say to the member for Curtin that there has been interesting commentary about those remarks as well, including from former federal leader of the Liberal Party John Hewson, who has described the reaction more generally to the RSPT by certain parts of the mining industry as 'hysterical'. Dr Hewson said:I must say the positions taken by people, whether it is 'Twiggy' Forrest or Jac Nasser - I mean I have these waking up nightmares of Mr Nasser like he used to attack us over tariff protection for the car industry 20 years ago.That is what Dr Hewson said. I do not necessarily endorse what Dr Hewson said at all, but I do draw it to honourable members' attention.I also draw their attention to the fact that Dr Hewson, a former leader of the Liberal Party, has indicated that, in policy terms, these policies are right - 'This is making sure we get the settings right for resources rent tax.' He goes on:I think the resources rent tax has always been on the agenda for serious debate since the middle 1970s. We never got it right. This is a chance to get it right and in particular to deal with the state royalties at the same time as you deal with the federal tax.And so say a large number of other contributors to this debate. I say to the member for Curtin, therefore: reflect carefully on what that former federal leader of the Liberal Party has had to say on this matter, what the former state leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party Mr Brogden has had to say on this matter and even what the WA Premier has had to say on this matter in terms of obtaining a better return for the Australian people and for small business, better super for working families, better infrastructure for the Australian economy and a decent tax break for small business in terms of the $5,000 tax break.Leave not granted.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Newcastle for that question. I know she has been particularly interested in the way that services are provided in the broader Hunter region. I am delighted to be able to tell her and the rest of the House that the implementation of the $275 million commitment to the GP Super Clinics Program has been going well. In fact, I can report to the House that around 50,000 services have already been provided under this GP Super Clinics Program.I can see the member for Paterson smiling. Indeed, he should be. I was in Port Stephens last Monday to officially open the superclinic in Nelson Bay. The superclinic in Nelson Bay was a $2.5 million commitment. The GPs who were successful in their application for the superclinic intend to invest about the same amount themselves in expanding health services around the clinic. This clinic is going to have extended hours of operation. For example, it will be the first GP service open in the region on Sundays. It offers a dedicated service on Tuesday and Thursday mornings for residents of local aged-care facilities. It has received a grant to provide after-hours services as well. Four new GPs, two full-time registered nurses and a wide variety of allied health professionals are going to staff this new clinic. They are going to work in multidisciplinary teams to provide integrated patient-centred care.Of course, this is a fantastic new addition for the community. Unfortunately, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister have turned their backs on these sorts of investments. Communities, like Port Stephens, who put up their hands for a superclinic in the future following the budget commitments made last week will not get support from the Liberal Party. Of course, they are joining a long line of Liberal members who oppose this. The shadow minister for health did not even turn up to the opening of the Strathpine superclinic in his electorate. He might have been busy looking at investments that had to be made! He did not even bother to be there.Not every Liberal MP has given the superclinics program the cold shoulder. In fact, many people on the other side have embraced this idea with open arms. I feel it is necessary to bring some photographic evidence of this fact. I think people should be aware and I should declare first in the parliament that in politics you are sometimes required to do things that you never anticipated you would be required to do. I need to show this photograph taken at the opening of the Port Stephens superclinic. There are three people in it. One of them is Labor's candidate for Paterson, Jim Arneman. He has a big smile on his face. The reason he has a big smile on his face is he was present at the last election when this commitment was made. He is our candidate again and I am sure he, as well as everyone on this side of the House, is delighted that these commitments are being delivered. Not surprisingly, as the health minister I was there at the opening of the superclinic. I did say that not everyone has given the superclinics the cold shoulder. I do need to provide this photo to the House. -  - I did think it was necessary to preface the showing of that photograph with the confession that in politics sometimes you do do things that you never expected you would ever do. There is of course a very serious point to this. There is a reason the member for Paterson was so happy about the superclinic opening in his electorate and there is a reason that communities around the country want these superclinics, and that is that they provide essential services to communities that need them.You may not trust the photographic evidence. Perhaps the reason the member for Newcastle asked this question is that she was watching NBN TV on the night that the opening occurred. Of course, the member for Paterson was quoted on television as saying, 'This has my absolute support,' as indeed it should have. But, unfortunately, 23 additional communities and more than 400 GP practices across the country will not be able to have that benefit because, despite the member for Paterson's words, the rest of the Liberal Party will not support these investments. The Leader of the Opposition, when the Minister for Health and Ageing, pulled a billion dollars out of our hospital system and he is fast already pulling the next billion out with the commitments that they have made in their budget reply.So you do certainly get a sense of 'Here we go again in health'. If you put the Leader of the Opposition anywhere near a health budget, you lose a billion dollars like that. Communities cannot afford this. GP superclinics are good for the community, as the member for Paterson clearly knows. I have taken the liberty of preparing a small gift for him to display in his office of the opening of the superclinic. I hand it over to him now. -  - </DOC>

 - I thank very much the member for Goldstein for his question. If he would care to consult his press secretary, he would find that there is a statement on this matter which I think has been issued by the Treasurer today. I am sure the press secretary is busy with other matters at the moment, but he could pop it into the in-tray. The statement says the analysis is co-authored by Professor Douglas Shackelford and published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. It goes on to make a series of statements about the number of Nobel prize winners et cetera from the NBER. It goes on to say that the analysis has been commented upon by some -  - I am further advised that the analysis is published with acknowledgements to many other leading authorities and refers to a bunch of other institutes including those who participated in the 2009 Institute for Fiscal Studies European Tax Policy Forum Conference et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. - I very much welcome the question from the member for Goldstein because it goes to the whole debate about what constitutes a fair return for mining interests in this country. On this debate about a fair return for mining companies  -  -  - I welcome that interjection by the member for Dickson as I know he is a committed and declared shareholder of BHP. The member for Dickson then left the chamber. 
 - I would simply draw the member for Goldstein's attention to the statement which was put out by the Treasurer this morning and commend his attention to the relevant paragraphs concerning the source of the report. - Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for his question. As I have said on a number of occasions over the past couple of weeks, tax reform has never come easy to Australia but it is the responsibility of the Australian government to actually take on this debate, a responsibility that the previous government shirked. I say that because the only sections of the Australian community arguing at the moment that the resources and petroleum sector in Australia should not pay higher taxation are the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition. In that context, can I say that we are well positioned to have this debate. Australia has come out of the global financial crisis in a very sound position. In many ways we are the envy of the OECD world.The real debate is about how much tax is paid, who collects it and under what system. We should also remind one another that that is not just my view, it is also the view of many in the resources and petroleum sector in Australia. Let us go to the Minerals Council of Australia. This is what they have actually said about a profits based tax debate in Australia:There is a strong argument to reform the basis of determining royalty payments to a profits based criteria from a revenue one.I could not agree more with the Minerals Council of Australia. But I also appreciate that the devil is in the detail. That is why the government is engaged in a very serious process of consultation at the moment. With respect to the requirement of the resources and petroleum sector to pay more taxation in Australia, I remind you of what the CEO of Woodside, Mr Voelte, said on Radio National this morning:In talking to the big miners and the mid cap miners I have not heard that they are not willing to negotiate a different tax and a higher tax back. They want to give a fair share back to the Australian citizens. The key is how you balance the right amount of money back to the citizens versus the economic return on billions and billions of dollars of investment.I agree with Mr Voelte of Woodside. That is where we are at in this debate at the moment - the coalition is opposed to any tax reform in Australia whilst the government seriously engages industry with a view to actually getting the balance right. I say that because shareholders are entitled to a fair return for the purposes of their investments in Australia, but perhaps more importantly we should remind the coalition that so is the Australian community. They only get one chance to develop their finite resources. Those resources are 100 per cent owned by the Australian community.I also remind the House that a number of major resource companies in Australia are also open to this debate. Let me go to what the CEO of BHP Billiton said on 9 May when he was asked, 'But are you opposed to the resources rent tax in principle?' He answered no and went on to say:_ we are not opposed to reform. We're not opposed to any particular form of how that taxation takes place.The reason for that is that the resources and petroleum sector and the Australian community now want some certainty for the purposes of the pipeline of investments that are in place potentially for Australia. They have had a gutful of state and territory governments lifting royalty rates from time to time to suit their short-term circumstances. The Minerals Council submission to the Henry tax review argued for a profits based tax system in Australia to create that certainty. I simply say that I agree with the mining industry. We require certainty. The tax announcements of the government will change that. Yes, they will tax profits at an appropriate rate, but they will also provide certainty and flexibility because you will only pay taxes on the basis of the profits you make.In that context, I refer to an earlier question by the member for Groom who, I might say, should know better. He should go away and re-examine the question given to him by the Leader of the Opposition that he asked today. Clearly that question was carefully choreographed, yet we do not know, from time to time, whether he is telling the truth or not. Let us go to the oil and gas sector tax. That has created certainty in Australia. I remind the member for Groom and the Leader of the Opposition about the introduction of that tax. It goes to the issue of certainty. Esso and BHP actually chose to transition into the petroleum resource rent tax system of Australia, under which the life of the Bass Strait oil and gas reserves was extended for decades.Then he goes to the question of the long-term nature of these investments. Let us go to the issue of Pluto, an investment decision made in 2007. Pluto will export LNG from Australia in the financial year 2010-11. Let us go to the biggest ever LNG investment in Australia. Let us go to the biggest ever single investment in the history of Australia - Gorgon. Gorgon will export LNG from Australia in the financial year 2015-16. We had a debate 25 years ago about the need for tax certainty in Australia - an investment horizon that created attractiveness for investment in Australia whilst creating long-term opportunities for shareholders. Let us go to the nature of that tax in the Gorgon LNG investment decision. I refer to some comments made in Western Australia on the occasion of that investment. I remind the House of what the Chevron vice-chairman, George Kirkland - not known to the Leader of the Opposition because he finds economics and investment in Australia boring but at least known to the member for Groom - said:There's no doubt _ this positions Australia very, very strongly in the gas world. It really and truly does.He then went on to say:The good news is Saudi Arabia is all about oil, and what we're seeing in Australia is all about gas.                _            _            _Asia has been growing, growing significantly. And where's Australia? Great position to really deliver on a cost advantage basis, that market.He went on to say:_ for Chevron we have four focus exploration areas of the world that we push the predominance of our exploration money. Western Australia is one of those and we feed our exploration budget here very well, and we're going to continue to feed it very well, because we have the view that we can grow the resources here _That is because we took on a debate 25 years ago. It was a debate which ensured we had certainty in the tax regime in Australia for the resources and petroleum industry and a debate which ensured the Australian community got a fair return for the development of their resources - 100 per cent owned by the Australian community.That is why this government, unlike the opposition, who should have done this over the previous decade, is committed to putting in place a resources rent tax that provides for the broad development of the Australian resource community and creates efficient and effective mining but also ensures a better return for the Australian community. I simply say to the resources and energy sector and the petroleum sector: there is a genuine process of consultation underway; we are interested in the issues that you are raising; and we are absolutely committed to getting it right. Unlike the opposition, we believe in investment certainty and the right of the Australian community to get a fair return on their investments. The only people arguing against higher taxation for the resources sector in Australia are Tony Abbott and the opposition, because all they are interested in are grubby donations from certain sectors of the Australian community. - </DOC>

 - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and where is the member for Goldstein's press secretary when you need him. He digs himself in on a question about which the opposition are most sensitive, which is the actual level of taxation paid by the Australian mining industry. He refers in particular to the publication from the NBER, and he says that the NBER does not publish these sorts of publications. One piece of information I have from the National Bureau of Economic Research is an NBER publication by Douglas Shackelford of June 2009 entitled, Do multinationals or domestic firms face higher effective tax and rates? written with Kevin S. Markle. That is what it says - with him. That is actually listed under NBER publications by Douglas Shackelford.What I find stunning about the use of question time for this purpose is that it actually seeks to mask the opposition's refusal to engage in the substance of the debate, which is the best form of taxation for the Australian mining industry. Firstly, what grows the industry over time? Our answer is a profits based tax; not a volumes based tax. Secondly, we have the example of the PRRT as to how it has worked over time. Now by their questions they are walking away from the PRRT. Thirdly, with the RSPT we bring in a new system of proposed taxation which provides an upfront assistance to industries to offset their costs involved in the initial investment in order to broaden the base of the industry. That is what we are seeking to do. This is the basis of the reforms that we are advancing and the projections contained in the papers provided by the Treasury and the Econtech modelling, which underpin that the long-term growth of the industry increases by 5.5 per cent as a result of these reforms.Those opposite, consistent with their engagement on every matter of policy - whether it is health policy, education policy or any other form of policy including Work Choices - are negative, consistently attacking and never provide an alternative. I would just draw their attention, again, to the former head of the Liberal Party, Dr John Hewson, and his remarks, the former head of the New South Wales Liberal Party, Mr Brogden, and his remarks and also to the earlier endorsement of the PRRT by the former Treasurer of Australia, Peter Costello.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fowler for her question. The reforms announced by the government do act on our commitment to improve our superannuation system and ensure that some of the social dividend from the mining boom is directly channelled into national savings. This is a long-term economic reform which will have long-term benefits.I am asked by the member for Fowler about those benefits for young people. I can inform the House that an 18-year-old entering the workforce today will be $200,000 better off at retirement because of these reforms. This is important when you consider the amount of time that 18-year-old will need to spend in retirement. The expected time spent in retirement, because we are all living longer, will almost double from 1960 when it was 12.5 years to 22.4 years when we get to the year 2050. When it comes time for today's 18-year-olds to retire from the workforce they will need enough retirement income to last at least 22 years. It stands to reason that those who will be in the workforce longest under this reform system will be those who benefit very substantially.The member for Fowler asked me what threats there are to Australia building a world-class retirement income, and the threat sits opposite. Last week the opposition got around to announcing their response to the budget. In their own special way they responded to the government's budget. The member for Goldstein released a list of things that would be cut. This list confirmed that the opposition opposes the increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. They oppose the re-funding of the contributions tax to low income earners, and they oppose allowing people over 50 to make concessional top-up payments to their superannuation funds. They also oppose paying workers aged between 70 and 75 superannuation.It was this last one that really got my attention. I get a lot of letters about this from older workers in the workforce saying, 'Why should we be discriminated against just because we turn 70? Why shouldn't we receive superannuation payments?' The government considered this and, in order to encourage workforce participation and in order to deal with this discrimination, we announced that we will change the law and will have superannuation guarantee payments for people aged 70 to 75. The opposition oppose this as part of their savings measures. I thought this was a bit curious because this measure does not cost the government any money. They included as a savings measure the abolition of a measure which does not cost money because people who receive superannuation payments for the first time pay tax and this will increase government revenue by $15 million. So the opposition hate superannuation so much that they use as a savings measure the abolition of a measure which will actually make the government money. That is how much they are opposed to the retirement incomes of Australians. This takes their sloppiness to new heights.Their inconsistencies do not end there. One month ago the shadow minister for superannuation - and, yes, there is one; it is the member for Cowper - gave a speech to the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees. It was a scripted, written speech. As far as we know the member for Cowper might have even rehearsed in front of the mirror, so we should have been able to take what he said as the gospel truth. He said that the opposition in government would allow people over 50 to make concessional top-ups to their superannuation payments. That was a commitment from the shadow minister for superannuation. It lasted one month.On 19 April this was announced as policy by the shadow minister for superannuation. On 19 May, the shadow minister for finance announced this was no longer opposition policy; it had been discontinued. It lasted a month. Their commitment to people aged over 50 lasted a month. How inconsistent can you be? But the Leader of the Opposition is probably very pleased with this. He is probably pleased with the inconsistency. I noticed in the Financial Review today the former Leader of the Opposition and former Leader of the Liberal Party, John Hewson - somebody who knows the current leader very well - said that the Leader of the Opposition thinks:_ consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds.That is the view of the Leader of the Opposition, and that was just before John Hewson said:Tony is genuinely innumerate - that he finds economics 'boring' - He has no interest in economics and he has no feeling for it.That is what Professor John Hewson thinks of the current Leader of the Opposition. That is what he thinks of his economic skills. So we should not be surprised about this inconsistency and this complete lack of economic policy skills from the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow treasurer, who together are the weakest frontbench economics team from opposition in living memory. But we will not be distracted by the inconsistency and the myopia of those opposite. We will continue with our policy of improving the retirement incomes -  - It fell to the Labor Party in the 1990s to introduce a national superannuation scheme, against the opposition of the Liberal Party. It now falls to the Labor Party to strengthen the national superannuation scheme in a reform that will have lasting benefits for decades.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question. I am familiar with the company, Shenhua, and I have known of its operations for many, many years. The particular project that the honourable member refers to in his part of Australia I am not familiar with. But I have listened very carefully to his question and he goes to the core point of environmental approvals. I do not know what stage those approvals are at and the extent to which they currently involve both the state and federal governments, given that it involves not just the water system but I presume other environmental dimensions as well. On the question of statements made by Shenhua from Beijing on this, that it is their predisposition to proceed with this project prior to approvals being granted, prima facie I would find that unacceptable in terms of the provisions of Australian law. However, as the member has raised it, I will go into the detail of the matter and report back to him separately on it. As for visiting the area, given he has raised it in this place, either I or another minister of the government, as appropriate, will seek to visit the area with the honourable member to ascertain what the best way forward is.</DOC>

 - I am in his fan club because he is a very strong advocate for his area of the importance of trade, in particular the relationship with China. The recent visit had three purposes. The first was the annual economic dialogue that we engage in with China, now Australia's largest trading partner and the fastest growing nation in the world. As nations, our two economic areas of activity are intricately entwined. The economic dialogue provided the opportunity not just to review where we are at but also to talk about how we could strengthen that relationship, in particular diversify it. We had good discussions about opportunities in the services sector and in advanced manufacturing. It was a very rewarding dialogue indeed.The second part of the visit was to continue what we have referred to as the second-track approach to China. Members would be aware that we have not yet been able to conclude the free trade agreement, but we are making progress. The important thing though is that we have not let this deter us from looking for commercial opportunities in key regions and key cities in China. I visited the Shandong province and the governor from that province is going to visit this country later this year. They are very keen to develop an MOU with the Australian government as a region on the basis of key areas of their interest. We look forward to that visit. That engagement with the Shandong province builds on many more engagements that we have already had and under which we have signed six MOUs with various cities and regions within China.The third dimension of the visit was to visit the Australian pavilion at the largest expo ever held in the world being held in Shanghai at the moment. The Australian pavilion is a magnificent structure. It was formally opened by the foreign minister. This pavilion is now receiving up to 40,000 visitors a day, close to 800,000 visitors have already gone through and the Australian draw on a daily basis is in the order of 15 to 20 per cent. It is one of the most visited pavilions in the whole of the expo site. Beyond it being a striking feature and a drawcard in its own right, the Australian pavilion has been an important platform on which Australia has engaged some of the key sectors I have spoken of before. We conducted forums in relation to financial services, sustainable building and urban design, as well as the auto sector. Sustainable building is a vital area of opportunity. In the next two decades, China is going to have to house 300 million people. This will be the biggest urban development in the history of the world and they are looking to countries such as Australia to advise them on smart buildings, clean energy, recycling and clever design. So those platforms are particularly important. The expo also provided us with the opportunity to launch internationally 'Brand Australia', an exciting new concept which will present, in a multifaceted way, the great things Australia does on so many different fronts. More than just a tourist destination, this is a great place to invest, to do business and to trade on so many fronts.It was a very worthwhile visit. There will be many more to that part of the world. China, as I said at the outset, is our largest trading partner at the moment. It is going to have a significant bearing on the economic future of this country, as is Australia on theirs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. When the various installers were here in Australia some time ago, we did indicate that there would be a replacement scheme. 
 - We are in Australia, yes! - We did indicate when they were here in Canberra that there would be a replacement scheme. We also indicated at the time that safety would be first priority. That is why, having commissioned the Hawke review and obtained its recommendations, it was decided, based on those recommendations, that we should not proceed with the replacement scheme because safety could not be guaranteed. I draw honourable member's attention also to the fact that we have now committed $56 million to assist insulation workers and companies affected by the closure of the Home Insulation Program.

 - I want to thank the member for Hasluck for her question. She knows, as well as people on this side of the House, that housing affordability is intricately and directly linked to housing supply. We have not been building enough homes across Australia for at least a decade now. Because of that, we have seen price pressure both on homes for people to buy and on homes for people to rent. Of course the previous government ignored this problem for 11 years. The only real moves they made in housing were to cut $3 billion from housing programs during 11 years in government.In contrast, since coming to government we have helped almost a quarter of a million young Australians into a home of their own through the first home owners boost. In the member for Hasluck's state, Western Australia, the number is 28,800 first home buyers who have been helped by the first home owners boost. We have also supported the building of thousands of affordable rental properties through our National Rental Affordability Scheme and other programs. I have been very pleased with the uptake of the National Rental Affordability Scheme. In fact, in the first two rounds of the scheme we have approved 11,000 National Rental Affordability Scheme properties. In this current round, round 3, which is open until the end of August, we have so far received eight applications from right across the country for over 12,000 National Rental Affordability Scheme incentives. I am very pleased to inform the House today that the first major proposal in round 3 is from Western Australia, from a wholesale company called Yaran, which specialises in affordable housing projects. They are building across 47 sites, right across WA, more than 1,100 new homes for Western Australians which will be offered at affordable rentals.Of course that is terrific news for those families in Western Australia. The homes are spread right across the Perth region. Yaran is the name of the company, and the homes are spread right across the Perth region from Mandurah in the far south to Merriwa in the outer north. The projects are proposed for regional areas like Denmark, Mount Barker and Bridgetown in the south-west as well, and I am sure that the member for Hasluck is very happy to know that up to 170 of these new homes will be in her electorate alone. That goes with the 20 homes in the first two rounds of the National Rental Affordability Scheme at Gosnells and Midland and with the 53 homes built through the stimulus package - social housing homes, including the 16 that we have visited together, which were being built for seniors in Gosnells. So there are 243 new rental homes for the member for Hasluck's seat as part of about 4,000 new rental properties right across Western Australia. And it is not just the new rental properties; it is new homes to buy. Through the Housing Affordability Fund we will see a total of $31½ million going to WA for 13 projects, saving homebuyers in Western Australia around $16½ thousand on about 1,820 new homes and housing lots.In the Hasluck electorate, the City of Gosnells has received over a million dollars from the Housing Affordability Fund, and 100 homebuyers will receive discounts of around $11,000 each on their homes. This is a massive investment in housing right across WA, a state that desperately needs affordable rental housing and affordable homes for people to buy. This investment means more homes sooner and better affordability for those Western Australians who want a home to buy, to live in or to rent.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for education for his question, and I await his explanation of the $425 million they want to rip out of quality teaching and the more than $3 billion they want to rip out of education after having governed for almost 12 long years, a wasted decade. But, on the question that the shadow minister has asked me, I will take some advice from the Attorney-General about whether he has breached the copyright of the Australian newspaper. Should it turn out that he has breached that copyright, then I am sure that publishers of the Australian newspaper will take the appropriate action. Having seen the story in the Australian newspaper from which the photograph has come and which has just been held up to the House, I read the words in the newspaper as well. -  -  -  - If only they put such energy into developing policies and their budget reply! Coming back to the question from the shadow minister for education, brought to you by the Australian newspaper, yes, I did see the story. Of course, as I have said on the public record on a number of occasions, often the cost comparisons we see published are not correct. But I am very determined that we see value for money. I want every dollar that goes to schools to make the biggest difference for schools. That is why I have appointed the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce, led by a leading Australian businessman, Brad Orgill, to focus on these questions. I say to the members opposite: if they actually have any serious concerns they should research them themselves, as opposed to just reading things in the media. If they ever spend just one minute doing any work and if they actually have a complaint then they can raise it with the implementation task force.On the matter of photographs and Building the Education Revolution, I am very happy to say to the House that I have some photographs, and I would love to see them in the Australian newspaper. In this photograph we have the member for Fairfax breaking into song because he is so happy, at the opening of a Building the Education Revolution project in his electorate, at Kenilworth State Community College. - There he is, sitting next to the President of the Senate, John Hogg. Once again, he is very happy to be there, at the opening of a Building the Education Revolution project. I look forward to seeing that photo in the Australian. But then there are some members -  - Obviously, what we never see on display from the shadow minister is intelligence or policy other than cutbacks. But, in conclusion, there are some members of the opposition who are so exhausted from turning up at all of their Building the Education Revolution openings - to try and associate themselves with a program that they have opposed in this place - that some of them, like the member for Gilmore, actually send a staff member to the sod-turning because it is all just too much for them to get to every opening. That is the real picture from the opposition on Building the Education Revolution. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question and indeed for her welcome back to the electorate of Page last week, where I announced community infrastructure projects in Grafton and Kyogle. Later that day I was in Parkes, announcing a project in Moree. The member for Parkes chose a different path. He was in Moree in the morning, but he left before we made the announcement giving grants in Moree.An opposition member - He didn't hear you were coming. - He did hear I was coming. I rang him, as I always do.The Rudd government's third budget injected an additional $1 billion into the Australian Rail Track Corporation. Last Thursday I visited Broken Hill, a place where investment and jobs are welcomed. As result of our record investment, we will see re-railing and re-sleepering from Broken Hill to Parkes in the east and re-railing from Broken Hill to Whyalla in the west, not only creating jobs directly in construction but also creating jobs in manufacturing. Overall, 600 jobs will be created, through that project, in regional Australia. We have now more than quadrupled our investment in rail. It has been welcomed in other parts of regional Australia as well, where two-thirds of our $37 billion nation-building infrastructure investment is going. We are creating jobs, strengthening local communities and building the transport infrastructure that will secure our prosperity for the long term.After this announcement last Tuesday, I waited with some anticipation for the opposition leader's budget reply. I must say I was somewhat disappointed. I waited because I thought we were going to get a considered, well thought out, well-structured, gospel truth statement from the opposition leader. We did get that. After he had been part of a government that presided over an infrastructure deficit and ignored 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank, the number of mentions of infrastructure made by the Leader of the Opposition in the opposition's budget reply speech was exactly zero. I thought, 'Given that he's flicked it to the shadow Treasurer, we might get something of substance about infrastructure, dealing with capacity constraints and growing productivity from the shadow Treasurer in the National Press Club speech.'The shadow treasurer did manage to mention infrastructure during his National Press Club debacle. He did at least get to it. He made four comments about infrastructure. The first thing he said was that he had what he thought was a new idea: he would actually get an incoming government to undertake an audit of Australia's infrastructure needs. Sound familiar? Done - done by the Rudd government, done by Infrastructure Australia. The first thing they did was an audit of Australia's infrastructure. They reported to the Council of Australian Governments in December 2008 - tick, done.I go to the second thing that the shadow treasurer said. He said they would 'better utilise existing infrastructure'. If he had actually read the report, he could have read page 28 and the chapter on - wait for it - better use of existing infrastructure. Done. He had a third position in this great announcement, having done nothing for 12 years. He said they would look at access in terms of infrastructure. He could have gone to section 2.4A, 'Open access to infrastructure', in the audit report.Then he said a fourth thing. He said they would work with the private sector to help address the infrastructure deficit that the Howard government had left behind. He could have gone to pages 72, 73 and 74, the whole chapter about financing of infrastructure, including how you mobilise private-sector infrastructure financing. Or he could have welcomed the changes that we made in the budget to provide incentives for private investment in corporate bonds for infrastructure - in the budget on Tuesday night, ignored by those opposite. But instead we got absolutely no new ideas, no new initiatives and no alternative proposals.When the pass-the-parcel game ended with the member for Goldstein finally making a statement, it was plain to see that there is no funding for the promises that the coalition has been making locally in electorates right around the country. We know from the finance minister's answer that they have got a disclaimer: disregard all previous comments; all previous commitments are not worth anything. They are worth as much as a statement from the Leader of the Opposition. So no funding for the members for Gippsland, Gilmore, Wide Bay, Maranoa and Dickson. They have all been out there promising major infrastructure spending and we now know that that is all gone.There is one thing that was in the statement. Members would recall that during the last sitting week I made a statement about the commitment by one of the former ministers for infrastructure to the Toowoomba bypass. I informed the House that that was worth $1.75 billion. How do we know it is worth $1.75 billion? Because after the member for Groom promised in his first election campaign that he would deliver on this and mentioned it in his first speech, they did nothing about it until 2006. Then they set up an inquiry to look at costings of this road, the Toowoomba bypass. It was their costings that costed it at $1.75 billion, yet in the document they have allowed $280 million. The bypass has become a footpath. You cannot build the Toowoomba bypass for $280 million. You are treating the Australian people like mugs. Those opposite could not walk away completely from their commitment so they came up with $280 million. Phony Tony and his colleagues are treating the Australian public like mugs. They say one thing in their electorate but they do something else when they come here. - I will indeed, Mr Speaker. On Wednesday of this week I was due to debate the fourth shadow minister for infrastructure at the National Press Club. This is a bloke who never misses an opportunity - he does not have an office in Parliament House; he lives at Sky News, in the studios. But he will not debate me about infrastructure at the National Press Club because they are simply unaccountable. - I wouldn't raise the National Press Club if I were you, Joe. I wouldn't raise it, mate. It is a nightmare. - To assist the shadow treasurer and the latest shadow minister for infrastructure, I table the Infrastructure Australia audit already done and reported to COAG.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the Leader of the Opposition. It goes to the fundamental need to reform the tax system for the Australian mining industry and to use the revenues which would come from that reform to fund better super for all Australians, better tax cuts for all Australian businesses and, on top of that, better investment in Australian infrastructure for the future.The Leader of the Opposition refers to the effective tax rates for particular mining companies and the industry at large. I draw his attention to a Treasury Roundup article released today which says that Treasury's analysis shows that the resources sector faces an average company tax rate about 12 per cent lower than the average tax rate across all industries. This is because of the very generous tax concessions that the mining sector enjoys, which reduces their headline rate of company tax. A separate Treasury minute to the Treasurer notes that the average company tax rate for the mining sector was 17 per cent in the decade of 2004-05, compared with 19 per cent for construction, 27 per cent for transport and 29 per cent for finance. The Treasury minute notes that the findings in the Roundup article for mining are similar to those in the Markle and Shackelford 2009 paper. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition acquaint himself with economic fact rather than simply act as the puppet of the MCA in this place.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The question was about the fraudulent use of Australian passports -  - I did not hear the interjection, so it is of no moment to me. The question was about the fraudulent use of Australian passports, the risks to the integrity of the Australian passport system and the risks to Australia's national interest, as my statement to the House yesterday refers. The government is in no doubt that Israel was responsible for the fraud involving Australian passports connected with the assassination in Dubai of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. While Israel is and was a firm friend of Australia, this action was not the act of a friend, and I have made that point consistently. Regrettably, this was not the first time that Israel has misused Australian passports. That occurred previously. As a consequence of that breach, an understanding was reached between Australian and Israeli agencies that this would not be repeated. So what has occurred is in express and direct breach of an understanding reached between Australian and Israeli agencies during the period of the previous government.The government's decision and judgment in this matter have been based at all times on national security considerations and, importantly, on the advice of relevant national security agencies - the Australian Federal Police, ASIO, ASIS and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Both the government's consideration and those agencies' considerations have involved very careful, exhaustive investigations and assessments, careful consideration and the weighting of the importance to Australia's national security of the integrity of our passport system. No government can guarantee that any passport system is foolproof but, equally, no government can stand idly by and turn a blind eye when anyone, including a foreign government, another country, fraudulently abuses the integrity of our passport system and abuses our trust and our confidence.The advice that was given to me and to the National Security Committee of the Cabinet yesterday was in substance the same advice given to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for foreign affairs. She received a briefing yesterday. It is the second briefing that she has received on this matter; she received a briefing from agencies when the matter first came to public attention.I was surprised in March when the Leader of the Opposition in response to a newspaper interview, before the completion of the AFP inquiry and before, as I understand it, any briefing he had, made the public comment that he did not believe the government should take any action in this matter. I thought that was unwise. In these matters I think that you are always best off carefully considering, acting on advice, weighting that advice, and weighing up the heavy responsibility and often difficult judgments about national security considerations.If I was surprised by the Leader of the Opposition, I must say that I was shocked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's response yesterday - absolutely shocked. As I said, yesterday before I got to my feet in the parliament she had received a briefing from relevant security agencies - the Australian Federal Police, ASIO, ASIS and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - and the substance of the briefing was exactly the same as the substance of the briefing which the government itself received.I am asked about risks to these matters. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said that the government's decision was wrong because it was based on political considerations, that it was done for United Nations Security Council purposes, that there is no evidence or proof that Israel was responsible for these matters, and that the government's decision in asking Israel to remove one of its officials from the embassy was an 'overreaction'.I choose my words carefully. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition makes a point about evidence. She is aware as a result of the briefing that she received yesterday that, while the decision was not based on evidence of a kind which could lead to law enforcement action before a criminal court, it was a decision based on a considered judgment shared by relevant Australian security agencies. It was also a decision which, she well knows, included reasons and information which, for reasons of national security, I could not share with the Australian public, but which were shared with her by our security agencies. That is why I was absolutely shocked when she conducted herself in the manner in which she did. The decision and the judgment which the Australian government have made have at all times taken into account the national security considerations of the Commonwealth. -  - She is now complaining that I am asserting that she breached the confidentiality of the briefing. I am not saying that. In the face of a briefing, you went out and said that the reasons the government has made this decision are, firstly, for political considerations and, secondly, for United Nations Security Council considerations. Thirdly, you said it was an overreaction. Let me make this point to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: when she received the briefing from the national security agencies, as did the government, none of those national security agencies had in their minds when they were carefully weighting their advice to the government what she would describe as 'political considerations' or the United Nations Security Council.They had in their minds, as did the government, the integrity of our passport system, the protection of our national security interest, and what you have done in your response yesterday and today has shown that you are not fit to occupy a position of trust in the national security environment. -  - That is what she has shown. -  - I have also seen the assertion that somehow this was the first occasion in which an Australian government has asked the Israeli embassy to remove an officer. This is not true. - I am not saying that you said it. I have seen the assertion. The assertion was made to me on television. In 2004 when the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition were cabinet ministers, the previous government on the advice of the national security agencies asked the Israeli embassy to remove an officer for national security reasons of which, for example, the member for Berowra is well aware. On that occasion there was no assertion from anyone that somehow this was done for political considerations or other motivations.Historically in this place people have understood the framework of national security considerations within which we work. I do not like to see national security considerations become a political football, but that is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has done. That is not the context in which the Labor Party when in opposition responded when for national security considerations on the basis of national security agency advice the previous government asked the Israeli embassy to remove an officer. We did not turn that into a political football - and the examples are comparable. When governments seriously, sensibly, carefully make national security considerations they do so after carefully weighing up the advice from the national security agencies and that is what we did.I am asked about risks. There is a substantial and significant risk to the national security interests of the Commonwealth. There is a substantial and significant risk to the integrity of our passport system. If what we have seen and if what we have considered is not enough for the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to regard appropriate action being taken, action more than an expression of concern, what is required in their view? What do we need to see to destroy the integrity of our passport system? What do we need to see to destroy our national security interest? What do we need to see to have an attack upon our sovereignty before they would act? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has shown by her response to this matter that she is not fit to occupy a position sitting around the National Security Committee of the Cabinet.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the opposition on tax reform and the benefits to which that reform would be put - better super for working Australians, less tax for Australian companies, tax breaks for small business and investment in infrastructure. - The member for Goldstein refers to a paper entitled Disparities in average rates of company tax across industries. The authors are as specified earlier. I recall a question yesterday from the member for North Sydney, the shadow Treasurer, asking for the government to bring forward substantiating material concerning the government's position on current tax arrangements for the mining industry. In response to that request yesterday, the Treasury brought forward a Treasury note. And in response to that the member for Goldstein stands up and objects to its contents because it concludes that the average company tax rate of the mining sector was 17 per cent in the decade to 2004-05. That is precisely what I said before. It compares that to construction, at 19 per cent; transport, at 27 per cent; and finance, at 29 per cent. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition read the paper from the Treasury, digest its contents and stop simply acting as the mouthpiece of the MCA. I suggest he undertake some independent research, which might be in the national economic interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin very much for his question. This government believes in a strong economy. It is a government which believes in ensuring that the strength of our economy underpins a fair go for all Australians and enables us to protect Australian jobs. - The government has kept the Australian economy strong during the global economic recession by preventing it from going into recession. The opposition said, 'Do nothing.' The opposition said that it was better in effect for the Australian economy to stand unprotected from the ravages of the global recession. The Leader of the Opposition said that his prescription for the future was to do what New Zealand did. What New Zealand did was to go into recession for 1¼ years.Secondly, the Australian government is keeping the Australian economy strong, as underpinned by the delivery of the government's budget, which halves net peak debt, which brings back the budget to surplus in three years time, three years ahead of time. This is a core achievement in keeping the economy strong. Despite all we saw with the three-ring circus last week from those opposite, masquerading as a budget reply, those opposite still cannot nominate the year in which they would return the budget to surplus.Thirdly, the government is keeping the economy strong by continuing its program of implementing long-term reforms in the economy. That means reforms through the education revolution, reforms in nation-building infrastructure and reforms also in creating a seamless national economy - all of which are designed to lift productivity growth. That includes also the reform of the taxation system.There is one core fact about our proposed reform of the tax system - that is, it asks mining companies to pay a fairer share to the Australian people for the resource which the Australian people ultimately own. Furthermore, it says that the revenue derived from that fairer share will then be used to fund better super for working families. It will also be used to fund tax cuts for all Australian businesses - for small business in particular - and will be used for investing in our future infrastructure needs.For the economy at large, what this means is boosting our global competitiveness by bringing the Australian company tax rate down, boosting our national savings - a very big buffer in times of global economic crisis - and, on top of that, ensuring that we have a consistent national taxation regime for the mining industry, as opposed to the patchwork of royalties regimes which are based on volumes rather than profits, and that assists the mining industry to grow over time.Mention has already been made in question time today of the contribution to our national interest of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I also refer to further comments she has made in the national economic interest, in this case, when it comes to this debate on tax. Yesterday she said the mining industry did not need to pay more tax. Contrary to what the WA Liberal Premier has said, which is that the mining industry is getting away with blue murder, and contrary to the fact that we have even the CEO of Woodside saying that mining companies can pay more tax, instead what we have is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying that, in effect -  - I notice the interjection from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She contests the accuracy of what I have just said. I draw the attention of the House to the following:Question: Given their profits and the fact that these are our resources, they are not renewable, are they paying enough tax?Deputy Leader of the Opposition: I believe that they are paying a fair amount of tax.Any suggestion that that is misleading or misrepresenting the Deputy Leader of the Opposition suggests to me that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is having a casual relationship with the truth.I go back to the core position which she advances. Despite what the Liberal Premier of WA says and despite what everyone else says, she has said on behalf of the opposition that the mining industry is paying enough tax. Well, there is a new development, and I turn to no-one other than Senator Barnaby Joyce. Let's hear it for Barnaby! Barnaby entered the debate today as the shadow minister for infrastructure - onya, Barnaby! Question to Barnaby:So you believe that the mining industry shouldn't have to pay more tax than it is at the moment? I just want to clarify that point.Senator Joyce: I'm prepared for people to look at the mining sector to pay more tax.So in the space of 24 hours we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying they pay enough tax and we have the shadow minister for infrastructure saying that in fact they can pay more tax, and should pay more tax. Two contradictory positions within 24 hours. Of course, there is the third position on tax. It is the Leader of the Opposition's position on tax, which is that he is going to tax the mining companies anyway through his great new big tax on everybody in order to fund his PPL. Three different tax positions. Coalition tax policy No. 1: the Julie policy, which says they should not have to pay any more tax. - Coalition tax policy No. 2: the Senator Barnaby Joyce policy, which says the mining companies should pay more tax. Coalition tax policy No. 3: the Leader of the Opposition's policy, which says they will be paying more tax, it is just that they are going to be paying it through the PPL.What we have seen is complete shambles and chaos on the part of those opposite, not just last week in delivering their budget reply but also in the coherence of their tax policy. With each policy they have outlined - 1, 2 and 3 - it fundamentally contradicts the others; it cancels out the one that had been delivered just before. I say to those opposite: if you are serious about managing a budget, you have got to get a budget reply right; if you are serious about a tax policy, you have got to have one policy not three policies; if you are serious about managing an economy, you have got to demonstrate some interest in the economy; and if you cannot even manage your party on tax policy, what hope have you got of managing the country?</DOC>

 - We would hope in this parliament that the man who puts himself forward as the alternative Treasurer of Australia would actually sit down and do some economic work. In the course of the last week we have not seen an economic team at work; we have seen a three-ring circus. The member for Goldstein said that the Leader of the Opposition would answer all questions on the budget and return to surplus. He did not do it. The Leader of the Opposition said that the member for North Sydney would do it. He did not do it. The member for North Sydney said the member for Goldstein would do it. Then the member for Goldstein eventually did it, until his press secretary told him to stop. We welcome a special media award being established in the name of Robbie's press secretary, because I believe he is a man of direct action, to paraphrase -  - a comment used by the Leader of the Opposition before. The member for North Sydney asked a question about the taxation treatment of utilities in this country. He knows full well that, because of the nature of utilities and the accelerated depreciation on large assets within that sector, it has a particular set of taxation arrangements - anyone knows that - because of the fundamental role utilities provide in the economy for the provision of basic services. The member for North Sydney should listen carefully to what people like Peter Costello have said before, when he said in response to the PRRT that that is the sort of tax on profits we need for this country for the future. That is why he kept it in place, for the entire period that he was Treasurer of the Commonwealth, as a resource rent tax based on profits, not based on volume. Not only did he say that but the former Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer, said that as well. In fact, those of a reformist bent of mind responsible for economic policy on the benches opposite in times past have stood behind that principle as it goes to the PRRT. John Hewson, a previous Leader of the Liberal Party, has come out in support of the RSPT concept as a new resource tax as it relates to onshore resources, as has John Brogden, the former Liberal Party leader in New South Wales.It is very easy for the member for North Sydney to stand up and just deliver a scare campaign. That is what they seem to do. But when it comes to core economic reform, the serious contributions of the likes of Peter Costello and others in the past, and the commentary by John Hewson and others formerly associated with the Liberal Party on the proposal now before the nation, it is time that the member for North Sydney actually sat down and did a bit of work rather than just engage in populist low-rent politics.The views in this article are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the Australian Treasury.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lowe for his question. It is certainly true that accurate accounting for proposals for savings is critical to returning the budget to surplus. Members will be aware that over some months I have been asking the opposition to put forward its savings proposals that would back up its claims to returning the budget to surplus more quickly than the government proposes to do.Last week, in a highly entertaining three-ring circus, as the Prime Minister described it, we finally got an outcome after the member for Goldstein indicated that the savings would be in the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply. The Leader of the Opposition then indicated in his budget reply that they would be in the shadow Treasurer's speech to the National Press Club. Then the shadow Treasurer, at his speech to the Press Club, said they would be in a subsequent press conference from the member for Goldstein. We finally got a statement on proposed budget savings from the opposition.At first light it had a very big number on it. It had a very big headline number of $46.7 billion. Initially, I was almost impressed by this. I thought, 'Gee, they have done all right here.' But, unfortunately, I then started to read the savings proposals and, sadly, they did not stand up to much scrutiny. In fact, if you took that $46.7 billion and rubbed out the '4' then you would still have an overstatement of the net impact on the budget bottom line. You could take out the digit '4'and you would still have an overstatement on the beneficial impact on the budget bottom line of the proposed savings of the opposition.Let me run through a few examples. First - and most egregiously - they quote their proposal to not proceed with the government's resource super profits tax as a saving. A small bit of news for the opposition and their economic gurus: when you cancel out tax revenue, that is not a saving to the budget; that is a loss to the budget. So $12 billion straight off the top has gone - dead. Next, we have capital savings. They do concede in the fine print that these do not hit the budget bottom line, so there is a total of $22 billion. These are simply figures that the opposition have made up. There is no substantiation for their proposed sale price for Medibank Private and there is no substantiation for the $18 billion they claim would be removed from the budget by not proceeding with the capital item for the National Broadband Network.Then we have $3.5 billion worth of proposed savings that have a little asterisk beside them. It is a very small asterisk: it would be about four point. There is a very small note at the bottom that says, 'These items may be used to finance coalition commitments in the same area.' In other words, they will not really be savings; they are going to spend the money by rebadging these things or in a different way. Then there is $2.4 billion of claimed savings on interest from the refusal to proceed with the National Broadband Network. This is a figure that has simply been plucked out of thin air - created, fictitious and has no substantiation or reflection in any budget items.Then we have the proposed freeze on the Australian Public Service. That has morphed around a bit. A few things have been added here and there that would not be subject to the freeze but, allegedly, that saves $3.8 billion. Unfortunately, the opposition neglected to note that when you freeze Public Service numbers in enforcement agencies - for example, people in the Australian Taxation Office chasing tax avoidance activities - you lose revenue. The estimate of the equivalent loss of revenue as a result of cutting back on staff chasing people like tax avoiders and welfare rorters is $2.1 billion in lost revenue. Finally, there are a few classic proposals, a few absolutely sensational proposals, supposedly cutting back on Public Service travel, government advertising and consultancies.The interesting thing about all these proposals, which add up to about $800 million, is that they are all areas where spending has been cut back very substantially by this government after the massive explosion in spending by the Howard government. The same people who let spending blow out are now claiming that they will be able to reduce spending below the level to which it has already been cut by the Rudd government. The savings package is totally phoney.I note that I am not the only person who was less than impressed by the performance of the member for Goldstein in presenting this savings package at his press conference. In fact, his own media adviser, who I think is named Nicholas Troja, did not seem to like the proposition much either because he spent most of his time doing this or doing this and turning away. It is on YouTube and it is really worth a look. I am delighted that the member for Goldstein is employing people who are obviously concerned about fiscal responsibility. It is just a pity he is not taking their advice. If the opposition want to be treated seriously on these matters, they have got a lot more work to do. - I think if the member for O'Connor types in 'Andrew Robb's staffer' he would be able to view the video. -  
An opposition member - Are you going to ask him? - No. - No. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question on the resources super profits tax, because it is a core element of the government's tax reform plans for better super for working families, lower tax for small business and, of course, investing in infrastructure. The member for North Sydney referred to a research paper; I think it was from Citigroup - is that right, Joe? - I am just checking whether it was. As the member for North Sydney would know, there would be a range of opinions on the impact of the government's proposed taxation arrangements when it comes to the mining sector in particular and the economy in general. I draw the honourable member's attention to a note released today by Macquarie Research Strategy, by Rory Robertson, which says:So Canberra's objective today is not so much to increase taxes on the resources sector as simply to return payments to the public purse from mining company profits to the sorts of shares observed less than a decade ago.The bottom line is this: when it comes to the return to the Australian taxpayer from the mining sector, 10 years ago one dollar in every three in profits came back to the taxpayer through royalties; 10 years later, one dollar in seven comes back to the taxpayer through royalties. The Leader of the Opposition asked a question about corporate tax - well, come in, spinner! - because if you add the royalties to resource taxes and the company tax rate, in 1999-2000 to 2003-04, you will have royalties, resource taxes and company tax representing 55 per cent in profits and, in 2008-09, you will have royalties, resource taxes and company tax representing 27 per cent of profits.This is the data contained in this research note from Macquarie Research, which was just put out today. The bottom line is that the total tax take of these companies, including all forms of tax, when measured against profits has halved over the last decade. What we stand for as a government, therefore, is to get a fair share back for the Australian people from a resource which is owned by the Australian people. Miners do deserve a fair share for their investment, and the Australian people deserve a fair share because the resource is also owned by them.But, given that the member for North Sydney has asked this question about clarity concerning our tax policy and its impact, it is only fair for me to conclude by asking: what actually is the tax policy of those opposite? Is it Julie's policy? Is it Barnaby's policy? Is it Julie's policy, which says that the mining industry is paying enough tax, or Barnaby's policy, which says that they should be paying more tax? Maybe what we should do, given this lack of clarity, is get it in writing from the Leader of the Opposition, because we then know it will be the full, gospel truth as to what the tax policy of those opposite is. At present, it is chaos and confusion.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for that very important question because we have been having a discussion about this in various ways through question time today. Of course what the government has done is outlined a plan to modernise our taxation system particularly as it applies to non-renewable mineral resources.Those opposite do not seem to have the most basic understanding of why a resource superprofits tax should be replacing royalties. They do not seem to understand to begin with that royalties are there as a charge for non-renewable mineral resources. That is, they are 100 per cent owned by the Australian people. That is what is different about royalties; they are 100 per cent owned by the Australian people and they are, of course, a non-renewable resource. Once they are dug up they are gone forever. That is why mining companies must pay royalties. But royalties do not give to the Australian people the value they deserve and they have not been giving to the Australian people the value they are due in recent years.Even the mining industry accepts that there is a case to increase the charge for the underlying value of those resources that are 100 per cent owned by the Australian people. Even the most extreme elements of the mining industry are acknowledging there is a case for a profits based tax. Even the Minerals Council of Australia acknowledges that. The only people who do not acknowledge that are the Liberal and National parties in this House.The shadow Treasurer came in before and talked about effective rates across various industries. He does not seem to understand that the only industry in the country that gets access to a non-renewable resource that is 100 per cent publicly owned is the mining industry. It is not the transport industry and it is not the finance industry. None of those industries get their input for nothing and they do not get land for nothing. The shadow Treasurer is so ignorant he does not seem to understand that there needs to be a special charge, which is separate from company tax, that gives the Australian people the value of those resources that they 100 per cent own. Those opposite do not even understand this most basic fact. If they do not understand that fact how could they run an economy or a country? They could not even be held in respect by the mining industry. We know what disrespect they have for themselves because they have sold out to the mining industry on this very question.The Prime Minister before was talking about Mr Rory Robertson from Macquarie Bank. He has put out a report today which I think is very illustrative, so we might just go through it for a while. This is what he has to say:Only the most naive investor could have imagined that the final prices the mining sector receives from world markets for publicly owned resources could increase by multiples over a decade. And yet governments effectively would keep selling those same resources to mining companies at the same low prices, at effective prices, that were generally set a decade ago.So those people opposite want to continue charging the same price that is a decade old because they are not prepared to stand up to mining companies and say the Australian people deserve fair value for their mineral resources which are 100 per cent owned by them and are non renewable.What this reform is about is economic reform for the future to create prosperity for all Australians - Australians in small business; Australians elsewhere in large business; Australians who want to save for their retirement and Australians who want investment in infrastructure. That is what this reform is about. It is the big economic reform that Australia needs to go forward so we can prosper in the Asian century. But, of course, those opposite do not understand any of that. Then they buy the line that has been given to them by the mining industry; the line that somehow effective rates on the mining industry are as high as the rest of the effective rates across other sectors.Everybody in industry knows this one basic fact: that the mining industry does get access to generous concessions. We on this side of the House do not contest that but the mining industry should not claim they do not so that they can run around the country and claim that our RSPT produces tax rates as high as 58 per cent, which it clearly does not. It is true that very profitable companies will pay more and many companies will pay less under our proposal. We have a fair proposal here which will deliver fair value to the Australian people. But those opposite, who have sold out to sections of the mining industry, have yet again demonstrated how they do not understand Australia's national interest.</DOC>

 - I again thank the member for North Sydney for his question on the resource super profits tax, because we all know how important tax reform is for the future strength of the Australian economy and, on top of that, for ensuring that working Australians get better super in the future and small businesses get a tax cut as opposed to a tax rise. Mr Speaker, can I say to the member for North Sydney as he continues in this debate: it follows .as night follows day that there are going to be a range of opinions from leaders from both within the mining sector and beyond the mining sector in corporate Australia and, depending upon the branch of corporate Australia, their individual views on this will vary. You have seen comments in recent times by Roger Corbett. You have seen comments in recent times by a range of individuals like Bernie Fraser, who is the former Governor of the Reserve Bank and the former Secretary to the Treasury. You have seen a range of comments from all sorts of people engaged in this debate.But what I would go back to is this: the underlining rationale for a resource rent tax of this nature is to provide an incentive for those companies, particularly those who are less profitable in their early years, to expand the basis of the industry by ensuring that they have appropriate forms of tax write-off for the way in which their investments are handled. That is what the rationale is for a tax based on profits rather than a tax based on volumes. That is why the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, supported the PRRT. Those opposite, led by the member for Groom yesterday, stood up in this place and said that the PRRT was somehow no longer supported by those opposite. They had 12 years to change that tax. - Mr Speaker, the question raised by the member for North Sydney went directly to the impact of the proposed tax arrangements on future investment in the industry, and he cited one particular former mining executive, Mr Ralph, as his authority. Various mining executives will express a range of views on this matter. Mr Don Voelte, the CEO of Woodside, has expressed a view in recent times. He indicated that in fact mining companies could pay more. There are a range of opinions within the mining industry; there are a range of opinions within the general business community. But I go back to the former proposition. The first point is: should mining companies be paying more tax? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says no. The shadow minister for infrastructure says yes. What does the Leader of the Opposition say? We do not know, because their policy flips and flops in between. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may be against our tax. I am not sure that the shadow minister for infrastructure is necessarily of the view that the mining industry should not be paying more. Look at his statements from earlier today. The second point I would make in response to the member for North Sydney's question is - and he knows this infinitely well - that the whole point of a profits based tax as opposed to a volume based tax is to encourage the expansion of the industry. That is why, if he bothered to search the record of an illustrious predecessor of his - that is, the former Treasurer of the Commonwealth, Peter Costello - and looked at his remarks on the architecture of the petroleum resource rent tax, he would see that the former Treasurer understands and grasps the core significance of ensuring that it assists industry to expand. Let me quote what Peter Costello had to say:The idea of the PRRT, when it was introduced - I think it was actually introduced by the Labor Party _ from memory - He is right on that - it was certainly introduced by the Labor Party _ that the petroleum extractors would be taxed on their profits, except to the degree that they used it for new production or other exploration. In fact, that is a good policy aim.In other words, Mr Costello, the then Treasurer of the Commonwealth, was saying that a tax on profits is in fact a more rational approach and a more efficient approach to the taxation of the sector - that is, a tax on volume. That leads me to the third point: the modelling produced through Econtech contained in the Treasury's report on the day that the tax policy was released was of a type which concluded that the overall activity in the mining sector would increase by 5.5 per cent over time as a consequence of the total tax package which is being introduced. No. 1: we have a clear tax policy. The opposition currently have three tax policies on the run at once. No. 2: we believe the mining industry should pay more. We do not know where those opposite stand on that particular question. No. 3: we believe that the best way of taxing the mining industry is on profits rather than volumes because it is the best way to generate future growth and expansion in what has been and what will be a great industry for Australia.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hunter for the question. His question goes to the heart of this debate. It is about how we as a nation put in place a modern resources tax system for a modern nation. The real debate, as I said yesterday, is about how much tax we collect, who collects it and under what system it is collected. The Australian community - unlike the opposition - understands that the time has come for this debate. The Minerals Council of Australia is also, as I have indicated to the House previously, up for this debate - unlike the opposition. It argued in its submission to the Henry tax review that, 'There is a strong argument to reform the basis of determining royalty regimes to a profit based criteria from a revenue based system.' I say that because it is well understood that the existing type of royalty scheme as applied currently in the mining sector creates a lose-lose situation for industry and for the Australian community. The royalties framework is bad for business and potentially worse for the Australian community.During difficult times - and let us be frank - it has and could continue to send companies to the wall. In good times such as over recent years when prices were high, the community missed out on the benefits of the boom because royalties remained fixed and stuck in the past - just like the opposition led by Tony Abbott is stuck in the past and unable to front up to the hard and tough debate on tax reform. - The government is simply proposing to put in place a stable fiscal regime, a regime that is much fairer to industry and certainly much fairer to the Australian community. I ask the House to think about the operation of this royalty regime in past years. Let us think back to the start of this century, when we had a royalties regime in place -  - It is not that long ago in terms of the time horizons of the member for Flinders. Let us go to the application of state royalties across a range of state and territory boundaries. Time and time again we had resource companies approaching state and territory governments for holidays from payment of royalties or potentially time for them to pay off their royalties because times were tough. One example that springs to mind is a project that Andrew Forrest was once involved with, the Murrin Murrin project. They approached the Western Australian government for royalty relief. I have no doubt that a profit based system would have been beneficial to that project. The industry has acknowledged that it is time for reform. They want a profit based system. They have had enough of the royalty based system. And that is not just my view; it is also the view of the broader Australian community. - The industry also appreciates that they have a capacity to pay more tax. That is not just my view - I notice that the member for Curtin has a little bit to say, and I will come to her in a minute - but also the view of the Western Australian Premier. Perhaps next Saturday when she drops into Peppermint Grove for a cup of coffee she should talk to the Western Australian Premier about his view. I am well informed that the Western Australian Premier proposes to take from Rio and BHP in the next financial year something in the order of $800 million in increases in royalties. That amounts to about $3.2 billion over the forward estimates. But what is the opposition's view? The Western Australian Premier has pretty fixed views. I will take the House to the Hansard of the Western Australian parliament of 25 February. He said:As members are aware, I have put it to both BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto that I believe time is now overdue and that they should be paying full mining royalties on the many hundreds of millions of tonnes of iron ore that they produce.He then went on to say:I have to say that a few people who work around the mining industry came up to me over the summer and said: 'By the way, Colin, the mining companies are getting away with murder; they are not paying enough.' A number of people who work in the mining industry have said that.That is what the Premier of Western Australia said. That takes me to where the opposition are. What a mess; what a dog's breakfast we have on the other side of the House at the moment with respect to this complex and important debate. Let me start with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who once held the exalted position of shadow Treasurer. Opposition representatives like the member for Flinders and the member for Dickson soon saw her off. I refer to what the member for Curtin said last night. She said, 'I believe they are paying a fair amount of tax.' Perhaps she should convey that to the state member for the seat in which she lives, the Western Australian Premier and Treasurer, Colin Barnett.Then we have yet another position, that of my dear friend the member for Groom. What did he have to say both yesterday and today? He said, 'If there needs to be a royalty change, it should be done by the states.' So he is up for higher tax, unlike the member for Curtin. That is exactly what the Western Australian Premier and Treasurer is arguing and exactly what the current government is arguing: the mining companies have a capacity to pay more tax and the Australian community need to get a fair return for the development of their resources. But it gets better. Perhaps Colin Barnett has been listening to Senator Joyce, someone who the member for Goldstein likes to ridicule on a regular basis. Let us go to what Senator Barnaby Joyce had to say on Sky television at lunchtime. - Absolutely, Mr Speaker. It actually takes some time to go through all the different policy positions on the other side of the House. But let us go to Senator Barnaby Joyce: 'I'm prepared for the people to look at the mining sector to pay more tax.' I must say I am starting to try and think through what is the opposition's real position. What is the gospel truth? Do these views all represent considered views drafted by the Leader of the Opposition, as he stands there checking the weather vane to assess where to jump from day to day on what is a complex tax debate.Clearly, the opposition is totally focused not on a policy debate that we have to have. It is unprepared to accept the view of the government that there should be a reasonable super profits tax put in place. The headline will be 40 per cent. The tax will also ensure Australia gets a fair return on our precious non-renewable resources and that we put in place a tax system that further encourages investment. I simply say in conclusion: what we have is an opposition that has sold out lock, stock and barrel to some sections of the mining industry because it is more focused on a return to its own pockets in the form of donations than a complex debate.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. As far as Mr De Lacy is concerned, my recollection is that he is Chairman of Macarthur Coal. I seem to recall that, when the Queensland government last increased coal royalties, the Chairman of Macarthur Coal objected to that as well. You would expect the chairman of any resource company like that to have a problem with an increase in tax because he would be out there arguing the interest of his particular view and people in industry are doing that at the moment.The other part of the Leader of the National Party's question goes to the overall incidence of taxation. I draw to his attention the contents of the Treasury minute to the Treasurer which notes that the average company tax rate in the mining sector was 17 per cent in the decade of 2004-05, comparing it to construction at 19 per cent, transport at 27 per cent and finance at 29 per cent. One of the reasons - I say this to the member of the National Party in particular - why he should be getting behind this proposal is that a tax on profits is in fact the right way to go. In fact, he could reflect on some of the observations of one of his illustrious predecessors, Tim Fischer, a former Leader of the National Party, in the debate on the resources rent tax back in the nineties. Tim Fischer announced that a coalition would not be opposing the RRT legislation. He went on to say:The clear advantage of an RRT over the old excise and royalties system must be carefully weighed but it is nevertheless an advantage which allows investment decisions to be based more on the quality of the resource.So said Tim Fischer about the RRT back then; so said Peter Costello about the PRRT back then. I say to the Leader of the National Party that when he embraces this position of opposition to an RSPT he is standing in the way of tax breaks for small business, he is standing in the way of better super for the working people in his electorate and he is standing in the way of funding infrastructure. I know how keen the Leader of the National Party is on infrastructure because the Minister for Education, the Deputy Prime Minister, has just given me some happy snaps of the Leader of the National Party -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker -  - The Leader of the National Party's question went to Macarthur Coal, it went to comments by Mr De Lacy, it went to the whole question of the RSPT as proposed by the government and therefore the purposes to which the revenue obtained by the RSPT would be put. I would simply say to the Leader of the National Party: it is important to be consistent in public policy. You either stand for the proper funding of future infrastructure or you say one thing in Canberra, which is to oppose infrastructure investments of the type contained here at the St Helens primary school in his electorate, and then go back to the electorate and show up bright eyed and bushy tailed for the school opening. I think the Australian public would expect better of the Leader of the National Party on a policy approach to a resource rent tax based on profits rather than volume. I would draw his attention to one of his predecessors, the previous leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer. Can I suggest again that those opposite should actually engage in the policy of this debate, rather than engage in what they are now doing, which is yet another re-run of an ancient fear and scare campaign, which they are highly accomplished at.</DOC>

 - I thank the member very much for her question. I know that she celebrated along with other members of this House on the day that we introduced the legislation that ended the making of award-stripping Work Choices Australian workplace agreements. That was a day to be celebrated because it meant that from then on Australians had the benefit of a safety net that they could rely on. Of course, that was necessary because Australians in 2007 spoke long and loud and said that they did not want Australian workplace agreements that could strip the safety net away.As we stand here with the Fair Work system in operation as a replacement for Work Choices, there are no individual statutory employment agreements that can be made under the Fair Work system. The Fair Work system does not permit the making of any individual statutory employment agreements, a fact that has been continuously misrepresented by those opposite. Of course, under the new Fair Work system it has been a great relief to working Australians that they do not have to fear that today is the day they will go to work and have a basic condition like penalty rates ripped away. Many working Australians hoped that this fear was gone from their lives forever. Unfortunately, because of the extreme policies of the Leader of the Opposition, this fear is back.The Leader of the Opposition says he should only be believed when he issues carefully scripted remarks. Presumably there could be no more carefully scripted remarks than his own book, Battlelines, in which he said, 'Work Choices wasn't all bad.' Presumably he was making carefully scripted remarks to a business meeting when he said:At four elections running we had a mandate to introduce statutory non-union contracts and we will seek to renew that mandate.Presumably he was making carefully scripted remarks when he said - and this one is truly remarkable:If we're honest, most of us would accept that a bad boss is a little bit like a bad father or a bad husband. Notwithstanding all his or her faults, you find that he tends to do more good than harm.That was none other than the Leader of the Opposition. I do not know who should be more insulted by that remark, working Australians or every Australian woman or all of them. 'A bad boss is bit like a bad father or a bad husband. Notwithstanding all of his faults, you find he tends to do more good than harm.'In his budget reply speech, which we also assume was carefully scripted, though given what later happened with the budget reply process maybe that is a big assumption, the Leader of the Opposition said that he wanted to reintroduce Work Choices in the language of flexibility. Of course, we know that the word 'flexibility' when used by those opposite is a code word for Work Choices. It was the language that the former member for Flinders spoke in when he introduced the Work Choices legislation. Just in case we are in any doubt, the member for Curtin helpfully defined flexibility for us on radio recently. She said:The fact is that there are workers now who are suffering under the new awards system. Because it's bringing back penalty rates on weekends _It is pretty clear what the member of Curtin means by flexibility. It is the flexibility to lose your penalty rates without a dollar of compensation.I believe that there are some questions that the Australian people are entitled to get an answer to from the Leader of the Opposition. Obviously that answer will have to be in writing and carefully scripted. We ask for the answer to be produced that way. I think the Leader of the Opposition should give us an answer to the following questions. Under the Liberal Party, can an employer require you to sign a so-called flexible statutory individual employment agreement as a condition of getting a job? Under the Liberal Party, will you be able to terminate your so-called flexible individual statutory employment agreement at any time and go back to the award or collective agreement that would otherwise apply? These are important questions about the degree of risk that the Leader of the Opposition poses to the pay packets of working Australians.We want the answer in writing because we know that, when the Leader of the Opposition speaks, he tries to use code to explain his intention about Work Choices. He tries to hide behind the word 'flexibility'. On this, Australians are entitled to the gospel truth. Of course, the whole concept of flexibility for the Leader of the Opposition is not just about a codename for Work Choices. He is a man who believes in flexibility when it comes to the concept of telling the truth. This is a man that goes on the 7.30 Report and asks you to believe he is an honest man because he fesses up about his dishonesty under pressure. It is a curious definition of honesty. This is a man who wants you to believe that it is okay to say anything if you are cracking up under pressure. He does frequently. He does not believe that there is a problem with being such a phoney. Even for a man with such a flexible attachment to the truth, there is one gospel truth about the Leader of the Opposition and that is that he stands for the reintroduction of Work Choices. He is a risk to the pay packet of every working Australian.</DOC>

'Terry McCrann criticises Australian government economic policy'? Well, hold the phone! 'Piers Akerman is a great fan of Kevin Rudd'. For God's sake, let us just get real about this.On the question of the debate about the resources super profits tax, there will be a range of views expressed out there in the community, in the commentariat, on the part of industry and on the part of mining companies. We have all sides of the argument participating in it. However, what we have on the part of those opposite is an entire policy briefing run out of the MCA. For the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to stand up yesterday and say that the mining industry should pay no more tax is an extraordinary statement. She is in effect saying exactly what the MCA want her to say. That is what is occurring here.I think it is high time the Leader of the Opposition clarified what their policy is on this matter. Is the mining industry paying enough tax? Is it not paying enough tax? Until we have clarity about their alternative position, this debate is fundamentally hampered. Our plan is clear: funding better super for working families, funding tax cuts for Australian businesses, funding smaller tax for small business and funding the future infrastructure needs of the nation. That is where we stand. We do not know where you stand at all.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question, because it does provide an opportunity to correct several statements from members opposite. The government's superannuation reforms are crucial to boosting the retirement incomes of Australians, and these reforms are funded by the resource super profits tax. There are 8.4 million Australians relying on these reforms to boost their retirement incomes. A 30-year-old on average weekly earnings would have their retirement income boosted by $108,000 on their retirement.There has been some commentary by members opposite about the effects of the resource super profits tax on people's retirement incomes. The shadow minister against superannuation has made some comments. His commentary did not go to why the opposition is standing in the way of the boost to retirement incomes of Australians. The comments did not go to why the opposition is standing in the way of giving low-income earners their superannuation tax back. They went to a scare campaign. The shadow minister against superannuation - the member for Cowper - said this to the Coffs Coast Advocate:We also must remember the collapse in mining share investment is having a domino effect right through the economy that will drive down super returns even further.He is not the only one. The member for Goldstein said it, the member for North Sydney said it and the Leader of the Opposition said it. Now it is time for some facts which will show that the opposition's scare campaign is simply sophistry. It is true that the value of Australian mining stocks has fallen since 2 May. It is also true that the value of stocks generally in Australia has fallen. It is also true that mining stocks around the world have fallen in value. The Australian materials index covering mining stocks has fallen by eight per cent since 30 April, the ASX 200 has fallen by 8.6 per cent and the financials index has fallen by 10.57 per cent. The resource super profits tax has had a big impact on the financial services index.It is also interesting to look around the world. As I said, the ASX 200 has fallen by 8.6 per cent, the FTSE has fallen by 8.7 per cent, Standard and Poor's has fallen by 9.5 per cent and the Nikkei has fallen by 11.7 per cent. So the superprofits tax has really hit Japan hard. I have heard a lot of outlandish claims from the opposition over the past fortnight. I do not think I have heard the opposition claim yet that the resource super profits tax has caused the Greek debt crisis. I might have missed it. It would be about as outlandish as most of their claims. That crisis, which has caused stock market falls around the world, has not been caused by the RSPT.The opposition say that the resource super profits tax is affecting superannuation returns. Let us see what the superannuation industry has to say to their claims. David Whiteley, the Chief Executive of the Industry Super Network -   -   - Said:Asserting mining stocks have plunged as a direct result of the tax when all stocks have fallen to a similar if not greater degree is plainly deceitful.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says Mr Whiteley is a Labor hack.  -   - She said he is a union hack. Let us see what that other union hack, John Brogden, had to say. John Brogden says of the argument that the mining tax is having an impact on superannuation returns:It doesn't hold up in the short term, and it won't hold up in the long term. I am very strongly of the view that it is quite erroneous to link a negative outcome on mining to a negative outcome on superannuation.That is what John Brogden said of the arguments that are being put by those opposite. I wonder if he is a Labor hack as well. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition appears to have gone quiet. - I referred to the various indexes, but this analysis is also borne out if you look at individual share prices. Let us take, for example, for the sake of argument, BHP. Since 30 April, BHP has fallen by 7.24 per cent. In other words, BHP has outperformed the market in the past three weeks. Perhaps that is why so many analysts are recommending a buy on BHP - advice that at least one opposition frontbencher has taken to heart.  -  
 - Our old friend the member for Dickson. He has been out there giving hypocrites a bad name again. - I withdraw. The Leader of the Opposition says that you can only believe something he says if it is in writing. Perhaps you can only believe something the opposition say if it is written in the pecuniary interest return to the House of Representatives, because what they say is worth less than what they do. If I tried to desert my seat I would probably try to make investments to improve my retirement income as well. But we actually care more about the retirement incomes of all Australians. If the opposition want to be taken seriously, they should stop crying crocodile tears about the price of mining shares and should support our efforts to improve the retirement incomes of all Australians, to give all Australians a secure and dignified retirement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. It goes to the impact of the proposed RSPT on the superannuation earnings of Australians. The first thing I would say in response to the honourable member's question is that the way in which you boost the superannuation earnings of Australians is to increase the SGL from nine per cent to 12 per cent. That is the first thing you do because superannuation adequacy for working families is, frankly, not sufficient. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. My recollection of the question from the member for Pearce is that it went to the impact of the government's proposed tax on superannuation and, furthermore, it went to a range of other matters as well, including those analyses taken into account by the Treasury. -  -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The member for Pearce's question went to superannuation and to self-funded retirees. The first point that I was making - and I repeat it even though it seems to irritate those opposite - is that we are increasing the SGL, superannuation guarantee level, for all working Australians, from nine per cent to 12 per cent. - Furthermore, in the Treasury's analysis of the impact on the economy, that is what underpins what is returned to the superannuation industry through investments over time for both the mining industry and the general economy. If you look at the Econtech modelling contained in the Treasury report, it projects ahead a 0.7 per cent increase in economic growth over time. - Secondly - and I say this for the honourable member - it also projects ahead a 5.5 per cent increase in overall mining activity. It follows as a consequence that the overall impact of these reforms on the broad economy will lead to greater growth in general, and for the mining sector in particular and therefore for superannuation funds invested in those sectors into the future.Furthermore, I draw the honourable member's attention to the response just given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. The minister for finance in particular emphasised the recent performance of resource stocks as against non-resource stocks within this country and abroad. The member for Pearce, as she said, reflecting on the concerns of her constituents should have listened carefully to what the minister for finance said. He said that the changes over the last month in resource stocks have been less, by and large, than those in the financial services sector. - If you want examples, BHP Billiton is down nine per cent, CBA down 12 per cent, NAB down 15 per cent, WBC down 18 per cent, ANZ down 13 per cent -  -  - I know that these are uncomfortable facts for the political argument being advanced by those opposite. - When those opposite - and, as we know, they are such a crack economic team made up of the Leader of the Opposition, the member for North Sydney and the member for Goldstein, aided and abetted from time to time by Senator Barnaby Joyce - actually look at what is happening in the global economy and the performance of all stock markets at present, they will see that it is directly impacted by events in Greece and in Europe. That is why we have seen such massive changes in stock market indices across most Western economies in recent times, including those within our own region.Therefore, in response to the honourable member's question, we are proud of the fact that we are using the proceeds from the RSPT to increase the retirement income of working families. The impact on the overall economy and on mining in particular is assessed by the Treasury analysis as being positive and therefore the earnings of the industry will be so underpinned into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. He has a particular interest in the establishment of a national e-health system, because the division of GPs in his electorate has been leading the way across the country with a very advanced system. But it operates only within their smaller area and they have hopes of expanding it.GPs in the member for Moreton's electorate and across the country do understand that an e-health system will help revolutionise the delivery of health care in Australia. It is why the budget includes $467 million to roll out personally controlled electronic health records for all Australians from 2012-13. Patients will for the first time be able to access their key health information when and where they need it. Patients will no longer have to remember every detail of their care history, medications or test results, and they will not have to retell it to every health professional that they see.It is estimated that two to three per cent of hospital admissions in Australia are linked to medication errors. This equates to 190,000 admissions each year and costs our health system a staggering $660 million. On top of that, about eight per cent of medical errors are because of inadequate patient information. So it is not a stretch to say that this investment in e-health will help to save lives, reduce medical errors, keep people out of hospital and save money for the taxpayer. Given all of this, it is unsurprising that patients, clinicians and stakeholders have all supported this reform. The AMA, the AGPN, the ANF, the Consumer Health Forum and many more have all said that the e-health system is a key building block to create a 21st-century health system. Everyone, it seems, except for the two people in furious discussion across the table, thinks that this is a long-overdue investment.I must emphasise to you that it is only today's Liberal Party who are against e-health. Unfortunately, the Liberal Party announced last week that they would slash funding for this initiative. We see them mimicking their time in government. A billion dollars was slashed from public hospitals when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Health and Ageing. Now nearly another billion dollars would be slashed from the health system, affecting GPs and e-health, under the opposition's plan.The reason I emphasise that it is today's Liberal Party that oppose e-health is that not very long ago there were people on the other side of the chamber who thought that it was very important. I thought the chamber might like to know that in the Leader of the Opposition's very first speech as health minister he chose to address the topic of e-health. In fact, in 2003, when he gave his first speech as the new health minister, he gave his government five years to implement a national scheme. He said that failure to do it in five years 'would be an indictment against everyone in the health system, including the government'. Indeed, it is an indictment of the former government. We can just add it to the list of other indictments - a billion dollars out of hospitals, a cap on GP training places and now the failure to deliver an e-health system.I think that the chamber deserves to hear just a little bit more. In August 2007, the then health minister gave another speech. He referred to his first speech as health minister. He said:In November 2003, my first scripted speech as Health Minister concerned e-health. I stated that an electronic health record, communicated electronically among health care providers, would mean safer, better, more convenient and more efficient health care.I could not agree more. He went on:For doctors and other professionals, it meant less repetitive taking of histories; for governments and other funders, it meant less duplication of diagnostic tests; for patients, it meant more access to their health records and more capacity to manage their own health; for everyone, it meant fewer potentially disastrous mistakes because of avoidable ignorance.These were carefully scripted speeches, so we know that Mr Abbott absolutely believed every word of them. The only problem was that 'Phoney Tony' did not act on that belief. He did not deliver any e-health records -  - I withdraw it. - The only problem was that the Leader of the Opposition, as the health minister, said all of these things about electronic health records and failed to deliver one iota.I can tell you that the member for Dickson is also on the record as offering bipartisan support for e-health. He even had a swipe at his own leader. Last September he said that the lack of e-health was 'a very poor reflection of the last decade of discussion'. I wonder who was in government for the last decade? The member for Dickson also said in March:_ Nicola Roxon and I don't always have a perfect made in heaven relationship, but nonetheless, when I first sat down with Nicola coming into this portfolio only six months ago I gave her an undertaking that we would - on the issue of e-health - provide bipartisan support _There goes that offer! How erratic are they, in that year after year they could commit to e-health, when they got into opposition they could commit to e-health and then, last week, they slashed half a billion dollars from their budget for this necessary revolutionary change to our healthcare system? One day they are for e-health; one day they are against it. It is pretty hard to know what the Leader of the Opposition thinks, but we certainly know what he did about e-health - absolutely nothing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mayo for his question because, when it comes to all businesses, what this government stands for is lower tax as opposed to higher tax. We are bringing the company tax rate down two per cent. You are taking it up two per cent. That is what you are doing by virtue of Mr Abbott's great big new tax on everything. On the matter that the member for Mayo raises, I simply say to him that companies from various sectors of the economy are currently consulting the Treasury panel on the impact of the proposed RSPT on them and, as far as his constituents are concerned, I strongly encourage them to do so, as many others are across the country - more than 80 companies altogether.The third point I would make in response to the member for Mayo, and more broadly in this debate on tax, is that this is about how we reform the country for the future. This is about how we set Australia up for the next level of economic growth. This is how we take the benefits from the mining boom and invest them in Australia's productive potential in the future. This is a serious program of economic reform.What we have seen today is a stark contrast between what we stand for on a reform proposal and what they stand for in terms of simple scare campaigning on the basis of lowest common denominator politics. It is writ large right across the board. We stand for better super; they stand for less super. We stand for less tax on business; you stand for more tax on business. We stand for less tax on small business; you stand for more tax on small business. We stand for investing in health; as the Minister for Health and Ageing has just said, you stand for health cuts. We stand for investments in education; you stand for cuts to education. We stand for investments in renewable energy; you stand for cuts to renewable energy. We stand for investing in infrastructure; you stand for cutting infrastructure. - Mr Speaker, I say to those opposite as they engage in the politics of the lowest common denominator: have a very clear eye upon where this debate goes for our future productive potential as an economy. We stand for boosting Australia's long-term productivity and our global economic competitiveness. I say to the member for Mayo, as a person who I thought was literate on questions of policy, that he should engage in the detail of this debate rather than simply take the script delivered to him by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Sturt.We will deal with each business on its merits, with each sector that they are engaged in. They are currently discussing these matters with the Treasury panel. This is a fundamental exercise in long-term economic reform, to which this government is committed.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and for his invitation to engage with him in a very productive small business breakfast just last week. It was very well attended too. The government supported Australia's small businesses and our tradies during the global recession through our economic stimulus plan. During the recovery we want to support our small businesses again through small business tax breaks. In fact, the government's economic stimulus plan is right now supporting small businesses right around Australia, including our tradies in thousands of construction projects across the nation.I remind members of the chamber that the opposition voted against and continues to oppose the fiscal stimulus package which is supporting our small businesses and our tradies. But not all members of the Liberal-National Party feel that way. George Christensen is the Liberal-National Party candidate for Dawson and a councillor on the Mackay council. At the council's meeting on 16 December last year, Councillor Christensen moved a motion that the council accept $4½ million from the Rudd government's Social Housing Initiative, which is being organised and provided through the good auspices of the member for Sydney. Councillor Christiansen clearly supports the government's economic stimulus plan, but he is not alone. The LNP's candidate for Wright, also in Queensland, is Hajnal Ban. She is a councillor on Logan City Council, in my own area, so she is a member of a council that has benefited from stimulus funding of almost $5 million for, amongst other things, local roadworks, a library fit-out just down the road from my office and an extension to the Logan Entertainment Centre. And what about Councillor Jane Prentice? Councillor Prentice has nominated for LNP preselection for the seat of Ryan to replace the now demised member for Ryan, who has been thrown out of the LNP and obviously has a few more questions to answer beyond the LNP's own internal investigation - and I will have more to say about that later. Back to Councillor Jane Prentice: she is a councillor on the Brisbane City Council, which has gratefully accepted more than $16 million in funding from our economic stimulus plan.Doctors take the Hippocratic oath. These three LNP candidates and aspirants will need to join with sitting LNP members in taking the opposition leader's hypocritic oath, which says: 'I support the Rudd government's stimulus package in the electorate but I pledge to oppose it in the parliament.' - I withdraw. When it comes to economic management, the Leader of the Opposition is erratic and his policies are extreme. I am asked about small business tax breaks. The opposition leader plans to block the resource super profits tax in the Senate. What would that do? Deny small businesses and tradies a much-deserved tax break. The opposition leader says that he only speaks the gospel truth when something is written down, scripted for him, prepared for him by his staff. It must be put in writing. But not so Senator Barnaby Joyce, because he walks into a TV studio and just blurts out the truth. When he was asked just before question time - very good timing, I thought, from Senator Joyce - about the deputy opposition leader's comments that mining companies already pay their fair share of tax, what did he say? Did he agree with that? 'No, not at all - we can have a sensible negotiation.' Go Barnaby!He went on, 'To say there is not the capacity to change the tax is not right.' We agree with Senator Joyce. He went on to say, 'I'm prepared for people to look at the mining sector to pay more.' The deputy opposition leader says, 'They are paying the right amount; they are paying their fair share.' Senator Joyce went on to say, 'Let's go through the proper negotiation.' That is a good idea; that is what we are doing - going through the proper negotiation. But on the other side they are saying, 'No, Barnaby is wrong, we should not go through the proper negotiation.' The truth is that Senator Barnaby Joyce has blown out of the water the opposition's confused scare campaign about the resource super profits tax. He has completely contradicted the opposition leader, he has completely contradicted the deputy opposition leader and, of course, he had a big go at the member for Goldstein. They had a tiff yesterday and the member for Goldstein rang him up. - Sure, Mr Speaker, and I welcome the interjection from Pig Iron Pete over here, share trader. - I withdraw. - Certainly, the opposition leader knows that Senator Barnaby Joyce believes that revenge is a dish best served cold. It was served up today. The resource super profits tax is a tax to fund small business tax breaks. The Rudd Labor government is the best friend that small business has ever had.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the fear campaign run by the Leader of the Opposition reaches no bounds. The Leader of the Opposition has been out there talking about the proposed impact of an RSPT on share markets, on superannuation earnings, on food and on everything else under heaven, without a single shred of evidence to back up each and every one of his claims. He said so about share markets: have we looked and seen what the Australian share market has done relative to other share markets across the world? Have we looked and seen what has happened with the Australian share market for mining stocks against mining stocks in other parts of the world? The Leader of the Opposition is engaged in an utterly shameless fear campaign against an RSPT because he has no alternative tax policy.I refer the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to the contents of the modelling in the Treasury document concerning the RSPT and its calculation in relation to economic growth, in relation to employment and in relation to price impacts. I would also draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to this: if you are also bringing down the company tax rate across the country, that also has an effect on the price of goods and services in a positive direction for the general community.What this all points to is a fundamental lack of policy on the part of those opposite. On Monday of this week we had, I think, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who has been in the news of late, saying that the mining companies were paying just the right amount of tax. Then on Tuesday we had the shadow minister for infrastructure come out and say that he was open to them paying some more tax. What we have today, however, is volume 3 from the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition gave us tax policy No. 3 today when he said that any fair minded analysis of the evidence would suggest that mining companies are paying more than their fair share of tax.So, on Monday they were paying just enough tax, on Tuesday we had Barnaby saying they were not paying enough tax and now on Wednesday we have the Leader of the Opposition saying that in fact they are paying too much tax - one, two, three tax policies in three days. You begin to think that Goldilocks and the three bears are running their tax policy - not enough, just too much, a little bit more! They can credibly participate in this debate on tax policy when they have an alternative policy. The truth is that they have none. We stand for better super for workers; we stand for tax cuts for small business and greater investment in this country's long-term infrastructure.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is a very important question which goes right to the heart of matters which go to the protection of our national security interest. Of course it has been a fundamental principle of successive governments that governments do not comment on intelligence matters. They particularly do not comment or speculate on operational matters. This has been the case for many years, for all of the very obvious national security reasons. One does not comment; one does not speculate.That has been a principle that successive prime ministers and foreign ministers have adhered to. The Prime Minister made a perfect statement of the principle last night. His predecessor, John Howard, was very careful to respect this principle. On 24 February 2004, he said:I follow the longstanding practice of my predecessors, both Labor and Liberal, of not commenting on intelligence and security matters - a very sound principle.A very sound principle, indeed. My predecessor Alexander Downer said, at about the same time, 27 February:_ I'll never walk away from this point - no responsible cabinet minister in our country, present or former, is going to get into the game of talking publicly about the operational side of our intelligence agencies.So there are very clear risks to Australia's national security when this fundamental principle, enjoined by successive governments over a long period of time, is breached - a very severe risk.Yesterday, regrettably we saw a very serious breach of this principle. In an interview on Melbourne Talk Radio at about 10 minutes past eight, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made a very clear statement. She said:It would not be the first time that another country forged passports for a particular operation, and I would include in that Australia.Later that day, at about 12.30, she sat down with Tim Lester from Fairfax Online and recorded an interview on camera which went to air while we were all here, about 3.05 or 3.10 yesterday afternoon. In that interview she asserted for the second time that Australian intelligence agencies forged passports. For the second time in one day she broke a fundamental principle of neither commenting on nor speculating about operational matters so far as intelligence and security are concerned. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said:It would be naive to think that Israel is the only country in the world that has used forged passports, including Australian passports, for security operations.TIM LESTER: What, we do?JULIE BISHOP: Yes.If the written word is not enough, I urge members to watch the video. This was not a throwaway remark; this was not inadvertence; this was the deliberate and deliberative knowing answer to a journalist, with the knowing smile that she was about to deliver something which was secret, something which was exclusive. I urge all members to watch the video to see the calculation with which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition broke for the second time in one day a fundamental principle.I have been critical of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition all week for her inadequate and inappropriate response to the fraudulent abuse of Australian passports, for her failure to stand up for the abuse of our sovereignty, for the abuse of our national security and for the abuse of the Australian travelling public. I will not regale you with that. This is qualitatively different. This is twice in one day the deliberate and deliberative breaching of a fundamental principle of national security so far as this country is concerned.I said earlier this week that she is not a fit and proper person to sit around the National Security Committee of the Cabinet. She is not a fit and proper person to discharge that role. But this is so serious a matter that there is now an obligation on the part of the Leader of the Opposition to state clearly and unequivocally that this is a fundamental principle to which he adheres and which he would carry out as his predecessors have done. There is only one way he can show his adherence to that principle. He must indicate publicly that the conduct of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition yesterday in twice disavowing this fundamental principle was completely unacceptable. This is so serious a matter that the Leader of the Opposition must acknowledge that her conduct was unacceptable, that she was in serious breach of a fundamental principle and, as a consequence, she has put our national security interests at risk.</DOC>

 - I always find it remarkable when the Leader of the National Party takes up the bat on deep questions of economic policy. The Leader of the National Party has not exhibited huge credentials in this department in the past, like the rest of the crack economic team which forms the frontbench of those opposite.Point 1 about the RSPT is that it applies to commodities which are sold on international markets at world market prices. Point 2, if he actually spent some time examining the documents released by the Treasury in terms of the impact of this proposed tax on consumer prices, he would be enlightened further. Point 3, I find it remarkable again that the Leader of the National Party stands up here and speaks about taxes when his party is now committed to the Leader of the Opposition's policy of introducing a great big new tax on all Australian big businesses, defining 'big' with a turnover of more than $5 million, in order to cross-subsidise his plan for a paid parental leave scheme. If you look at the flow-through impact of prices on bread, milk, and right across the food chain, you will see that that impact will flow through to the actual cost of living faced by working families right across Australia. That is why those opposite sitting behind the Leader of the Opposition are so deeply nervous about his great big tax proposal. I would suggest that the Leader of the National Party spends a little bit of time examining the economic documents released by the Treasury, understanding the impact of world prices, and the fact that these prices are set by world markets into which we sell our principal commodity groups.In passing, I also note the fact, by the way, that it seems to be, as briefed out by Manager of Opposition Business, that now we have a system where the Leader of the Opposition only asks the first question, presumably, for reasons of not wishing to engage in a prolonged debate and discussion on economic policy - or on other matters perhaps. Let us just see how this goes today. -  - </DOC>

 - I am asked what the response has been to the flagrant breach yesterday of a fundamental principle applying to our national security arrangements. I am also asked what should be the appropriate response in such a matter. Not surprisingly, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has been roundly condemned by experts in the security area for her breach yesterday. I will give just one example. Michael McKinley, from the Australian National University, was on ABC Radio National with Fran Kelly this morning and, inter alia, he said:She has breached this longstanding etiquette or discursive law and therefore she will come in for justifiable criticism _He went on to say:It does raise questions as to whether or not she - the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - fully understands the sensitivities of the shadow portfolio, and what might happen should the Liberal Party come to government.That is just one of a number of adverse comments so far as the deputy leader's breach of that principle yesterday is concerned.I am asked, importantly, what the response should be when such a breach occurs. It would have been appropriate on this occasion, in this instance, for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to acknowledge that she had made a very serious error of judgment, to indicate that there were adverse consequences which flowed from that error of judgment, to undertake never to commit that offence again and to slavishly adhere to a fundamental principle of longstanding. That would have been the appropriate response. Regrettably, it was not the response we saw on this occasion. We saw last night the Deputy Leader of the Opposition put out a three-sentence statement which is well worth reading into the record:I did not state that Australian intelligence agencies have forged the passports of other nations during my interview with Fairfax online this afternoon.My responses were referring to the fact that forged Australian passports have been used previously, as noted by the foreign minister today.I have no knowledge of any Australian authority forging any passports of any nation.I will just take the first sentence first:I did not state that Australian intelligence agencies have forged the passports of other nations during my interview with Fairfax Online this afternoon.That does not stand up to scrutiny at all. That is not a retraction, as I have seen some people refer to it. It is a bald-faced denial flying in the face of the facts. And she did not just say it to Tim Lester on camera yesterday. She said it twice: at eight o'clock in the morning and at midday. I would have thought that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would have had much less shame than that, than to put out such a misleading account of what she had said - to assert that black was white; to assert that yes was no.I have indicated to the Leader of the Opposition that because of the fundamental seriousness of this issue he should adhere to and make a statement adhering to this principle, and the only way he can do that is to disavow the conduct of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. But I think on this occasion, given the bald-faced denial running contrary to all facts, the Leader of the Opposition needs to do more. The Leader of the Opposition was asked this morning at a doorstop by a journalist:And just finally, Julie Bishop: are you standing by her?Abbott: Of course.Journalist: Her comments were irresponsible, weren't they?Abbott: Look, um, she's issued a statement. I think the statement makes things very clear.Journalist: But she did say what she said. She shouldn't have said that, should she?Abbott: Oh, but, as she says in her statement, ah, she misunderstood the question.First point: I did not see any misunderstanding of the question in the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's statement. Second point: I did not see any misunderstanding of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when she asserted on Melbourne radio just after eight o'clock yesterday morning and I did not see any misunderstanding of the question when she answered Tim Lester on camera - and I again encourage all members to look at the video of it. Certainly there was no misunderstanding in Tim Lester's mind when he published his report.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition's so-called denial last night was an attempt to mislead the Australian public. An attempt to fly in the face of the facts. An attempt to avoid the scrutiny that she so rightly deserves. Rather than the Leader of the Opposition joining in this act of denial, he should make her retract her misleading statement. He should make her retract her dishonestly misleading statement, and he should do that today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question because it goes to superannuation earnings and it goes to the overall performance of an economy upon which those earnings are based. The letter that she referred to from her constituent went to a number of points, one of which was the impact on employment, another was the impact on small business and the third was in relation to superannuation. On the question of employment, to which she referred in her question, can I say to the member for Pearce that the impact on GDP which is projected as a result of the introduction of the government's tax plan -  - Firstly, on the question of the impact on employment, if the honourable member reads the documents released by the Treasury, she will see that the analysis contained within them projects an increase in employment as a result of the implementation of the government's tax measures. The reason for that is that we are boosting the overall cost competitiveness of Australian business at large, and the employment consequences of that across the entire economy are significant, particularly when you look at the concentrations of employment which lie both within and beyond the mining sector. Secondly, she referred to the small business sector. I would have thought that, in terms of the impact of the government's tax package, the cut to the company rate - 30 per cent of small businesses are incorporated - and the impact -  - Firstly, the overall impact of the government's tax reform plan is to increase employment across the Australian economy. Secondly, can I say to the honourable member on the point that she raised from her constituent on the matter of small business, small businesses will benefit first of all - the 30 per cent of them which are incorporated - from the overall two per cent reduction in the company rate and, secondly and most significantly, for all 2.4 million Australian businesses, the impact which arises from the $5,000 each year tax write-off which is possible against the assets which they invest in. Can I say therefore to the honourable member, on the question of the impact on small business, there are two specific measures contained in the government's overall tax package which assist small business.The honourable member then goes on to ask about superannuation earnings, in particular for self-funded retirees. All superannuants have an interest in the long-term performance of Australian equities markets and in the other investments which superannuation funds make. Can I draw the honourable member's attention to what the Treasury's analysis says about the future performance of the Australian mining sector as a consequence of the broadening of the base of the mining sector which is achieved by these reforms: a 4.5 per cent increase in mining activity and an increase in employment in the mining sector. Over time, you can see that therefore this is a sound set of reforms for the mining industry as it looks to the future.Therefore, whether it is the economy at large or the mining sector in particular, the government stands by these reforms. They are good for the economy, they are good for growth, they are good for employment, they are good for business and therefore they are good for the long-term investments and therefore returns to Australian superannuants. I conclude by saying this for the millions upon millions of Australian workers who stand to benefit from having their superannuation guarantee level increase from nine per cent to 12 per cent: we stand on the side of better super for working families; the Leader of the Opposition stands on the side of ripping that super away from working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for his question, as I know he is concerned about his local small business community and his community in South-East Queensland. I note in passing to the member for Forde that the secondary schools in his electorate stand to be directly punished as a result of the opposition's policy to cut funding to trades training centres. In fact, there are a number of secondary schools in his electorate which stand to be punished as a result of that. -  - I notice from the reaction of those opposite that there is a degree of sensitivity about the cuts to trades training centres in schools. - The strength of the Australian economy depends on three core factors. One is keeping this economy out of recession, and that is what we have done together as a nation in response to the global financial crisis. The second is bringing the budget back to surplus, back in black, three years early, three years ahead of time, and in just three years time, and halving the net peak debt of Australia. The third is a program of economic reform. That is where tax reform comes into play.This government is committed to the importance of tax reform, because this package of measures boosts Australia's global competitiveness because of the reduction to the company tax rate and the assistance to small business. Secondly, it boosts Australia's level of overall national savings some $85 billion over the decade ahead. It boosts the individual retirement incomes of working Australians to the tune of some $108,000 in the case of an average 30-year-old worker and it also boosts our investment in infrastructure - rail, road and ports.On the question of a profits based tax regime, can I say to those opposite and the parliament at large that this government is committed to the principle of bringing in resources tax reform because we believe this principle is right. Firstly, it is right as we move towards a system of resource taxation which taxes profits, not production. The existing system of state royalties is inefficient. Royalties tax production unfairly disadvantage miners who have high costs upfront, in particular high extraction costs. Furthermore, the proposed Resource Super Profits Tax, as a tax on profits, shares the risk between companies and the government.Let me go to what that means in particular. The government effectively contributes 40 per cent of the cost of the investment through deferred tax credits - that means to offset the initial investments by a company. Furthermore, as that company goes through its initial years of operation this deferred tax credit continues to be drawn upon. If for whatever reason the venture fails, then the company in question can transfer that to a further project or have the remaining amount refunded by the government. Furthermore, the government then takes 40 per cent of super normal profits to the extent that those super normal profits exist. Finally, and most critically, the government then fully refunds the existing state production based royalties. This is the core architecture of a profits based regime. That is what the government is seeking to bring in.What is the overall effect on the economy? Why is this a worthwhile reform? Firstly, it means less profitable mining companies will actually pay less tax. For example, Treasury modelling indicates that, for a typical project, a company earning less than 10 per cent returns will pay less tax. Secondly, it is a flexible system because, as commodity prices change over time, a company will pay more during boom times and less as commodity prices moderate over time. The crude blunt instrument of a volume based tax does not do that. Thirdly, what we have also is a system which enables companies to rely upon a tax system which replaces the patchwork quilt of an inefficient existing state based royalties regime. That also enables companies not to be subjected to individual decisions by state governments to jack up royalties regimes in a manner not consistent with the profitability returns of the companies in question. That is a further reason why this is a good reform for the economy. Finally, this system would introduce minimal distortions to production decisions by companies developing their resource simply because it is a tax on profits and not a tax on production. It is for these reasons that, under an RSPT scheme, mining investment is projected in the Treasury's modelling to rise by 4.5 per cent, jobs within the sector by seven per cent and mining production by 5.5 per cent, because this is an efficient tax based on profit, not on volume.Others who are engaging in this debate have seen the merit of this. I referred yesterday to comments by the former Treasurer, Peter Costello. I referred to comments by the former Leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer. Even the Minerals Council of Australia has come out today and accepted the logic of a profits based system. It said:We in fact put on the table through the course of the Henry review there was a view that let's move from the inefficient and complex set of royalties that exist across states to a profits based system where the risk and reward is shared between the state who owns the minerals and the companies that develop them.So says the MCA. On the merits of a profits based tax system, these individuals are not alone. Enter the member for Tangney. The member for Tangney was asked this very basic question this morning - I notice he is not seeking to engage our attention here: 'But economically it is more sensible to have a profits tax rather than a production tax. I mean that's just economics 101, isn't it?' The member for Tangney's immortal reply was:Well, the point is _ ah. I won't go into arguing the specific merits of that _ ah I mean, yeah, there is potential that taxing profits is better than simply taxing volume.In other words we have from the great state of Western Australia over there the member for Tangney endorsing the fundamental tax principle which underpins this government's proposed tax reform. But there is more. Enter the shadow minister for finance. This was pretty interesting. What we have from the shadow minister for finance is a statement which says:This debate has never been about the design of the tax _ The debate is all about the size of the tax grab.In other words, from the shadow finance minister and the member for Tangney we have a fundamental endorsement of the principle of a profits based tax system. Can I say to those opposite that this actually raises a deep question for the Leader of the Opposition. He has had three different tax policies in three days: on Monday it was 'There was just enough tax', on Tuesday 'Not enough' and on Wednesday his policy was that there was far too much. Does the opposition leader support of shadow minister for finance in embracing a profits based tax regime? We are all ears. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. The government's tax reform plan is clear. There is a consultation process underway. It will deal with detail, it will deal with implementation and it will deal with transition arrangements. We have said this from the beginning. We continue to engage in that consultation with all firms, and that process of consultation is working effectively, including in relation to the matters just raised by the member for Dunkley.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The answer is that 20 of our most respected economists have had some very sensible things to say overnight about a resources super profits tax, and I will talk about that in a moment. But there has also been some more commentary today, particularly from the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition said today on Alan Jones's program that miners were paying 'more than their fair share' - more than their fair share. Now, we have been talking about this for about a month. There has been a vigorous debate about modernising our tax system when it comes to the mining industry. There is a vigorous debate about the tax, about its rate and about its design. But I think there is now one thing that almost everybody in the debate - except the Leader of the Opposition, Clive Palmer and one or two others - accepts, and that is that there is the capacity in the mining industry to pay more. It is universally recognised that the mining industry should be paying more because it has not been paying its fair share. - Let us just go back and look at the figures. At the beginning of the decade, one dollar in three -  - was paid in royalties and charges out of mining profits. - At the end of the decade, that has fallen to one dollar in seven. So just about everybody in the community accepts that the mining industry can pay a bit more - except the Leader of the Opposition, who does what he is told by the likes of Clive Palmer. Some of those mining companies walked into his office in week one, told him what to do, and he has been singing their tune ever since then.There is a wider debate happening in the community, and those 20 respected economists have gone to the core of why we do need change, fundamental reform, in this area. They are respected Australians: Professor Allan Fels, former head of the ACCC; Michael Keating, former head of the Australian Public Service; and the list goes on. They make some very sensible -  -  - I am going to go on. Professor Quiggin - it goes on and on. Let us go into it. What do they say? -  -  -  -  -  - I was talking about the views of 20 respected economists and I wanted to go through some of those views. This is a very important debate for Australia - for how we reform our economy as we go forward, for how we grow our economy, for how we invest in our businesses, for how we invest in infrastructure and for how we grow our national savings. Those 20 respected economists treat this issue very seriously, and it is worth while debating it in this House. I want to quote from them. This is what they say:_ it is desirable to levy a charge for access to publicly-owned mineral resources, in addition to normal corporate income tax._            _            __ this is an appropriate time for them to adjust to a more efficient and equitable system of sharing the value of those rights.Yesterday we were talking about the fact that these minerals were non-renewable, that they could only be mined once. What we have to do is extract the maximum value for the Australian people as we go forward - to reform our economy, to invest in our economy and to ensure our prosperity as we go forward. This is a very serious issue and it should be treated seriously by those opposite. The economists go on to say:There is no reason to expect a net contraction in mining over the longer term as a result of replacing royalties with the proposed resource rent tax.This is because a tax on economic rent of non-renewable resources is a more efficient revenue than taxing mining production.These are very serious points, but they do not seem in any way to be accepted by those opposite.Mr Quiggin went on today to make this observation, which was very pertinent to some of the points that were made in earlier questions. He said:_ there's no reason at all to think that the tax is going to affect world prices of these minerals and therefore that that's going to feed, in any way, into Australian consumer prices.On the other hand, there's potentially some benefit for consumers in the offsetting reductions in the general rates of company tax.So it certainly is depressing to see this kind of scare tactic put up. It really is just to shorten the debate.Those opposite do not want to acknowledge that we are also moving to a corporate rate tax cut. It is very embarrassing for the Liberal Party to be in this House opposing a corporate rate tax cut whilst at the same time wanting to impose their own. It is very embarrassing for the party that is supposed to be representing business in this House to be opposing sensible reforms to the taxation system for corporates and, most particularly, for small business. But it is more embarrassing for them because they are out there on their own - with Mr Palmer - opposing the fact that we need this profits based tax in the first place.There have been some spectacular interventions in this debate, and probably none more so than the one this morning from the Leader of the Opposition where he said that they should be paying less tax. That is a view that is not shared by many. It is not even shared by the Minerals Council of Australia. Mitch Hooke said this morning, 'The concept of a profits based tax is absolutely a tick.' So even the Minerals Council of Australia is in the cart for a profits based tax, but of course the member for Groom is not and the Leader of the Opposition is not. It just shows you how short-sighted they are, how negatively political they are and how they are not interested in our national interest. They are simply stuck in the past and incapable of coming to grips with the big economic challenges facing this nation. We on this side of the House will do everything we can to ensure that Australians get a fair share of their non-renewable resources so we can invest in jobs, growth and prosperity for Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. On the consultations at present between companies and the Treasury panel, they cover businesses from right across the mining spectrum. I would encourage the honourable member to ensure that the company in question is fully engaged with the consultation panel. Secondly, the member for Herbert asked a question about the impact on cost of living of the government's overall tax reform proposal. I would draw his attention again to what is contained in the Treasury's analysis of the overall impact on consumers and, furthermore, to the analysis just referred to by the Treasurer in his response and particularly to the comments today by Professor Quiggin on the question of the overall impact on prices.When it comes to prices, as the honourable member would be aware, the changes to the company tax rate and for small businesses also will have an impact on how profitable those businesses are overall. Can I say also that the profitability of those firms, particularly if they have a turnover in excess of $5 million, is directly affected negatively by the Leader of the Opposition's great big new tax on every business in the country turning over more than $5 million. The flow-through impact on cost of living for bread, milk and other basic grocery items right across the food chain is significant, as many people from the corporate sector very plainly pointed out when the Leader of the Opposition announced that policy only a couple of months ago - a policy he continues to support. I would also encourage the member for Herbert to encourage his constituent to directly engage with the Treasury panel and to ensure that the concerns raised by them are effectively addressed by the Treasury.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for the question. He, like I, appreciates the importance of the tourism sector to his electorate, especially the fabulous tourism opportunity at Bribie Island. He, like I, was amazed to hear the Leader of the Opposition this morning talking about tax reform. Yet again, the Leader of the Opposition has shown how out of touch he is with the Australian community when he said on radio: 'Any fair-minded analysis would suggest that mining companies were paying more than their fair share of tax.'This is not just about taxation reform to the resources sector in Australia; this is also about a fair return to the whole Australian community. This is about supporting households and businesses and, very importantly, it is also about supporting small and medium sized businesses in Australia, which are so vital to the tourism sector. I was therefore astounded to hear the comments of Senator Barnaby Joyce on Lateline last night. I remind members that he is not just a Queensland senator; he is also the shadow minister for regional development and infrastructure. This is what he said about the importance of the tourism sector in Australia, of which the restaurant sector is a vital component: 'The mining sector is slightly more important to us than the restaurant sector.' As the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism, I simply say that they are all important sections of the Australian community. Perhaps the member for Moncrieff ought to give his close mate, Senator Barnaby Joyce, a lecture on the importance of the tourism sector to the Australian community, especially the importance of the small business sector to that industry. For example, the tourism sector is worth $41 billion per year. It accounts for 3.6 per cent of Australia's GDP. It employs half a million Australians directly and just under a million Australians indirectly. From an export point of view, it accounts for just over 10 per cent of Australia's exports - our largest services export sector.In terms of the restaurant and catering sector, I remind the House that it was the opposition who last year sought to deny giving them assistance in the middle of the global financial crisis. I also bring to the attention of the House what Restaurant and Catering Australia has said on a number of occasions. It credits the government's decisive action with injecting at least $80 million into restaurant and catering businesses during the global financial crisis and with assisting them in getting through that very difficult challenge. But, yet again, we find the opposition dismissing the importance of the small and medium sized business sector of the Australian community. Having sought to deny them assistance during the global financial crisis, they are again seeking to deny them assistance out of a broader tax reform package. By way of example, the opposition is seeking to deny the 93 per cent of tourism businesses that are small to medium sized businesses the cash flow benefits of an instant write-off of assets worth up to $5,000. For tourism businesses that is important. It represents the potential immediate write-off of such assets as IT equipment, refrigerators, beds and other items of furniture that are very necessary for the purposes of refurbishing their businesses in a very tough competitive world.The opposition is also seeking to deny an annual saving of $94 million to the accommodation and food services sector from the potential reduction in the company tax rate from 30 to 28 per cent. The opposition is therefore effectively seeking to deny one or both of those benefits to 93 per cent of tourism businesses throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Many of them are in regional Australia. You would think that the shadow minister for regional development would have a better understanding of the importance of tourism, a better understanding of the importance of the restaurant industry and a better understanding of the importance of the small business sector to the Australian community. But, then again, I should not be amazed because I think he, like the Leader of the Opposition, has decided that this is not about tax reform in Australia. He has assessed that, from their point of view, there are bigger donations to come from the mining sector than from the small and medium sized business sector of the Australian community.The government will push on with this debate. Yes, there is a bit of rough and tumble but we are committed to winning through because this is about broad tax reform. This is not only about a fair return to the Australian community for the development of its resources; it is also about a helping hand, and appropriately so, to small business operators - and many of them are in the tourism sector that was so dismally dismissed by the shadow minister for regional development last night.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question. I understand that it is his birthday today - so happy birthday. The member for Dawson's -  -  - We are so pleased to see the good wishes flowing from the opposition as well. That is very generous and charitable of them. I am asked about threats to our 10-year $2.5 billion Trade Training Centres in Schools Program. This is a program that has been constantly vilified and misrepresented by the opposition. This is a program that is providing between half a million dollars and $1.5 million to each secondary school around the country in order to develop or refurbish a trade training centre facility.We know the opposition struggle with the truth - the Leader of the Opposition has made that very clear on national television. The opposition have constantly claimed - and, indeed, interjections today have repeated these false claims - that somehow this program has been changed so that fewer schools are benefiting. That claim is, of course, 100 per cent untrue. I invite those opposite to check the policy documents that were released at the time of the budget reply when the Prime Minister was the opposition leader - in the days when someone giving the budget reply would actually talk about things in the budget. In those policy documents we talked about schools getting between half a million dollars and $1.5 million in funding and about schools having the option of working together to pool those funds for a bigger facility. So every time the opposition criticise that, they criticise the decision of school principals - a disgraceful thing to do.This program has funded 230 projects in 732 schools. That is a total investment of $809.9 million. There are 135 projects underway, 13 trade training centres have been completed and 42 schools are already delivering new trade qualifications through their trade training centre funding - a great achievement, giving real skills for real jobs to Australian students.In the budget reply, which was delegated from the Leader of the Opposition to the shadow Treasurer and finally to the shadow finance minister, the opposition announced that it was going to cut this program. That was a very, very disappointing announcement for those schools that had not yet had funding approved - schools that had hoped to get a trade training centre in the future. Those schools were now hearing that the program was going to be cancelled if the opposition were elected - that is, 1,800 schools that would have wanted to benefit that would not be able to benefit in that event. That is very bad for those schools.But I have to inform the House that there is something even worse coming out of this cutback. On 5 November last year, 302 schools were approved for trade training centre funding, a total investment of $384.2 million. Those schools are approved for funding. They know they are getting their funding. They are making the arrangements for their trade training centre. Money is conveyed to those schools as they reach project milestones. There is money in the forward estimates so that those schools which have been approved for funding can get the funding they have been promised. It is this very money that the opposition say they are going to cut if elected. That means not just that schools which have not yet been approved would miss out but that schools which have been approved and are in the process of delivering their trade training centre would lose funding if the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party were elected at the next election. This is a cut of a magnitude that would mean approximately 180 schools and 62,000 students missing out, even though they have been approved for funding - a disgraceful cut, pulling the rug out from under these schools.At the conclusion of this answer, I will table a list of these schools by electorate and by state. I say to every member of this parliament that they should look at this list by electorate and by state and it will give them the names of the schools approved for funding that the Leader of the Opposition wants to cut. -  - They are approved for funding and the Leader of the Opposition wants to take their money away. No amount of interjecting will cover up that fact. Every member of the House should look at this list.Members opposite have a choice here. They can back their school communities and schools that have been approved for funding, which are rolling out their trade training centres now, or they can back the Leader of the Opposition. They cannot back both. Each and every member of the opposition will have to make a choice, 'Do I back my local schools approved for funding knowing that they are going to get those funds, or do I back the Leader of the Opposition?' And member by member we will call them to answer that question.Today I call the member for Dunkley to answer that question. He has not been a good supporter of the Leader of the Opposition and he will not be a supporter of the Leader of the Opposition after this. The member for Dunkley wrote to me about the Patterson River Secondary College trade training centre proposal. He said: 'I believe the local community would benefit greatly from this project, which would help young people and future job seekers develop new or existing skills and improve their employment prospects. It is my pleasure to endorse this project. Please let me know if you require any further information in support of this excellent proposal.'It was funded in round 2 for $19 million. It is a consortium involving a large number of schools. On this side of the House we want to deliver the $19 million that has been promised. The Leader of the Opposition wants to cut it. The member for Dunkley is the first member of the opposition that will need to make a public choice. Do you back the government and your local schools getting this funding or do you back your leader? You do not have the choice of both and you will need to make it publicly and on the record as will every member of the opposition. Mr Speaker, I table the list.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I agree with the member for Kennedy that this is actually a very serious issue. The hendra virus has already, as he mentioned in his question, taken four lives - one recently of a vet in Queensland. I am sure people on both sides of this House would like to extend condolences to the families affected. I understand that this is a very real concern for communities.I have been working with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry as you would expect to get advice from our team about steps that should be taken particularly to avert the hendra virus. It is probably worth reminding people in the House - I am sure the member for Kennedy is aware - that this disease is mostly found in bats and horses. It can be passed to humans with very close contact, but we have no evidence to date of there being any human-to-human transmission, which is an important factor in being able to assure the community that the virus is being closely watched and that there are serious issues. In fact earlier this week the government announced that they were investing some additional funds with the Queensland government to deal with a vaccine which would be available for horses. Of course the best way for us to stop the hendra virus, which is now known in Australia because it is transmitted amongst animals, is to look at treating it as an animal disease and therefore reducing exposure to humans. I will have to take on notice the member for Kennedy's reference to the CSIRO report. - I would appreciate it if you would let me finish. I am taking it seriously and I do not want to be dismissive of a serious question that is raised. I will have to take on notice the reference to the CSIRO report and make sure I get particular advice about the question raised for the nipah virus. That is not something that I can answer on the run but I am happy to provide an answer to it at a later time when I get that information. I think everyone in the community is concerned about these growing viruses. We take them seriously and I am happy to provide more information to the member.</DOC>

 - It is a great pleasure, following Monday night's victory by the Socceroos over New Zealand, that we can now farewell them, as they have headed off and are in flight on their way to South Africa to represent us amongst the best footballing nations on the planet at one of the biggest sporting events in the world. While Australia has a very long and proud history in the sporting arena, we should not underestimate what a major milestone this is and what a very big event it is. The Socceroos first game may be in just 18 days time, but this has been a very long endeavour in order for them to qualify for what is just their third World Cup and what is the first time we have qualified for back-to-back FIFA World Cups. And of course we did it in emphatic style by first of all taking on Qatar in Melbourne but then travelling around the world pursuing our qualification, doing so with still two games up our sleeves. So we should be incredibly proud of the Socceroos and the efforts they have put in already, but we all know that this is when the real competition starts.Like all Australians selected to represent us on the international sporting stage, the Socceroos will carry with them the hopes of literally millions of Australians who will be tuning in and following their every move. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Pim Verbeek, who will be coaching the Socceroos for the last time at this World Cup. We would like to thank him for all his hard work and wish him all the best over in South Africa, also acknowledging that we will have a new generation of players out there representing our country while we are also bidding to host this event within Australia.The squad announced yesterday as having been selected at this point will blend youth and experience. We have Socceroo icons like Lucas Neill and Mark Schwarzer, but we also have future stars like James Holland, Rhys Williams and 18-year-old Tommy Oar, who is setting himself up to provide a brilliant story in Australian sport. Importantly, the World Cup will also be a really significant occasion for us to push our case to host the World Cup in Australia. While our Socceroos will be working incredibly hard on the field, our officials will be out there working incredibly hard off the field to convince FIFA executives and voting members that Australia would be a great host for this major event in the future. This will provide a really important opportunity for us to do this.I would also note that thousands of Australian supporters will be travelling to South Africa for this event. The supporters will have an incredibly important role as ambassadors for our bid. It is interesting to note that, after South Africa, Australia has purchased the highest number of tickets per capita of any nation in the world to support their team with over 45,000 tickets sold to Australian supporters. To these supporters we say that you will be ambassadors for our bid. You will be out there showing your commitment and your passion for the sport. We would like to wish you very safe travels in doing so.I would like to remind those supporters of the government's advice that they access DFAT's World Cup specific travel bulletins and also that they register with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade their intention to travel. On behalf of the government I take this opportunity to farewell the Socceroos and also to wish them every success over there and to let them know that we will be right behind them every step of the way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. First of all, as the honourable member would know, North West Shelf projects currently exist under the federal crude oil excise regime. That has been the case for a long time - since about 1987. Secondly, the minister's response to the question which was posed to him by the media the other day and is reflected on by the member just now is entirely accurate. Thirdly, together with all industries, as we have said from the beginning, all companies are engaged in consultations with the Treasury panel on detailed implementation and on transition. That applies to those companies. It applies to all other companies in the mining sector. That is what we have said from the beginning. Our position has not changed.I say to those opposite, in their state of frenetic activity on this one, we on this side of the House welcome any question to do with tax reform. The reason we welcome any question is that these tax reforms are fundamental to delivering better super for working families, tax breaks for small business and, on top of that, support for infrastructure investments nationwide. The key development in the debate in the last 24 hours is from the shadow minister from finance - that is, he is embracing for the first time, on behalf of those opposite, the principle of a profit based tax system as opposed to a production base tax system.In question time today I went through the logic underpinning a profit based system. It is a flexible instrument which deals with the different profit circumstances of companies over time. It is sensitive to changes in commodities prices. Also on top of that it is an ability to replace comprehensively a patchwork of state royalties regimes and therefore boost production over time in the mining sector. That is the logic of a profits based regime. That is why it is good for the mining sector. That is why we are engaged in consultation with the consultation panel through Treasury with every company affected by this RSPT. That is what we have said from the beginning; that will continue in the future.Mr Speaker, mark this day down as that day those opposite embraced the principle of a profit based tax system for the resources sector. The member for Tangney, at the door this morning, was forced to make that concession. The shadow minister for finance has made that concession as well. The key question is: does the Leader of the Opposition back the shadow minister for finance or not? Every economist in the country, including even the MCA, backs a profit based regime. Where does the Leader of the Opposition stand on this other than to say he believes that the mining industry does not pay enough tax at present?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her very important question and her abiding support for ensuring we provide better safety in our communities. The federal government has been working very hard with local government and other community groups to ensure that we provide better support for our people in the community. What we have ensured is that we work in partnership with local councils. That is consistent with the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government's and the Prime Minister's efforts over the last two years to work in close partnership with local councils.The Safer Suburbs Plan has been a very effective approach to ensuring that we reduce crime and the fear of crime in our community. I recently visited Perth to see the success of several of those programs and I am pleased to outline some of those very successful programs to the House. Firstly, in the City of Gosnells in the member for Hasluck's electorate I visited a fantastic Thornlie civic precinct which has been revitalised through a safer suburbs grant of $500,000. The precinct comprises the Thornlie State Park, Thornlie Library and Leisure World. It is a great project giving young people a safe and visible place to participate, to join together. It is also a place where we can ensure greater engagement with social services for those young people who might be on the margins and might be vulnerable to falling into criminal or anti-social behaviour. This is a very good effort and I would like to applaud the efforts by the City of Gosnells and also the member for Hasluck for her advocacy for this program.Can I also mention the City of Swan. The government is providing better support for young people in the Ballajura area. I met and spoke to a number of those involved in this very exciting initiative that engages young people at risk of a life of crime and anti-social behaviour. This will reduce the likelihood of juveniles offending or re-offending and reduce crime and, as I said earlier, the fear of crime in our community. In the same municipality I was also pleased to launch the new mobile CCTV camera project, Oscar, which will be used to deter and, failing that, detect crime or anti-social behaviour in the City of Swan. These mobile CCTVs have been designed and built by officers and employees of the municipality of Swan and they should be commended for their efforts and their partnership with the federal government in order to protect the community in that municipality.In the City of Belmont, the Prime Minister and I were given a demonstration of an alarm assist project which involves the installation of alarms in businesses and residences in the municipality as well as a sophisticated CCTV system linking existing cameras and installing new ones in the Kooyong Road shopping precinct. This is a very important initiative and I do applaud the municipality for their efforts. In the City of Stirling the government funded security patrol vehicles monitoring hot spots by foot patrols and quad bikes for beach patrols in and around the Scarborough beach area.I would like to thank the member for Hasluck for her advocacy and support for these initiatives in her own electorate and, while I am on my feet, I would like to thank the member for Petrie, the member for Longman and the member for Wakefield, who I visited in their own electorates which have similar programs. The Rudd government will continue to work closely with local government, local police and community organisations to mitigate against crime, to reduce crimes against persons or property and, very importantly too, to reduce the fear of crime in our community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. I know that she has a very keen interest in conservation issues in Western Australia. It is the case that the government takes very seriously the protection of our environment, including those areas of high conservation and cultural value. There is no higher level of recognition than World Heritage listing. The Australian government submitted a World Heritage nomination for the Ningaloo Coast in Western Australia in January of this year and also included Ningaloo on the National Heritage List as well. I was particularly pleased to be able to deliver on this important election commitment of the Rudd government.I want to note that the Australian and Western Australian governments reached agreement on an appropriate boundary for the Ningaloo Coast nomination in early January this year. We wanted to submit a dossier that had the strongest chance of success and it was particularly important for us to work closely with the Western Australian government. I want to acknowledge the cooperation of the Premier of that state and the full support of the Western Australian government through this process. The Western Australian environment minister and I announced the submission of Ningaloo Coast to the World Heritage centre and also the gazettal of Ningaloo Coast as well.The nomination package includes a strategic management framework for the Ningaloo Coast and that sets out the management arrangements for all areas covered by the nomination, and that again is submitted to the World Heritage Centre on 28 January. In March I was pleased that the World Heritage Centre confirmed that the nomination met all the technical requirements, and so was in good shape to be evaluated over the coming year.The fact is that the world renowned Ningaloo fringing reef stretches hundreds of kilometres along a very arid coastline. The nomination reflects that it is a significant international area for the protection of an exceptional number of marine and terrestrial species - over 500 marine species. The incredible whale shark, whales, turtles, dolphins and over 200 coral species make it truly a landmark environment here in Australia.The fact is that World Heritage recognition is generally considered to be a kind of Nobel prize recognition for the high values that these places have. A recent study of the economic value of Australia's World Heritage places found that they generate some 120,000 jobs and economic benefits of around $12 billion per annum. This is a very significant economic contribution to Australia, and this contribution was particularly in our minds when we supported heritage projects as part of the Jobs Fund. In fact, I recall that we provided some $1.8 million for the Fremantle Prison main cell-block conservation project. Again, the member for Fremantle will recall this. It was a great boost to employment for those who were repairing Fremantle Prison, and important because Fremantle Prison makes up one of the 11 convict sites that Australia has for World Heritage nomination. I think that our prospects of success for that nomination are also very good.That fact is that Australia is mightily blessed to have a number of outstanding world heritage properties. Kakadu in the Northern Territory; the wet tropics and the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, and Uluru are important places which reflect high cultural values and important environmental values but, significantly, deliver significant economic benefits to Australians. This government is committed to their recognition, their protection and their ongoing good management.</DOC>

 - There could be a variety of reasons for that, and it may not be true. Let me give you one example of the way in which the opposition is misusing figures in this House. I will give you just one. They have sided with the mining council's assessment that the effective rate of tax paid by the mining industry in company tax is 27 cents in the dollar. But what they do not tell you is the way in which the mining industry council has calculated that, because it has only been calculated using taxable income - not economic income. So they are moving figures around all of the time and juggling them up. I am happy to stand behind any of the figures that I have issued and I will not be there with the mining council distorting figures like they are.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question. Of course, he has a great deal of interest in infrastructure because we are providing some $190 million for the upgrading of the Midland Highway in his electorate. That is part of the major road and rail infrastructure being provided by this government. Some $20 billion worth of projects commence this year - $20 billion. We have doubled the roads budget and we have quadrupled the rail budget.I am asked also about the importance of providing funds for commitments, and indeed that is important. In last week's budget, once again we provided all the funds there for the $37 billion nation-building plan. It is all set out. It is all part of memorandums of understanding with the states and territories governments. But some other members of parliament have been running around the country making commitments about infrastructure development. Indeed, on the Midland Highway, the Leader of the Opposition travelled to Launceston on 18 February, just three months ago. There he said - it was written down, fully scripted and, one would think, the gospel truth, because it was there in writing, in this speech:_ a future federal government will spend the $400 million that will be needed _So I looked at the statement from Andrew Robb, the shadow finance minister, who put forward all the funding commitments, and I looked for Midland Highway in the release last week: nothing, not a cent. But he is not alone. The member for Dickson made a commitment - actually in Dickson, not the Gold Coast! - again, when the Leader of the Opposition visited, on 28 April: $10 million for on- and off-ramps on the Bruce Highway in his electorate, at Murrumba Downs. So I looked for that commitment. Again, nothing - nothing there whatsoever, again an unfunded promise.I have a deep interest in the Pacific Highway, because we are providing $3.1 billion to fix up the Pacific Highway, and I noted that the member for Cowper, in spite of the fact that we are funding the Kempsey bypass, we are funding the Woolgoolga to Arrawarra upgrade - with both of those constructions commencing this year - has said we are not doing enough. - Indeed, he said the Kempsey bypass was funded by the previous government. You fool! It was a part of the Nation Building Program -  - through the -  - I withdraw - through the Building Australia Fund that the opposition opposed. The fact is that the member for Cowper called the Coffs Harbour bypass 'the most urgent infrastructure priority in Australia', so I expected funding for that to be there - not a zack.There is the Princes Highway down in Gilmore. The member for Gilmore said on 28 April that a coalition government would provide the $20 million for the Princes Highway to be upgraded, and said that what is needed is 'extraordinary funding'. She repeated the commitment outside parliament today. But last week, when the coalition had to put down what they are actually providing money for - because it takes money to build roads and railways and ports - there was nothing there from the shadow finance minister. I looked at the media release on Thursday, 20 May from the shadow minister for finance and, in small writing right down the bottom, it said:'In view of - and he went on about figures - _ any other past commitments have been discontinued,' said Mr Robb.So they are out there making these commitments, and, to be fair, they have got funding in there for the Toowoomba bypass - $280 million for a $1.5 billion project; the bypass that has become a footpath - but there is nothing else. There is not a single delivery of a single infrastructure commitment from those opposite.We have been out there today talking to regional Australia about these breaches of faith, about how the gospel truth is not quite gospel when it comes to those opposite. It gets better. The shadow minister for transport has put out a release in response. He says:_ the Coalition would meet its promises on road and rail funding, and they have all been allowed for within planned funding levels.Wait for this:'Most of the Coalition promises - 'most', we are not sure which ones; some of them are just completely dismissed - referred to today by Mr Albanese relate, in whole or in part, to funding to flow outside the current forward estimates and under the funding envelope for future AusLink national transport plans,' Mr Truss said.So they are not commitments for 2010; they are not commitments for 2013; they are commitments for their second or third term in office. There is confidence for you.He went on. Here is fiscal responsibility for you, National Party style. Mr Truss said:Other projects involve relatively small amounts of money - well, nothing that I mentioned will cost under $20 mil - and can easily be funded under the banner of the existing $26 billion - it is $37 billion, by the way - transport construction budget.So they are saying they will fund these small amounts some time down the track. They need to say what projects they will cut. They need to say which highways will not go ahead, which road upgrades will not go ahead, which rail projects will not go ahead and which port infrastructure will not go ahead. They have been caught out completely by the duplicitous nature of the way they have put this forward. They are prepared to say one thing in their electorate but another thing when it comes to actually stumping up the funds. The fact is that they are a desperate opposition. They are a divided rabble. We see from here that they are a threat to our economic security. What we need in infrastructure development is certainty on funding. With that release today, the shadow minister for transport has brought into question the funding agreements with states and territories for every transport project in the country. They are a threat to economic security.We know, because of the actions of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - not rebuked by the Leader of the Opposition - that they are also a threat to our national security. They are a threat to national security and a threat to the economy. They are a huge risk to this country. That is why we have just seen this pathetic attempt at a suspension. There has been no build-up; we have just seen the Julie Bishop defence strategy. That was all it was. I wonder whether she will come to the microphone and give a personal explanation, because that is what decency and integrity demand that she do.</DOC>

 - I notice that the once great Liberal Party has hauled up the surrender flag on tax policy and has now moved on to a debate on border protection. It took just three days of debate in this chamber on tax before they returned to old faithful. The Leader of the Opposition referred to coalition policy. The question arises as to whether this particular policy actually went through the coalition party room. This has been a matter of some debate today and we turn to our good friend the member for Cook, who had an interesting discussion on a radio program in Melbourne early this morning on 3AW. Neil Mitchell asked the member for Cook this question:Mitchell: Has this gone through the party room yet?Morrison: It has gone through our internal processes, as our policies do, and that is appropriate.Mitchell: So has it gone through the party room yet?Morrison: It has gone through our internal processes. It is official coalition policy.Mitchell: What does that mean?Morrison: It has been signed off the way we sign off policy. That is what happened Neil.Mitchell: Does that involve the party room?Morrison: It enjoys the strong support of the party room.Ten times he was asked this question; ten times he refused to answer. We know why because the member for Kooyong has already belled the cat. There was no internal party room process. Which begs the question: is this the full gospel truth or is it the Tony Abbott truth? Is it in writing or is it not in writing?Can I say this in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question: back in March in Melbourne he came out through the Melbourne Herald Sun guaranteeing he would stop the boats and shut the border. That was his guarantee on 31 March. Two months later, it is pretty interesting to hear what the Leader of the Opposition had to say in a press conference earlier today. Listen carefully to what the Leader of the Opposition said today when asked to provide the same guarantee. The journalist asked, 'Can you guarantee that you will stop the boats?' -  - Today at the press conference the Leader of the Opposition was asked by a journalist, 'Can you guarantee that you will stop the boats?' Abbott replied, 'Someone else with a question?' The favourite one was the last question of the press conference. The journalist asked, 'Do you guarantee that this policy will stop the boats coming?' Tony Abbott replied: 'Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you.' That is what I call definitive public policy. That is what I call a rock solid, iron clad guarantee. That is what I call straight-talking Tony. That is what I call full gospel Tony. What we do know is that, if we do not get it in writing from Tony, we should not give it any attention at all.</DOC>

 - Notwithstanding the fact that the once great Liberal Party has abandoned the tax policy debate and has hauled up the white flag on the need for a profits based tax for the future of the resources sector, for which we thank various members opposite for their contributions yesterday, this government believes in the importance of tax reform for Australia. For this government, the importance of keeping the Australian economy strong depends on (1) keeping our economy out of recession, (2) making sure that we are returning the budget to surplus three years ahead of time and (3) implementing fundamental economic reform, including tax reform. Furthermore, tax reform is essential because it enables us to increase super for working families, it enables us to bring about tax cuts for small business and it enables us to build infrastructure for Australia's future.In the last 24 hours the opposition has gone very cold on the tax debate indeed. After three days of chaos and confusion in their ranks they have now scurried away from the debate altogether. The government is happy to continue to prosecute this debate because we believe it is a fundamental reform for Australia's future. There are two issues at stake in this debate. One is the design of the tax and the government's plan for a tax on profits as opposed to a tax on production, and the other is the level of the tax - the government's plan for an RSPT 40 per cent tax credit on a company's investment and a 40 per cent tax on super normal profits.Yesterday, on the design of the tax, the opposition tapped the mat. They fundamentally tapped the mat. In fact, we had the Leader of the Opposition out there yesterday saying that this new tax system would plunge a dagger into the heart of the Australian economy. That is what he had to say. That was before the shadow finance minister stood up and said, 'This debate has never been about the design of the tax but simply about the level of the tax.' Then we had the good old member for Tangney - the two of them seem to be missing today, the member for Tangney and the shadow minister for finance - who said that there is potential that taxing profits is better than simply taxing volume. He has moved - I am sorry about that.On the design of the tax and the need for a profits based tax as opposed to a production based tax, those opposite have hauled up the white flag and conceded defeat because they know that Peter Costello supported a profits based regime. They know that the former Leader of the National Party supported a profits based regime and they know that most people serious in the economic debate support that for the simple reason that it is the most flexible way of encouraging the expansion of the industry over time, making the tax returns commensurate with the level of commodity prices over term, enabling small and medium capped firms to enter into the mining industry and to broaden the base of that industry and to replace the patchwork quilt of state royalty regimes with a comprehensive profits based tax. That is issue No. 1: the actual design of the tax where the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues have hauled up the white flag.No. 2 on the level of tax is where it gets really interesting. This is where we have had this complete evolution in the opposition's position over the course of this week. Our position is very clear: 10 years ago $1 out of $3 profit went in royalties; 10 years later $1 in $7 came back in royalties. That is why we need fundamental reform. But on this we have had nothing less than absolute chaos and confusion. Earlier this week - I think it might have been on Tuesday - we had the Leader of the Opposition coming out and saying that he believed that mining companies were paying too much tax. That is his position. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition came out and said that they were paying just the right amount of tax. Nice one, Julie! You got that one I suppose a bit better than you got other things in recent days. - Thirdly, we had the shadow infrastructure minister come out and say that miners are not paying enough tax. So we have had too much, not enough and just right - as I said yesterday, the Goldilocks policy on tax from the opposition: that is, they cannot quite settle on it. Today we had a further contribution from the good old member for Kalgoorlie. Where is he? Is he missing in action from the debate today? He was asked today a question on the level of tax: 'Do you agree with Tony Abbott when he says they pay more than a fair share of tax?' Mr Haase said, 'No, I do not.' There you go. 'And, you know, you're going to question me as to why I disagree with my leader, but I'm pretty close to the mining industry.' So there we have the member for Kalgoorlie repudiating his leader.It gets better because the member for Kalgoorlie was then asked, 'But, Barry, isn't it damaging, though, for the opposition to have different options on whether or not mining companies are paying too much tax or not enough tax? The government is keen to exploit that.' Mr Haase, the member for Kalgoorlie, then said, 'I think individual points of view are a fine thing.' In other words, it is not just a question of having a tax policy which says you are paying too much tax, not enough tax and just enough tax. In fact, he says that everyone in the opposition should have their own individual tax policy. That is where we have got to - Monday, too much tax; Tuesday, not enough tax; Wednesday, just the right amount of tax; and Thursday, everyone should have a tax policy. What we have seen on tax policy is abject chaos and confusion on the part of those opposite. It is very simple. If you cannot manage a tax system, you cannot manage the public finance of Australia. What you have had is a chaotic opposition who would in government be a chaotic government. If you cannot manage the tax policy of the country, you cannot manage the economy of the country, and you cannot manage the country itself.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. First of all, could I turn to the correspondence that he refers to: Minister Garrett's letters to me dated 27 August, 28 October and 30 October. These have been provided to the Senate in their entirety, although not requested by the Senate orders, complete with my letters to Mr Garrett dated 4 September, 29 October and 2 November. These have been provided voluntarily to the Senate. Furthermore, as I outlined in the House on 11 March, there are a number of actions and changes to the program that the responsible minister proposed during 2009 to address a range of safety issues. These have all been reviewed by Dr Hawke in the context of his review.The member for Flinders asks about cabinet deliberations. I refer him to the updates which were provided to the cabinet through the Nation Building and Jobs Plan implementation reports. I have reported on those earlier in this parliament. Furthermore, could I say to the honourable member for Flinders that, from 1 July 2009, subsequent to the introduction of the program, there were a number of changes to it. The Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts issued 26 installer notices under their Home Insulation Program that went to every registered installer. These notices often dealt with safety issues, including reminders around electrical safety and any updates to the program guidelines. Furthermore, can I say to the member for Flinders that, from 1 July 2009 -  - The question from the member for Flinders went to cabinet deliberations, to correspondence with the minister and to a letter which I will come to presently. I am answering the honourable member's questions in sequence. From 1 July -  - If I were the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on the question of adhering to proper protocols I would ask her to reflect on her behaviour in recent days. - From 1 July 2009 the program guidelines outlined strict requirements for installers to have occupational health and safety training. There was also a construction industry pocketbook provided to registered installers which specifically -  - On 14 August, I received a letter from the minister proposing increased compliance requirements for the Home Insulation Program. On 17 August, the relevant cabinet committee considered the compliance issues raised by the minister in his 14 August letter. The committee approved changes to the program guidelines, including requiring physical site inspections and a range of other measures. On 27 August 2009, I received a letter from the minister proposing changes to the program to require installers to provide physical evidence of qualifications and/or competencies before they are registered.On 28 August the changes to the program guidelines were released. Furthermore, these guidelines required from 1 September 2009 the following: the requirement for installers to undertake a physical site inspection before providing a written quote to improve the quality of quotations; the requirement of installers, including those currently in the process of registering, to provide evidence of qualifications and/or competencies at the time of registration; and the provision of a price guide advisory for different types of insulation products and other variables to educate householders and installers. Furthermore installers charging above the maximum recommended price would be required to explain why -  - on the quote provided to the householders. On 28 October the minister wrote to me to indicate the actions he intended to take in response. These included requiring householders to get two quotes and to publish a public list of deregistered installers. On 29 October, I responded to this letter agreeing to the minister's proposal to tighten the guidelines.On 30 October Minister Garrett wrote to me in relation to safety issues in the Home Insulation Program. The letter proposed to roll out an electrical safety testing program for homes that had had foil insulation and proposed a ban on metal fasteners and proposed to mandate the use of covers over down lights and other ceiling appliances.On 2 November 2009, I replied to the minister noting the package of safety measures he had proposed and from 2 November 2009, under the Home Insulation Program, metal fasteners for foil insulation were banned. Installation of covers over down lights and other ceiling appliances were mandated. The government announced it was implementing a target electrical safety program.The further part of the honourable members question goes to a further letter on the part of the then minister, Minister Garrett. A letter from Mr Garrett dated 14 August 2009 was a proposal for increased compliance requirements for the HIP and it is a cabinet document which was considered by a cabinet committee on 17 August 2009. -  - Before those opposite become too excited, they will note that I have already provided an outline of what was in the 14 August 2009 letter and the other letters to which I referred in the House on 11 March 2010. To remind the honourable member what I said about it at that time:On 17 August, the relevant cabinet committee considered the compliance issues raised by the minister in his 14 August letter. The committee approved changes to the program guidelines which included requiring the following: physical site inspections prior to giving quotes, increased inspections and scrutiny of trainer qualifications, increased compliance communications and processes for suspending and deregistering non-compliant installers.I have therefore in the past been more than happy to provide a description of the contents of these letters, including the one which is a cabinet document. In terms of the handling of that particular document, we have adhered to the processes which have been applied by all previous Australian governments.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question because the OECD's latest Economic Outlook confirms that Australia's economic growth and employment outlook is among the best in the OECD. The report is yet another reminder of the strong economic management which has seen Australia fight off a global recession and emerge in a much stronger position than just about any other country in the developed world.The report makes a number of very important points. We are one of the strongest economies in the OECD, we have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the OECD and we have one of the best fiscal positions in the developed world. Contrast this to what is happening across the OECD. In the past two years there has been something like 16 million jobs lost. Just think about that for a moment, think about the devastation that causes in local communities and across whole economies, and compare that to the performance of the Australian economy where, in the last period, we have created something like 250,000 additional jobs. That is certainly celebrated by everybody on this side of the House because we understand how important it was to keep the economy going when the global economy fell off the cliff at the end of 2008 and in early 2009. We had very difficult global circumstances but in those circumstances Australia performed very strongly. That is something everyone in this country can be proud of. The OECD report says:After weathering the crisis well in 2009, the Australian economy is projected to experience strong growth in 2010 and 2011.The OECD is now forecasting growth for Australia at 3.2 per cent in 2010 and 3.6 per cent in 2011. The forecasts for unemployment are also equally encouraging. They are forecasting unemployment of 4.8 per cent by the end of next year, which is dramatically lower than the eight per cent expected for the OECD area as a whole. That is the comparison. That means there are Australians in jobs who are going home with a pay cheque at night. It is happening in this country; it is not happening in many of those other countries. So we have to make sure that we put in place a very strong fiscal framework to ensure prosperity as we go forward, particularly when we consider the backdrop of what is happening in Europe.This comment from the OECD is particularly important. It talks about the government's fiscal settings. It says they are 'welcome given the rebound in activity'. It goes on to say:_ in view of the stronger economy and fiscal restraint, the government now expects to balance its budget by 2012/13, three years earlier than previously anticipated.This is a fiscal position that is the envy of the developed world. We have got to this point because of responsible economic management, bringing the budget back to surplus in three years - three years early - and ahead of every other major advanced economy. This is what the OECD Secretary-General had to say:_ you have navigated well through this difficult time. The behaviour of Australia may not be very typical because you have done so well but holding up you have never had a big recession; it did have a very big positive impact on growth. I wish we could export your recipe.He had a few other things to say as well. He made some comments about the resource super profits tax. This is what the Secretary-General of the OECD had to say last weekend. He went on to make this point:In the particular case when you're talking about the availability of raw materials _ my impression is that taxes are not the major reason why they would invest _                         _                   _                   _I think if you look at these things strategically _ of course it's a wise thing _ to invest in Australia.Indeed, it is. You can see this particularly in the major investment that has been put forward in recent days in Queensland by the major coal companies who are wishing to invest in rail. They are optimistic about the future of this country. The government is optimistic about the future of this country. What we must do is modernise our tax system. What we must do is get a modern tax system in terms of resources. And what we must do is give the incentive for companies through lower taxes, particularly for small business, to continue to invest and to create jobs. That is something that we should all be very proud of.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. Tax reform as proposed by the government is very important for the Australian economy. Econtech modelling shows that the government's tax package will lead to higher growth, will be good for jobs, will be good for the state of public finances and, indeed, good for Australia's resources sector.The proceeds from the Resource Super Profits Tax that the government is proposing in this tax package go to cutting company tax, cutting tax on small business, improving superannuation tax concessions for low- and middle-income earners, providing a tax break for small savings and providing a guaranteed $1,000 tax deduction on ordinary personal tax returns. Under the Rudd government, you will have a 28 per cent company tax rate. Under an Abbott government, you will have an almost 32 per cent - 31.7 per cent - company tax rate, according to their own announced policy positions.We have heard a lot of wild claims, many of them from the opposition but not only from the opposition, in this debate. We have seen a lot of very vigorous, very robust, prosecution of self-interest on the part of people in the mining sector. It is notable, as the Treasurer mentioned, that there is a big statement of confidence in the future of Australia's mineral sector that has been made by coal companies just today by announcing an almost $5 billion bid for the rail infrastructure of the Queensland Rail Corporation. That is hardly the action of a sector that thinks that there is no future in mining in Australia.The key points are these: first, the Australian people own these resources and the taxing mechanisms are the means by which they extract the price for selling those resources to mining companies that extract them, process them and onsell them. Secondly, mineral prices globally have soared. They are at new levels and are likely to remain at those levels. Therefore, the proportion of the total price that the Australian people get from their resources has diminished substantially. The Australian people are entitled to get a fair return for those resources. Thirdly, those mining companies get very generous tax concessions on their company tax payments and, as a result, at the moment, broadly, over an extended period they have typically been paying around 17 per cent in company tax compared with 29 per cent for financial services and 27 per cent for transport. Finally, taxing profits is a much more efficient mechanism in this sector than taxing production or taxing volume. It is a much more efficient mechanism for extracting the value for the Australian people for their resources.It is unclear what the opposition's position is on this question of whether or not the government's tax package is good for the Australian economy and strengthening the Australian economy, because we have had several positions during this week. On Monday, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that the mining industry was paying its fair share of tax. On Tuesday, Senator Joyce said it could pay more than it is currently paying. On Wednesday, the Leader of the Opposition said that the mining industry is paying more than its fair share of tax. Also on Wednesday, the shadow finance minister, the member for Goldstein, indicated that the opposition did not appear to object to the design of the tax, that that was not the issue, and therefore he and the opposition are happy with a profit based tax. Just today, we had a media alert put out by the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, at 7 past 10 announcing a doorstop media interview at half past 10. About five or 10 minutes later the Leader of the Opposition also put out a media alert saying he was going to have a doorstop, which ended up being about asylum seekers. At 20 past 10 a media alert was put out by the shadow Treasurer saying that the 10.30 doorstop had been postponed. They moved right away from the debate about the tax reform issue. -  - It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition did not even tell the shadow Treasurer he was going to have a doorstop on asylum seekers.But this raises a key question: what is the opposition's policy going to be, heading into the election, on the government's tax reform proposals? Is it to defend the status quo? Is it to support a profit based tax? Is it to reduce taxes on the resources sector? I know one thing about this; it will be very interesting in the campaign when the Leader of the Opposition turns up in Cairns and talks to the tourism industry about why they should be paying higher taxes under a Liberal government. It will be very interesting when he turns up in Geelong and talks to the manufacturing industry and tells them why they should be paying higher taxes under a Liberal government. It will be interesting when he turns up in Lismore and talks to small business there and tells them why they should be paying higher taxes under a Liberal government. Because, under his proposals, company tax will be nearly four per cent higher, there will be no $5,000 immediate write-off of costs for small business, there will be no increased superannuation and savings tax concessions and there will be no automatic tax deduction of $1,000.It is one thing to throw verbal bombs, to throw all the one-liners and the TV grabs that we hear from the Leader of the Opposition; it is one thing to run around squawking 'great big new tax' every time somebody drops $10 in the street; but the moment of truth is going to arrive when the opposition will have to front up to the Australian people and indicate why they are putting the interests of one sector, which is now paying a much lower proportion of its profits as tax than it previously did on minerals that are the Australian people's asset, ahead of all the other businesses all around Australia that are struggling to get by. That is the thing that they are going to have to explain to businesses all around the country.</DOC>

 - I stand by all of the numbers and all of the charts in my economic note -  - and we know what they are, but those opposite do not want to understand what they mean, because what they mean is that the Australian people have not been getting a fair share, and what we have now seen in this House is that those opposite do not care. They simply do not care, so they are going to let the bounty of our resources just walk out the door. They do not care if it is reinvested in our community, they do not care whether it is reinvested in superannuation, they do not care about a lower company tax rate for tourism operators or the manufacturing industry - they do not care about any of that because they have sold out to the mining companies. Now, Phony Tony comes in here and -  - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition comes in here and wants to pretend that he stands up for small business and families, but he is prepared to let a situation go on where the Australian people are not getting a fair share of the mineral resources that they own 100 per cent which can only be mined once and which are absolutely essential -  - Yes, I am going to the numbers behind the document, and that is what they find so uncomfortable, because the purpose of that central pie chart is to describe the situation where the Australian people have not been getting a fair share. But this seems to be completely irrelevant to those opposite. Nobody is seriously contesting this. Not even the mining industry is seriously contesting the fact that they need to pay a bit more because the underlying value of our resources has increased substantially and that, if we want to move forward as a modern economy, we should take those revenues and invest them in a lower corporate rate so we can meet the challenges of the mining boom mark 2. They are so embarrassed that they are opposing a lower corporate rate and at the same time they are proposing an increased corporate rate. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. She is a member in this House who stands up for her electorate. As I explained to the House yesterday, last November we approved 302 schools for funding for trade training centres. Schools approved know that they are getting the money and are excitedly making plans to implement their trade training centre. The Leader of the Opposition has announced that he will cut the funding that is supposed to be going to those schools - schools that have been promised funding and that are now at risk of losing their funding because of the Leader of the Opposition.Yesterday I said that we would look for a member of the coalition who is prepared to stand up for their electorate and say, 'I want the schools in my electorate that have been promised money to get that money,' to stand up to the Leader of the Opposition and say, 'It is wrong that you want to cut the equivalent of 180 trade training centres from schools that have been promised the money since last November. Yesterday we asked the member for Dunkley whether he would be a coalition member prepared to stand up for his electorate, and the answer has clearly been no. He will meekly follow the Leader of the Opposition and allow the trade training centres promised in his electorate to be cut.I asked today about another member of the coalition - the member for Bradfield. Our old friend the member for Bradfield does not have a happy record with the schools in his electorate, as we know. But maybe he could overcome his unhappy record with the schools in his electorate if he was prepared to stand up for St Ives High School and Sir Eric Woodward Memorial School and make sure that they get their trade training centre. He would need to tell the Leader of the Opposition that he is wrong to cut this funding. We will wait for 24 hours to see whether the member for Bradfield is a man who is prepared to say to the Leader of the Opposition: 'My schools have been promised money. They were promised it last November and it is wrong of you to rip that money directly out of their hands.'  -  
 - While she is not here, let me indicate that there is also a test for the member for Gilmore. I note the member for Bradfield. He is big on yelling in this House. The question is: will he stand up for his local schools? We will wait to see that answered. The member for Gilmore, who is not here, wrote to me about the failure of a school in her electorate to be approved for a trade training centre. She said that we had had the rounds, the applications, and we have had had more schools apply than could get in the first few rounds or applications. She wrote to me because she was very disappointed that a school in her electorate did not get approved. She said:It has come to my attention that Vincentia High School has been unsuccessful in their application for a much needed Trade Training Centre. This school is one of the most disadvantaged schools in my electorate of Gilmore, reflected in the data outlined on the My School website _Another thing delivered by the Rudd government in education. She said:Many of the students come from low socioeconomic or Indigenous backgrounds, and the area itself is quite isolated from tertiary opportunities and services like public transport. The principal, Steve Glenday, has written to express disappointment.I accept absolutely that the member for Gilmore is genuinely concerned about this school not getting its trade training centre, but the test for her is whether she will now go to the Leader of the Opposition and say, 'If you go ahead with this cutback, Vincentia School will never get its trade training centre.' The only way it will ever get a trade training centre is under the Rudd government's 10-year program, if the Leader of the Opposition stops being a risk to this program.Yesterday when I raised this matter in here the member for Goldstein, who also is not here today - the shadow finance minister who announced these cuts - yelled out, 'We'll have a better plan.' And I thought, 'Gee, the member for Goldstein with a better plan - that will be interesting.' I checked on the performance of the member for Goldstein when he was a minister with responsibility in this area. In 2007 he famously said: 'We've got a problem with skills shortage. We knew it was coming, but it has arrived with a force, and it is only going to get worse.' That is the record of the member for Goldstein in dealing with skills shortages - knew they were coming, did not do anything about it. - The member for Menzies helpfully yells out, 'What about technical colleges?' Thank you very much, Member for Menzies. I have looked at the track record of the Howard government on technical colleges, and let me illuminate the House on their record. In 2004 the Liberals promised that Australian technical colleges would help 21,000 students over four years at a cost of $289 million. Okay, that was a promise. What in fact happened? It cost $440 million to establish 24 colleges that ended up with 3,000 enrolled students. Let me just give you those numbers again - you would not have to blitz the grade 3 NAPLAN test to understand the import of these numbers: $440 million for 3,000 students enrolled, a cost per student of $140,000.So let us not hear any nonsense from the opposition about having a better plan. Their track record in government is absolutely clear: $140,000 per student, watched skills shortages coming and just waved their hands in the air and did absolutely nothing. And now the Leader of the Opposition sitting there is a risk to the trade training centres in schools, particularly the more than 300 schools that have had funds approved and who are going to have those funds ripped out of their hands by the Leader of the Opposition. The search for a member of the coalition prepared to stand up for their electorate will continue. We have not found one yet.</DOC>

 - I say to the honourable member who asked the question that the Treasury, as I understand it, are in consultation with a range of businesses concerning the detailed implementation and transitional arrangements with the proposed RSPT. We are confident that, when it comes to the industries in the area he refers to, those consultations will be productive. We are very mindful of the implications as they relate to magnetite. We are very mindful of the implications as they relate to those employed in related industries. We intend to get on with the business of proper consultation with industry and make sure we bring about tax reform: beneficial tax reform in the form of small business tax cuts across the country, tax reform that brings down the company rate across the country, tax reform that delivers better super for all working Australians and tax reform which funds future infrastructure, including in communities like Whyalla.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question. I am glad he had an opportunity to repeat it after it was so interrupted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who of course has been revealed this week as a threat to national security, and the Leader of the Opposition, who in the past has been a threat to the personal security of a member in this House. - Going to the question of the member for Lindsay on productivity: given the level of disinterest of the opposition on economics, I suspect they will not listen. - If it assists the House, I withdraw, Mr Speaker. - The question was about the productivity agenda of this government, which is obviously something that the opposition are not interested in, because their leader is bored by economics - that is a matter that is on the public record; it was raised by the former Treasurer. This government has been investing in productivity. In particular it has invested in a national system of paid parental leave, an increase in the child care tax rebate to 50 per cent, outcomes from early childhood programs equivalent to best practice in other countries, a year 12 attainment rate of 90 per cent by 2015, 40 per cent of 25- to 34-year-olds with a bachelor degree being attained by 2025, and halving the proportion of 20- to 64-year-olds without a certificate III qualification.We have had the benefits of these national goals, which we are working towards and delivering on, modelled by Econtech. That modelling shows that over the next 15 years this would benefit our economy by up to $60 billion and from 2010 to 2040 by $108 billion. This would see more than half a million jobs added to the Australian economy every year.I was asked about this productivity agenda and about threats to this productivity agenda. Of course, the threats to this productivity agenda are clear. They are clear from the cutbacks announced by the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister in the game of 'pass the budget-reply parcel'. These cuts include preventing 120,000 students getting computers. There is a theme to the opposition's cutbacks. They are against the NBN, they are against kids getting computers in schools and they are against e-health. We are the party of the future that is preparing the nation for the future; they are the party of the past. We are the party of the National Broadband Network, computers in schools and e-health; they are the party of the Olivetti manual typewriter. That is where they want to take the nation.As well, they want to cut our vital investments in teacher quality, investments which are enabling the best teachers to be paid more to go to the schools that need them the most. They want to cut our trades training centre programs. They want to risk 90,000 people in training through their cuts to the Productivity Places program, including 18,000 apprentices currently in training.When we look at all this we know that they are a risk. We know too that they are a risk to our school modernisation program, to Building the Education Revolution. The problem here of course is that they are being phoney. They are not being honest about the proposed cutbacks to schools. The Master Builders Association has indicated publicly that the investment in school infrastructure is supporting 31,000 businesses around the country. They have certainly said that without this activity in building and construction we would have seen job losses as high as 35,000.The Leader of the Opposition went to the Master Builders Association last night and spoke. But he did not utter a word about his plans to cost that industry 35,000 jobs through the threats that he is posing to economic stimulus. Instead, he went and said about the Labor Party:They don't like business.Who is it that is supporting business: this side of the House that wants to keep the doors of businesses open, or that side of the House that wants to cut economic stimulus and close businesses down; this side of the House that wants to make sure businesses have the skills, apprentices and tradespeople that they need, or that side of the House that wants to cut the vital investment into Productivity Places and trades training centre programs; this side of the House that wants to provide the National Broadband Network, the infrastructure of the future, or that side of the House that wants to cut it? This means of course that the Leader of the Opposition is a huge risk to the Australian economy and to the prosperity that supports Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question, which is presumably why the Newcastle Herald, I am advised, editorialised in support of the government's proposed tax. -  - I will stand to be corrected. I have been advised by others that there was a generally supportive approach to it. -  -  -  -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The reason we are engaged in tax reform is because we want to ensure that we have an increase in the overall competitiveness of the Australian economy, and that includes in regions like the Hunter and Newcastle and right across the nation. You do that by making sure that you have got globally competitive tax rates for Australian businesses. You bring down the tax burden for Australian small business. As the finance minister quite rightly said in his response to an earlier question, the contrast now is stark when it comes to the company tax rate. How many companies, for example, in the honourable member's electorate will be paying the company tax rate? Under this government it comes down to 28 per cent. Under the proposal by the Leader of the Opposition it goes up to 32 per cent. That is a four percentage point difference in the company tax rate for all those companies in the electorate of Paterson.Furthermore, how many small businesses do we think there are in the electorate of Paterson? A large number, and I am sure the relevant minister will give me the figure before long. Small businesses, in addition, those that are not incorporated, will all benefit from the additional measure of the tax break concerning $5,000 of their assets in a given year.These are the changes that we make to the economy on the ground. A further change that we make to the economy on the ground in electorates such as that represented by the member for Paterson is an investment in the Hunter Expressway, a very large scale investment in the transport infrastructure of the region - $1.45 billion. I seem to remember that the member for Paterson promised this, and promised this again - and guess what happened? Nothing actually happened. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The question from the honourable member for Paterson was about the impact of the government's tax reform proposal on the economy of his region. That is what I am responding to. The purpose of the government's tax reform is to make it possible to bring down the company tax rate right across the country to increase our global competitiveness - as opposed to those opposite, who would increase the company tax rate, thereby impeding the profitability of firms across the economy and doing the same to small business. I am advised reliably by the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy that there are 4,194 small businesses in his electorate that stand to benefit from this government's special tax break on $5,000 of assets in a given year in order to take the burden of tax from small business, so much the engine room of our economy.Another reason that we are investing in tax reform is to make sure that we can fund the country's future infrastructure needs. The member for Sturt took a point of order in terms of the relevance of this matter. The funding of infrastructure is one of the core cornerstones of the reason we are constructing this tax reform. We are doing it so that we can fund the nation's future infrastructure; fund what is necessary for the construction of the Hunter Expressway, a very large project - $1.4 billion. Does he assume that this money grows on trees? It does not. We need to derive this money from the tax base of the Commonwealth in order to make sure that infrastructure is built.The member for Paterson spoke specifically about the industries within his region: the port and the associated resource industries around coal. We are investing something in the vicinity of half-a-billion dollars through the ARTC to increase the overall efficiency of the rail infrastructure to make that port, the port of Newcastle, as efficient as possible. He asks, therefore, what we are doing for the businesses and economies of his region. I welcome that sort of question from any member opposite, because we are bringing down the company rate, bringing down the tax burden on small business, boosting the super payments for all the workers in your electorate, increasing our ability to invest in projects like the Hunter Expressway and investing in projects like the ones that the ARTC is investing in in terms of the rail efficiency of the port of Newcastle. These are the practical things which make a difference. We believe that this is an absolutely essential reform for the nation's future.I say therefore to the member for Paterson that the important thing is to be actually fair dinkum about tax reform. We saw what happened in terms of fair dinkum tax policy from those opposite during the course of last week. They could not render the full gospel truth of whether they thought that there was enough tax, too much tax, just enough tax, or whether anyone should have a tax policy on the benches of those opposite. We have had this change time and time again. But there is more. I have just been alerted to the fact that, on the question of the full gospel truth, we have had another major backflip by the Leader of the Opposition on policy. We have seen it on tax; we have seen it on the party room. We have seen it also in the party room's deliberations on border protection and the assurances that he gave about shutting the border. This one goes to climate change. - Mr Speaker, in the context of the carbon based industries within the region referred to by the member for Paterson, I would assume that those who accept the science would regard the opposition's policy on climate change relevant to the long-term development of the coal industry in the Hunter. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has famously declared in the past the settled science - he called it 'so-called settled science' - of climate change science to be crap. That is his word: 'The argument is absolutely crap.' But today he has said this: 'I am confident based on the science that mankind does make a difference to the climate. Almost certainly the impact of humans on the planet extends to climate.' - It is a question of whether those opposite are participating in this debate in a bona fide way. Are they fair dinkum? Is this full gospel or not? We have seen a complete backflip on the question of tax policy; we have seen them twist and turn on so many other issues. I will conclude by quoting the headline of the Newcastle Herald to which the honourable member for Paterson referred before. It says -  -  - They are very sensitive to what has happened in terms of the twists and turns of their policy. The member for Paterson spoke before about the editorial of the Newcastle Herald. It was entitled 'Australia's mining industry can afford to pay more taxes without its viability being threatened'. I think that the Newcastle Herald says it all.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question and for organising meetings with the Swan Chamber of Commerce and the Kalamunda Chamber of Commerce. That was a very good opportunity to discuss the issues of concern for small business in her electorate. She has always been a strong advocate for small business. Yes, Opposition Leader, that is you and it is coming. You have a very confused look on your head and we will get to that.During the global recession, the Rudd Labor government supported small businesses through the stimulus package and through a special small-business tax break. We think they behaved magnificently, keeping people on, although perhaps reducing hours. We want to thank them and support them during the recovery phase through small-business tax breaks. There are two major tax breaks. The first is that for every one of Australia's small businesses, 2.4 million of them, there would be instant write-off of the value of assets up to $5,000. That has been strongly welcomed by the Council of Small Business of Australia. Contrary to assertions from the opposition, it applies to every small business in Australia.The second tax break is a reduction in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent. That is a head start reduction - that is, starting on 1 July 2012. That is great news for small business as well - great news if we can get the legislation through the Senate, but the bad news is that the opposition has already indicated that it will block the small-business tax breaks. What has the opposition got against small business? The member for Herbert will have to explain to the 11,133 businesses in his electorate why he is denying them a tax break and, if he does not, we will. So, for the member for Herbert there are 11,000. The member for Hinkler is here. The member for Hinkler will need to explain to the 10,000 small businesses in his electorate why the coalition would deny them a small-business tax break and, if he does not, we will.The member for Ryan will not be explaining anything and he is not here today, but the candidate for Ryan - and I am reliably informed Councillor Jane Prentice from the Liberal-National Party is looking good there at two to one on - will have to explain to the 12,500 businesses in the electorate of Ryan why she is denying them a small-business tax break. I saw that my friend the member for Dickson was having a chat with the member for McPherson. It is not too late. You can make the move to McPherson, but, if you do not get the nod there, if you cannot convince the existing candidate, then the member for Dickson will have to explain to 11,900 small businesses why he is denying them a tax break. Why would you do that?The member for Bowman is not here. I think he is into the party pies early. He has gone. A total of 11,676 small businesses will be saying, 'Why am I being denied a small-business tax break by the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Bowman?' The member for Gilmore will have to explain to 8,000 small businesses. The member for Greenway will have to explain to 12,960 small businesses why she is denying them a tax break. I see the member for Hughes. The member for Hughes will have to explain why 12,000 small businesses in her electorate are going to miss out on a tax break if her leader gets his way. The member for Macarthur, if he still has any interest in the matter, will have to explain to 8,400. The member for Paterson has 4,194. That is a big job. Go around door-to-door and explain. He can also explain why he cannot read the newspaper that editorialised in favour of the resources tax, in favour of the mining industry paying more tax.The member for McEwen was formerly the Minister for Small Business and Tourism. Why wouldn't a former small business minister go to the opposition leader and say, 'Don't do it, Tony, please don't do it, because I will have to explain to 12,000 small businesses why I am denying them a small-business tax break.' There are 5,175 small businesses for the member for Sturt. The member for Swan -  - The responsibility of ministers individually to parliament is not mere fiction.Is the minister quoting numbers of incorporated businesses, which are the only ones that will get the tax deduction? - My list is complete, but I will remind the member for Hinkler that, for him, it is 10,086. He was not listening the first time. The member for O'Connor's point is the repetition of a completely false statement. The coalition have been saying that only incorporated small businesses will get the $5,000 instant write-off. We just heard it from the member for Mackellar. The truth is that they have no idea about tax. Every one of Australia's 2.4 million small businesses will get this tax break if the Rudd Labor government can get this legislation through the Senate, because it applies to sole traders, to partnerships and to companies.I will just complete on this point. This is a very important book, I think the opposition leader would say. -  - It is a very important book about his views on small business. - Do you know how many times he mentioned small business in his very important book? He did so four times. It was four times. One mention was on a tax loss carry back, which was euphemistically 'discontinued' only a week ago; two mentions were on unfair dismissals, and they would remove the protections for millions of Australian workers; and the other mention was on page 102, on his great big new tax on everything you buy. The truth is this. He says that if it is written down it is gospel truth. Do you know what he says about the great big new tax on everything you buy? He says small business should pay. That is what he says on page 102.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. It goes to the mining industry and it goes to the implications of the proposed introduction of the government's RSBT. I would say to the member for McPherson to look carefully at the projections by Treasury of the impact of the government's overall tax reform on employment for the economy and for the mining industry as well. In fact, when it comes to employment for the mining industry, from recollection, the Treasury analysis says that you would look at about a 4.5 per cent increase in activity, I think a 5.5 per cent increase in investment and over time a seven-point increase in employment. I would suggest that the honourable member for McPherson reflect on those figures contained within the Treasury's projections.I would also remind the member for McPherson, given the nature of the seat she represents, of the large number of small businesses within her electorate that would be directly benefited by the tax reforms the government foreshadows. I think the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy just recently - and eloquently, if I might say - ran through the implications for small businesses individually in electorates right across the country. On the Gold Coast there are a great stack of small businesses, which frankly would benefit from being able to -  - I enjoy also the continued interjections from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, because she has distinguished herself so greatly during the course of this week.In response to the question of the member for McPherson, I go firstly to the overall employment impacts of the government's proposal, secondly to the mining industry and thirdly to the working families and small businesses of McPherson. They will benefit under this proposal from an increase in super for all working families, and she is voting to block that. There will be a reduction in the tax burden on the small businesses in her electorate, which she is voting to block. And there will be a tax reduction for all companies in her electorate, which she is voting to block. I would suggest to the member for McPherson that in standing up for the interests of her constituency she should bear in mind the burdens borne by small business - eloquently underlined just now by the minister for small business. If she had some concern for her local economy, she would stand up in this place and back the interests of the small businesses of McPherson.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. He has a particular reason for asking this question, as no doubt he is very pleased that the project for the new step-down care unit at Royal Darwin Hospital is very well advanced. It will provide additional services to the community of Darwin and the surrounds. It forms part of the significant investments that the Rudd government has been making in health, in an area called subacute services. It is an area that people do not often talk about but which was described by the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission as the 'missing link' in our health system. As part of our COAG agreement back in 2008, where we put a record $64 billion into our hospital system - which was a 50 per cent increase on the agreement on funding for hospital services of the Leader of the Opposition - we also committed $500 million to increase subacute services by 20 per cent by 2012. This money is now starting to hit the front line.I am very pleased to be able to announce today that some of the early investments are coming to fruition. For example, in the seat of Watson - the electorate of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry - six palliative care beds have opened at Canterbury Hospital. I think the member for Dunkley will be interested to know that funding has been provided for four restorative care places at the Frankston Hospital and similarly at the Goulburn Valley Health service in Shepparton.I imagine that the Treasurer will be pleased to know that 44 beds are progressively coming on line at the Eventide Nursing Home in his electorate. On top of that, $12.9 million has been allocated to expand specialist palliative care services, rehabilitation and geriatric care at Mount Gambier in the electorate of Barker, and also at Whyalla country general hospital in Grey. I noticed that the member for Grey was on his feet before. He did not ask me a question, however, about the investments in cancer services going into his electorate in Whyalla - more than $50 million, and a total of $69 million with the state government's involvement, which was not mentioned by the member for Grey.What this means is that we are already seeing services coming on line. But the good news is that under the recent COAG agreement, an additional $1.6 billion is being invested in subacute care services to provide 1,300 additional beds in palliative care, mental health community care, and rehab, both in hospitals and in the community. Of course, what this means is that the grand total of our investments in palliative care, in rehabilitation care and in subacute care is now over $2 billion. I want to emphasise that $2 billion because there is some magic in that amount now - that is, it is the running total of the damage that the Leader of the Opposition has caused and wants to cause to our health system. He already ripped $1 billion out of our hospital system when he was the health minister and now he is well on the way to promising to pull another $1 billion out of our health system following his budget reply.Here we are, investing more than $2 billion into subacute services that are already being rolled out across the country, and the Leader of the Opposition is using that as his target to see how much money he can rip out of the system. We have already invested more than $2 billion in our cancer services - regional cancer centres, investments in drugs for cancer treatment and research projects on cancer. Again, the Leader of the Opposition is using that as his target. The simple truth is: Australia cannot afford to have the Leader of the Opposition as the Prime Minister. Our health system cannot afford the damage that will be caused when Mr Abbott yet again tries to pull another $1 billion out of our health system. We simply cannot risk it. All those investments that are starting to turn up in our electorates across the country need to be secure. We need the Leader of the Opposition to promise that health will be protected from his razor gang. He was not able to deliver that in his budget reply, but it is about time he stood up and made clear that he is not going to rip another $1 billion out of our health system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question because there is one thing I can absolutely guarantee: we on this side of the House will get fair value for the Australian people for the mining resources that we own 100 per cent. We have outlined a framework for that and we are consulting with industry about that. They are very much involved in developing this proposal because they do understand how important it is to modernising our economy and making our economy much more competitive. Those company tax cuts for small businesses and businesses more generally are very important for economic growth in this country and for providing incentive for people who work hard and invest.That is why we are putting forward those company tax cuts. That is why we have got the $5,000 instant write-off - a fantastic incentive for small businesses to develop and grow. We saw what happened last year through the investment allowance. We saw how that created a pipeline of employment and kept the doors of small businesses open during the impact of the global recession. Everybody has seen what we can do as a country if we are prepared to invest and if we are prepared to put in place good economic and social policies to protect employment, to grow business and to make our country more prosperous. That is what everybody on this side of the House is 100 per cent committed to - a fair share for the Australian people, a resources industry that grows and an economy that is modernised and faces up to the challenges of the 21st century.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question -  The members for Curtin and Sturt then left the chamber. 
 - I would just like to repeat my thanks to the member for Bendigo for his question. He has been a very active advocate for the defence industry in this country. Yesterday the government announced that Australian manufacturers will be given a chance to win a contract worth more than $1 billion for the manufacture of the next generation of protected mobility light vehicles. These vehicles will play an important role in keeping Australian troops safe in combat roles, including command liaison and light battlefield resupply operations. They will be provided to the Army's combat units and Air Force's airfield defence guards and will be designed to operate in future conflict environments. Three companies will be awarded up to $9 million each for the development of protected mobility vehicle prototypes, putting them in the running to land a manufacturing contract for up to 1,300 vehicles. The three companies down selected that were announced yesterday include Tallis Australia, Force Protection Europe and General Dynamics Land Systems Division Australia, which is based in Adelaide. Tallis has facilities in Bendigo in Victoria and, as I indicated, General Dynamics are in Adelaide.This decision means that these companies now have a chance of competing against prototypes also being developed in the United States under the joint light tactical vehicle program that are also in the running for the contract. Importantly, the Australian down selected manufacturers will have access to approximately the same funding that the government has allocated through the Department of Defence to the prototypes being developed in the United States. This announcement means that there will be greater competition for this very important contract in defence, an outcome that can only lead to better vehicles and better capability for the ADF. There is some way to go, of course, in this competitive tendering process, with two more stages of decision making still ahead of us. Just as an example, should Tallis Australia ultimately be successful in this competition, they have indicated that it would generate approximately 500 jobs in the Bendigo area and nearly 700 across Victoria in total.Finally, I would like to acknowledge the role a number of members have played in pushing toward this particular outcome. The member for Makin has been active in relation to this issue in particular, but I think it is fair to say no-one has been more active than the member for Bendigo who, when you are a minister in my position, is a person that certainly keeps the issues right in front of you. We are very pleased with this stage in this particular process.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the Leader of the Opposition on tax reform. I welcome the question because it is very, very difficult to understand where the opposition stands on tax reform. In the space of one week this Leader of the Opposition has said that mining companies pay too much tax, we have had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying they are paying just enough tax and we have also had the shadow minister for infrastructure - his big backer in the Senate, Senator Barnaby Joyce - saying they could pay more tax. Where does the opposition stand on these matters?Can I go to the points that were raised by the Leader of the Opposition. First of all, his argument was that this was contributing to a reduction in the value of the Australian dollar. That is what he has said. That is the most reckless comment of many reckless comments he has made in this place. I quote to him the Westpac senior market strategist on this matter, who says, 'The Australian dollar remained under pressure in the first half of Tuesday's European trade over concerns about the Eurozone's financial system and tensions between North and South Korea had investors selling high risk assets such as equities and commodities.' Those remarks have been echoed also by the Chief Economist of RBS Morgans. That is the first point on the dollar.The second is this: the stock market. This goes to the other point he has made. I quote him from an earlier remark when he said, 'Our share market is under pressure because the government has totally mismanaged its proposal of a big new tax on mining.' He said it was so, at least in part. Let us go to the facts of this matter. Share prices around the world have fallen because of the crisis in Greece and the honourable Leader of the Opposition would know that. Here are some discomforting facts for him. First of all, if we look at the stock market we see that Australian shares have fallen by less than in other countries over the past month. Since 30 April, the Australian Stock Exchange has fallen by 10 per cent, the London market has fallen by 10.4 per cent, the US Standard and Poor's index by 11.5 per cent and the Japanese stock market by 12.8 per cent. That is fact one.Fact two: let us look within the Australian share market itself and the performance of mining shares relevant to other shares. Australian mining shares have fallen by 8.9 per cent but all Australian shares have fallen by more than 10 per cent, the banks and financial institutions by 12 .3 per cent - that is, the second crux of his argument today demolished again by the facts.He has said in recent times in relation to the cost of living, investment and growth and employment that the RSPT therefore has represented an impact on these and he particularly made reference today to employment. I say to the Leader of the Opposition on the facts again that this country, with an unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent, represents a rate of unemployment celebrated by the OECD today coming in at a level almost half that of many other major industrial economies and considerably less than most other members of the OECD, Japan being a notable exception. Again against the facts, given the strong employment performance of this economy against the statement just made by the Leader of the Opposition that this is therefore costing jobs, that flies again against the facts of the performance of the economy. Secondly, within mining itself he is yet to adduce any data to support the proposition.So on proposition No. 1 about the dollar, on proposition No. 2 about the share price, on proposition No. 3 about employment: wrong, wrong, wrong, against all the factual data. That is because this Leader of the Opposition does not have any comfort zone at all when it comes to debating any matter of economic policy. He has said he is bored by economics. The former Treasurer of the Commonwealth Peter Costello said he could never be entrusted with the responsibility of the Treasury. So many of his colleagues from the previous Howard government have said that on matters concerning the economy he was financially irresponsible, that he could never be described as a fiscal conservative, that he has only spending proposals and no savings proposals, and yet we have the Leader of the Opposition now engaged in this debate. He stands utterly exposed by contribution of the facts.</DOC>

 - The member asked me about developments on the Korean Peninsula and the importance of that to peace and security and our national security interests and the need and importance for us to be working with other countries in that respect. Australia has been working on peace and security issues on the Korean Peninsula for 60 years. We were, of course, under a United Nations flag in the original hostilities on the Korean Peninsula, costing us 340 Australian personnel. More recently, we have been strongly supportive of United Nations sanctions so far as North Korea's nuclear program is concerned and have worked closely with and supported members of the so-called 'six-party talks'. Most recently - and this is the development to which the member's question refers - we have been very closely involved in developments since the sinking of the South Korean corvette, the Cheonan. We made our expert officers available to work with the Republic of Korea and with officers from the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Canada to do an exhaustive scientific investigation of the causes of the sinking, which helped people come to the independent conclusion that the sinking was caused by actions of North Korea.Since the publication of that report, we have been working very closely with our friends and neighbours in this respect, indicating to the Republic of Korea that we stand shoulder to shoulder with them. The Prime Minister has spoken recently to President Lee as I have in recent weeks to Foreign Minister Yu.The Minister for Defence and I were in Japan for two-plus-two defence talks with our Japanese colleagues and had extensive consultations about this matter. We are now working very closely with United Nations Security Council members, both permanent and temporary, to see that there is an appropriate international community condemnation of this action by North Korea, which was belligerent, destabilising, contrary to international law and a violation of the armistice agreement.Peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and in North Asia are very important to Australia. It is more than just the substantial, large and very important trading partners we have in North Asia - Japan, China and the Republic of Korea itself where engagement has been enhanced in the last couple of years not just economically but also on security, strategic and defence cooperation. We have admired the Republic of Korea's restraint in this matter in the face of such belligerent, unlawful actions by North Korea, the DPRK.The member asked me why, in these difficult international peace and security matters which have national security implications for Australia, it is important to work with other countries. It certainly is very important in these matters to be thoughtful and calm. It is certainly very important to carefully consider the advice one might receive from our national security agencies and not to discount that advice or throw it out the door for baseless reasons. It is very important to act in accordance with the established norms and conventions. There are ways in which we conduct ourselves while we are engaged in these difficult national security issues. It is important to understand that, when you are dealing in discussions with other parties, when you are dealing in discussions on national security issues, to keep a confidence. It is important to understand that many of these national security issues are highly confidential and it is important, therefore, to keep a confidence.It is also important when you are engaged in discussions and negotiations with other interested parties that other parties know and understand that what you say is what you mean, and that you do not put yourself in the position when you say to other parties with whom you are having discussions, 'You should only have confidence or rely upon the things that I write down, not the things that I say.' You have to make sure that when you are dealing with these very sensitive national security matters that you are consistent in what you say and that you do not, for example, say something twice on the same day and then the same night say to others that it meant exactly the opposite. There are very important ways in which one needs to conduct -  - I was outlining to the House how one needs to conduct oneself in these sensitive national security matters in one's dealings with other nations. When that occurs, the people of Australia and the international community have to have confidence in the government of the day which is transacting those affairs. The events that we have seen this week from the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition show that there would be no confidence and no trust if they were given that onerous task. They would be a risk and there would be no confidence and no trust. Their conduct on these matters would be nothing but full of risk so far as our national security interests are concerned. There has been deafening silence from the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on these matters. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is back here, at 20 to four. We are happy to make the time available to her to explain herself.</DOC>

 - Like the member for Maranoa, I think Warwick is a great town. It is full of great and fine upstanding citizens and has contributed much to the civic and political culture of Queensland. He asked a question about the business community -  - I take the good people of Warwick seriously. Those opposite seem to think that these reflections of mine lack sincerity. They do not. It is great city. I dare say that I have been there a few more times than the Leader of the Opposition. The member for Maranoa asked a question about the business community in Warwick. The first thing I would say to him about businesses in Warwick is that they stand to benefit from a cut in the company rate under this government. The second thing I would say to the member for Maranoa is that the company rate for many of the businesses in Warwick would likely be increased should the Leader of the Opposition form the next government of Australia - that is, by increasing the company rate to businesses with a turnover of more than $5 million by two percentage points. He now disputes the basis of the tax; but, frankly, the basis of the tax has been the cause of some confusion over time. Two per cent down from us, two per cent up from them - that is the best summary. The third thing - and I look to my colleague the minister for small business for some data - is that in Maranoa and in Warwick in particular there would be many, many small businesses. What will the member for Maranoa say to the small businesses in the main street of Warwick when he tells them that he will be voting against a $5,000 tax cut for each and every one of those small businesses in terms of the tax break which is offered by the $5,000 offset in any given year. That is the $5,000 tax break which is represented -  -  - Order! The Prime Minister will resume his seat until the House comes to order. - The small businesses in Warwick therefore would be disadvantaged by him voting against a measure which assists them with a particular tax break, on top of the company tax breaks which we have spoken about before.The member for Mackellar then left the chamber. - What is interesting about the member for Mackellar's departure -  - Each and every one of those opposite is standing in the road of a tax cut being delivered to small businesses in their electorate. That is why I would simply say to those opposite: how do you actually look your small businesses in the eye when you are going out there and standing opposed to tax cuts for them? Your companies - standing opposed to tax cuts for them. The workers in Maranoa, who would benefit from the increase to the SGL - standing in the road of better super for those workers. Also, the infrastructure needs of the honourable member's electorate, the roads, the rail and the ports necessary to underpin our resources sector in the future - standing in the road of a purpose-built infrastructure fund to support those infrastructure investments over time.I say to the honourable member for Maranoa: when he asks a question about the RSPT tax reform and the benefits which flow from that overall reform, he needs to be very mindful of what he is standing in the road of in terms of delivery of key benefits for his electorate. But, beyond that, can I also say to the honourable member for Maranoa, echoing a statement earlier by the Deputy Prime Minister: members opposite need to get real about standing up for their constituencies. By standing in the road of tax cuts and better super, by proposing the cessation of the trades training schools, the cancellation of the Building the Education Revolution program or its restructuring, with each and every one of these cuts in health and in education and in trades training centres and by standing against better super and support for small business - those members opposite are not standing up for their electorates. They are standing up instead for their partisan political interests.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Indeed, we are joining with the member for Corangamite to deliver on the commitments that we have made: the Geelong Ring Road 4A, Geelong Ring Road 4B, Princes Highway West, Waurn Ponds to Winchelsea, and many other projects. The member for Corangamite and the member for Corio are great advocates for the greater Geelong region.We are also out there delivering in other parts of regional Australia. Today I was in Wagga Wagga with the member for Riverina and I was also in Wodonga. There we were making commitments and once again delivering infrastructure on the ground in regional Australia - important infrastructure. In Wagga Wagga we will deliver there an instrument landing system that will help that regional airport to maximise the benefit of the pilot college there that I also opened today that will train 200 pilots as part of the infrastructure and skills agenda that is taken so seriously by this government.I am asked also why it is important that commitments are delivered, that they are funded and that they actually get built because, out there, there is some cynicism in the community about these issues. It is little wonder, because the coalition said through their shadow finance minister on 20 May, 'Any other past commitments have been discontinued.' The famous statement by the shadow finance minister, who says that any commitments, unless they are in the funding document, are not worth the paper that they are written on, let alone those that are just said, because we know they are not worth anything at all. But yesterday, when I raised this issue in the House, the shadow minister for transport said the coalition would meet its promises on road and rail funding. So who do you believe - the shadow finance minister or the Leader of the National Party? They both cannot be right. - 'They're both right,' says the Leader of the National Party. That is the sort of economic integrity of those opposite. I will give you a couple of good examples. On 7 May the National Party had a meeting up in Lismore and 15 parliamentary colleagues were there, including the Leader of the National Party and the shadow minister for infrastructure, Barnaby Joyce. In fact, the reports say that there were 'many more pollies than community members at the morning tea' at the Lismore Workers Club. There they went on to make a big announcement: 'Nats are talking tough - pledges to reopen rail line for light rail and finish Pacific Highway upgrade'. It is a very clear commitment. The whole team was there: senators, House of Representatives members, state leader - all there.After the statement yesterday, in today's copy of the Northern Star you have a somewhat different position. You have this:However, a spokesman for Nationals Leader Warren Truss said the Coalition's commitment on the train - spelt out during a visit to the region by the Nationals' leadership team early this month - had never included a dollar figure.It is a ghost train. It does not have any money. It has no funding, but it is going to exist somehow. They then went on to explain how that can occur, this ghost train of the National Party:The spokesman said the Coalition's approach to the Casino-Murwillumbah line, during the Howard years and since, had always been to pressure the State Government to step up and restore the line.So they go out there, they have a meeting; they bring everyone up to Lismore, they make this commitment, and when they are pinged for it because there is no money there, because there is no money at all, that is their explanation.But it gets worse. It gets worse, because in the electorate of the member for Corangamite they have also made a range of commitments. The candidate there made unfunded commitments - withdrawn by the shadow finance minister just last week - about the Princes Highway. But what happened when the Geelong Advertiser and the Colac Herald, the local papers, contacted the shadow minister for finance yesterday? The shadow minister for finance told them, 'No, we don't have any funding allocated, but we'll take it out of the Roads to Recovery program.' So the Roads to Recovery program, which is untied grants to local government for local roads, will now be raided for an off-the-cuff promise. Not surprisingly, the editors have asked the shadow minister for finance to put it in writing, because you cannot trust anything that those opposite say. We saw it again from the Leader of the Opposition today: the weathervane is back, and he is back this time on climate change, saying climate change is no longer crap, unlike what he said when he was running for the opposition leadership. I am not sure what has happened in the meantime, but the fact is that you cannot trust a thing that this mob opposite say. They want to play games with people in their electorates, but when they get in here there is no funding, there is no sincerity, there is no integrity on economic security and there is certainly, for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, no integrity on national security either.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The government regrets very much the information concerning that most recent incident in Melbourne. Furthermore, the government has acknowledged on many occasions that there have been mistakes made in the implementation of the insulation program. That is why the relevant minister is now conducting an extensive inspection program across both foil insulation and a large number of houses with non-foil insulation. The government intends to work closely with the industry and households in dealing with the problems that have arisen.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank very much the member for Flynn for his question because it goes to the importance of keeping the Australian economy strong. -  - Those opposite, in the midst of their guffaws, should reflect on the OECD's report last week on the strength of the Australian economy worldwide. The fact that this economy came out of the global economic crisis as the only major economy not to go into recession is a matter of pride for the government and for the nation. The fact that we are able to produce the second lowest unemployment across the major advanced economies is a matter of pride for the government and the nation. These are fundamental achievements in addition to bringing about the lowest debt and the lowest deficit of all the major advanced economies.The challenge for the future is to keep our Australian economy strong. That is why the Treasurer delivered a budget which will see the budget back in surplus in just three years time - three years ahead of time - and will also bring about a halving of net debt. These are significant economic achievements, particularly if those opposite would bother to reflect on the state of economies around the world. The global economy is not out of the woods yet, as those opposite, if they paid any attention to analyses of events in Europe, would also conclude.The business of keeping the Australian economy strong, however, lies in also prosecuting a continued campaign of economic reform, and tax reform is a key part of that. This government believes in tax reform to deliver better super for working families, to bring about tax cuts for small business and to fund our future infrastructure needs for the nation at large. The government was elected to office with an ambitious reform program. We have abolished Work Choices, we have cut income taxes on three occasions and we have increased hospital funding by 50 per cent, but there is much, much more to be done and we intend to get on with the business of doing it.On the question of tax reform, firstly, this is in Australia's deep economic national interest, the reason being that this sort of tax reform will, in time, grow the Australian mining industry. It is a tax on profits not a tax on production. And even those opposite, led by the shadow minister for finance and others, have concluded that a tax on profits is the way to go for the future. Secondly, it also helps mining companies themselves because if you are being taxed on profits it means that, when commodity prices are high, you pay more but, when they are lower, you pay less - as opposed to a flat tax effectively operating on production and volume. Thirdly, this tax also enables us to get on with the business of building infrastructure.The member for Flynn has asked a question about this. In his electorate I have sat down with the Gladstone Regional Council before and spoken to them about the impact of infrastructure demands in that part of Queensland through the developments in the Bowen Basin. Mr Speaker, these have to be funded in advance for the future, and we need a revenue stream to underpin that investment for the future. That is why the government is getting on with the business of these fundamental tax reforms - because at the end of the day what we are on about is a fair share for all Australians for the resource which all Australians own; that is, the natural resource wealth of Australia.There is only one person in this House who has said that in fact he believes the mining companies are taxed too much, and that is the Leader of the Opposition. No-one in this parliament believes that the mining companies are taxed too much, except the Leader of the Opposition. We in this government intend to get on with the business of tax reform. It is necessary for long-term economic reform, and necessary to enable the funding of the hospital and health and additional reforms that we have proposed for the nation at large by keeping our economy strong. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: rather than simply acting as a mouthpiece for elements of the mining industry and acting as a mouthpiece for Clive Palmer, of the Liberal National Party, why does he not stand up and act in the Australian national economic interest instead?</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because I welcome a debate on tax reform and I welcome a debate on the standards of this government on public advertising as opposed to the standards of those opposite on public advertising. I stand absolutely committed to our earlier statements. Those statements went first and foremost to the quantum of public advertising. Let us bear very plainly in mind the previous government and their investment in public advertising. They allocated $420 million for public advertising on the GST, more than 10 times that which has been allocated for this campaign in relation to the RSPT. Secondly, for Work Choices, $120 million came from the taxpayer, almost four times that which has been allocated for the public information campaign concerning the RSPT. In 2008, this government spent one-third of what the previous government spent in 2007 on public advertising. In 2009, we spent about one-half of what the previous government spent in 2007 on public advertising. So, on the question of the quantum of public advertising, I say to the Leader of the Opposition: this government stands absolutely by its commitment to reduce the overall amount of public advertising.Secondly, we go to the guidelines to which the Leader of the Opposition in part addresses his question. The government instituted a set of guidelines in July 2008. Those guidelines came into criticism from a range of people including, I seem to remember, the member for Mackellar, as well as the member for Kooyong, because, according to them, the guidelines placed the Auditor-General in an invidious position. The government, as of March of this year, brought in revised guidelines which were welcomed by those opposite. Those guidelines have been adhered to in the context of public advertising campaigns since then.I say to the Leader of the Opposition: on the question of overall reform and on the need for public advertising, when the Australian government faces the prospect of a mining industry kicking up to $100 million into a campaign, by some reports, when the interests of working families are at stake and when the economy on the whole and its reputation and standing and confidence are at stake, this government will not stand idly by while a campaign of misinformation is run against a fundamental element of tax reform. We stand for tax reform to benefit working families, small business and investment in infrastructure. That is what we stand for. We will stand resolutely opposed to any campaign of misinformation which has been marshalled by those opposite, including by the likes of Clive Palmer, for whom the Leader of the Opposition stands in this place as a public mouthpiece.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for that very important question. Australia has had a long history of economic reform which has created almost two decades of uninterrupted expansion. This makes Australia stand out almost uniquely amongst developed countries. Of course, in the past when there have been fundamental economic reforms put in place, there have always been exaggerated claims about these reforms - how they would produce the end of the world, how damaging that would be and how they were unacceptable. We should reflect on the last 25 years or so. We should reflect on what was said during the eighties and the nineties when the dollar was floated, when the tariff walls were brought down and when compulsory superannuation was introduced. These reforms were opposed bitterly by sections of the business community, who would have Australians believe that they would damage the economy and hurt employment.Of course, through these reforms the Australian economy did become stronger and stronger, so much so that these reforms are much admired elsewhere in the world. But at the time there was not agreement in the community about them at all. There was trenchant opposition from sections of the business community. You can remember what happened when there were proposals to tax gold, with the removal of its income tax exemption. We were told that was going to be the end of the world. That industry survived and prospered. Of course, there was the bitter opposition to the petroleum resource rent tax that was introduced in the early eighties. It pays to go through some of the quotes of what was said at that time. This was said on 1 July 1984 in relation to the petroleum resource rent tax:The Hawke Government's RRT will effectively destroy the incentive for offshore exploration _Who do you reckon said that? John Howard, the shadow Treasurer. This was from an industry representative on 2 March 1984:An RRT reduces the upside potential so, no matter how much of the financial exposure is covered by the Government, investors will not be induced to put their money into exploration in Australia but will rather explore overseas and invest in other, less risky, industries in Australia.Who could have possibly said that? Rio? BHP? That was a representative from BHP on 2 March 1984. We had this one from an industry negotiator on 2 March 1984: 'An RRT is a bit like communism'. Who could have said that today? The man who owns those opposite lock, stock and barrel. All these claims were rubbish then and they are not true now. We are being told that we will see the end of the world. What we have put forward is a very important economic reform for Australia to grow the resource sector, to deal with the challenges of a two-speed economy, to provide some incentive for corporate Australia and small business. And it is opposed by all of those opposite because they are owned lock, stock and barrel by sections of the mining industry. We on this side of the House will stand up for the national economic interest. - Yes, Mr Speaker. It is the hard and difficult reforms that do produce the enduring gains. We on this side of the House understand that; those on the other side of the House do not understand that. We understood that when we put in place national superannuation, and it goes to the very core of what we are doing now. We understand the national interest in terms of building the national savings pool. - We know how important it is for the future of this country to build up our national savings. We understand that. We understand how important it is to give small business some incentive. We understand that; that is not understood by those on the other side of the House. - One of the reasons why this economy has prospered for so long is that it has had those essential and enduring reforms. We have prospered because of those reforms of the eighties and nineties and we need another round - which indeed goes to the core of what the government is doing now. We on this side of the House are about protecting the national economic interest, supporting Australian workers, supporting Australian small business, lifting our national savings and investing in infrastructure. We see that as our duty because it is in the national interest, unlike those opposite.</DOC>

 - I welcome the debate on tax reform and I welcome the debate on public advertising concerning tax reform. The core difference, if the Leader of the Opposition bothered to reflect on it, is one essential point. The policy which the government has put forward, as attested by the independent modelling of the Australian Treasury, grows the Australian economy and grows the mining industry. That is separate from the impact of a misinformation campaign which a range of people - including Clive Palmer - of the Liberal National Party are now engaged in. That is the core difference. That is our policy. Given the Leader of the Opposition has asked this question, it raises of course the question as to what their position would be. The Leader of the Opposition was asked this question this morning: 'Would you put an end to government advertising?' The member for Cook then left the chamber. 
 - The Leader of the Opposition asked a question about public advertising and my response to it was in the terms that I have just delivered concerning policy on the one hand and the deliberate misinformation campaign underway on the other. Second point: it raises the legitimate question as to what the policy on advertising is by those opposite. This morning the Leader of the Opposition - the 'straight talking' Leader of the Opposition - was asked this at the doors.Journalist: Would you put an end to government advertising?Abbott: I _ I _ I want to put an end to a Prime Minister _This was followed by the usual spray against me:Journalist: What about government advertising?Abbott: Well, the issue is _And there is another spray against the Prime Minister:Journalist: But you're the alternative Prime Minister, people have a right to know where you stand on government advertising, would you ban it _ -  -  - The Leader of the Opposition was asked five times this morning what the position of the opposition was on the future of public advertising. I got up to the third. The fourth was:Journalist: What is your opinion on government advertising?Abbott: I think _The fifth was:Journalist: You've got to have an opinion.Abbott: I think, I think _And then there was another spray at the Prime Minister - five times in a row from the straight-talking Leader of the Opposition, right on message, always negative, never positive. The Leader of the Opposition was part of a government which expended $420 million, or allocated that for expenditure, on the GST public advertising campaign and $120 million on Work Choices. Can you imagine that? Using the taxpayers' dollars to take away from working people proper wages and proper conditions. What we are doing through this campaign is explaining - The member for Sturt then left the chamber. - the facts to the Australian people in relation to a tax reform proposal of the government which, in contrast to what was advocated for Work Choices, actually seeks to enhance the prospects of working families by adding to the superannuation earnings of working families. Our tax reform plan delivers better super. It also delivers tax cuts for small business and proper funding for infrastructure.Before the Leader of the Opposition asks his next question on this subject, could I ask him also to explain how they still propose to justify the $17,000 we are incurring every year for the storage of those 36,650 mousepads from the Work Choices campaign - 100,000 plastic folders created by the previous government, 98,000 mousepads and 77,000 pens. When it comes to the use of public advertising dollars, the figures speak against those opposite. They knew what they were doing when they were using that money to undermine the interests of working families. We will defend the interests of working families, including their right to better super. - Yes. - Yes.</DOC>

 - There have been many colourful claims made in the debate about tax reform recently, both by sections of the mining industry and of course the opposition. For example, sections of the mining industry chose very conveniently to exclude the effect of generous tax concessions when making claims about what percentage of their profits are taken in tax. But perhaps the most absurd claims with respect to the impact of the government's tax package relate to its impact on Australia's international reputation - to what extent Australia is an attractive location for international investment - and in particular to the issues of sovereign risk and alleged retrospectivity.I would urge all members to have a look at a column about these issues today in BusinessDay in the Age and, I presume, in the Sydney Morning Herald by Ross Gittins, somebody who has in recent times been critical of the government on a number of matters but on this issue is absolutely bang-on. We are seeing the mining sector seeking to redefine the concept of sovereign risk to something very different from what it is generally understood to be. Typically it is understood to relate to issues of conflict, corruption or expropriation, but now sections of the mining industry want us to believe that sovereign risk basically arises whenever there are tax changes we do not like. That is basically their concept of sovereign risk. Even though prices for our resources have soared relative to where they were five, six or seven years ago and are likely to continue to be at elevated levels, and the Australian people are seeking through their government a better return for the asset they can only sell once, according to sections of the mining industry this raises sovereign risk issues. That is simply nonsense.Second is the alleged issue of retrospectivity. This also involves a clever redefinition of the concept of retrospectivity. It effectively seeks to relate the tax incidence not to the activity - which of course is the usual concept of retrospectivity, and clearly we are not dealing here with retrospective taxation - but to the original investment. Some mining investments can last for decades, so the concept of retrospectivity that is being sought to be applied here is one that is totally unrelated to the normal use of that concept in taxation. You would never be able to change taxes without them being retrospective if this were taken to its ultimate extreme. Any change in tax that applied to any business, if taken back to an original investment decision that could have been taken 20 years earlier, would therefore be deemed retrospective.Interestingly, it is notable that nobody is complaining that the proposed cut in company tax is retrospective. Nobody seems to be complaining about that, even though it has exactly the same kind of effect. Most importantly, these absurd claims about the alleged impact on Australia's international reputation completely ignore the positive elements of the government's tax package - the cut in company tax down to 28 per cent. Whereas the coalition are promising that their company tax rate will be increased to nearly 32 per cent, the government's package involves a cut in company tax down to 28 per cent. What are the implications of a cut in company tax for Australia's reputation internationally? According to the former Treasurer Peter Costello, it would increase attractiveness as an investment location, strengthening Australia's prospects for investment and economic and jobs growth. That is the former Treasurer Peter Costello's assessment of the benefits for Australia's reputation of a cut in company tax.I also want to draw the House's attention to the benefits to our reputation of increased investment in mining infrastructure, better tax treatment of mining exploration and, of course, a stronger superannuation system which is already the envy of the world. In conclusion, if you ever wanted to see a better example of the ludicrous rhetoric and the ludicrous scare campaigns that the government's proposals are being subjected to, I draw your attention to statements by Clive Palmer yesterday morning on the Meet the Press program. I preceded him on the Meet the Press program, but unfortunately it was not a debate, otherwise I would have had a bit of fun. I would have had some serious fun. His statements were these:The perception overseas is that it is a 70% tax on mining in Australia, so avoid Australia and that perception will mean that there won't be any further investment and there won't be any jobs created. Mum and dads all over Australia will become unemployed. They won't have the money to buy their Christmas presents for their kids. They will be out on the street.We have not quite got to the plague of locusts and the seven years of famine and the four horsemen of the apocalypse, but by God we are getting there. This is just empty rhetoric, hysterical rhetoric, from a man who is the proprietor of the Queensland Liberal National Party. This is just ludicrous rhetoric, and it illustrates precisely why it is important for the government to explain its position as to why these changes are good for the Australian economy and good for Australia's international reputation.</DOC>

 - Again, I welcome any question from those opposite about tax reform in Australia and I welcome any question about the public advertising associated with that tax reform. The reason I welcome it is that long-term tax reform is necessary for the long-term reform of the Australian economy. That is why we are doing it: to build better super for working families, to cut taxes for small business and to fund the future of infrastructure. The member for North Sydney - as a member, I presume, of the Liberal Party and therefore a representative, more broadly, of the Liberal-National Party - must therefore also now be taking his instructions from Clive Palmer, the new pin-up boy of the LNP. -  - As the member for North Sydney will know when it comes to royalties, 10 years ago, for every $3 that companies received in profits, $1 came back to the governments of Australia through royalties. Ten years later, for every $7 which companies received in profits, $1 was coming back in royalties. Furthermore, the member for North Sydney would be aware that, if you then added royalties to the company tax cake, you would find that on average receipts relative to profits have halved compared to the proportion which existed 10 years ago.I say to the member for North Sydney, though: whichever way you cut the cake - whether it is on royalties, whether it is on company tax and against all ranges of measures - the bottom line is that because of the current structure of the taxation regime the return to the Australian people via the taxation system is infinitely less than it was a decade ago. In the intervening decade, Australian families have faced a range of additional imposts to fund the infrastructure of the future.The purpose of questions is ostensibly to seek information or press for action.Before the guffawing, this statement I am going to make refers to everybody:However _ it is often a time for political opportunism - where the opposition questions will seek to embarrass the government - _ while government Members will be tempted to provide Ministers with an opportunity to put government policies and actions in a favourable light or to embarrass the Opposition.This is the tradition of question time that has developed. If the House would like to have changes, it should deal with that itself. The Prime Minister is responding to the question. - So I say to the member for North Sydney: if you look at the overall return to the Australian taxpayer, the return now is much less than it was 10 years ago. The commodity price increases which have occurred over the period of time have not been properly reflected in returns to the Australian people. Frankly, the Australian people are deserving of greater returns in order to fund the future needs which they face - one, by assisting and bringing down the company tax; two, by assisting those companies to pay additional superannuation payments through the SGL; and, three, by funding the infrastructure needs of the future as well.The other thing I would say to the member for North Sydney is this: we have seen one scare campaign after another from those opposite when there have been any changes over the last 10, 20 or 25 years that affect the mining sector and its profitability. When the PRRT regime was brought in 25 years ago, those opposite claimed that it would lead to a collapse in investment in the industry. It did not. In fact, I would draw the attention of those opposite -  - It goes to the question of the impact of policy decisions on the mining industry. The history of those opposite over the last 25 years was in saying that any changes that affect the mining industry will automatically result in something akin to the collapse of the industry. They did the same in relation to the PRRT regime - a resource rent tax - 25 years ago. Secondly, do we all remember the debate over Mabo? The debate over Mabo was that the mining industry would collapse as a result of the introduction of native title laws. -  - The point of my response is to say -  - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, when it comes to defence of the national interest, I believe has form herself. - So, when those opposite enter scare campaigns in relation to the mining industry, they have form: the PRRT regime, first and foremost; secondly -  - And when we brought in legislation to get rid of Work Choices, they said it would kill the mining industry as well. Wrong, wrong, wrong, and wrong on this one as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I echo what the Treasurer said today: long and enduring tax reform has never come easy to Australia. I simply say that our government is not going to walk away from this very tough debate, because it is a debate the nation has to have. This debate is about our long-term national interest. We also appreciate in that context that we are seriously engaged in a proper process of consultation. We are absolutely committed to getting the balance right, based on ensuring an ongoing stream of investment in Australia akin to what we have achieved over the last 2½ years, as evidenced by the Gorgon investment, and ensuring that the Australian community gets a fair share of the opportunity to develop its resources. I compare that to the position of the opposition at the moment. Also, I remind the House that one of the key outcomes of this debate is a capacity to further invest in the infrastructure requirements of the resources sector in Australia - something that the opposition neglected for 12½ years. A prime example is that, for the first time ever, we will have, in forthcoming budgets, a line item going to investment in resource communities in Australia - initially, $700 million in 2012-13; an amount of $5.6 billion over the next decade.We are in catch-up mode because of the failure of the opposition to invest during their period in government in key resource infrastructure projects. The bottlenecks that they left unattended effectively meant that we lost market share over the previous decade and lived off the back of commodity prices. They were content to spend the proceeds of the mining industry boom but not willing to invest in our future opportunities. I was therefore not surprised to see the ongoing campaign of misinformation yesterday by the stand-in opposition spokesperson, Mr Clive Palmer, claiming that the resources industry is paying 70 per cent tax. That is an outrageous claim, even from Mr Palmer - and we all appreciate what a colourful character he is, better known for his real estate activities than for his mining capacity.The opposition might be content to stand side by side with Mr Palmer, but we are going to continue the debate that goes to the primary focus of our capacity to ensure the long-term sustainability of the resources sector to invest in key projects related to port, rail and road infrastructure. I compare our performance over 2½ years with the opposition's performance over 12½ years. Let us go to the state of Western Australia: $339 million invested in the Oakajee project, something that the Western Australian Premier asked us to commit to, and another $40 million in the port of Esperance, which was a major problem in the previous parliament. Northern Australia is so important to the resources sector: investment in the further development of the Darwin port, $50 million; the Australian Rail Track Corporation, $1.2 billion, including key investments in the Kalgoorlie corridor in Western Australia; the Perth urban transport corridor, $350 million; and the upgrade of the Port Hedland roadworks, $160 million - an area historically absolutely neglected by the opposition under the AusLink program - under AusLink 1.We also appreciate that the impact of resources activity does not extend only to resources communities. That is why I was delighted to notice a commitment today by the Commonwealth government of $180 million to a $225 million project in the heart of the city of Perth. The Great Eastern Highway is to be expanded to six lanes between Perth Airport and Graham Farmer Freeway, something that is so important to Perth. The impact of the resources boom is not just on regional communities; it is also on our major capital cities. Compare that key resource investment in the city of Perth with the previous government's preoccupation with approving a brickworks at Perth Airport for a key donor rather than doing something about huge delays at Perth Airport that increase the cost of conducting mining industry activities in Australia.It is not just government that is investing in key infrastructure. I also welcome the announcement last week by the Queensland Coal Industry Rail Group to commit $4.85 billion to seek the purchase of the coal corridors in Queensland, which is also exceptionally important. It is not just the initial commitment of $4.85 billion; it is going to mean another couple of billion dollars over the next couple of years to make sure we front up for the necessary maintenance and capital expansion of the Queensland rail corridor. The industry, despite the rhetoric that is currently out there in the community, understands that the coal industry in Australia is going to expand. - Its capacity is going to grow over the next three to five years, and that investment is most welcome and supported by the government. In conclusion, I simply say that this is a debate that we had to have. We as a government are going to go on and get the balance right. The resources sector is part of our future, but so is tax reform. It is about making sure that we stand up for the long-term national interest of Australia. The government's policies are not for sale. The opposition might be owned lock, stock and barrel by the likes of Clive Palmer and his ilk, but we are going to continue this program of activity, because it is in Australia's long-term national interest.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member's question, in the context of reviewing the Henry report on taxation the government over a large number of months considered the desirability of a public advertising campaign to underpin its response to the Henry report. That is the first part of the answer. The second part of the answer goes to the use of the particular exemption provisions to which the member refers. My advice is that that was done in response to the conclusion reached by the Special Minister of State and the Treasurer concerning the misinformation campaign which began to unfold. That is the answer to the honourable member's question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. It is the case that low-income earners receive fewer tax concessions for their contributions to superannuation than high-income earners. When a worker puts money into superannuation it attracts a 15 per cent tax rate. For some Australian workers, this is considerably less than their marginal tax rate of 30, 37 or 45 per cent. There are 3.5 million workers who earn less than $37,000 a year and therefore face income-tax rates of 15 per cent or less. For these Australians, there is very limited incentive to save through superannuation. This is a situation that the previous government was happy with for 12 years, but it is not a situation that is acceptable to this government.That is why the government has decided to give back the contributions tax to low-income earners - those who earn up to $37,000 - up to a maximum of $500. These are the people with the least money set aside for retirement. These are the people who need more assistance. It is worth bearing in mind that if you take into account the government's increase in the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent, together with the rebate of the contributions tax and a $1,000 member contribution matched by the government, low-income earners will see their effective superannuation contributions increased to 19 per cent of their wages - something this government is very proud of and something which stands in contrast with those opposite.It also complements the government's moves to provide more incentives to save through non-superannuation for low- and middle-income earners. Of the 5.7 million taxpayers expected to benefit from the discount on interest through bank accounts and credit unions and building societies, three-quarters of those have taxable incomes of $80,000 or less.All these are to be funded by the resource super profits tax, all measures opposed by the opposition. Let us make it 100 per cent crystal clear. Let us make it the gospel truth. The opposition stands opposed to tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners who are trying to save. They oppose tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners. They rage on behalf of mining companies, they rail on behalf of mining executives, but when it comes to tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners they are worse than silent; they actively oppose a tax cut. I guess low- and middle-income earners cannot bankroll a Liberal Party election campaign. That is the difference between their approach and our approach.We heard previously from the Treasurer about how the Liberal Party are very good at running scare campaigns against major economic reform. They opposed the petroleum resource rent tax, and they were wrong. They opposed national superannuation, and they were wrong. This is the Leader of the Opposition who told this House in 1995, 'Compulsory superannuation is one of the biggest con jobs ever foisted by government on the Australian people.' That is what this Leader of the Opposition said. I reckon the biggest con job is the Leader of the Opposition, who says mining companies pay too much tax but does not care about low- and middle-income earners showing a bit of aspiration, trying to save for their future, and says they should pay more tax. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to connect with working families, he should back our plan to give them a tax break for saving. That would be regarded as real action.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. First and foremost, unlike the previous government, this government has had clearly published guidelines concerning public advertising. I would say to those opposite when they ask their questions about this that they should bear in mind not just the absence of effective guidelines but also the quantums that they expended - $420 million on the GST and $120 million on telling Australians that they would be better off under Work Choices, having their basic pay and conditions ripped away.In response to the honourable member's question, I would simply draw her attention to this fact: first, consistent with the development of any major new policy initiative of the government, it is inevitable and probable that you would be dealing with a consideration within government about a public advertising framework to work with it. That is the first point. That has gone back quite a number of months. Secondly, in terms of the budget provision for it, the honourable member will be aware that amounts for this and other campaigns associated with policy change by the government were clearly outlined in the budget papers. Thirdly, in terms of the use of the specific exemption clauses which she refers to, these were activated once the government, through correspondence between the Special Minister of State and the Treasurer, concluded that the misinformation campaign in which both her party and people like Clive Palmer were engaging - and other associated misinformation campaigns - represented, therefore, a risk to various aspects of economic confidence in the economy. For those reasons, the decisions were taken in the order in which they were taken.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question and I know about his lifetime commitment to education. As a man with a lifetime commitment to education, he and members on this side of the House recognise that for school students to get the education they need in the 21st century it is vital that they have access to the learning tool of the 21st century. - I am very glad that the member for Gilmore is so interested in where these computers are. Just listen. If the member for Gilmore just tried listening - we know they always caterwaul about education - why she is probably caterwauling now is she wants to stop me saying clearly what we inherited when we came into office. The first thing we did under the computers in schools program was we audited how many computers there were for students in years 9 to 12, counting as a computer something four years old or less. There were 210,000 of them. There were some schools that did not have any. There were some schools that had a ratio of 1:8. Faced with these statistics, what had the Howard government done? It had obviously viewed this as satisfactory. - The member for Gilmore and all the members opposite have sat in their seats looking at this scene and deciding it was satisfactory. The hunt is still on for someone over there who will finally stand up for their electorate, because we did not believe it was satisfactory that there were only 210,000 computers, we did not believe it was satisfactory that there were some schools without any and we did not believe it was satisfactory that there were some schools with a 1:8 ratio. The member for Gilmore clearly did. She was a core supporter of the Howard government and did nothing to rectify this situation. We have acted, unlike those opposite. Today I am pleased to report to the House - on 31 May these figures are accurate -  - The member for Gilmore might like to think about them - as of 31 May, we had funded 696,000 computers and installed 297,000. That is, we have installed more computers than were available to kids when the Howard government was in office. In 2½ years we have installed more computers than were available to students after 12 long years of the Howard government. - The member for Gilmore can scream and shout all she likes, but she is clearly exposed as someone who did not care about this track record of neglect. She should be celebrating the fact that 297,000 computers have been installed, more than were available when the Howard government was in office - a shameful track record of neglect.The hunt remains for a member over there who is prepared to stand up for their electorate after the budget cuts announced following the three-ring circus, the pass the parcel - the hospital pass - that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer engaged in with the shadow finance minister. Let us just think about the dimensions of these cuts. Trades training centres: gone, including ones that schools were promised last November. We know of course that, in addition to trades training centres being gone, quality teaching money would be gone, money that is bringing the best and brightest graduates into teaching, money that is funding the best teachers to go to the classrooms that need them the most - gone, as a result of the policies of the Leader of the Opposition.But, obviously, today what would also be gone is the continuation of the computers in schools program. That means 120,000 kids would miss out on a computer. And then, beyond the allocation of these computers, the program would not be continued in a way that would support kids to have access to computers. So it would be back to the days that we had under the Howard government, where kids in the class scrabbled to get to the only computer, back to the days where they did not care that our nation was not ready for the 21st century in schools - back to those days, because they did not care in office at all about Australian education. Let us listen to the words of people who do care about Australian education - and I suggest members opposite might contemplate these. I received an email from a parent, Kate Swadling, who said:I am writing to express my support of the great work you are doing in Public Education. My son was one of the lucky students to receive a laptop at the end of last year.As a boy with handwriting difficulties this has made an enormous difference to his ability to work well in class and follow through at home. As a very low income family we would not have been able to afford to purchase such an item and so THANK YOU!The opposition do not care about that, and there would be no more stories like that if they were elected. Kids like that would miss out as a result of their cutbacks. Let us listen to the words of students themselves. Blake Osmond and Elizabeth Kuskovska, year 9 students from the Illawarra Sports High School Student Representative Council, wrote:Our Year 9 students received their state of the art _ Laptops from the Federal Government. We are writing to thank you on behalf of our students for the investment in us, our school and inevitably our Nation's future.It seems remarkable to me that students in year 9 can understand how important this investment is to the nation's future but the Leader of the Opposition does not understand, does not care and would stop kids like these ones getting the computers they need.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Berowra very much for the question, given his historical commitment to integrity in this place. Can I say in response to the honourable member's question that, when the government was elected, its pre-election commitment was to bring in a system of guidelines which involved the Auditor-General. Furthermore, that was then argued against by two members of the opposition: the member for Kooyong and, I think, the member for Mackellar. The Auditor-General himself also expressed reservations about the system that we were proposing to bring in. When we brought that system in, as of July 2008, we also undertook to review that system in 2010.When the system was reviewed in 2010, consistent with the original recommendation by the Auditor-General, we established instead an Independent Communications Committee, and that was welcomed by Senator Ronaldson, on behalf of the opposition, by the member for Kooyong and by the member for Mackellar. Those guidelines, which were welcomed by the opposition, as of their introduction in March 2010, contained within them the exemption clauses which have already been the subject of questions by the member for Farrer.Can I also say that the pre-election commitment by the government went to guidelines and it went to quantum. The second element of the commitment on quantum was to reduce the overall amount expended on government advertising. In the government's first year in office we spent one-third of what the previous government had spent in 2007. In 2009 we spent one-half of what the government expended in 2007. The government's allocation in relation to this campaign in support of tax reform in Australia represents less than one-tenth of what those opposite allocated for the GST campaign, and it represents a little more than a quarter of what the previous government allocated for is Work Choices campaign.I also say in response to the member for Berowra: this campaign in support of tax reform is to deliver an additional benefit to working families through better super. The campaign in support of Work Choices, on which they spent nearly four times as much, was about ripping away the wages and conditions of the same working families.</DOC>

 - Coming from the Leader of the Opposition, who was one of the greatest users and abusers of public advertising in his period in government, I find this set of questions remarkable. There was the use and abuse of the Work Choices campaign, not to mention rock-solid, ironclad guarantees concerning Medicare. The honourable Leader of the Opposition asked a question about remarks made in this place yesterday. Firstly, I was very clear about the fact, in response to a question from the member for Farrer, that the government, from the early part of this year, had been intending to conduct a public information campaign in support of the changes to the proposed tax system. Secondly, I further indicated that the government also then used the guidelines which enabled that campaign to be brought forward, given the campaign of disinformation which has been mounted by the mining industry, not entirely unassisted by the Leader of the Opposition himself.This campaign is necessary for the following reasons: (1) the government will not stand idly by while the mining industry runs the opposition's line of attack in this parliament (2) the government will not stand idly by while misinformation is placed in the Australian community by elements of the mining industry who simply do not want to pay more tax and (3) this government will act in the national interest in order to make sure that it can deliver better super, tax cuts for all companies and tax cuts also for Australian small business. The government stands by its actions - every single one of them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question, and I know that all members of the House will be both interested and concerned about this matter. This is a terrible and shocking incident, a terrible and shocking event, and I think many Australians will be shocked by it. I will deal firstly with the safety and welfare of Australian citizens and an Australian permanent resident who have been caught up in this matter. I deal firstly with the Sydney Morning Herald photographer and journalist, Kate Geraghty and Paul McGeough. Kate Geraghty is an Australian citizen; Paul McGeough is a permanent resident of Australia but is understood to be an Irish citizen and travelling on an Irish passport. I make that point, which I would not normally make public, because it is important as it goes to contra assistance and access.I indicate that both Ms Geraghty and Mr McGeough are to be transferred from the city of Ashdod to the Beersheba detention centre. Australian officials have been advised that, in the case of Ms Geraghty, consular access will be granted in the course of today, Tel Aviv time. In the case of Mr McGeough, Australian officials have been advised that Irish officials will be granted the same consular access. Australian officials have taken the opportunity, as you would expect, of underlining with Irish officials our very keen interest in the wellbeing of this Australian permanent resident, who would be, as he is to me, well known to many members of the House. So we expect that in the case of Ms Geraghty, so far as Australian officials are concerned, and the case of Mr McGeough, so far as Irish officials are concerned, consular access will be given in the course of the day, Tel Aviv time. In the meantime, I am advised that the welfare of Ms Geraghty and Mr McGeough has been confirmed.I made public this morning that there is an Australian citizen, an Australian man, who has been injured through a gunshot wound to the leg. He has undergone surgery and is currently in hospital. He has been visited by Australian officials in hospital, and Australian officials will continue to provide consular assistance to him. I can advise the House that two Australian women, who were also on board one of the flotilla vessels, are being detained at the Beersheba detention centre. As is the case with detained Australian nationals, Australian officials will be granted consular access to these two women in the course of today, Tel Aviv time.I indicate to the House that Australian officials are working assiduously with Israeli officials in Canberra, Tel Aviv and New York - working assiduously not just on the matter generally but also to seek to ascertain whether there are any other Australians who have been caught up in this incident. I can advise the House that to date Australian officials have received no information or evidence which would suggest that any other Australians have been killed or injured in this terrible matter. Our officials continue to work very closely with Israeli officials in that respect.That deals with consular matters. Can I make some remarks in the House so far as this terrible and shocking event is concerned. The Australian government very strongly believes that the onus is now on Israel to conduct a credible and transparent investigation into this matter. That investigation should of course be subject to the scrutiny of the international community. The Security Council, as we speak, is dealing with this matter and may well later in the night, New York time, issue a statement in respect of these matters. What is required is a transparent and credible investigation by Israel which will be the subject of, obviously, the international community's scrutiny and which, in Australia's view, should appropriately be the subject of Security Council consideration.The Australian government's policy position on the blockade of aid or humanitarian assistance to Gaza is well known. We believe there should be an easing of the blockade to enable aid and humanitarian assistance to be delivered to Gaza. We have made that point both to Israel and also in the most recent open session of the Security Council on this matter in October of last year. Australian officials will continue to work closely with Israeli officials on consular matters. We will of course continue to put our view to Israel at officials level in Canberra, Tel Aviv and New York. We await the deliberations of the Security Council.While it may well be the case that an easing of the blockade would help prevent such terrible events occurring in the future, I think all members of the House would have the view that the only long-term, enduring solution to such matters is a long-term, enduring peace in the Middle-East. Such a peace can only be based, can only be predicated, on a two-state solution. That is why not just this Australian government but Australian governments of both political persuasions consistently have been very strong supporters of the peace process and very strong supporters of a two-state solution, and the Australia government urges all of the parties to engage as quickly as possible in the proposed proximity talks.</DOC>

 - I certainly thank the shadow Treasurer for that question. When big changes are made to the tax system, there is always a need for a public information campaign. We have in place some very big changes to the Australian taxation system - not just the modernisation of our taxation of minerals but also cuts to the company tax rate, accelerated cuts to the company tax rate for small businesses and changes to the treatment of interest income, with a 50 per cent tax discount and a standard deduction. There are a whole set of very complex changes which are a very big economic reform for Australia, and the only responsible thing to do in preparing for that change is in fact to put in place a public information campaign.Of course, we funded this public information campaign in the budget. I do not recall anyone from the opposition, either at budget time and/or subsequently in estimates, being remotely concerned about the fact that there was going to be a public information campaign, because it is entirely legitimate to have a public information campaign in these circumstances. And it is entirely legitimate to do it without legislation, because those opposite know they have done that as well - they have put in place public information campaigns when big and complex changes have been in prospect. The government, as the Prime Minister said before, was contemplating a public information campaign from early this year, as we came to the decision to put in place these very big changes to our tax system.Now, of course, that brings us through to the period when we launched these proposals. I launched them in Parliament House with the Prime Minister and other ministers on 2 May and just prior to that we had the beginnings of the scare campaign, from the likes of Clive Palmer and all of the mates of those opposite, about the prospect of us having a superprofits tax in the mining industry. But even I was shocked by how brazen some of these people in the mining industry were, because after we launched -  - The government announced these tax changes on 2 May. And what did we see happen through that week from 2 May? There was one miner that said his company was in trouble, said he was going to close his operations in Australia and then turned around the next day and bought a million shares. But that is not misconduct; that is nothing, given what is going on in the markets when it comes to those opposite. There was also a report that week from one of our largest companies that said they were going to shelve projects worth billions of dollars, and they were forced the next morning to make a clarification at the stock exchange. - Also during this week the mining council went to press with paid advertising - once again misleading paid advertising. So there are three examples which have the potential to impact on the market. But this is all irrelevant to those opposite because they are in bed with some mining companies campaigning against this tax. They are nothing but a tool of the mining companies in this debate. It was events like those that had me write to Senator Ludwig asking to bring the information campaign forward, and in those circumstances that was entirely legitimate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. Today's Reserve Bank board meeting left the official cash rate unchanged at 4.5 per cent. This news will be welcome relief for many Australian families and businesses around the country who are of course doing it tough. Today's decision means a family with a $300,000 mortgage is still paying around $450 less a month than they were prior to the onset of the global financial crisis. That is around $5,400 less a year.When interest rates rise certainly everybody on this side of the House understands the impacts that that has on families, on businesses and on budgets. That is why our budget is so firmly focused on responsible economic management, bringing the budget back into surplus three years early. That is why we are concentrating so much on building the economic capacity in our economy. That is why we are focusing so much on investing in infrastructure, investing in skills and making sure that our economy is that much more competitive. That is why we are modernising our tax system to make our economy more competitive, to make our economy one in which we build our economic capacity so we can take the pressure off inflation - so we can have sustainable growth with lower inflation. That is the whole point of the budget that we have brought down. That is the whole point of this government from the very beginning: investing in capacity. That is why our modernisation of the tax system is so important. We have got to continue with that reform. This is something that those opposite simply do not understand, because we all recall their failure to heed the warnings from the Reserve Bank about all of the capacity constraints in the economy. They still do not understand the importance of economic reform to building capacity and to making growth sustainable. They simply do not understand why we must move forward to make our economy much more competitive.Tomorrow we do have the national accounts, and I have every confidence that with the right policies in place our economy can continue to be one of the best in the world over coming years. But to continue to do that we have to keep this momentum for reform; we certainly need to do that. I can see the disappointment on the faces of those opposite that rates did not go up today. They certainly would never admit that the official interest rate is still 2.25 percentage points lower today than when the Liberals were last in office. But, from our perspective on this side of the House, we will do everything to reform our economy to build economic capacity and to keep the pressure off inflation so we can grow sustainably.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for North Sydney for his question, because I notice that those opposite are quite happy to ride on the coat-tails of a campaign, of up to $100 million based on reports, from the mining industry representing companies who do not want to pay another dollar's worth of tax to the Australian people. Second point: these resources are owned by the Australian people and the Australian people deserve their fair share.Furthermore, if you look at the overall take of tax through royalties over the last 10 years, it has gone from $1 in $3 in profits to $1 in $7 in profits. The Australian people are demanding a fair share. We make no apology whatsoever for engaging in a public advertising campaign to establish the facts of the government's new proposed RSPT and the reforms which it is capable of bringing about - namely, better super for working families, which they would cut; company tax cuts, which they would raise; and tax breaks for small business, which they would rip away. That is the government's reform plan. We intend to get on with the business of putting out the facts to the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I draw the attention of the House to the decision by Fitch Ratings agency on Friday which downgraded Spain's credit grading to AA plus, triggering renewed global concerns about sovereign debt. This is a matter of concern to financial markets and governments around the world. There were also sharp falls on global stock markets over the course of the last month. The US market was down by nearly 10 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial had its worst performance for the month of May in 60 years.This underlines the fragility of the global economic recovery. The IMF is forecasting that in fact we will have a fragile and protracted recovery for the global economy and, therefore, the world is by no means out of the woods yet. The IMF expects the global economy will grow by 3.9 per cent in 2010. On current IMF projections, real potential output for the global economy is not expected to return to precrisis levels until 2014. This puts in absolute stark contrast the importance of responsible economic management. This puts into absolute relief the responsible economic management policies of the Australian government.During the global financial crisis, 31 of the 33 IMF advanced economies went into recession; Australia did not. Eight of Australia's top 10 trading partners went into recession; Australia did not. Australia is the only one of the major advanced economies not to go into recession. Australia, as a result, has had the fastest growth, the lowest debt, the lowest deficit and the second lowest unemployment of all the major advanced economies. Without stimulus the Australian economy would have shrunk 0.7 per cent in 2009 and we would have had 200,000 more Australians out of work. Had we followed the Leader of the Opposition's prescription for responsible economic management and gone down the New Zealand road, we would have had hundreds of thousands of Australians out of work on top of those who had lost their jobs already.When the national accounts are revealed tomorrow, Wednesday, our fiscal position will be underlined again as being the envy of the developed world, given the fact that so much of the rest of the world has barely begun the trajectory to economic recovery. The success of our strategy is reflected in the point made just before by the Treasurer - that is, through prudent financial management the government will return the budget to surplus in three years time, three years ahead of time, and will also halve net peak debt. This is a critical achievement given the concerns about sovereign debt levels around the world and across OECD economies.This is not the time to follow the prescription of those opposite to pull the rug from under economic recovery by the abolition of stimulus. That would be absolutely the wrong call now and it is the call made by the Leader of the Opposition, who says repeatedly he has no interest in economics and who the former Treasurer said he would never have as the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. But go to the specifics of the cuts proposed by those opposite and it becomes even more concerning. It would be the wrong time, for example, to be slashing training programs - cuts that will deny training to nearly 400,000 Australians. It is the wrong time to be denying tax cuts to 2.4 million Australian small businesses, the wrong time to be jacking up the company tax rate as opposed to bringing the company tax rate down and the wrong time to be cutting and slashing trade training centres across Australia. These centres are necessary in order to build up the skilled workforce of the future.These are fundamental reforms for the future, all aimed at underpinning the skills needs of our economy for the future. The alternative approach by them is to abolish stimulus and to slash and burn - cuts in schools, cuts in training, cuts in computers, cuts in trade training centres, cuts in health, on top of the billion dollar gouge out of health he took last time. On the question of reform and keeping the economy strong, we have had a debate today and yesterday about tax reform. In fact, those opposite have abandoned the real debate. They have now gone onto a debate purely about advertising. Can I say one of the reasons they have abandoned the debate on tax reform is the Leader of the Opposition does not even understand what tax is being debated. Today the Leader of the Opposition was asked a very simple question. Journalist: 'If I point to that product over there, can you explain to me how that tax would interact with it and how?' Abbott's answer: 'Well, the tax falls on everything which is extracted.' That is not right, Leader of the Opposition. But it goes on. 
Opposition members - Why not? - Why not? Come in spinner. Journalist: 'But can you explain the detail of how like if I point to that product over there, can you explain to me how that tax would interact with it?' Abbott replied: 'Well, well, the tax falls on everything which is extracted from the ground.' That is the point, Leader of the Opposition. This is not an extraction tax. It is not a production tax. It is a tax on profits. On the first principle of tax reform, he does not get it. He says it is a royalty tax based on extraction as opposed to a tax on profit. The Leader of the Opposition, we know from the former Treasurer, Peter Costello, does not actually think economics is interesting. We know from the former Treasurer that he would never have appointed him as Treasurer of Australia, but not to even understand that the RSPT is a tax on profits and not on volume and extraction and production fails Economics 101.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. As I said in response to one of her questions yesterday, the government in the early part of last year decided internally we would be embarking upon an advertising campaign to support fundamental tax reform. Secondly, on the question of expediting that campaign, we took that decision on the basis of the information which was contained in the correspondence between the Treasurer and the Special Minister of State.In terms of the internal deliberations of the committee in relation to this matter, I cannot enlighten the minister in response to her question. I can say to her, though, that when the previous government was looking at a $256 million advertising campaign -  - When the previous government was doing its $256 million, or thereabouts, public advertising in 2007, guess who was on the ministerial communications committee - the member for Farrer. -  - The only point I was seeking to add to my answer was that the member for Farrer is well qualified in these matters as she was a member of the ministerial advisory group of the previous government which approved $256 million worth of advertising in 2007, including more than $50 million on a Work Choices campaign. I understand where her priorities really lie.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. It is very important to counter misrepresentations regarding the government's tax reform package, and there are an awful lot of misrepresentations going around, both from the opposition and from sections of the mining industry. I mentioned a couple yesterday and I have a few more to mention today. The Minerals Council have had ads on radio recently, and they feature a self-funded retiree saying that the government's tax plan:_ may be good for paying off the Government's debt, but it's not good for me.Well, there is one problem with this assertion, one big problem: the proceeds from the resource super profits tax are being dedicated to cut company tax, to cut taxes on small business, to cut taxes on superannuation, to invest in infrastructure and to ensure that people who have deductions of up to $1,000 do not have to put tax returns in.If you want some evidence of this, I have a very reliable source to support the government's assertion, and that is in fact the opposition. When the opposition announced its purported savings package a week or two ago it put out a table headed 'Coalition savings'. This is a double-sided table, and it has a list of savings that are specified as being linked to the RSPT. Guess what they are:Early start to company tax rate cut for small businessLowering the company tax rateSmall business instant asset write-off _Resource exploration refundable tax offsetState Infrastructure Fund - et cetera. There is a total of the savings that are involved in not proceeding with these tax reform proposals, and guess what that adds up to. It adds up to almost $12 billion - the amount the resource super profits tax is proposed to raise over that time. So the opposition nail their own misrepresentation in their own savings announcement.The second example is a statement made by the head of the Minerals Council, Mr Mitch Hooke, last week, with respect to resources that are in the ground, minerals and resources that are owned by the Australian people. He said that they are 'only dirt' when they are in the ground. I have to say, it is great to see the noble and ancient art of alchemy making a comeback - because, according to the head of the Minerals Council, the process of digging this 'dirt' out of the ground magically transforms it into gold, or nickel or some other precious metal, but with a twist, because traditionally alchemy was about transforming base metals into gold but, according to the head of the Minerals Council, he can transform dirt into gold. That is some misrepresentation.Finally, we have the ever-present fifth shadow minister for finance in this parliamentary term, the member for Goldstein. On Sky News yesterday he claimed 'there are people already losing jobs because of the RSPT'. He was then asked to provide examples. He said:Ah, yes, there is people, um, I can't cite them here but they've been told to me.What that does indicate is that there is a giant misrepresentation campaign going on here, both by sections of the mining industry and by the opposition.The government is concerned to ensure that there is a balanced debate about these very important tax reform proposals and there are constructive negotiations with the mining industry about the details of the proposals, because at the bottom of all this is a simple proposition: to ensure that the Australian community gets full value for its resources that are dug up and sold by the mining industry for prices that are way higher than they have traditionally been, and that that value can be transformed into value for Australian businesses that create jobs and generate wealth all around the country across all sectors. That is what this tax reform proposal is about. That is what the government is committed to doing. And that is what the opposition is committed to tearing down.</DOC>

 - Can I say to the member for Groom that one of the reasons it is important to have facts in the debate about the RSPT is so that misinformation does not create unnecessary uncertainty in the Australian economy. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation has just gone through one example after another of how the existing campaign by the MCA fundamentally misleads in so many aspects of this tax debate - the reason, therefore, why the government has brought forward an advertising campaign on this question to settle the facts in the minds of the Australian public.Those opposite trade constantly in fear, they trade constantly in misrepresentation - not just in relation to an RSPT; they have done it in practically every other area of public policy as well. That is because the Leader of the Opposition has no positive plan of his own, only fear and loathing in relation to anything positive that we plan or propose for the future. One after another, whether it is a proposal in relation to the economy, whether it is a proposal in relation to how we invest in skills or infrastructure, whether it is a proposal for climate change or whether it is a proposal in relation to an RSPT, what the Leader of the Opposition does is say: '(1) I have no policy; (2) you should be very frightened of that policy.' That is his standard stock in trade. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: he needs to get real with the Australian public and level with them about his own actual policies.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for Wakefield for his question because, as he knows, the government values the hard work of all parents, whether they are in the paid workforce or whether they are at home. What we do on this side of the House is support families to make their own work and family choices. That is why the government supports families through the baby bonus and family tax benefits parts A and Bill, and that is why, from 1 January next year, we will be delivering Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. This will give mums and dads extra support so that they can spend more time at home with their newborn babies.Our scheme is fair to families and fair to businesses. The Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and individual employers have all welcomed our scheme. Employers are now embracing the opportunity to work with the government to make sure we give parents more work and family choices. Just today we have seen Westpac and their new collective agreement offering 13 weeks of paid parental leave. This makes Westpac a paid parental leave pacesetter in the financial sector. Westpac, like many other companies, clearly recognises the value of being an employer of choice and the value of family friendly working conditions for attracting and retaining their staff. I know the Deputy Prime Minister, as the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, has a very keen interest in this agreement. Westpac is providing employees with the flexibility to decide on the work and family conditions that suit them and their families. The important thing is that Westpac's scheme will be in addition to the government's paid parental leave scheme. This means that Westpac employees will be entitled to up to 31 weeks of paid parental leave.Instead of supporting and encouraging companies like Westpac, this Leader of the Opposition, of course, is not supporting those companies; what he wants to do is impose a great big new tax on all of these businesses. We know that for 12 years when he was in government, this Leader of the Opposition opposed paid parental leave. All of us know that this Leader of the Opposition in fact famously said that paid parental leave would be introduced over his dead body. Now of course, after a staggering back flip, he has come up with a sham scheme that will impose this great big new tax and see prices go up both for families and for pensioners. If ever it was the case that his scheme was introduced, we would see very substantial amounts of money going to high-income earners. High-income families - high-income parents - would be getting around $75,000 under the scheme of this Leader of the Opposition. - I hear the member for O'Connor up the back there. He has tried to sum it up this way today. The member for O'Connor said: 'Well, look, brighter people have brighter children. I mean, and, um, you know, I make the sporting analogy: faster racehorses get faster racehorses.' Well, according to the member for O'Connor, their great contribution to family policy in Australia - the great contribution from the member for O'Connor - is to compare mothers to horses. Thank you so much! What a bunch of absolute dinosaurs opposite. Australian families have been waiting decades for paid parental leave, and this government will deliver it to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question and I go back to my answer to the previous question which was asked. My answer was that those opposite engage in one thing and one thing alone when it comes to tax reform, and that is a fear campaign. It is a fear campaign in the absence of any form of fact. The Leader of the National Party, if he bothered to read the government's report, through the Treasury, on the economic modelling for the introduction of the RSPT, would know, from its conclusions, the impact on consumer prices. He would know the impact on employment; he would know the impact on overall economic growth; he would know the impact on the expansion of activity within the mining industry and also on the expansion of investment in the mining industry.But as he has raised the general question of resource rent tax can I also, for the benefit of the House, refer to an article which has recently been published in the editorial of the Financial Times of London - a leading left-wing journal! It is coloured pink; be very suspicious! It says this in the first paragraph or two:Miners, like oil men, are a tough lot. They are fighting tooth and nail to derail the Australian government's plan for a 'super profit tax'. But just as oil and gas companies survived when a similar tax was imposed on them, the mining industry has broad enough shoulders to bear the new burden.It goes on to say:It will be a long-overdue update of the medieval practice of levying royalties on gross production. Being regressive, royalties squeeze marginal producers while letting those with the most abundant mines keep the largest share of their loot.Furthermore, the article goes on to say, in response to an observation by Rio:The charge that it turns Australia into the 'number one sovereign risk issue', made by Tom Albanese, chief executive of Rio Tinto, is absurd.So says the editorial of the Financial Times yesterday. The Financial Times, I would suggest, is not necessarily a subunit of the Australian Labor Party! It is not a branch of the Australian government; it is the premier financial journal in the world. Its editorial recognises that a resource rent tax is the most effective way of taxing profit rather than volume, profit rather than production.But then again the Leader of the Opposition does not understand what this tax is about in the first place, because in answer to a question this morning - a very simple and basic question to the Leader of the Opposition, 'Tony, how does this tax actually apply to this product?' he could not answer. He could not answer in one sentence, two sentences or three sentences. In fact he said it was just like a royalties tax.The Leader of the Opposition does not know the first thing about tax policy, nor the first thing about economic policy. The one thing he does know about tax policy is how to jack up the tax rate by bringing in a great big new tax across all Australian businesses that have an over-$5 million turnover - a thought bubble he had one morning without consultation with anyone in his joint party room. This government has the plan for reform; those opposite have a fear campaign - one and all.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question; I know that he is passionate about ensuring that people in his electorate have decent working conditions and fairness at work. Of course on this side of the House we are always very happy to talk about respecting fairness in people's workplaces, and we are always very happy, too, to point out the alternative: a return to Work Choices, under the Leader of the Opposition - Work Choices mark 2. One of the reasons that we introduced the Fair Work Act was to put focus on productivity growth because of the stalling in productivity growth under the Howard government.If we look at the Intergenerational report about Australia to 2050, we see it confirms that productivity growth was averaging 1.4 per cent during the decade to 2010, after reaching 2.1 per cent in the 1990s. Lifting this productivity rate is a key objective of the Fair Work Act. It needs to be taken into account in every decision taken by Fair Work Australia. With a focus on collective agreement making, that focus is of course about productivity enhancing enterprise agreements, and research has shown that collective bargaining is good for productivity growth. We have also reduced a massive regulatory burden on workplaces through the simplification of awards. We have reduced almost 4,000 federal and state awards to 122 modern, simple awards - that is, 197,000 pages of regulation reduced to 5,753 pages, a massive reduction of 95 per cent in the red-tape and regular burden.Access Economics has modelled that the benefit of this to our economy and the benefit of moving to a uniform system of workplace relations for the private sector, as delivered by the fair work system, is $4.83 billion over 10 years. That story has a positive impact on economic growth and employment. Access Economics estimates the reform will boost national output by 0.05 per cent and increase employment by some 5,000 jobs at the peak of its beneficial impact in 2011-12.I am asked, too, about threats to the fair work system and its ability to enhance productivity. We know that the Leader of the Opposition is a Work Choices supporter and is absolutely unrepentant about it. On 19 March 2008, the Leader of the Opposition said Work Choices was 'good for wages, good for jobs and good for workers, and let's never forget that'. Those are the words of the Leader of the Opposition. So maybe the Leader of the Opposition might like to explain this: how is it that when 63 per cent of Australian workplace agreements cut penalty rates that was good for workers? How is it that when 52 per cent of AWAs cut shift loading that was good for workers? How is it that when AWAs - 51 per cent of them - cut overtime loadings that was good for workers? How is it that when 48 per cent of AWAs cut public holiday pay that was good for workers? The view of the Leader of the Opposition - pay cuts, loss of basic conditions, penalty rates, shift loading, overtime and public holiday pay - is somehow that all of that was good for workers.Mr Speaker, you might believe that it is a little bit mysterious how the Leader of the Opposition could ever have come to such an irrational view. But I have a theory. My theory is that the Leader of the Opposition was actually indoctrinated by the $121 million of advertising that the Howard government and the Leader of the Opposition engaged in in relation to Work Choices advertising. This was a 24/7 campaign. The Leader of the Opposition would get up in the morning, make a cup of coffee, walk over to the fridge to get the milk out and there would be a Work Choices fridge magnet. He would get himself ready for work, he would get into the office and the first thing he would do when he was in the office was pick up his Work Choices pen. And then when he was starting to work on Battlelines, having his first preliminary thoughts, they were not very big thoughts so he could have got out his Work Choices pad and written them down. And then, as he was more ready to bring out Battlelines, he would have been working away on the computer looking at his mouse pad every day - 24/7 indoctrination has obviously got to the Leader of the Opposition.Fortunately, my department apparently rejected his request for Work Choices budgie-smugglers because the thought was too hideous to contemplate. But I have a standing offer to the Leader of the Opposition and I am waiting for his response. I still have five pallets of Work Choices propaganda. I have done my best. They have gone to Ethiopia. They have gone to East Timor. They have gone around the world. I have done my best to get rid of them, but I have five pallets of Work Choices propaganda. I have 34,000 individual items - Work Choices pens, mousepads and all the rest of it - ready to go. I am asking the Leader of the Opposition, so I do not have to table 34,000 items at some point, whether he can take these items off my hands. They will be very good for his next campaign, because we know that his slogan is going to be 'Work Choices - good for workers'. Tony, you will really need these on the campaign trail.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the member for Kalgoorlie, who has already made a very strong contribution to the tax reform debate for the mining industry, for his question. The bottom line is that only the Leader of the Opposition in this place says that the mining companies are paying too much tax - only the Leader of the Opposition. - Ah, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, she of national security credentials, interjects and says that in fact there is someone else. But I thought that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that they were paying just enough tax, whereas the shadow minister for infrastructure - good old Senator Barnaby Joyce - said that they could be paying more tax. The member for Kalgoorlie entered with the fourth position, which was that everyone in the opposition should be able to have their own tax policy. That was a great intervention on the doors the other day. Only the Leader of the Opposition says that the mining companies of Australia are paying too much tax. We know that the member for Kalgoorlie is out there trying to back him up.The bottom line is that they can pay more tax. The government stands by the data that it has presented. I would suggest to those opposite that they engage in their own independent analysis as opposed to simply running out one piece of propaganda after another put out by the MCA. This government stands for tax reform to deliver better super for working families, better tax cuts for small business, reducing the company tax rate and better infrastructure for Australia's regions for the future. That is what we stand for; that is what you stand opposed to.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition again for his question on economics. It goes down to the economics of small business. I cannot comment on the individual circumstances of the firm he describes, but let me say this to the Leader of the Opposition about what has kept many Australian small businesses alive over the past 18 months. No. 1: we stimulated the Australian economy. No. 2: we kept more than 200,000 people in jobs who would otherwise have lost their jobs. No.3: we provided tax concessions for small business during the course of the global recession so that they could actually bring forward their capital acquisition in order to keep themselves afloat. The small business tax benefit which was delivered was a huge success for small businesses right across the country. I would be interested to know whether in fact the business in question made utilisation of that particular tax measure, which we used in the course of our response to the global financial crisis.The Leader of the Opposition is bored by these sorts of facts. These facts go to what kept hundreds of thousands of people in work, tens of thousands of small businesses with their doors open. Instead, what he proposes is to pull the rug from stimulus, notwithstanding the fact that the global economic recovery is tenuous, and thereby place at risk and at jeopardy the future of the Australian economy. His only response to the company in question is to send them a big warning bell: whatever you do, do not go from being a small business to a medium business which might have a turnover of some $5 million, because then you would be up for another two per cent tax if the business is incorporated. That is what the Leader of the Opposition stands for. What we stand for is bringing down the taxes on Australian business. What he stands for is jacking up the taxes on Australian business. We stand for increasing the super for the workers employed in that particular industry. He stands for ripping that super away from those workers. He stands also for reintroducing Work Choices. This government has withdrawn Work Choices. He stands for increasing the job insecurity of workers by ensuring that he repeals the government's current arrangements concerning unfair dismissal. He stands for job insecurity. He stands for cuts to jobs, cuts to education and cuts to health as well as the reintroduction of Work Choices, all of which would be of passing relevance to the workers in the firm which he just described.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. His one script for working families is to bring back Work Choices. Our script for working families is to abolish Work Choices. That is the difference. With Work Choices, which he regards as his key mantra for the future: number one, it strips away basic working conditions for working families; number two, it undermines such things as penalty rates; and, number three, it damages a whole series of additional basic conditions which working families need to ensure that family incomes are held up. When the Leader of the Opposition stands up here in an exercise I can only describe as rancid hypocrisy on the interests of working families, I say to him two words: Work Choices.The Leader of the Opposition referred to education. This government prior to the last election said we would bring in an education tax refund. We have brought in an education tax refund for working families with primary school kids and with secondary school kids. Secondly, we also said that for working families dealing with childcare costs we would increase the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We have increased the rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. The Leader of the Opposition refers to health costs. I refer him to the government's pre-election commitment to bring in a teen dental scheme. The government has brought in that very scheme, which has benefited, I am advised, some 400,000 or more across the country.The Leader of the Opposition refers more broadly to health costs. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition on the question of health costs and the effectiveness of the health system that what he did as health minister for five years was reach his long hand into the health budgets of the nation and take out $1 billion from the public hospital system of Australia. What he has now said, further, is that if he were elected to the office of Prime Minister at the next election he would reach his hand in again and take out nearly another billion dollars from the health system of Australia. On housing, I remind the Leader of the Opposition that interest rates now are some percentage points lower than they were when he left office at the end of 2007. So whether it is on interest rates, whether it is on housing, whether it is on education, whether it is on health, whether it is on hospitals, but most of all whether it is on Work Choices, the Leader of the Opposition's record on working families is clear to each and every person listening to this debate today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. Last night I spoke to the Prime Minister of Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu. He had just returned from his visit to Canada and was about to go into a cabinet meeting to discuss the incident that the honourable member's question refers to. I set out the framework in which Australia views this tragedy in my discussion with the Prime Minister, and reflected Australia's deep concerns over the recent military operation off Gaza.Consistent with the public remarks made both by myself and by the foreign minister yesterday, I indicated that the Australian government was deeply concerned at the loss of life and injuries that had occurred as part of the IDF operation; furthermore, that deaths in these circumstances are deeply disturbing and of deep concern to the Australian people; and, furthermore, that Israel should mount an independent inquiry into the incident so that all the facts can be established and an informed judgment made about the events surrounding the incident of Monday. Furthermore, I reiterated that the Australian government's position was that more needs to be done to ensure a reasonable continuing supply of humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. Australia recognises the unique security challenges that the government of Israel faces from the government of Iran, the state of Iran, and the terrorist organisations which the Iranians support. Australia remains sensitive to the security concerns of Israel. Australia is nonetheless deeply concerned by the loss of life in this most recent military action off Gaza.The government gives the highest priority to the welfare of Australians caught up in this incident. The Australian embassy in Israel has been in close contact with Israeli authorities concerning the welfare and safety of the Australians who have been involved. I can advise the House that Australian officials have been granted access to all known Australians from vessels in the flotilla and that officials have provided consular assistance to those Australians. Yesterday embassy officials visited the three Australians and one permanent resident currently at the Beersheba detention centre, where people on the flotilla have been taken. Also yesterday an Australian embassy official made a second consular visit to an injured Australian man in an Israeli hospital. We have been advised that consular access will be provided again to the Australians at the Beersheba detention centre today, 2 June. We have also been advised that all those detained can request access to lawyers.Our embassy officials are working with detained Australians and Israeli authorities on the appropriate way forward for each Australian given their specific circumstances. We continue to seek confirmation that no other Australians were on board. Furthermore, I requested of Prime Minister Netanyahu last night that he personally engage on the matter concerning the wellbeing of these Australians and these Australian permanent residents. The Prime Minister indicated he would do so.The events of Monday have generated protests in a number of countries around the world. Australia has been no exception. Australia has a deep commitment to the right of Australians to protest and to express their views on subjects of their choice. Whatever the issue Australians have that right. That protest, however, needs to be undertaken peacefully and in a manner which does not incite or provoke violence or lead any community to feel under threat within our country, Australia. At times like this, when passions are aroused, it is important that our communities understand that protest activity needs to be peaceful and undertaken in a way that does not fray the threads that make our society the strong fabric that it is. This is Australia. All protest activity must be undertaken peacefully, and in relation to individual communities within Australia none of those communities should be left feeling under threat.Australia has a very strong relationship with Israel, a relationship that goes back to the founding of the Israeli state and Australia's vote at the United Nations in 1947, which was the first cast in support of the establishment of the state of Israel, under the Chifley Labor government. We are friends. At times, however, the role of friends is to speak plainly, and that is what Australia has done on this occasion in relation to this matter.</DOC>

 - I stand by the accuracy of all the figures in the economic note - absolutely. Let us just go through what this is all about, because the member for North Sydney has been very, very sloppy yet again. I know people on this side would find that probably hard to understand, but of course he has! Now what does this relate to? This relates to the fact -  - You always laugh when Joe's asking you about pies. -  - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. Around the start of the decade the Australian community received about $1 in royalties and resource charges for every $3 of resource profits. In 2008-09 that figure had fallen to $1 in $7. This goes to the very core of the embarrassment of those opposite. -  - Yes, Mr Speaker, because the pie chart shows and the data that it is based on -  - The pie chart - and the data it is based on - shows that the Australian people have not been getting their fair share. The member for Dickson is only interested in shares. He is not interested in a fair share for the Australian people. Not even the mining industry thinks that there should not be more paid by most companies so the Australian people get a fair share. The only people in Australia who believe that are those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition thinks the mining industry is paying too much tax. I stand by all of the data in the economic note, so I stand by that. There was a discussion about this last night in Senate estimates and of course that will be responded to in the normal way by the department.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question because the strength of the Australian economy also rests on the strength of the region's of Australia, including the Northern Territory, which the honourable member so effectively represents in this chamber together with the member for Lingiari and senators as well. I believe there is nothing more fundamental to the responsibilities of a government than to keep the economy strong, because, if you have a strong economy, you can then deliver on the aspirations for working families. You can also then build a fairer Australia and put in place the measures you need to secure Australia's future.Today we had revealed and released the national accounts. They point to a strong performance for the Australian economy. Australia's GDP has grown by a solid 0.5 per cent in the March quarter. The Australian economy continues to be the envy of the developed world. Notwithstanding our strong national economic performance, we should also be mindful of the fact that many families in the Australian community and many Australian small businesses are still finding it very tough, given the nature of the global economic forces still at work on Australia.The Australian economy, as I said before, continues to be the envy of the developed world. Australia's growth over the past year has been 2.7 per cent. This compares to 0.4 per cent for New Zealand, minus 0.2 per cent for the United Kingdom, 2.5 per cent for the United States and 0.5 per cent in the Euro area. This becomes an even more stark comparison if we compare Australia's economic growth performance since the crisis began some two years ago. These figures are worth reflecting on. Australia's economy since this crisis began has grown by 3.5 percentage points. In the United Kingdom, GDP has fallen by 5.5 percentage points. In Germany, it has fallen by 5.3 percentage points. In the United States, it has fallen by 0.9 percentage points.But the model for the Leader of the Opposition - remember - is New Zealand. I would ask him to reflect on the fact that in New Zealand they have had something like five consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. That is his recommended economic model, from the man who says that economics bores him, from the man who the previous Treasurer Peter Costello said he could never make Treasurer and whose colleagues have now said, in various publications around the country, would not understand the meaning of the concept of being a fiscal conservative. His model is New Zealand and I would suggest he reflects on New Zealand's performance.On the question of the strength of Australia's performance, I would also draw to the attention of those opposite that this government will be bringing the budget back to surplus in three years time, three years ahead of time, and we will be halving net peak debt. That is this government's record of achievement. Had we gone the other way and taken the recommendation of the Leader of the Opposition and not had any stimulus, you would have had Australia in recession, you would have had taxation receipts collapsing completely and you would have had very large outlays for unemployment benefits. Had Australia performed like so many of the other economies around the world which generated double-digit unemployment we would have had something like half a million more Australians out of work. That was the script being put on offer by those opposite - tens of thousands of businesses closing their doors and our budget under greater pressure.The core difference that we made relative to other economies was the size and construction of our economic stimulus strategy. That is what has made the difference in this Australian economy. - The member for North Sydney continues to loudly interject. I would ask him to examine the national accounts figures today in terms of the contribution of public final demand to the overall growth performance of the Australian economy and ask him then to reflect upon the wisdom of his interjection that stimulus had nothing to do with it.Can I say to those opposite and to the House more broadly that stimulus has helped pick up the slack in critical areas of the economy. For example, in the building industry, private activity contracted by 0.6 per cent in the March quarter and is now over 15 per cent below the level it was a year ago. That is why programs such as Building the Education Revolution, the school modernisation program, have been of fundamental importance, together with the social housing program, in providing work for tradies, sparkies, chippies and builders right across the Australian economy. If any of those members opposite were being honest about this and looking in the faces of the builders and the subcontractors in their electorates, including the Leader of the Opposition's electorate, they should have the courage to front them and say that they would pull the plug from under each and every one of those projects.This has therefore been a core element in Australia's strong economic performance. The stimulus measures that we have embarked upon are already in the process of being withdrawn. The first homeowners boost has been reduced, the tax breaks to small business have come to a conclusion, and there is the guarantee scheme for large deposits and wholesale funding and the state guarantee scheme. Over time the withdrawal of fiscal stimulus is anticipated to subtract around one percentage point from GDP growth over 2010.Here is the core point: those opposite are calling for the cancellation of stimulus now. That is their position. Reflect on that as it would occur and roll out across the ground. The cancellation of stimulus would result in the cancellation of 175 road and rail safety projects right across Australia. It would result in construction being stopped midway on 7,000 major school buildings. It would result in the construction being stopped midway of more than 533 science and language centres across Australia. It would leave 12,500 new social dwellings unfit for occupation, without plumbing or even walls. It would lead to the cessation of the construction of 380 defence homes across Australia, something I would have thought the member for Herbert might take a particular interest in. Further, 130 projects across our universities would be stopped and work also brought to a halt on 125 community infrastructure projects, all backed by Australian local government. That is the practical consequence of what the Leader of the Opposition says would happen if he cancels - as he says he would - stimulus projects across the country. The question for each member opposite is to front their local P&amp;Cs and their local P&amp;Fs and tell them which of those schools is not going to be brought to conclusion.This government is proud of its achievements in terms of the management of the economy in the worst global economic downturn that the world has faced since the Great Depression. We are proud of the fact that the Australian economy has emerged as the only major economy which has not gone into recession. It is one of only two economies of the 30-plus economies across the OECD not to have gone into recession. This should be cause for confidence on the part of Australians, but it should not be cause for complacency on the part of Australians. That is why we are engaged in long-term economic reform as well - building productivity growth, investing in infrastructure, investing in skills and implementing microeconomic reform. That also includes taxation reform, and that is what we are doing with the resource super profits tax in order to provide long-term reform and a basis for growth for this country into the future.This side of the House welcomes positive news on the Australian economy. We welcome positive growth numbers for the Australian economy. Is it so far beyond the capabilities of the Leader of the Opposition to stand up today and welcome the fact that this has been the strongest-growing economy of all the advanced economies in the world?</DOC>

 - He is at it again. I confirm and stand by the accuracy of all of the data supplied to my office which appears in the pie charts. I have made that very clear. The government and the department are very happy to supply all of the data in the normal way, as was requested in Senate estimates. That is entirely a matter for the department, and they will do that in the normal way.But let us just go through what the opposition are upset about here. Last night on Lateline, we had the shadow Treasurer. He showed absolutely conclusively on Lateline that he does not understand the purpose of royalties. - It is a question about royalties, it a question about data -  
Opposition members - No, it's not. - The whole chart is about royalties. It just shows that they have not the faintest idea why royalties are important, what role they play and why we have to have a superprofits tax to replace royalties. They simply do not get it, and they do not think that it is a problem that the Australian people have not been getting fair value via the royalties system. They have bought this line from the Mining Industry Council hook, line and sinker that, because the mining industry pays company tax, it does not matter what they pay in terms of royalties. They have bought that line hook, line and sinker. - I most certainly am, because this is an argument and a discussion about royalties - whether the Australian people are getting their fair share and the data on which that is based. So I am very, very clearly relating my answer to the question. What they are trying to deny is that the Australian people have not been getting a fair share, and they are seeking to cast some sort of doubt on the accuracy of the figures. - I stand by the accuracy of all of the figures in the economic note. Regarding the figuring on which it is based, I have said in relation to Senate estimates - which was also asked about in one of the questions - that the department would be supplying all of that material in the normal way. This was a question about royalties and how they are calculated.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. As the Prime Minister said before, the Australian economy grew by a solid 0.5 per cent in the March quarter and 2.7 per cent through the year. I think all Australians should have confidence in this very solid outcome and confidence in the fact that we do have one of the best economies in the developed world. We can see that again in these national accounts today. It is an economy which is gradually in transition from support provided by policy stimulus to support provided by private demand. Of course, as the Prime Minister also said before, that stimulus is withdrawing at a rate that ensures appropriate support remains targeted at softer sections of the economy. Infrastructure projects in particular have helped plug the hole in private sector building activity, while stimulus payments and tax breaks for business have been unwound.Stimulus projects contributed 12.5 per cent to the increase in new public investment in the quarter. Public investment has now risen by more than 40 per cent over the past year. As the Prime Minister also said before, this is keeping tradies in employment and it is keeping the doors of small business open. - But, on cue, we get the shadow finance spokesman over there saying that somehow this did not play an important role in our economy and it is not important as we go forward. I can tell you that this pipeline of activity is absolutely essential to employment in this economy, is absolutely essential to confidence in small business and is keeping the doors of small business open in circumstances where it is quite difficult and remains very difficult for many small businesses out there. It is indeed ironic that the party opposite, which claims to be a party of small business, does not understand that essential fact - the ongoing importance of that infrastructure stimulus to support demand in our economy as the rest of the stimulus is being wound down.The national accounts today are an important reminder of what Australians have achieved over the past year. Certainly the greatest achievement was that we did avoid recession when many other countries faced recession. The consequence of that has been the creation of something like 235,000 jobs in the past year. Other nations were shedding jobs. Other nations have unemployment rates of nine and 10 per cent; if you go to Europe, unemployment is as high as 16 per cent in some countries. That in itself is a fundamental drag on growth and a cause of great concern. You would think that in this House today they would be celebrating this very important outcome for all Australians - the fact that we have been successful in supporting small business and supporting families.One of the lessons that this country has learnt through the experience of the last couple of years is that we do need to take the hard decisions to support our economy. They were not capable of taking the hard decisions to support us when we put in place fiscal stimulus, which is responsible for the outcome that we are seeing today. They squibbed it. They came into this House and they voted it down and they voted it down in the Senate in the first passage. That fiscal stimulus was absolutely important to the financial security of every Australian. On that occasion they did not display any understanding of the threat.Equally, they have no understanding of what we need to do now to build on that success to put in place the essential economic reforms that can create prosperity as we move forward. They were wrong about stimulus and they are wrong about tax modernisation because they are simply out of touch and have no grasp of economics whatsoever.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question and for her ongoing interest in the economic future particularly of the west. Today I granted major project facilitation status to the West Pilbara iron ore project. This recognises its economic significance to Australia and it shows that the government is getting on with the job of supporting investment so that Australia can take full advantage of the global recovery. This is a $4 billion project which will commercialise 500 million tonnes of iron ore. It will generate some $2 billion every year in export revenue and create 4,000 jobs during construction. I spoke with the project manager yesterday, who confirmed that, with today's announcement, they are on track to start construction on this iron ore project next year, with production to begin in 2013. This is good news for the Pilbara and it is good news for the nation.As we all know, a project of this scale needs infrastructure. In this case, the West Pilbara iron ore project will construct a 275-kilometre heavy haulage railway and a new deep-water port at Anketell Point, both with opportunities for third-party access. This is an issue right across the country. We need not just private sector investment in infrastructure; we also need to have a capacity to leverage with public investment in infrastructure. Only this morning, the member for Maranoa was calling for an urgent upgrade of the Landsborough Highway to cope with the pressure from the Galilee Basin coal projects. The Rudd government's tax reform plan will support more sustainable growth across the economy by helping to build infrastructure capacity around Australia as resource projects come on line. That is why the Rudd government wants to establish the infrastructure fund as part of its proposed resource super profits tax. We stand for a stronger economy. We recognise that even in areas where there has been a substantial mining boom - such as Port Hedland or Karratha or Newman - you see, in spite of the extraordinary wealth that is being generated, a lack of infrastructure, whether it be export based infrastructure restricting our capacity for growth, or whether it be social infrastructure, such as education, health and childcare facilities. And, frankly, I am surprised that the announcement of a project such as this, with major project facilitation by the federal government, is not welcomed by all in this parliament. I assure the parliament it has been welcomed by the company concerned.</DOC>

I understand that those opposite have very little to do with their days other than sit by the radio, but I have not seen the transcript of Mr Orgill's interview. What I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that Mr Orgill is able to get every document that can be accessed by the federal government, the Commonwealth government. As the Leader of the Opposition may be aware, under the arrangements for Building the Education Revolution, including the guidelines, we are able to access documentation by education authorities relating to Building the Education Revolution. For example, documents held by state governments or education authorities relevant to the rollout of the program and compliance with the guidelines can be accessed. I will have a look at Mr Orgill's transcript, and if I can assist the Leader of the Opposition further then I will.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, tax reform in this country is both necessary and long overdue. That is especially the case in the resources sector, the objective being to make it more efficient. That effectively means a very serious debate, one which the government is engaged in, about removing royalties and introducing a profit based system.A profit based system will provide fiscal stability compared to the current situation, where state governments can and do lift royalty rates when they need to boost their bottom line, as is currently occurring in the state of Western Australia. It will also turn the lose-lose situation of the royalties based system around, which means the same revenue is paid in the good times as in the bad. I remind the House that during the good times, when prices are high and profits are high, a profit based system provides the Australian community with a fairer return on the nation's non-renewable resources. Equally, during the bad times, when prices are low and profits are low, a profit based system provides timely tax relief for miners. And on many occasions, the minerals industry has sought that relief from state based premiers and treasurers.That is not just my view; it is also the view of the Minerals Council of Australia. They have set out a case for a profit based system in their submission to the Henry review. I was fortunate today to be amongst friends at the Minerals Council of Australia annual meeting. I want to bring to the attention of the House what the CEO of the Minerals Council of Australia said today. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition ought to take some interest in this; he might learn something about the minerals sector in Australia. This is what Mr Hooke had to say this morning:We certainly do want to see a profits based system.He went on to say:All the economists who say moving to a profits-based system is the way to go are right.The CEO of the MCA went even further:We're the ones that said let's move to a profit based system. Ipso facto, you pay more tax when you earn more profit.I only wish that the Leader of the Opposition would pay a little bit of serious attention to what is a complex debate. Yesterday we had the Leader of the Opposition suggesting that what we are talking about is an extraction tax. We are actually talking about a profit-based tax. He clearly showed, again, that he is focused on the politics of the debate rather than the current hard policy options for the Australian community. That comes as no surprise to me, because - as we all know - he finds economics boring.When it comes to advice on the minerals industry, he turns to the patron saint of the coalition - one Clive Palmer. We saw a cameo appearance by Clive Palmer at the National Press Club today. I only wish that the Leader of the Opposition had had time to watch that rather than delivering his political diatribe to the Minerals Council at lunchtime today. Let's think about Mr Palmer. A fortnight ago he was making threats about walking away from investment in South Australia. Well, we are still looking for that project. Last week we had him running around saying that the resources sector in Australia pays a tax rate of 70 per cent. When he was questioned about that at the Press Club today, he was all over the shop like a dog's breakfast. He could not support his previous claim that the resources industry pays a tax of 70 per cent. One should not be surprised, because Mr Palmer is used to throwing his weight around. I think the Australian community is fast coming to the conclusion that you cannot take Mr Palmer or the Leader of the Opposition seriously.Only a matter of a couple of weeks ago he was making similar threats to another very important section of the Australian community - one that is pretty important to a lot of ordinary people because of their love of sport. I go to his endeavours to stand over the Football Federation Australia and his claim that he was going to walk away from the sponsorship of the North Queensland Fury. If you listened to Mr Palmer at the National Press Club today, you almost came to the conclusion that the poor bloke was walking around with his backside out of his pants. This is what he had to say a couple of weeks ago, and this really goes to the question of his credibility and the credibility of the opposition. When asked about his support for the Fury and whether or not he had the financial resources to meet those commitments - and he now says that the resources sector cannot afford to pay more taxes - he was quoted as saying:'I can afford to lose eight million every day of this year and still be alright, you know,' he laughed.Well, this is no laughing matter. This is a serious debate about the future of the Australian resources industry.I simply say that this government is committed to getting the balance right - the appropriate balance between attracting investment in the resources sector of Australia and ensuring that the Australian community get a fair return on the development of the resources that they own 100 per cent. You can have Mr Palmer and his advice, because your credibility is about as good as his -  - Take his donations and sell your soul. We will stand up for the national interest of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I understand that the source material, if you like, for his question relates to an issue he has raised in this parliament before about a school in Berwick - he is indicating that he has raised it before - and some complaints raised by the school principal. I am therefore somewhat familiar with the matter he raises. I am advised -  - Let me explain. It is the principal of Berwick Lodge Primary School who raised the costings by Swift. Consequently, when I indicated to the member for La Trobe that I am familiar with this matter -  - You have to be careful of those interjections that show your ignorance. Swift Construction has been contacted by the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development. I am advised that, following those contacts, Swift Construction has actually advised the Victorian department that the template that is being used cannot be delivered for under $3 million using the BER processes. That is my advice from the Victorian department.On the question of suspending this program, about which I was asked - and I presume that there is some level of interest in an answer to the question asked, which is not being exhibited at the moment - can I explain to the member for La Trobe that I think there has been an apprehension that money being conveyed by the Commonwealth to education authorities on 1 July is somehow immediately expended on 1 July and, consequently, any recommendations in Mr Orgill's report in August cannot be actioned. I say to the member for La Trobe that this apprehension is not right.Let me take this opportunity to explain to the member for La Trobe, given that he has asked me directly about it, that what is happening is as follows. Payment is being made on 1 July in accordance with our education agreements - that is true. There are two more instalments of funding due to education authorities, one in November 2010 and the second in March 2011. These payments amount to around $3.5 billion and relate only to Primary Schools for the 21st Century. When amounts are paid by the Commonwealth to education authorities they are not immediately expended; they are held by those education authorities and they are drawn down when projects reach appropriate milestones. Consequently, even with money being conveyed on 1 July, there are payments to come in the future, and the money paid on 1 July will be held by education authorities and drawn down in relation to project milestones. Consequently, the report we will receive from Mr Orgill in August and any recommendations that he makes can be actioned. I have also said - and I am happy to repeat to the parliament very, very clearly - that Mr Orgill is at liberty to make recommendations earlier if he chooses. Of course, I am all ears in relation to those recommendations.Finally, and in conclusion, the member for La Trobe asked me about the question of a suspension. I refer him to today's national accounts data, particularly to the fact that private non-residential building investment fell further in the quarter and remains at a depressed level. Without the substantial ongoing support provided to the sector by the Building the Education Revolution program, activity and employment in this sector would be at an even lower level.  -   - Consequently, what I say to the member for La Trobe and those interjecting is that they should understand - and they may still advocate a suspension -   -   - Is the member for La Trobe interested in the answer or not?  -  
 - Obviously not. - My point from today's national accounts is this: it is clear from the national accounts that Building the Education Revolution is vital at this stage to supporting non-residential construction - that is, it is vital to supporting jobs. Members opposite may believe that there should be a suspension in doing so; they believe people should lose jobs. If they want to advocate that, that is a matter for them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. I know he has a strong interest in the Rudd government's actions in opposing so-called commercial whaling - scientific whaling - in the Southern Ocean and globally. The member asks me what actions the government is taking and I am pleased to report to the House on a number of actions that this government has taken in opposing commercial whaling and continuing to seek a permanent end to whaling worldwide, particularly in the Southern Ocean.Since coming to office the government has embarked on a comprehensive diplomatic engagement on this issue, including the appointment of a Special Envoy on Whale Conservation. Additionally, we have advanced a strong reform agenda focusing particularly on conservation and science at the International Whaling Commission, which is the body that regulates these issues, a proposal that was widely supported and discussed and will continue to be the subject of deliberation in the IWC process. The Rudd government has also launched the largest research partnership of its kind in the world, the Southern Ocean Research Partnership, a $32 million non-lethal whale research partnership open to all nations of the International Whaling Commission, so that we can prove once and for all that we can have whale research without needing to kill a single whale. In the run-up to the IWC we have also brought forward our own reform agenda which sets out our compromise proposals, including a phase-out of Southern Ocean whaling within five years and specifically no targeting of endangered or threatened species.Of course people listening will know that the government has taken the additional step, on 28 May, of announcing that Australia will initiate legal action in the International Court of Justice in The Hague against Japanese scientific whaling in the Southern Ocean, and that application is now lodged in the court. This is not a decision that is taken lightly. The government have been patient and committed in our efforts to find a diplomatic resolution to this issue. We have remained in intensive discussions in the IWC and bilaterally with Japan, and we will continue to work hard in the lead-up to and at the IWC meeting in June to pursue our objectives. We judge that the chance for an outcome at that meeting which meets Australia's fundamental conservation objectives is slim, but Australia will continue to engage constructively in the diplomatic effort.Importantly, we have enjoyed support for our proposals broadly from other IWC members who share Australia's concerns and goals, but the fact is that recent statements by whaling countries in the commission have provided little hope that our commitment to conservation of the world's whales will be reflected in any potential IWC compromise agreement. Having been unable to make the necessary progress we said we wanted to see, we now move to the next stage: legal action. I noticed some remarks from non-government organisations once that announcement was made. The International Fund for Animal Welfare said:The Australian government is the leading voice in whale conservation and today's announcement demonstrates that they are willing to put their words into action by taking this unprecedented step.The Australian Marine Conservation Society said on 28 May:It is about time a government stood up for the whales and we commend the Rudd Government for showing backbone.The fact is that this government has done more in just over two years on whale conservation than the coalition did under government in 12 years. It is a fact that the whale conservation efforts of the coalition, when they were in government, were miserable, were full of cliches and, critically, despite much table thumping, saw a doubling in the number of whales targeted in the Southern Ocean. That is the critical point here: in the entire period of time the coalition had carriage of this issue, the success of their activities can be judged by the fact that the number of whales targeted in the Southern Ocean doubled. That is because they have been confused over a number of matters in relation to taking re-election. Mr Hunt demanded that the government take international legal action, in August last year:We think Australia should put together a coalition of nations to proceed legally against Japan under the International Law of the Sea.In January the Leader of the Opposition said that legal action was not coalition policy. He said:Coalition policy is not to take Japan to the International Court.Then last Friday he had a bob each way with a hybrid model: 'We do support appropriate action, but we are not sure if we support this specific action.' The opposition leader should make it clear specifically whether he does support, or not, the government's action to initiate legal action in the International Court of Justice. In the meantime, the government remain absolutely opposed to commercial whaling, including so-called scientific whaling, and we will continue our efforts and our actions to ensure that these majestic creatures are not killed in the name of science.</DOC>

 - I thank the independent member for Ryan for his question and indicate to him that this data is not held by the government; it is held by industry. The member should therefore seek the information from industry. The government does, however, appreciate that there is substantial community concern, and legitimate concern, around these issues. I know that the issue of Bardon has created some controversy, as has, indeed, one particular tower in my electorate. There is community concern. The government is conscious of that.The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency, within the health portfolio, sets the mandatory limits on public exposure based on safe international best practice guidelines. I note that these arrangements were put in place by the previous government. Under these arrangements, carriers must issue notices responsibly, and there are rules on safety, consultation and compensation. We believe it is important to balance the community need for good communications infrastructure with community concerns on this issue.Communities that believe a carrier has not complied with its obligations should contact either the carrier or the Australian Communications and Media Authority. The industry code is currently under review, and it is appropriate that the government consider the findings of this review. But I will convey the member's question directly to the minister for communications and suggest that, if he has anything directly to add, he convey that directly to the member.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hunter for his question. He indeed is a member who understands that, when it comes to delivering transport infrastructure, long-term planning and certainty is vital. That is why the reckless statements over the last fortnight by the coalition are so alarming. They are attempting to say one thing here in the parliament but then another thing completely in their electorates. Indeed, the shadow minister for finance released a statement, as part of the budget response, when pass-the-parcel had ended. He said:Given the commitment to release the costings of already announced policies following is a table of costings relating to our $4.8 billion spending commitments - and then that table was included. He then stated in a press release, distributed after the famous press conference here, cut short by his advisor, that:Any other past commitments have been discontinued.It was a very clear statement from the person responsible for providing a finance position which was a part of the budget response.However, they are continuing to say something different out there in their electorates. Indeed, in a letter to the editor of local papers, Mr Robb, the member for Goldstein, said - wait for this quote:The claims by Mr Albanese that this commitment has been discontinued are completely and utterly false.Well, I am sorry if we have quoted the shadow finance minister, in a carefully scripted and written down comment we thought was gospel truth! That is all we have done. But they are continuing to say one thing in here, around Canberra, one thing to the press gallery about their being concerned about debt and deficit, and that they are not going to make any irresponsible promises, but something else out their in the electorates.The other thing they have done is that the shadow finance minister, when asked how he would fund roads, said that he would use Roads to Recovery funding - a big 'woops' moment from the member for Goldstein. The 565 local governments around Australia that receive untied funding to fund their local roads now know that all of that funding is under threat. The coalition will pillage that funding, in the words of the shadow finance minister. In the electorate of Paterson, in the Hunter: Dungog Shire Council, $2 million - gone; Gloucester Shire Council, $2 million - gone; Great Lakes Council, $3.7 million - gone; Maitland City Council, $2.8 million - gone; and Port Stephens, $2.7 million - gone.But it gets worse, because they cannot get enough cash to pay for all their promises simply by plundering local government. They have also drawn up a separate infrastructure hit list. In the same letter to local papers the shadow minister for finance said:There's still many projects worth billions of dollars in the Rudd Government budget which have not started _So all of the infrastructure projects, if they have not commenced - and the Leader of the Nationals has said the same thing - are up for grabs. In the Hunter, that means the $1.65 billion Hunter expressway, due to commence construction in 2010 -  - Construction has not started, because this mob opposite had not even purchased the properties along the route, and that had to be done, or had the planning put in place. So that will commence in 2010. - We stopped it? They did nothing for 12 years, we provided funding but they say we stopped it. - So the shadow minister for finance said today, to the Newcastle Herald, 'Oh, no, we'd let that one go through' - but we do not have it in writing yet, so we do not know what will go ahead and what will not. What the opposition now have to do is go through the $37 billion nation-building program and say which projects will proceed and which ones they will attempt to stop - even though all of them are subject to memoranda of understanding with state and territory governments. We know that when they last came to office they cut $2 billion from the roads budget.We also know that it is symptomatic of their attitude to infrastructure across the board. In the Hunter region, right up there at the top, the election of Paterson, the trade training centre at Bulahdelah Central School - $ 1½ million under threat; the trade training centre at Great Lakes College - $4½ million under threat; and the 577 computers in Paterson that kids will miss out on as a result of this opposition's reckless position. We need to know exactly what they stand for. We will be holding them to account - on the ground, in each and every electorate between now and election day. They will not get away with saying one thing in Canberra and another thing in their electorates.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question, though I view it to be a great pity that she will not stand up for the trades training centre in her electorate or the delivery of computers - a matter I raised with her in the parliament during the course of the last few days. At the next election voters in Gilmore will have a choice about getting someone who will stand up for the local electorate and their trades training centres and computers in schools -  - Can I say, on the question of school infrastructure in the member's electorate, I absolutely acknowledge that she has written to me supporting the Vincentia Trades Training Centre. You had better ask the Leader of the Opposition why he wants to cut the funding, member for Gilmore, and why you are supporting a man who would prevent that going ahead if he was elected as Prime Minister. That is what I mean by standing up for your electorate, member for Gilmore.On the point of order of the member for Mackellar, after the interruption by the member for Gilmore - I am not saying that in any way to criticise the member for Gilmore - the Deputy Prime Minister showed that she knew that she had to relate her remarks to the question. I invite her now to rise and to respond to the question from the member for Gilmore. - In response to the question, the member for Gilmore has raised with me an individual school. I assure the member for Gilmore, I want to get value for dollars spent on schools. On this side of the House we value education. That is why we are allocating money to Building the Education Revolution, trades training centres, computers in schools and teacher quality. We understand that the Leader of the Opposition - and maybe the member for Gilmore has a different view but she is not standing up for it - does not value this expenditure and wants to cut it all. Can I tell the member for Gilmore the appropriate course in relation to the individual school she raises: I have specifically created the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce, led by Mr Orgill, to deal with these matters. If she chooses, she can refer this matter to the taskforce.Then, on the matter of what the taskforce can do next - it was suggested in a question to me today that the taskforce cannot get documents - I refer the member for Gilmore to the agreements we have with education authorities that require, in clauses 3.2 and 6.4, the provision of documents, when requested, which can go to the taskforce. I also indicate, in response to the member for Gilmore, and on the question of the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce generally, that a little earlier today the Leader of the Opposition suggested in a question to me that Mr Orgill had said to Ray Hadley on his show this morning that he had admitted he does not have access to cost data in schools. That is not correct and I table the transcript which indicates, as usual, that claims made by the Leader of the Opposition are absolutely phoney.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. It was very appropriate, because I know that she enthusiastically welcomed the government's announcement of a regional cancer facility in her electorate - $12 million for the Illawarra. It is something that has long been needed and is one of a number of regional cancer centres that have been announced across the country. Today, the 20th announcement was made - $1.8 million to the ACT. It is one of the smaller investments but is a very important one. It will fund accommodation facilities, particularly for those people travelling from the broader south-east in the electorate of Eden-Monaro and those surrounds, for people that have to come to Canberra for services and often struggle with finding accommodation. These are very important projects that the government has been proud to announce. The member for Gilmore would be interested in this question as well, because a $23 million investment is being made in establishing a Shoalhaven regional cancer centre. This project will fund a linear accelerator, a CT scanner, eight chemotherapy chairs and 10 patient accommodation places. -  - I have not noticed, despite the overwhelming support for the need for these investments, any support coming from those opposite. In fact, I can hear members opposite yelling out, 'When will this happen?' It did not happen under the previous government for 12 years. We have now invested $560 million in more than 20 projects across the country. What we fear, and I think the member for Gilmore should fear, is that we have no promise from those opposite that this money will be honoured, that these commitments will be honoured, under a Liberal government. We have reason to be dubious about whether they will be honoured, because the Leader of the Opposition pulled a billion dollars out of our hospital system. He already in the budget reply has promised to pull another $800 million out of the system. The shadow minister for health, on Friday, committed to withdrawing another $450 million from the budget because they do not support our diabetes initiatives. So members like the member for Gilmore need to be standing up and committing to these projects, need to be standing up for their communities and need to be making sure that the Leader of the Opposition, who was a risk to health expenditure when he was in the portfolio, allows these important projects to continue.There is a legitimate question about when these investments will be delivered. Cancer investments take a very long period of time. The member that wants to interject will remember that in 12 years his government did not commit to any of these investments. I would be surprised if the member for interjecting - he probably is the member for interjecting; nevertheless, I do not think that is the name of his seat - the member for O'Connor, would not welcome $22 million going to regional cancer services in Albany, Northam, Narrogin, Geraldton and Kalgoorlie or $23 million going to the St John of God Hospital in Bunbury. I would have thought the member for Forest would also be welcoming this. We could go through the very long list.The point I am making, however, is that the Leader of the Opposition has not committed to protect this expenditure. He has already on his tab - his snatch and grab list of what he is going to do with our health expenditure - pulled $1.2 billion out of the system. We fear that these important cancer investments are next. If those backbenchers who stand to benefit from these investments do not get on quick smart to the Leader of the Opposition to tell him that this money should be protected, these long-term vital investments may not be made. That would be a tragedy, because the reason the government is making these investments comes down to one very important fact: if you are an Australian who lives in rural and regional Australia and you get the dreadful news that you have a diagnosis of cancer, your chance of surviving is three times worse than if you are a person in the city who gets that same diagnosis. That is not good enough. It is an embarrassment for a country like Australia. It is the reason that $560 million is being invested in regional cancer centres. We would like to see those opposite standing up for regional Australia for once and agreeing that this money will be protected by any future government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. Can I say this to the member for Greenway: when we see comparisons made on building costs, sometimes in the media and sometimes in this parliament, it is very important to be comparing like with like. I am not sure that in the member's question we have really seen a comparison of like with like. However, can I say to the member that if the P&amp;C at that school is concerned about value for money on their Building the Education Revolution project, then so am I. We are concerned to make sure that dollars spent on schools make a difference for schools, that dollars spent on schools go to maximum effect. As a government, and the member for Greenway might want to contemplate this, we have prioritised the education revolution and school education because we inherited a system that was groaning after more than a decade of neglect. That is why we are investing in trades training centres, to give kids an opportunity to get the skills they need for life and work, and the opposition wants to cut that back. That is why we are investing in computers in schools, so kids can learn with the learning tool of the 21st century, and the opposition wants to cut that back. That is why we are investing in teacher quality, to bring the best teachers to the classrooms that need them the most, to pay the best teachers more to go to the classrooms that need them the most, and the opposition wants to cut that back. And it is why, during this difficult economic period when we have needed to support jobs particularly in non-residential construction, as shown by the national accounts today, we have chosen to invest in schools. - I am a bit amazed to get an interjection from a man whose proud track record in government was making sure people's pay could get cut - Work Choices written all over him, and I am still trying to get rid of his propaganda. It will come in handy for the Liberal Party in the next campaign, when they will be out there telling working families to take a pay cut, because that is what they believe in. Here is the member for Menzies back - tell us about Work Choices. - On the question of the Building the Education Revolution project that the member for Greenway has raised, can I give this commitment to the member for Greenway, and I will seek one in return: my commitment to her is that I will have this matter referred to the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Task Force for inquiry about value for money questions, and the commitment I seek from her in return is that she be honest with every school and every P&amp;C in her electorate about the cutbacks that will be visited upon them if she is re-elected as the member for Greenway and the Leader of the Opposition is elected as Prime Minister of this country. The people who vote in Greenway are entitled to know the member for Greenway stands for cutbacks to local schools.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. Certainty is very important for the future of the Australian economy, particularly with respect to longer term investment that will deliver more jobs and particularly with respect to ensuring that investment can produce higher economic growth in a low-inflation environment. Underneath those issues, there are critical questions of economic capacity that face Australia that the government, when in opposition, pointed to time after time and that the Reserve Bank pointed to time after time when the Howard government was failing to address them. These issues of course are issues of skill shortages and inadequate infrastructure, and therefore central to the Rudd government's economic strategy has been an obsessive focus on improving Australia's skills and improving our infrastructure.It is important to note that this is occurring at a number of levels, and one of those levels is through local communities. I want to draw the attention of the House to the impact of the position being taken by the opposition on these issues at a slightly more local level, in this case the electorate of Swan in Western Australia. The coalition proposes to abandon the trades training centres that the government is putting in place in schools all around the country, and that means that St Norbert College would lose $1.4 million for its trades training centre; Belmont City College, sharing with Canning College, would lose $3 million for its trades training centre; and Kent St Senior High School, sharing with Como Secondary College, would lose $3 million for its trades training centre. Schools in the electorate of Swan would also miss out on 710 computers for secondary students.The point about this is that these trades training centres and computers are all about providing school students with the early steps to developing the skills that will serve them and the Australian economy so well in the future. It is about giving people access to opportunity to develop skills at an early age so they can move on into the work force and earn good pay, do good jobs, and contribute high incomes for their families and high economic growth for Australia - and non-inflationary economic growth, because there is economic capacity to absorb higher investment.Now the attitude of the opposition on these things does not just extend to the vandalism of getting rid of these vital trades training centres and computers - critical facilities and 21st century tools for young people to learn skills in our schools. It also extends to improving roads in local communities, roads that are important infrastructure - both economic and social infrastructure. So in the electorate of Swan the Roads to Recovery program is now under threat because of the approach being taken by the shadow finance minister, the fifth shadow finance minister - 'Andrew the Fifth'. As a result of the approach being taken by the shadow finance minister on behalf of the coalition, the City of Belmont will lose $1.25 million; the City of Canning will lose $2.85 million; the City of Gosnells will lose $3.38 million; the City of South Perth, $970,000; the Shire of Kalamunda, $2.28 million; and the Town of Victoria Park, $871,000. All of these investments are about improving Australia's infrastructure and that means huge projects and it also means local projects. It means our local roads as well as our major freeways and highways, and it means our local schools as well as across-the-nation programs. This is simply economic vandalism by the coalition. It is vandalism of the highest order because these are critical parts of ensuring that the Australian community can enjoy long-term sustainable growth and prosperity for its future by investing now in the things that drive that prosperity: skills and infrastructure - the very things that when in office the coalition failed to invest in and therefore created big inflationary pressures. These are the things that the Rudd government is committed to investing in and these are the things that are critical to Australia, both at the local community level and at the national level.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the member for Sturt. The member for Sturt has stood in this place and sought to pretend that they are opposed to investment in the education revolution projects on the ground but out there - right across Australia - has sought to say the opposite. Well, member for Sturt, the truth is out. You cannot have it both ways: standing here in the parliament pretending that you are going to abolish a program, on the one hand, and going out there and saying that you are going to continue with the construction, on the other. - Now the Leader of the Opposition interjects and says they are not going to abolish the program. Well, I would be very interested to hear from the Leader of the Opposition what he will do with this program. What will he do with this program? -  - He will pay the money to the schools and cut out the public servants? - What else are you going to do? I heard it was sort of 'stop the funding, restructure it' and enable yourself to slip and slide through each of the seats represented by those opposite and have members pretend, on the one hand, that they are not opposed to an investment in their local school and, on the other hand, pretend here that they are in fact doing something exactly the reverse. The member for Sturt twists and turns on this matter. Watch his correspondence and look at his behaviour on the ground as one after another of those opposite have stood up in front of their public schools and said, 'We welcome this investment.' Mr Speaker, do you know something: those opposite, if they have any integrity on this question, need to actually list by name, by school in each one of their electorates which project they support and which they oppose, because there are many of these projects underway at present - 7,000 of them - and a large number would be in the electorates represented by those opposite. Which will you stop and which will you allow to continue? That is the core question which will be asked in each and every one of your electorates as this year progresses.But I make one further point to the member for Sturt in response to his question. If he bothered, as those opposite may have bothered, to listen to the exposition on the national accounts earlier today or read the reports associated with the national accounts, he would understand one thing: what has stood between Australia and going into recession is this government's stimulus strategy. What has stood between this country going into recession is this government's stimulus strategy. What has prevented 200,000 more people going out of work is this government's stimulus strategy. What has enabled tens of thousands of small businesses to continue to operate is this government's stimulus strategy. In each and every one of the regions represented in this place there are small business men, chalkies, subcontractors and the rest, all of whom -  - chippies and those who are responsible for the building industry -  -  - You said it about chalkies. And those who are in the classroom want the Building the Education Revolution as well. Those opposite pretend that the stimulus strategy has had no effect on the overall state of the Australian economy. -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Each and every one of the teacher representatives welcomes these school buildings. Each and every one of the building subcontractors welcomes these school buildings. They welcome new language centres. They welcome new science centres. They welcome also, on top of that, new state-of-the-art learning centres for primary schools. Each and every one of these is welcomed by local communities. But the Leader of the Opposition sits there and guffaws. He sits and guffaws because he knows nothing about economics; he has no interest in economics. He has been described by the previous Treasurer as being unfit to occupy any economic portfolio in the government, most particularly that of Treasurer. His colleagues in the previous cabinet said he could not be described remotely as a fiscal conservative, that he had one attitude to every proposal, which was to run to the office of the former Prime Minister and seek intervention.The Leader of the Opposition knows full well that, had we prosecuted his recipe, which was to implement the New Zealand solution for the Australian economy, this economy would have gone into recession, this economy would have seen the loss of hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs and those opposite know that full well. So the sanctimonious performance by those opposite as they stand here and pretend to be interested in macro-economic questions on debt and deficit and the impact of these investments in their schools is all one paper tissue of untruths and misrepresentations. Those opposite know the truth on the ground. They know that these investments are critical to the future of school communities.The member for Boothby then left the chamber. - This government defends the Building the Education Revolution program. It is the right program for the future and we stand by it 100 per cent.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her very timely and perceptive question. She is a member who is dedicated to her electorate and stands up for her electorate, unlike those opposite. I am sure she and her electorate are very, very glad that her electorate is benefiting from a $1.3 million trades training centre at the Redcliffe State High School - and we had the opportunity to have a look at that - and the benefiting of Clontarf Beach State High School. I am sure she is very pleased too that the students in her electorate are benefiting from 2,136 computers funded under the digital education revolution. I am sure she is very concerned that the Leader of the Opposition wants to prevent 851 computers being delivered to her electorate.It is apparent at this point in question time, and particularly as a result of the conduct of the opposition during the Prime Minister's last answer, that the Leader of the Opposition is so bored by economics - The member for Mayo then left the chamber. - so unable to deal with figures and economics that he seems not to understand that, when he instructed his shadow finance minister to rip money out of education, that meant cutbacks. He is in here rolling his eyes, going, 'Oh no, no cutbacks; none from me.' He does not even seem to understand that, when you instruct your shadow finance minister to cut back money from schools, it hurts and it hurts school communities. He does not even seem to get that.The fact that the Leader of the Opposition is so bored by economics - so uninterested in education that he just has not got a view about providing things to schools, having been a member of a government that neglected education for more than a decade - is to be expected. What is harder to explain is the compliant attitude of members of the opposition as their local communities get ripped off. I asked the member for Dunkley whether he would stand up for his electorate. The answer has been no. I asked the member for Bradfield whether he would stand up for his electorate and the answer has been no. - Let the record show that the member for Menzies obviously thinks the trades training centre in the member for Dunkley's electorate is a rip-off. We will make sure that every school student and school community member knows that is the view of the member for Menzies. Let us have a look and see if the member for Canning, who is gesturing so wildly, is a man -  -  - I am asked about threats to funding for schools. Let me direct the House's attention to the threats for funding to schools in the electorate of Canning. That would cause members to inquire: why isn't the member for Canning standing up for his local schools? Because when we look at the electorate of Canning and the things that are at risk as a result of the Leader of the Opposition's cutbacks, there is a $4.4 million trades training facility that is at risk. This is a facility that is a consortium between Boddington District High School, Armadale Christian college and others.Can I say to the House, because it is a convenient opportunity: the member for Sturt and the opposition consistently misrepresent the trades training centre program, pretending somehow that schools choosing to come together indicates there is a cutback in the program. Of course, that is completely untrue, completely phoney. This is a program running out exactly as promised. School principals, including those in the electorate of the member for Canning, have chosen to come together to get a bigger facility, to make a bigger difference to the kids - real skills for real jobs; $4.4 million - and the member for Canning will not stand up as the Leader of the Opposition rips that out of his electorate. At the next election voters in the electorate of Canning will have a choice to get a member who will stand up for their electorate.On the question of choice, there will also be a choice in the electorate of Sturt, because obviously the member for Sturt does not want his schools to benefit from the more than $93 million that they have had under Building the Education Revolution. I have been to the electorate of Sturt and to a local school there. Let me tell you: the member for Sturt is not there saying, 'I voted against this project.' The member for Sturt is not there saying, 'I consider all of this to be a waste.' The member for Sturt is not repeating his grabs on radio that this is about flushing money out the door to schools. That is not what he says there locally, of course. When he is there locally he does not criticise this funding to schools - $93 million in Building the Education Revolution money.But the member for Sturt will also be called to account by his local electorate as to why he supports the Leader of the Opposition's cuts to computers in schools. That means he is a shadow minister for education and a local member who wants to rip 112 computers away from Charles Campbell Secondary School. He wants to rip 143 computers away from Norwood Morialta High School. He wants to rip 69 computers away from St Ignatius College. This is what is under threat because of the Leader of the Opposition and the policies of the shadow minister for education and member for Sturt.Let us be absolutely clear: on this side of the House, we believe that schools are important; on this side of the House, we are proud to be delivering Building the Education Revolution, trade trading centres, the digital education revolution and money for teacher quality. The hunt on the other side of the House for a member prepared to stand up for their electorate will continue. We have not found one yet.</DOC>

 - In fact, this is such a matter of national importance to the opposition that their stated matter of public importance today is about the government's failure on people smuggling. Those opposite, frankly, speak again with two voices on these matters. The Leader of the Opposition, come the end of each sitting week, feels the need always to move a censure - and not just at the end of a sitting week; in fact, according to my numbers, every third day on average since he has been Leader of the Opposition there has been a censure, a suspension or some other parliamentary device in order for the Leader of the Opposition to assume the dispatch box. I also say in response -  -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The first thing I would say in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question is: this government will not be intimidated by any statements by any mining company anywhere. This government will not be intimidated by the statements of any mining company, foreign or domestic. This government does not stand here as the puppet of parts of the mining industry, as those opposite do; this government stands here to act in the national interest on behalf of all Australians. -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition's question also went to the impact on jobs. I find this remarkable from the Leader of the Opposition, who has resolutely opposed any form of stimulus in the economy, which has created 225,000 jobs in this economy. Had we followed the prescription of those opposite, we would have had 200,000 more people in Australia out of work. So, if the Leader of the Opposition wants to stand on his feet here and speak sanctimoniously about his concerns for jobs, I would ask him to reflect on his own party's record on the question of how we responded to the global economic recession. That is the second point.The third is this, and it goes to the particular statement put out by Xstrata this morning: it is passing strange that, when we have a new system which was announced just one month ago, we have 12 months to go before draft legislation and we are 24 months away from the start of a new system, a company of this nature would issue a statement of this type. Furthermore, in relation to the particular project at Wandoan, I add the following: under the proposed RSPT, first of all, such a project would have been eligible for a 40 per cent tax credit on its investment - that is the first point. The second is that coal royalties payable to the Queensland government would have been refunded. Furthermore, when it comes to the use of the tax credit, that becomes available to the company irrespective of whether it is generating a profit or not. This stands in stark contrast to the royalty system, which is a crude -  - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition seeks to interject again, I presume in the national interest. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition always interjects in this place, with enormous credibility! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, each time she opens her mouth, is in fact greeted with the shaking of heads on the part of all those behind her - and we know the reasons why. This set of taxation arrangements replaces a royalties regime which is a crude instrument applied only to, firstly, volume and, secondly, revenue.In response also to the question of the Leader of the Opposition, he should also pay attention to the fact that it is our understanding that there are a number of other existing issues impacting on this particular development, concerning the feasibility of rail access, port infrastructure and power supply. My understanding is that these issues have not been fully resolved.I conclude my answer to the Leader of the Opposition by saying this: we on this side of the House stand for the national interest; we do not stand here as the instruments of Clive Palmer or anybody else. I would say also to the Leader of the Opposition that Clive Palmer's intervention in this debate yesterday was to make the remarkable statement that the minerals in the ground do not belong to the Australian taxpayers. This is the individual, Clive Palmer, who is the major contributor to the Liberal National Party in Queensland; he is the major contributor to the conservative parties in Queensland. He seems to also dictate the policy position of those opposite - and he stands in this capital and says that these resources are not owned by the Australian people. That is wrong. Those opposite obviously believe that this Mr Palmer's position on this is right; we will stand for the national interest, not for the sectional interests of an individual mining company, foreign or domestic.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - The member for Franklin asks a question about the strength of the Australian national economy. The strength of the Australian national economy depends fundamentally on strong economic management in the national interest. But can I also say in terms of the strength of the government's economic performance that we have been underpinned by a resolute prosecution of the need to stimulate this economy during the global economic crisis.The national accounts yesterday demonstrated that we had a 0.5 per cent increase in growth in the March quarter. We see commentary also from others in the last 24 hours about the key role of stimulus to keeping the Australian economy afloat. Chris Caton from BT has said:_ that stimulus has kept the economy afloat.Scott Haslem, the chief economist of UBS, said yesterday:Traditionally economic growth has been split 80-20 between the private and public sector.Over the last year it was 60-40 in favour of the public sector as the private sector struggled.The bottom line is this: public sector stimulus was absolutely fundamental to keeping this economy out of recession. That is the bottom line. Notwithstanding that, many families and small businesses across this country are still doing it tough.The Liberal and National parties made the very wrong call on stimulus last year. They said that stimulus was not necessary. They said that stimulus should not occur. They said that stimulus has been misdirected. 
Opposition members - That's a lie! - I notice their interjections whereby they object to the accuracy of what I have just said. I would draw their attention to the following statement by the now Leader of the Opposition. First of all he said, and I refer to his comments from last year:_ all of the money that they are spending, it's not going to stop us going into a recession.Wrong. Second statement:It's not going to stop the recession being long and deep.Wrong.And I would argue that the recession will actually be worse in the long run because of the measures that they've taken.Wrong, wrong and wrong! So said the Leader of the Opposition. That was his prescription for economic policy.He then went on to say, 'One of the reasons why we have opposed the $42 billion cash splash is because it is not the right way to go about stimulating the Australian economy.' If you are not going to use money to stimulate the Australian economy, what are you going to use? Is the Leader of the Opposition suggesting that if you do not use money to stimulate the economy then you are going to use a rousing speech, some comforting words or perhaps a form of Viagra to keep the economy going? I would say that it is axiomatic: if you are going to stimulate the Australian economy, you invest finance to stimulate the economy.But those opposite recommended a different course of action. The Leader of the Opposition, who has no interest in economics, whom the former Treasurer Peter Costello said he would never appoint as a treasurer of Australia, has said that the one model we should have followed was that of New Zealand - five consecutive quarters of negative economic growth. The Liberals and Nationals were absolutely wrong on the response to the global economic crisis, and it is time they admitted it.Furthermore, there has been a debate in this place about the government school modernisation program. I would quote what the Macquarie Bank economist Ben Dinte has said specifically about this. On 2 June he said, 'Much of the 0.5 per cent expansion in the Australian economy in the first quarter of 2010 was the result of significant government spending on education building projects.' In other words: it is not just stimulus at large, it is also the investment of school projects in particular that has kept the Australian economy afloat.On the question of the school modernisation program, it is very important to listen to what those opposite have been saying on this. The Leader of the Opposition has said that he intends to slash the quantum of the investment in the school modernisation program. That is what he has said. He has been backed in that by the member for North Sydney, as the shadow Treasurer, to slash the quantum of the investment in the school modernisation program. But today we have another voice: the member for Sturt. The member for Sturt answered a question by saying, 'We believe the infrastructure spending in schools' - this is the member for Sturt, this is what he said - 'is wise and sensible, and we will keep the infrastructure spending in schools if we are elected in a couple of months.' Then he is asked this question by the journalist, 'In that quantum as well?' So says the member for Sturt, 'In that quantum, as we've said all along.' So we have the Leader of the Opposition saying that he is going to slash the quantum of investment in the Building the Education Revolution program, and now we have the member for Sturt saying they are going to keep the quantum of investment intact. What all this points to is once again that those opposite have been absolutely loose with the truth. The truth is, as articulated by the Leader of the Opposition, he is going to slash and burn the school modernisation program, and what the member for Sturt has tried to do is paper stack over that.The contrast between us on these questions is very, very basic. We stand for responsible economic investment; they stand in support of a strategy which would throw Australia into recession. We stand for supporting jobs through the recession; they stand for casting hundreds of thousands of people into unemployment. We stood for taking the measures necessary to keep the Australian economy and the retail sector afloat; they would have consigned hundreds of thousands of people across those sectors into unemployment. We stand for the Building the Education Revolution program; those opposite stand for slashing that program. We stand for returning this budget to surplus in three years time, three years ahead of time; those opposite refuse to nominate the date at which it will be returned.The purpose of keeping the economy strong is as follows: to deliver a fairer Australia for all Australians, and that means being able to deliver on three sets of tax cuts for working families, being able to deliver a new health and hospital system for working families, being able to deliver the biggest increase in the age pension for working families, being able to boost the investment in our nation's infrastructure and skills for the future of the economy. But fundamental to all of the above is of course tax reform, making sure we take our current strengths and reform the economy for the long term. That is what underpins the long-term economic strategy of this government.We believe, and argue passionately, that a profits based regime for the future taxation of the mining industry is essential. That is government policy. Interestingly, it is also the policy of the member for Wentworth. The member for Wentworth has re-entered the fray. Malcolm Turnbull says:The miners have been arguing for years that royalties should be levied as a share of profits as opposed to a percentage of gross revenues or volume of production -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker, because part of keeping the Australian economy strong lies in continued reform. That is why we are seeking to reform the economy and boost investment in skills, in infrastructure and in productivity, and also to prosecute a program of regulatory reform across the Australian economy. Part of that reform is tax reform, and part of tax reform is mining tax reform. That means a system which is based on profits, not volume, and profits, not production, as was confused by the Leader of the Opposition the other day, and as I notice the former Leader of the Opposition backs in his remarks today and the member for Goldstein backed the other day as a rational way to impose a tax regime on mining projects, as has occurred with the offshore regime since the introduction of the petroleum resource rent tax in the mid-1980s. We stand, therefore, for the continued reform of the Australian economy, to keep our economy strong. Those opposite, it seems, have one attitude to economic policy and that is it - simply to abandon the field and take up the sectional interests of elements of the mining industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. I note that the member for Maranoa often stands in this place and speaks of the infrastructure needs for his part of Queensland. I note that the member for Maranoa has stood in this place recently and demanded extra funding for road construction in his part of Queensland. I note that the member for Maranoa is in repeated correspondence with the minister for infrastructure and local government requesting investment by this government in the infrastructure needs of his community. What the member for Maranoa does not do is stand on his feet with integrity and ask this question of himself and the House: 'And how should such investment in infrastructure be funded in the future?' This government has taken measures in terms of its proposal for an RSPT to provide a delivery of infrastructure investment funding for regional Australia. The member for Maranoa is very good at standing up and posturing in this place about the infrastructure needs of his region but on the other hand providing no solutions in terms of delivery of investment back into his region and the source of revenue which should provide the basis for it.As to the honourable member's question about Xstrata, I refer to my answer earlier to the question asked of me about the company: firstly, the impact of the proposed RSPT on that company through the refund of the royalties that they would otherwise pay to the Queensland government; secondly, the 40 per cent tax credit which has been recommended as part of the proposal; and, thirdly, their ability to use that across the life of the project particularly in its early loss-making years. That is why, for example, editorials across many parts of the country and the world, including most recently in the Financial Times, have said that this in fact is a rational way in which to tax the resources industry of this country and in fact others abroad.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - I thank the member for Leichhardt for the question, because he appreciates this debate is far more complex than a simple debate about a profits based system for the mining industry of Australia. Our tax reforms are also, importantly, about broadening and strengthening the economy for the future. It is also a debate about those who are up for the hard reforms that are worthwhile in Australia's national interest, and those on the other side of the House who are not up for the debate.It is also about those who always put the special interests of particular groups ahead of the national interest and those who are prepared to take on the major reform for the long-term national interest of Australia. I say that because I actually think Australia is well-positioned to have this debate at the moment. I refer to the overall strength of the Australian economy. We all appreciate that the Leader of the Opposition gets up every morning hoping and praying that he gets a bad economic indicator. All I can say is that he has had yet another week of waiting. We as a community can handle the tough debates. Why shouldn't we take on the tough debate about taxation against the backdrop of yesterday's national accounts? Even though we appreciate that the Leader of the Opposition finds economics boring, I am sure his advisers at least brought the national accounts to his attention yesterday.Let's consider the nature of the national accounts and our capacity as a nation to actually front hard reform. The economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter and 2.7 per cent over the year. Perhaps more importantly, Australia was one of only two advanced economies to avoid recession during the global financial crisis. I also remind the House that the report of the national accounts yesterday very clearly stated - and we should never forget that the opposition leader opposed, every inch of the way, the economic stimulus package of our government - that the Australian economy would have gone into recession, contracted for three consecutive quarters, if we had not taken the decisive action that we did. It is in that context that the member for Leichhardt has appropriately raised the all-important question: how do we assist those local communities who are feeling the pressure of the infrastructure requirements out of the strength of the Australian economy and the importance of the resources sector? That is why this debate is broader than the debate about resources; it is also a debate about broadening and strengthening the Australian economy.I can feel a few visits coming on next week for the Leader of the Opposition. We will have the fluoro jacket and the hard hat, and I am sure he has already telephoned his close mate, Clive Palmer, and said, 'Mate, mate, mate, can I borrow your Mineralogy jet?' - the largest corporate jet in Australia - and there is no doubt that Clive will be on board and will also be talking about the next round of donations for the purposes of funding the forthcoming election.When it comes to pressures of infrastructure -  - It goes to the question of infrastructure and the pressure the resources sector is putting on local communities in Northern Queensland - the pressure on infrastructure, the pressure on the budget and the pressure on the daily lives of workers in these communities. Perhaps when the opposition leader is on the Mineralogy plane next week he could drop in to the seats of, for example, Leichhardt and Herbert and actually look first-hand at all the investment by the Australian government in key local infrastructure projects and the pressure it is putting on the Australian economy and the pressure it is putting on the budget. He could go, for example, to look at the $255 million being spent on the Bruce Highway from Sarina to Cairns; have a look at the port access road in Townsville, at $95 million; have a look at the Townsville ring road, at $79.5 million; have a look at the Douglas arterial duplication, at $55 million; have a look at the $150 million for the upgrade of the southern approach to Cairns along the Bruce Highway; and a range of other projects in North Queensland.That is why we are also working with, for example, the member for Kennedy, because we understand the importance of reliability on energy. We are working with him about how we upgrade the grid between Mount Isa and Townsville. We are confident that out of that process we will also get a key commitment to a growth in renewable energy opportunities in that particular area of Australia. This government, unlike the opposition, understands and appreciates the pressures on local Queensland communities because of the resources sector and the expectation of people in those local communities that the mining sector pulls its weight in terms of sharing the huge profit growth they have had out of the opportunities to develop Australia's national resources, which are 100 per cent owned by the Australian community.Compare that approach to the view of the opposition leader. Let's go to what he said yesterday at the Minerals Council lunch: 'The resources sector is paying a fair amount of tax.' That is contrary to what a range of resource companies are actually saying. They are actually conceding that there is room to pay more tax. He then spoke in opposition yet again to a profits based tax. I referred yesterday to the clear statements by the CEO of the Minerals Council of Australia that they themselves believe that we should be introducing a profits based system in Australia. I will tell you what all this is about: a desire by the Leader of the Opposition to create a class war in Australia. He spelt that out in his speech to the Minerals Council of Australia at lunchtime yesterday.The Australian government is going to continue this debate because this is a very important opportunity for us as a nation to put in place a modern tax system, not only of long-term benefit to the resources sector in Australia but, importantly, of long-term benefit to the Australian community. We are committed to getting the balance right between attracting investment in the resources sector and returning a fair benefit to the Australian community. That is why the proceeds of this debate will help the states provide the major infrastructure necessary to continue our economic growth in Australia.I appreciate why the Leader of the Opposition is standing up for special interests in the Australian community. I refer, for example to the donations of Mineralogy to the Liberal-National Party in 2008-09: $400,000 to the federal Liberal Party; the WA National Party, $110,000; the federal National Party, $50,000; the Liberal-National Party, $20,000. Then we go to the archangel of the coalition: a personal donation by Mr Clive Palmer of $280,000 to the Liberal-National Party. That was last year. - We all know what has been coming the opposition's way in recent weeks. They have got difficulties actually adding up the donations, because they have sold their soul yet again.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. -  - I thank those opposite for their interjections, in particular the member for Dickson. I would just like to inform him that his share price is up since he invested. At lunchtime today, BHP was up 2.5 per cent. -  - I thank the member for Groom for his question because it goes to the question of jobs. He asked specifically about jobs. - What I would say in response to the honourable member's question is that, on the question of jobs, this government's economic policy -  -  - has created 225,000 jobs while practically every advanced economy in the rest of the world has been shedding jobs. If you look right across Australia and at the employment performance of the Australian economy over that period of time, we have seen jobs added when they have been lost in so many other parts of the world. A large number of jobs in international tourism, for example, have also been affected by the impact of the global economic crisis. Take, for example, Far North Queensland - the member comes from Queensland: the unemployment rate in Far North Queensland is currently in the vicinity of 12 per cent. One of the factors associated with that is the competitiveness in Far North Queensland of tourism businesses affected by a high Australian dollar. In response to those sorts of factors, what governments can do is to bring down the overall company tax rate for companies competing internationally. - The member's question goes to jobs. He asked specifically about jobs in one part of Australia and in one industry. My response goes also to the fact that employment across Australia is generated by many factors, not least of which has been the government's investment in stimulus for the last year and a half. As a consequence of those measures, we have added in the vicinity of a quarter of a million jobs in this country while we have seen jobs being lost right across the rest of the world.Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition interjected before that in fact he had never argued that stimulus was not necessary. I believe I have got his interjection correctly. He said before in an interjection that stimulus was not necessary. I also draw the attention of the House to what the Leader of the Opposition has actually said on this subject. The Leader of the Opposition, who is carefully avoiding the attention of the debate at this moment, said the following:_ the economic stimulus wasn't necessary to strengthen Australia's economy at a time of global recession.That is what -  - I beg your pardon? The Leader of the Opposition continues to say that he did not argue that the stimulus was not necessary. On 30 March 2010, he said:_ the economic stimulus wasn't necessary to strengthen Australia's economy at a time of global recession.'Was not' he said -  - In practice the word has been frequently accepted by the Chair as meaning relevant in some way or relevant in part, rather than directly or completely relevant.It might be a matter that the procedures committee could address in the next parliament or the parliament after. - The member for Groom's question goes to jobs - what generates jobs and what protects jobs - and I am responding to that both for the economy in general and for regions in particular. We have argued in this place that continued positive growth in the economy and in employment has occurred on the basis of stimulus through the course of the global financial crisis. The reason I am engaging in this debate is that the Leader of the Opposition has interjected across the chamber repeatedly that his position has never been one of opposition to stimulus. That is untruthful. That is fundamentally untruthful. The Leader of the Opposition has a very deep problem with telling the truth in this chamber. The Leader of the Opposition said that the economic stimulus was not necessary to strengthen Australia's economy at a time of global recession.We might well ask: was that just said, or was it written down? Guess what? It was written in a speech. Therefore, it is the full gospel truth. It was a considered, scripted, written speech in which he says that the economic stimulus was not necessary to strengthen Australia's economy at a time of global recession. Not only was that wrong in terms of economics but also he has been untruthful today in pretending he never said it. He did say it. That is their position, and it has been consistently. - We stand for policies which support employment. Those opposite stand for policies which destroy employment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. I acknowledge his very important work towards improving community infrastructure in south-west Sydney, such as the upgrade of the F5, the refurbishment of the Campbelltown stadium, the cancer centre at Liverpool Hospital and, significantly, the development of the autism-specific centre at Liverpool. I remember well doorknocking with the member for Werriwa in his electorate several years ago and meeting Julie Darmer - somebody who has been very active in the area of autism. I commend the member for Werriwa for his work.The national accounts that were released yesterday represent another solid outcome for Australia's economy, which continues to be amongst the best in the world at a time of great economic stress. The Australian economy grew by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter of this year and by 2.7 per cent over the year. That outcome was strongly supported by continued public investment, which rose 12½ per cent in the quarter to be more than 40 per cent up over the year. This contributed 0.8 per cent to GDP growth. About half of that is attributable to the government's stimulus strategy. The stimulus is gradually being withdrawn as the economy returns to something approximating normal growth. Nonetheless, it is still playing a very significant role in supporting jobs. Infrastructure projects are continuing to plug the gap in private building activity, which has been substantial, while stimulus payments to households and tax breaks to businesses have in effect flowed through the economy. There is very clear evidence in the national account figures released yesterday of the critical ongoing importance of the government's stimulus strategy in sustaining reasonable economic growth at a time of global economic challenge and sustaining jobs.The Prime Minister has drawn attention to the statement on 30 March by the Leader of the Opposition. I will repeat it again, just so that people realise the true nature of the position taken by the Leader of the Opposition:The economic stimulus wasn't necessary to strengthen Australia's economy at a time of global recession.This was in a speech amazingly entitled 'Economic fundamentals'. Anybody who is not bored by economics - anybody who is not innumerate, as the Leader of the Opposition was once described by the former Treasurer, Mr Costello - would read the national accountants and see just how critical the government's stimulus strategy has been. But it is not just the government that sees this as the outcome of the national accounts figures. In fact, the man who I presume the Leader of the Opposition will be enthusiastically arguing to be Victorian Treasurer at the Victorian election, due in a matter of months, shares the national government's view. I quote the Victorian shadow treasurer, Kim Wells, in a statement today, referring to the Victorian figures in the national accounts:The result would have been far worse had it not been for solid consumer and government spending in the quarter, generated by the continued effects of government stimulus payments and programs funded from Canberra.That is the Victorian Liberal shadow treasurer, who I assume the Leader of the Opposition will be saying is the right person to be managing finances of the state of Victoria come the Victorian election later in the year.The member for Werriwa asked me about the issues of stimulus and local infrastructure projects in south-west Sydney. I want to refer to the seat of Macarthur and just indicate to the people of south-west Sydney and particularly the people in the seat Macarthur what they stand to lose not just in macroeconomic activity but in local infrastructure if the opposition is elected to govern Australia. It will be $1½ million for three black spots projects, $1½ million for three local councils for 25 community infrastructure projects, $48.7 million for 212 social houses, $206,000 for repairs and maintenance in social housing and, under the Building the Education Revolution program, $114 million for 141 projects at 59 schools. These are the things that are helping to keep people in jobs in the seat of Macarthur in south-west Sydney and all around Australia, helping to keep growth positive at a time of great economic tribulation internationally and delivering important new facilities for the people of south-west Sydney. These are the projects that the opposition is committed to eliminating. If ever you wanted an illustration of the economic illiteracy, the vandalism and the complete lack of concern for the jobs of working people, this issue tells you all you need to know.The Leader of the Opposition and the member for North Sydney stand for depression era economics when the government sat back and did nothing and hundreds of thousands of people were thrown on the scrap heap. That is their position. The government stands to protect jobs, to support jobs, by investing in infrastructure at a time when the private sector is retreating, and that is being shown in the national accounts. Australia's economy continues to grow and employment remains reasonably strong because of the efforts of this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Stirling for his question. I would say to him that, a little like the question earlier from the Leader of the Opposition, for those opposite to now have an interest in (a) jobs and (b) workers rights is very interesting indeed. Firstly, on the question of jobs, I would say to the member for Stirling he should have a long, long hard look at the impact of the government's stimulus strategy on employment in the state of Western Australia. Look at the impact of investments that we are making in the infrastructure of Western Australia in the Ord, prospectively at Oakajee, in the middle of Perth - hospital constructions as well as road constructions, notwithstanding the investment in social housing. There are investments also in the Building the Education Revolution program in Western Australia and the community infrastructure program in Western Australia. These are core contributors to jobs growth in the state of Western Australia. If he looked at the breakdown of the state accounts, and the contributing elements to gross state product within his state, he would reach the same conclusion. - The member's question went to both jobs and workers entitlements. On the question of jobs, my response to him, being a member from the west, was along the lines I have just described. Those comments equally apply to the impact of the government's measures on stimulus payments in the state of Queensland. I suggest that he also looks at the impact through the most recently released gross state product figures for Queensland and other states to conclude where the actual contribution lies from federal government stimulus investments. The Minister for Finance and Deregulation has just referred to that in the case of the state of Victoria and made appropriate reference to statements recently by the Liberal shadow Treasurer of Victoria to that effect.Secondly, on the question of workers' entitlements, I would say this to the member for Stirling, as he cries crocodile tears about workers entitlements and workers rights: workers entitlements and workers rights are infinitely better as a result of this government's change to the laws than existed under the government of which he was part. We had also under this government, through the abolition of Work Choices, made sure that basic conditions for working people and working families were protected, not destroyed - not least of which was protection from unfair dismissal.Those opposite stand for the repeal of the government's protections against unfair dismissal. We stand for the protection of workers from unfair dismissal and we also apply the standard support measures for any worker in this economy who finds themselves unemployed for whatever reasons. This government's policies in support of jobs and in support of measures relating to the conditions of workers and, on top of that, protection from unfair dismissal exists in a legion above and beyond anything ever considered or supported by those opposite when they occupied the Treasury bench.</DOC>

 - I thank for member for her question. I know that the member for Chisholm is very focused on the question of quality education and quality schools in her electorate and that she is aware, as are many people around the country, of the impact of our Teach for Australia program. This program already has 45 of the best and brightest graduates who have undergone a training program teaching in disadvantaged schools around the country, most particularly in Victoria. It is a great quality program. I know that this program is under threat and I know the member who asked me the question is concerned about these threats. The threat arises because the Leader of the Opposition has said that, if he is elected, he will cut the money allocated to the national partnership program that supports Teach for Australia. This has been welcomed by principals, by people who care about education right around the country with words like, 'I feel like I have won the lottery to have one of these high quality graduates in my school.'I know that the member for Chisholm out in Melbourne's east has been involved in some community discussions about this question. I know that that community discussion is also continuing in the electorate of Aston. My attention has been drawn to the flyer of the Liberal candidate for Aston, Alan Tudge. I had a good look at it. I was a little bit intrigued when it said that, among his various claims to fame, he had worked at a national level formulating initiatives to give school communities more funding and control. That is interesting. Why is the name Alan Tudge familiar? Then it occurred to me -  - I was asked about threats to the Teach for Australia program. I know the name Alan Tudge because he is on the Teach for Australia Board; that is how I know that name. This is the very program that the Leader of the Opposition is a risk to.I am a person who looks to research things in depth, so I did not stop there with the community flyer. I have managed to obtain the Liberal Party of Australia application for preselection endorsement by Alan Tudge. There is interesting reading on the question of education. I will not be tabling it, because it contains personal details. But I will be making extracts available for all. -  - I am reminded of the great Gareth Evans statement about the member for Mackellar. - With that short reminder, I will move on to the preselection application, which deals with the Teach for Australia program about which I have been asked. Alan Tudge, the candidate for Aston, basically claims -  - On Teach for Australia, in this application Mr Tudge tells us all about his involvement and how valuable it is - the very program that the Leader of the Opposition wants to cut the money from. That shows how erratic that they are and shows how little that they care about school eduction.This preselection election campaign talks about Mr Tudge's claims to fame. It says: 'I helped develop the popular Investing in Our Schools Program, which was both practical policy and great assistance to coalition members in their individual seats and their local campaigns.' When we on this side of the House invest money in schools, we do it for the benefit of schools, not for the political benefit of coalition members. If you ever need to know the difference between this side of the House and that side of the House when it comes to education, have a look at this document. We are about benefiting schools. Mr Tudge and everyone sitting there are about cutting the money that goes to schools. As revealed by the Leader of the Opposition, they are going to cut the Building the Education Revolution, trades training centres, computers in schools and now this teaching quality money as well - those are the things that the opposition threaten with their budget cuts. Maybe the Leader of the Opposition should talk to Mr Tudge about the benefits of Teach for Australia. But we know that the Leader of the Opposition is a risk to local schools right around the country.</DOC>

 - As I said when asked about this by the media earlier today, as far as Sir Rod's comment goes on the question of consultation we welcome any commentary from those outside who want to see a good outcome to the negotiations currently underway between the government and the mining industry. Therefore, within that spirit I welcome Sir Rod's comments on the question of consultation. I note however, that this question was asked by the Leader of the National Party and I note that he is not actually bringing into the frame the leading pin-up boy of the National Party in Queensland, Clive Palmer.I know Clive was in town yesterday. It is hard to miss Clive - not just his jet but Clive himself - when he is in town. He made some interesting comments last night, I think. His description, which I presume reflects the position of those opposite, was that once there was Marx, then there was Engels and now there is Rudd. Marx, Engels and Rudd - so there is a communist conspiracy underway. But what I find confounding is this: the Clive Palmer who bankrolls the Liberal and National Party in Queensland seems to make a powerful amount of money from Chairman Mao's China.I say to those opposite that when they seek to invoke the names of various commentators in the debate on the future of the super profits tax it is very instructive to reflect on, firstly, who bankrolls the Liberal and National parties? Clive Palmer. Secondly, who stands up, therefore, and says that these resources are not owned by the Australian people? Clive Palmer. And thirdly, therefore, are those opposite acting in the national interest in their participation in this debate or acting simply as emissaries of various branches of the mining industry? On the question of employment which was raised -  - Elegantly summarised, Mr Speaker, because -  - I will not be listening to Clive Palmer. I do not think anyone on this side of the House will be listening to Clive Palmer, but I know those opposite will be listening to Clive Palmer because he bankrolls those members opposite in terms of their political parties - $800,000 contributed to the LNP last year alone.On the question of consultation, the government is engaged in a process with the mining industry. That will continue. This is a tough negotiation process but we in the government are up for an exercise of national economic reform. Those opposite are simply acting as emissaries on the part of a mining industry, which the Leader of the Opposition says pays too much tax already. The government's view is this: this tax reform is necessary to deliver better super for working families. It is necessary to bring down the company tax rate for all Australian companies. It is necessary to bring about a tax break for Australian small business and it is necessary, also, to fund the future infrastructure needs of Australia. That is why the government is committed to fundamental tax reform and that is why those opposite are acting purely as the mouthpieces of Clive Palmer as they engage in this debate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I also note that there are 46,000 working Australians in his electorate who stand to benefit from our reforms to superannuation. Perhaps it is unsurprising that there are so many people in the electorate of the member for Deakin who will have their retirement incomes boosted by our reforms, because there are 8.4 million Australians across the country who will benefit from our reforms, and there are 3.5 million low-income Australians who will benefit from having their contributions tax given back to them under this government, each of whom stands to lose those benefits if the Leader of the Opposition gets his way.At the moment, the average lump sum of somebody aged between 60 and 65 is $245,000 for men and $170,000 for women. By 2035, as a result of more people being under compulsory superannuation for longer as a result of our reforms, that will increase to $485,000 for men and $345,000 for women. Of course women stand to get a greater proportion of the benefit because females have lower incomes and our reforms are very much targeted at those who need to put more money aside for their retirement: people on lower incomes. The simple fact is that nine per cent of salary and wages is not enough for a comfortable and dignified retirement in Australia. It is a very good start - a start for which we can thank previous Labor governments. It was something that the opposition opposed all the way and something that they continued to oppose all through the years of the Howard government. They opposed giving Australians a more comfortable and dignified retirement.The member for Deakin asked me about the impact on outer eastern Melbourne. As I said, the member for Deakin can report to 46,000 of his constituents that they will be better off because of this government's reforms. But the member for La Trobe, who rejoins us in the chamber, will have a much harder task, because he will have to report to 52,000 of his constituents that they will miss out on a greater retirement income because of his opposition to our superannuation reforms. He will need to report to 17,000 of his constituents aged over 50, who potentially could benefit from our improved catch-up payments for superannuation, that he stands against them getting a more comfortable and dignified retirement.These are people who do not have a private jet with which to fly to Canberra to make their case at the National Press Club. They rely on us to make it for them. At least a little more than half of the people in this chamber are standing up for people to get a better retirement income. A little fewer than half are more interested in defending mining companies than interested in boosting the retirement incomes of Australians. They are lions on behalf of Clive Palmer; they are mice on behalf of working families. They have not a word in response - not a word in defence of the retirement incomes of Australians. So we look forward to the member for La Trobe's next newsletter. He will be explaining to 52,000 of his constituents why he opposes them getting a better retirement income. He could make it a bumper edition. He could explain why he opposes the trade training school at Boronia Heights. He could explain why he opposes the GP superclinic at Berwick. It could be a bumper edition. He would have to rely on all his eloquence to do it, but I am sure he could do it.It is time the Leader of the Opposition gave working families a break. It is time he gave them a tax break for saving through their superannuation. If you asked the shadow minister for superannuation what he thinks about superannuation all he will tell you is what mining companies think. But this is about much more than the shadow minister for superannuation not being up to the job. It is about the Leader of the Opposition thinking superannuation is a con job. He told this House it was a con job. It is about an opposition more interested in boosting their donations from mining companies than boosting the retirement incomes of Australians. That is what this is about. It is time the Leader of the Opposition -  - I thank the member for Boothby for pointing out that all Australians stand to lose from the opposition opposing our proposals.Most importantly, this is about working families and working Australians looking forlornly at the Leader of the Opposition, who simply does not care about giving them a more dignified retirement. - He simply does not care about superannuation -  - simply does not care about retirement incomes and simply does not care about them.</DOC>

 - I say to the member for North Sydney that he should spend some time reading the Treasury's analysis through the independent modelling contained in the Econtech report on the impact of (a) the overall growth in the mining industry and (b) employment in the mining industry. As far as employment in the mining industry is concerned, Econtech's independent analysis says the implementation of these reforms will result over time in a 7.7 per cent increase in employment in the mining industry.Furthermore, the member for North Sydney goes to comments from third parties. Can I draw his attention also to the comment of the former head of the Minerals Council, David Buckingham, who said that reactions to the mining tax proposal to the government have, quite frankly, been 'hysterical' and:Apoplectic responses of that kind simply don't help the cause in any realistic way.Furthermore, I draw his attention to a former Liberal Treasury spokesman and a former Liberal leader in this place, John Hewson, who has also come out in his attacks on the scare campaign which has been launched against the government's RSPT. I draw the member's attention also to the support for the government's proposals being delivered by the former leader of the Liberal Party in New South Wales, John Brogden. I draw his attention to the statement by -  -  - Those opposite seem to laugh at that, as if Mr Brogden does not have a proper place in the public debate. We think he does. - The member for North Sydney's question went specifically to the impact of the government's measures on the growth of the mining industry and on employment in the mining industry. I sought to answer both those things by reference to the government's modelling contained in the Econtech government report. The member for North Sydney simply leapt to the dispatch box in order to make a separate political point himself. Mind you, I say that it is pretty interesting in this debate that the Leader of the Opposition seems to be rationed to one question a day these days. Perhaps that is because there has been some concern on the part of the member for Sturt about the, shall I say, demeanour of the Leader of the Opposition in this place.Can I say in response to member for North Sydney's question, given that he does ask all the questions on the economy - as the Leader of the Opposition seems to have been banned from asking any questions on the economy, because the Leader of the Opposition is bored by questions on the economy and is regarded by the former Treasurer as being innumerate on questions of the economy - that there are multiple third parties in this debate, many of whom have supported the government's RSPT proposal. Many of them have contributed to Australian newspapers in recent times. Many of those views have been reflected in international journals as well. I would draw again the member for North Sydney's attention to the editorial contained in the Financial Times only earlier this week. It said specifically:The charge that it turns Australia into the 'number one sovereign risk issue', made by Tom Albanese, chief executive of Rio Tinto, is absurd.Furthermore, the Financial Times said:It will be a long-overdue update of the medieval practice of levying royalties on gross production. Being regressive, royalties squeeze marginal producers while letting those with the most abundant mines keep the largest share of their loot.I draw his attention to that editorial. Editorials in the Financial Times are not written lightly. They are written on the basis of a considered analysis of all the contending views and all the contending analyses. What those opposite are doing at the moment is what they always do: engage in a fear campaign - a fear campaign on the resources tax, a fear campaign on the emissions trading scheme, a fear campaign on asylum seekers. All they actually do in the public policy debate is engage in a fear campaign, because that is what the Leader of the Opposition is an expert at doing.We always hear opposition from the Leader of the Opposition; we never hear him propose anything. We hear negativity all the time, never positivity. We hear him stand opposed to everything the government puts forward. We never hear him propose anything, except one thing and that was his own great big new tax on everything. Having gone onto the Neil Mitchell show and sworn hand on heart that there will be no new taxes under the Liberal Party which he led, what did he do one month later: he jacked up the tax two per cent on all companies in the country with a turnover in excess of $5 million.Can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition: on the question of the economy and why I presume he has been sin-binned by the member for North Sydney and the member for Sturt from asking any questions on the economy, he would be very well advised to go back to Fundamentals 101 and revisit his earlier statement that this economy could somehow survive the absence of stimulus over the last 18 months. The illiteracy of the Leader of the Opposition on questions of the economy becomes more apparent day by day not just in this place but right across the country, as he simply does not know how to add up.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, because he understands that long-term planning and consistency is absolutely crucial when it comes to delivering infrastructure into regional Australia. But, of course, we know that consistency is not the coalition's forte. They say one thing here in the parliament and something completely different in their electorates. Just one week after the budget, on 20 May, the member for Hinkler wrote a letter to the editor of the Isis Town &amp; Country newspaper. He said this:Labor has betrayed local motorists by ignoring the urgently needed Isis River Bridge upgrade in its Budget.Wrong! The May budget delivered another $15 million to start the construction on this important bridge this year, money brought forward this year, jobs in Hinkler this year - something that could not be achieved by that other mob in their 12 years of government. The member for Hinkler also said -  
An opposition member - At least you put the people of Hinkler on notice. - This is after we provided the funding, you nong - a week after the budget. - I withdraw. In the Isis Town &amp; Country newspaper he also said:I have put the Government on notice - this is one week after we provided the funds - that I expect to see funds brought forward to have the job done _I will be in Hinkler tomorrow and I put the opposition on notice: is this project on your secret infrastructure hit list? The shadow minister for finance, in a letter to another local paper, said 'There are still many projects worth billions of dollars in the Rudd government budget which have not started' and he would not commit to supporting any of those projects that are in the Nation Building Program. He has made it very clear, and he confirms it today, that if construction has not started it will be on the hit list. Maybe the $250 million Bruce Highway safety package will be on the hit list.We know that the Roads to Recovery program for every local government in Australia is on the hit list, because he has told the Colac Herald and the Geelong Advertiser. So Bundaberg Regional Council, $7 million gone; Fraser Coast Regional Council, $6 million gone; North Burnett Regional Council, $7 million gone - and we know that there will be other critical infrastructure cut in Hinkler as well; 841 computers in schools, gone; and over $112 million for 58 schools, gone. We know that over $70 million of the 283 new social housing dwellings will be gone and we know that the trade training centre which is proposed to be built at Bundaberg State High School at a cost of $11 million will be gone. You have got to come clean and be fair dinkum with the Australian people. You cannot tell the electorate that you are fighting for more money for them and come here and be part of a show that is about making all these cuts.The member for Maranoa raised a question earlier on today and it went to the issue of infrastructure and employment in Queensland. The member for Maranoa is quoted in the Toowoomba Chronicle. He wants another $500 million in funding for the Warrego highway. He said:On advice given to me by Main Roads Queensland, $500 million is needed for a full upgrade and I am calling on the Rudd government to commit this funding as a contribution to the state Government's infrastructure plan for Surat Coal Basin.He goes on to say: 'With critical time lines now in place for local road, rail, airport and housing infrastructure, the Rudd Government' must deliver this. He has given up on his side! He has given up. I say to the member for Maranoa: part of our RSPT proposals is about providing a fund for infrastructure in regional areas. That is what it is about. So you should be voting for it, and I look forward to the member for Maranoa's support on the RSPT.</DOC>

 - Wonders never cease! It has taken three years to get a question on trade and what do we get? We get a question on consultation. It matters to have a decent memory in this place. I remember back in 1999, as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, when there was supposed consultation between the then government and us in relation to new taxes. The Labor Party of the day gave its full support to a revenue-neutral outcome in terms of taxation, a letter and an agreement that was signed off by the Treasurer of the day, Peter Costello - and an agreement that was never honoured. So do not come in here and talk to us about consultation. The key question for you is: do you honour your commitments? -  - It has taken three years to get a question. I am entitled to give it a preamble. - I am enthusiastic about trade but they are not, Mr Speaker. They never ask a question about it. If they are interested in the impact of trade in relation to this tax, I can tell them the conversations I have had in Japan and China recently are ones that are very supportive of the direction of this tax because it will increase the supply side of the equation, get a better match between the demand for our resources and our ability to more efficiently produce it. What we are doing is introducing a tax that takes out the disincentives that currently exist - disincentives that relate to the requirement to pay royalties before any profit is turned. This tax that we are introducing will effectively eliminate those royalties upfront. - As for consultation, of course I was consulted. We operate as an effective cabinet, not a rabble like you are over there. The only person in this parliament it would seem who does not believe we need reform in the mining industry is that person sitting over there, the Leader of the Opposition. For him there would be no change; for us, we want to make this industry more efficient, more competitive, and the proposals that we have put forward are going to do that. Not only will we continue to have those discussions amongst ourselves; we will continue to have them with the industry to achieve a sensible outcome for the future of this country. The sooner you get on board and support that direction, the better for this country.</DOC>

 - It is good to hear the Minister for Trade in fine form today. The member for Flynn asks a question concerning the importance of dealing with economic reform and the importance of its impact on the region that he represents. The government is committed to keeping the economy strong and to delivering a fairer share for all working families. That is why, when the nation was threatened with the global financial crisis, we did what we had to do to keep Australia out of recession. That is why we are committed to bringing the budget back to surplus in three years time, three years ahead of time. That is why, as of 1 July, the government will deliver its third set of tax cuts for working families. For someone who is on about $50,000 a year, that represents a tax cut of nearly 20 per cent. Keeping the economy strong has also enabled us to increase our investment in the hospital system of Australia by 50 per cent and to increase our investment in infrastructure, including the installation of a national broadband network. Also, on this day and in this sitting fortnight the government, as a result of keeping the economy strong, will deliver Australia's first paid parental leave scheme - an important reform for the nation. So we have 12 years of inaction on the part of those opposite, and the scheme is brought in by this government in its first term in office.The government has continued to do the job that we began to keep the economy strong and to deliver a fairer share for working families. That is reflected in what we saw in the labour force data which came out only last week. This is worth emphasising. Unemployment in this country is 5.2 per cent. Furthermore, employment has grown by 2.6 per cent through the year to May 2010. This is the ninth consecutive rise in the number of people engaged in full-time employment. If we compare that with the unemployment data we have seen from around the world, it is galvanising. There is 5.2 per cent unemployment in Australia. In the United States it is now up to 9.9 per cent; France, 9.9 per cent; Canada, 8.1 per cent; and the UK, eight per cent. But actually look at the numbers of people who are losing jobs and gaining employment. In the US, nearly six million people have lost their jobs. In Canada, nearly 100,000 people have lost their jobs. In the UK, more than half a million people have lost their jobs. In the euro area, 3½ million people have lost their jobs. In Australia, we have added 255,000 more jobs during the period of this crisis.Part of keeping the economy strong means also delivering on long-term economic reform. That is where tax reform comes in as well - boosting Australia's global competitiveness by ensuring that we are bringing our company tax rate down; boosting also Australia's level of national savings by some $85 billion over the decade ahead, an important buffer for the future against future external shocks; boosting also superannuation for working families, and for a 30-year-old now there is a $108,000 difference for the future; and boosting also investment in infrastructure, funding the rail, road and ports needed by our resource sector and those communities that support it. It is interesting to see where this tax reform debate has got to. We on this side of the House support tax reform in the mining industry and for the country at large. We support it, but also the principle of tax reform based on profits as opposed to production is now embraced by the government, by the Minerals Council of Australia and by most of the major miners - they believe that reform is necessary for the sector. There is just one person who opposes that, and that is the Leader of the Opposition, who says that no reform is necessary, that a production based tax through royalties should be retained and that the mining companies are paying too much tax. The whole country says we need reform for the mining industry tax arrangements based on profit, not on production. The Leader of the Opposition says no.This brings me to the electorate of Flynn and the impact of what we are proposing for future infrastructure investments. Each time I have been to the honourable member's electorate I have been presented with one request after another by the Gladstone Regional Council of their needs. Those opposite, if they have been to Gladstone, would have noticed one thing: you see an array of ships out there waiting to be loaded at harbour. I notice that those opposite raise questions about this and they find it amusing. When you look at export dollars for Australia being lost from a failure to invest in infrastructure, that is no laughing matter. It means we have to make a difference. When I was in Gladstone most recently with the member for Flynn, the Gladstone Regional Council then were embracing the needs of the region and discussing how to support the future housing requirements, transport needs and roads construction for the big expansion of its local population coming off the back of the mining sector and that broader community.The bottom line is this: the region in Central Queensland faces a desperate need for infrastructure and it therefore needs greater investment in infrastructure. That is why the government has brought forward a regional infrastructure fund which is designed to deliver better infrastructure for the people of Gladstone, for the people of Mackay, for the people of Karratha, for the people of Kalgoorlie and for those communities which support our mining industries. That is what the regions of Australia are crying out for.There has been a lot of speculation over the processes concerning tax reform. I wish to inform the House that, as of the week that has just gone past, consultation and negotiation continue with our major mining companies. Some of those companies are a long way down the path towards agreement; others are still some distance away. This is a tough debate from which the government does not retreat because it is a necessary part of long-term economic reform. - It is pretty interesting when you think about the needs for infrastructure, because the good old Leader of the National Party was out there the other day on this question as well. When fronted on it in Wide Bay, he had this to say:A great deal of our nation's wealth that's helped see us through the global economic downturn has actually come from the regions and I think there ought to be a compact with the regions under which the government guarantees a fair return, a fair share of our nation's growth and prosperity in the wealth of the regions so that we can provide proper services and facilities.Does it sound familiar? Does it sound familiar to those who have been observing this debate? Of course our regions need greater investment. We on this side of the House have provided a basis by which that investment can be undertaken for the future. The bottom line is this: if you are going to keep our economy strong for the future, you have got to prosecute continued economic reform. If you are going to deliver a fairer share for working families, better super, tax cuts and tax breaks also for small business, you have got to get on with the business of economic reform. That is what the government is determined to do. We have a plan for reform to keep our economy strong and to deliver a fairer share for working families. I do not see any form of alternative.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Higgins for the question. I start by saying that thinking about a profits based tax is not new to this government. I remind the member for Higgins it is something the industry has desired for a long time. It is something that her previous employer, the then Treasurer and her predecessor the former member for Higgins, failed to front up to. I say that because tax reform has never come to Australia. Government's capacity to deliver on tax reform requires strength of leadership. It is in that context I also remind the House that the findings and recommendations of the Henry tax review were not thought about in terms of the public debate.The consultation process, including with individual companies and the Minerals Council of Australia, went on for almost two years. I am sure the member for Higgins, like me, also read the musings of the Secretary of Treasury in a number of speeches he made about the potential concepts that might be embraced and the development of a minerals tax proposal with respect to putting in place a profits based tax system in Australia, something that industry long campaigned for. I simply say that these issues were also raised with me on a number of occasions by industry in the lead-up to the Henry tax review. My problem was that given my knowledge -  -  - Yes, it is very broad ranging. It is about tax reform and the capacity of the opposition to actually deliver any decent policy outcome. I remind the House that we will deliver a profits based tax system in Australia, something that the minerals industry accepts. I also remind the House that the minerals industry basically accepts that it should be paying more taxation in Australia.I simply say, from the government's point of view, that I was involved in cabinet processes, as I should be, and in doing so I was not in a position prior to the release of the Henry tax report to have serious consultations and discussions about the content - not until it was publicly released and not until after the government brought forward its response to the report. So, having talked about the concepts with industry prior to its release, I simply say: I am now involved in detailed consultations about its implementation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question. Indeed, the Regional Infrastructure Fund, which has been announced as part of the government's tax reform proposals, will ensure that the government can deliver the infrastructure that Australia needs. Without this investment in infrastructure, we know that the constraints will continue. We know that there were major constraints on our export capacity during the previous mining boom. We know because the Reserve Bank warned on 20 separate occasions about skills and infrastructure constraining growth in our economy. The Regional Infrastructure Fund is aimed at promoting development and jobs in mining communities, supporting our resource and export capacity, and tackling those capacity constraints. Importantly, this fund will also ensure that communities, such as those based around Mackay, get a fair share.We know that, at the moment, if anything symbolises the failure of the connection between infrastructure and our resource growth, it is the fact that many working Australians travel over 4,000 kilometres to get to work. If people think that that is good economically, if people think that that is good in terms of efficiency or, more importantly perhaps, if people think that that has good social outcomes, then they indeed have rocks in their head that should be mined! Because we know that these constraints are simply unacceptable. And you do not have to take the government's position on that; the Minerals Council warned that the private sector cannot invest and grow when they said:_ too often governments in the past have abrogated their responsibility to local communities and thus constrained the investment that private sector has wanted to make.They used one example, that of the Hunter Valley. The Minerals Council have calculated that Australia lost some $2 billion in revenue due to the failure to have the appropriate rail and port infrastructure in place - $2 billion over just a five-year period.Some, of course, do not agree with the Minerals Council, and one of those is the Leader of the Opposition, who last week, in response to the announcement about the Regional Infrastructure Fund, stated that it was the job of the private sector to do this infrastructure development. Of course, much of this infrastructure development does not relate directly to the profits of individual companies, and there are constraints and impacts on communities as a result of that. A good example is Mackay - and I am amazed that the Leader of the Opposition did not take a good look at the CBD of Mackay when he visited the electorate of Dawson just last week. If he had, he would know that there are significant problems with B-doubles going on roads that are also used by the communities who live in Mackay. There is a real issue with the ring-road in Mackay. It is the sort of project which could be eligible for funding under the Regional Infrastructure Fund.Those opposite are all over the shop, because, whilst the Leader of the Opposition is stating that he opposes this, just yesterday the Leader of the Nationals said, 'Much of our nation's wealth is produced in the regions; we want a fair share of that to return to the regions,' and in April Senator Barnaby Joyce said, 'We have to acknowledge that infrastructure spending has to occur in the regions.' They have been out there in individual electorates calling for infrastructure spending in our regions - and yet, when there is a precise, clear proposal to deliver just that, they are against it. They are also against the boost to superannuation and they are of course against the cut in company tax.We have a clear position, which is that infrastructure development cannot be left behind like it was during the first mining boom, because not only is it a constraint on our economic growth but it also has a devastating impact on the communities where that growth is occurring.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I draw to the member's attention - and I am sure he would have noted this - that the unemployment statistic came out last Thursday at the rate of 5.2 per cent. On the question of jobs: I know that members on this side of the House are very interested in how many Australians are unemployed and to see falling unemployment - 5.2 per cent -  - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his interjection and remind him, in case he missed it, of the global financial crisis and the global recession. He may choose to do some reading on that at some point, particularly as he is seeking to present himself as the man who has the ability to run Australia's macro-economy. He might want to catch up with that little bit of news, which has obviously entirely missed his attention.On the question I have been asked: for the resource super profits tax there is Treasury modelling about the impact on the industry, including the impact on employment. The modelling shows that the industry would continue to grow and consequently job opportunities would continue to grow. I understand that the opposition are involved in a fear campaign here, because that is what the opposition do. They are long on complaint and short on solution. I say to members opposite: let us look at the entirety of the package. There is the resource super profits tax, the company tax reduction, tax breaks for small businesses, superannuation and the regional infrastructure that my colleagues have talked about today. If you take the package as a whole, we are obviously talking about a net positive benefit to the economy, including job opportunities.If the member wants to be honest about the question of employment, step 1 is to be honest about the figures last week, step 2 is to be honest about the impact of economic stimulus on those figures - the economic stimulus that of course you opposed - and step 3 is to be honest about this package. It would be a change.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for that very important question, because there are a lot of very loud, well-funded voices being heard in this debate. Certainly the voices from the mining companies that are very well funded and the funders of those opposite -  -  - It is very important in this debate to acknowledge that there are lots of people in this country, particularly on low and modest incomes, who have a very big stake in its outcome. I think that is understood fairly and squarely on this side of the House, but is certainly not understood by those on that side of the House, who somehow believe that the mining community is paying too much tax. That is what the Leader of the Opposition has said. The Leader of the Opposition is advocating a cut in tax to the mining industry whilst on the other hand wanting to increase rates of company tax. Get that? What sort of twisted priority could get the opposition to the point where they think there should be a tax cut for very profitable miners and on the other hand want to increase tax for corporate Australia? What sort of twisted economic logic could lead to that position?It is refreshing to hear from those people in the community who are represented by organisations such as ACOSS, the ACTU and the Consumers Federation. -  - You can hear and see the contempt that those opposite have for people on modest incomes who are represented by organisations that have had their say in the last 24 hours. You can understand why they stand for the implementation of Work Choices in full, because they do not understand the importance of these measures to the living standards of people in this country who are on low and modest incomes. They most particularly do not understand the importance of the support for superannuation, particularly for people on modest incomes.These are very vital economic reforms which will lift the living standards of millions of workers in this country, and those opposite have nothing but contempt for those people and the organisations that represent them. It is good to hear from ACOSS. It is good to hear from the ACTU. It is good to hear from the Conservation Foundation. It is good to hear from the Consumers Federation. I know those opposite do not want to hear it, but let us go through what they have had to say. The Consumers Federation said:The RSPT is good policy - a tax on resources should be part of a sound tax base - and it comes with _ off-sets in other parts of the tax-base, so it has the added virtue of rebalancing a base out of kilter.Unlike many other products, the resources aren't mobile - they are in the ground. Australian ground. All Australians should benefit from this luck of geography, not just a well-heeled few.Nothing could summarise the situation better than that.We do have to face up to the need for fundamental economic reform to lift our national savings to support Australian workers on low incomes. We also have to face up to the need to invest in infrastructure, particularly in mining areas. Of course, some in the National Party, but apparently not in this parliament, understand the need to do that. We understand the need to invest in capacity in the mining regions. Those opposite do not. We also understand the needs of 3.5 million Australians who will benefit from what we are doing immediately in superannuation, the 8.4 million workers who will benefit from the 12 per cent guarantee or the 2.4 million small businesses which will benefit from the tax write-off of up to $5,000.This is what economic reform is all about, and that is what is not understood by those opposite. We saw the shadow Treasurer say last week that the stimulus had nothing to do with keeping Australia out of recession. They simply do not understand it. They get all the big economic calls wrong and they have got this economic call wrong. We on this side of the House understand the importance of economic reform to lift living standards and to put in place a modern tax system.</DOC>

 - It took three questions from those opposite to build up to the crescendo of the Leader of the Opposition's first question. -  - I notice his question is about the detail of consultation and the detail of negotiation. If the Leader of the Opposition had any experience on questions of the economy he would understand that, when you bring about fundamental tax reform, it involves complex consultations with companies and it involves complex negotiations with companies. That is what the government is engaged in. That is what any government engaged in the business of fundamental tax reform would be doing, and that is what we are doing. He raises more broadly the question of consultation. Can I simply draw his attention to the fact that - whether or not he or his colleagues have been asleep for the last two years - this entire debate has been out there through public documents released by the Treasury on where the overall direction of tax reform was going.First and foremost, on 2 May 2008, the government announced that we would be having the review into the tax system. On 6 August 2008, a discussion paper was released on the tax review entitled Architecture of Australia's tax and transfer system. That document, that discussion paper, raised the inefficiencies of royalties and pointed to a profits based tax. If you go to that paper it said:These royalties can discourage high risk investments (for example, in the case of an ad valorem royalty, revenue can be collected even when net losses are being made).It went on to say - if the Leader of the Opposition had any interest in the tax arrangements for the resource sector of the economy at large - back in August 2008:A resource rent tax does not apply until a firm has earned above normal profits. Once this occurs, the combined tax rate on the total return increases as the resource price increases.Back in August 2008, the government called for further public submissions. In December 2008, the government released a further, more detailed, consultation paper which went down to the definition of what constituted supernormal profits. It also went on to make reference to calculation bases which were linked to the long-term government bond rate.Through until May of 2009, there have been 1,300 submissions from the mining industry including from the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies and the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, and including recommendations from the MCA on the question of adopting a profits based tax system for the future. Then between June and November of 2009, industry, professional and community groups further consulted on the question of broader tax reform including that for the industry.So, for those opposite to infer that this is somehow some bolt from the blue on consultation concerning the future reform of tax arrangements for the mining industry and, more broadly, for the economy, this process has been under way for two years - had the Leader of the Opposition any interest in any matter concerning economic policy and tax policy. The government is now in the business of consultation with the mining industry. The government is now in the business of negotiation with the mining industry and the government is now engaged in detailed negotiations on details of implementation and generous transition arrangements. That is the normal way in which you engage in a process of tax reform.The government believes that this reform is delivering better super for working families, better tax arrangements for the rest of the economy and is boosting our level of national saving and, critically, is investing in regional infrastructure of the type called for by the Leader of the National Party when he was in regional Queensland the other day hoping that no-one would listen to what he was saying. Frankly, these are the factors at stake in fundamental tax reform. We are engaged in consultation, we are engaged in negotiation and we will prosecute that to the extent that it is necessary to reach an appropriate settlement for the national economic interest for the future of the mining companies in this country and for a fairer share for working families across the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. It goes to the task of putting in place what the petroleum and minerals industry has long argued for in Australia - a profits based tax system - because they think that is in their long-term best interests. I remind the House that, when we announced our response to the Henry tax review committee report on 2 May, the government established a high-level tax consultation committee. That committee delivered its first report to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer just over a week and a half ago. On the basis of that report, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and I have been deeply involved in discussions with industry about the nature of that report.I express the government's appreciation to those companies, both big and small, who have seriously engaged in discussions with the tax consultation committee and with the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and me over the last week and a half. Right across my portfolio, be they in mining, petroleum, coal seam methane or oil and gas, those companies have acknowledged that this is a serious and genuine process of consultation. That was evidenced today by the meeting between the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and me and the CEO of British Gas. She acknowledged the productive nature of these discussions. Her sector, I might say, was the first in the door on 3 May after the government's announcements of 2 May.I understand the importance of this sector, because what we are talking about is a new industry. That Queensland project alone represents a potential investment of $12 billion to $15 billion - and the opposition dare to raise the question of employment. This is about major employment opportunities in Australia. I know how disheartened the opposition were last week when they saw the good employment results - a terrific employment result for Australia following the impact of the global financial crisis.If you have any doubts about the importance of those discussions, I simply say that these discussions with British Gas are not new to the government. The delivery of this project started with detailed meetings with that company early in 2008. That led to an announcement on 24 March this year of the world's first LNG contract signed between Australia, British Gas and CNOOC. As the Minister for Trade acknowledges, we are talking about a deal potentially worth 3.6 million tonnes of LNG per annum to the Chinese national oil corporation. In volume terms, this is the single biggest company-to-company LNG contract in Australia's history, totalling 72 million tonnes over 20 years.For those reasons, companies such as British Gas and others right across my portfolio have approached discussions to better inform outcomes in a productive and constructive way. And so they should, because they themselves argued long and hard that we should put this type of tax reform in place in Australia. They do not like the royalties based system because, when times are bad, they are still required to pay tax. They actually believe that, over time, this will be a far better tax system for them and a far better tax system for Australia. That is what this debate is about. In that context can I say -  - The member for Groom asks whom I am speaking to. I am talking to people who have skin in the game - people who invest in Australia and who employ people in Australia. That would be a new thing for the Leader of the Opposition, because he has no practical understanding of the importance of investment and business activities in Australia - because he finds economics boring. On that note, I simply say that we as a government are making progress and we will continue to have these discussions, because it is about getting the balance right. This is the balance that is required.Unlike the opposition, we accept that the Australian community is entitled to a fair return for the opportunity to develop its natural resources - 100 per cent owned by the Australian community. We also have a strong view, as does the Australian community, that we are entitled to a fairer share from business for the opportunity of developing those natural resources. This debate is not just about the question of a profits based tax system in Australia but about fundamental change to the taxation system in Australia, including a significant reduction in company taxation. This is of major significance to me as the Minister for Tourism, because tourism is an industry principally made up of small- and medium-sized business opportunities, quite often in regional Australia.The government will continue to engage in these constructive and productive processes. We are about putting in place an appropriate outcome. I assure the Australian community that there will be a profits based system in Australia that is accepted by industry. And so it should be, because that is what they have argued for, long and hard. When it is all over, we will end up with a system that is fairer for Australia and balanced for industry. The only people that will stand in opposition will be the Leader of the Opposition and the coalition party room - just like they opposed our activities during the global financial crisis to maintain the strength of the Australian economy and minimise the impact on families through maintaining the best possible employment opportunities for the Australian community. We will continue, despite the endeavours of the coalition to run a fear campaign, to have these constructive discussions because this is about the long-term best interests of Australia. That is what governs the Australian government, unlike the self-interest which governs the other side of the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for North Sydney for his question. I am advised that, on 3 June, Xstrata said that it would suspend exploration at Wandoan coalmine and said it would jeopardise jobs in construction and operations over the next five years. The Financial Review, I noticed, reported on 11 June that Xstrata's executive general manager for the Wandoan coal project, Steve Bridger, said the company would continue to pursue the approval of a mining lease from the state government and would continue buying up land in the 32,000-hectare exploration area.This brings me to the broader question of the integrity of various claims that have been made concerning the proposed impact of this taxation regime and the fear campaign which those opposite are engaged in. Let me go through some of these in sequence, having dealt with the Wandoan matter. Let us not forget the claim made on 4 May that Cape Lambert announced that the RSPT would jeopardise its future operations in Australia. That was just five days before the chief executive of Cape Lambert proceeded to buy a million dollars worth of Cape Lambert shares. That is the first one. We then had the Liberals saying that BHP was cancelling its Olympic Dam project. That is the second one. The opposition said the new tax was already threatening multibillion dollar investments, most of all the $22 billion expansion of Olympic Dam in South Australia. The shadow finance minister said that Olympic Dam would be put off for 10 to 20 years. However, we then had BHP CEO Marius Kloppers say on 26 May:_ it is not frozen. We are carrying on. We are spending money, there are 200 engineers working on it. Otherwise we would have made a statement to the contrary.The third example goes to Xstrata, which I referred to before. Then of course we had a splash, I understand, in the Australian newspaper on 6 May, which stated:_ Rio Tinto has shelved plans to spend $11 billion expanding its _ iron ore operations in Western Australia _Three hours after that and after a two percentage point fall in share prices, Rio submitted a notice to the ASX market which included the following statement:Rio Tinto today confirmed that no decision has been made to shelve any projects in Australia _Then we go on to various statements which have been made one after the other by other mining companies. I go also to a report in the Financial Review on 9 June which said that the Chinalco bauxite development in Aurukun would join the eight projects worth $55 billion that had been put on hold due to the government's resources tax. At 2.18 pm that day Reuters reported that Chinalco denied dropping the Queensland project. It reported that Chinalco had said that it had no internal discussions on pulling out of its $3.04 billion Aurukun bauxite project and that it was carrying out feasibility studies and comparing proposals. Furthermore, quoting Mr Lu Youqing Chinalco:We do not have the consideration of withdrawing -  
from this project. It is one example after the other of exaggeration and overclaim (a) by various companies from time to time but (b) being harnessed by those opposite to prosecute a fear campaign. What this says is that the member for North Sydney does not do his homework. It says that the member for North Sydney picks up a clipping from a newspaper and equates that with fundamental, deep research. We expect higher standards from the member for North Sydney in this debate in this chamber. I would suggest if those opposite are running fear campaigns, the first and foremost requirement is to get your facts straight.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, dealing as it does with potentially the most difficult international peace and security issue that the international community will be confronted with over the next 12 to 18 months. On 9 June the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 1929 imposing new sanctions against Iran. Australia welcomed that resolution, which reflected the international community's continuing concern about Iran's nuclear program and its ongoing failure to be in compliance with its international obligations. Australia together with the international community has repeatedly called on Iran to conduct itself in accordance with International Atomic Energy Agency resolutions and to comply with Security Council resolutions. Indeed, the International Atomic Energy Agency's two most recent reports in February and May this year both found that Iran continues to enrich uranium in breach of its international obligations and that it has not provided either the necessary evidence or the necessary cooperation to persuade the IAEA that its program is exclusively for peaceful purposes. Australia also shares the Security Council's desire for a negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear issue, which of course requires Iran to change its policy. We continue to urge Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment programs. Despite these overtures, we are disappointed that Iran has not reversed its path. Indeed, very many people analyse that as a path of confrontation with the international community.Security Council resolution 1929 strengthens obligations on nation states to prevent the supply to Iran of goods and services that could contribute to Iran's nuclear industry - a proliferation sensitive nuclear industry - and also to its missile delivery technology and programs. As well, it imposes a heavy obligation on the part of nation states to prevent the supply of military equipment and related services to Iran. The resolution also targets Iran's transport and financial sectors as well as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in response to the corps' role in Iran's nuclear activities and the development of a weapons system. The resolution includes new financial sanctions against 41 individuals and entities in Iran. Australia's United Nations enforcement sanctions law will see that those financial sanctions have immediate effect and Australia will implement the other aspects of the resolution as expeditiously as possible.To reinforce those measures, earlier today I announced that Australia will impose additional autonomous sanctions against one individual and two organisations that assist Iran in its violation of its obligations under Security Council resolutions. Australia has imposed autonomous sanctions against Iran since October 2008 and today's announcement will now bring to a total of 21 individuals and 20 organisations subject to Australia's autonomous sanctions. Those additional organisations are Bank Mellat and the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines. The individual is General Rostam Qasemi, the commander of Khatem ol-Anbiya Construction Organisation, a company owned by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which is expressly referred to in resolution 1929 and already covered by our autonomous sanctions.We are taking these additional measures to ensure that Australia is at the forefront of those countries seeking to put pressure on Iran to change its policy in this area. These additional autonomous sanctions combined with our already rigorous implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, including our proposed implementation of resolution 1929, will continue to ensure that our concern is backed up by action and that our concern matches that of the international community. As I said in my opening remarks, this is potentially the single, biggest peace and security challenge which the international community faces. Australia again calls on Iran to conduct itself in accordance with its international legal obligations and to seek to resolve this matter through a change of policy as quickly as possible.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I am unaware of the circumstances surrounding Mr Kelly's business, but we will now investigate the circumstances surrounding his business. I would also say in response to the Leader of the Opposition that, if he consulted the documents attached with the Treasury's tax reform package released on 2 May, he would see that they go to the future modelling impact on the mining industry as a whole: first of all, the increase in overall investment in the mining industry by between 4.5 and 5.5 per cent; and, secondly, the overall increase in employment in the mining industry by seven per cent. I therefore am always reluctant to simply take anything which is said across the dispatch box by those opposite, particularly given the question asked just before by the member for Sydney - which went so well! - without actually further testing the facts.I also note that, if the question asked was about developments in the state of Queensland, I should raise our good friend Mr Clive Palmer again as well. Remember, on the question of impact on projects, Clive, the patron saint of the Liberal-National Party - at least the funder-in-chief of the Liberal-National Party -  - and campaign director of the Liberal-National Party - told South Australians he was cancelling projects in their state. We have been at work on this now for about two or three weeks. We cannot find those projects. Nobody can find those projects. Frankly, we are of the view that those projects may never have existed. So, when it comes to scare campaigns about individual projects, we are more than interested in separating fact from fear from fiction, which is important in this debate.What we do know is that actions always speak louder than words on this matter of the negative impact of the government's tax reform proposal for the mining industry on the interests of the economy at large and investors et cetera. Best proof positive still lies in that critical investment decision by the member for Dickson, because I am told his BHP shares are still out there doing - The member for Sturt then left the chamber. - Therefore, on the impact of the government's proposed tax reform, what we are on about is, firstly, how you grow the economy over time and, hence, the impact of the government's tax reform proposals, by bringing down the company tax rate, by bringing down taxes also in small business and by boosting the economy, including in the regions on which the honourable member's question was focused. - The question goes to impacts arising from the government's tax proposal on employment in regions of Australia where companies are located. What I am seeking to do is respond by saying: the impact of the government's tax reform plan, first of all, goes to the company tax rate, which we are bringing down by two percentage points - and the Leader of the Opposition is actually increasing by two percentage points. Secondly, for the small businesses in Cloncurry, they would all obtain a tax break in terms of $5,000 worth of assets purchased in a given year. On top of that again -  - The employment impact in regions of north-west Queensland would be the aggregate effect of what we are doing in terms of (1) the tax systems applied to the mining industry, both for the exploration and for the extraction side of the industry, (2) the tax reform for other businesses operating in the industry or outside the industry, which is a two percentage point reduction in the company tax rate and (3) all the small businesses in Cloncurry to which he refers, who will benefit if they are incorporated by the two percentage point reduction in the company tax and also, significantly, in terms of the $5,000 asset tax break as well.Taking these things together, the overall impact nationwide is a positive impact on employment in the economy and a positive impact on employment within the mining industry by 7.7 per cent. But the critical thing which I think the House would like to know is the impact of this tax overall. I am advised just now by others, by the way, that Australian mining stocks are now performing better relative to those in Canada. I would just ask people to consider that as a mere matter of fact which the member for North Sydney is not engaged in. Critically, in terms of the member for Dickson, the BHP share price is up 1.5 per cent over the last week. Onya, Pete! You have done the right thing. You have voted your confidence in the government's overall tax reform in an investment you made two days after the government announced its tax plans. Well done, Member for Dickson.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. I know that she is deeply concerned about investing in schools in her community so that every child can get a great education and investing to support jobs, particularly during these difficult days of the global financial crisis and global recession. On this side of the House, we stand for delivering a strong economy so people can get jobs and for investing in the services that families need, making sure families get their fair share, and there is nothing more important than the quality of the local school to which their child goes.Last week we saw some of the results of our investment in jobs with a 5.2 per cent unemployment rate. This rate has been achieved because, when faced with the global financial crisis, we did what had to be done to keep Australia working. If we had listened to the Leader of the Opposition, we would not have provided economic stimulus. We would be in recession now and hundreds of thousands of more Australians would be unemployed. Let us look at the statistics. Building the Education Revolution itself was responsible for 32 per cent of the value of non-residential building approvals over the year to April 2010 - that is, a third of non-residential economic activity was from Building the Education Revolution. If the Leader of the Opposition had his way, this would be brought to a shuddering halt - a third of economic activity in that sector, a third of jobs under threat from the Leader of the Opposition.It is about jobs, but it is also about investing in schools. If we look at what has been funded up to the end of April 2010, Building the Education Revolution has funded 3,052 new classrooms, 3,017 libraries, 2,822 multipurpose halls, 289 science centres, 179 language centres and 78 dual-purpose centres. In northern New South Wales, about which I am asked, in the electorate of Cowper Building the Education Revolution has funded 23 libraries, 30 new classrooms, 17 multipurpose halls, four language centres and five science centres. All of this is under threat from the Leader of the Opposition. When he was asked whether, as Prime Minister, he would guarantee the same quantum of funding for Building the Education Revolution he said, in the language of the Leader of the Opposition - you can tell that - 'Well, look, um, ah, I'm not going to give you that absolute commitment.' That is the gospel truth for, 'There will be cutbacks and these projects will not be delivered.' -  - Thanks to the member for Barker for that critique of my skills - that was very impressive. Beyond these threats to projects under Building the Education Revolution, there is a threat to computers in schools. We as a government have delivered more computers, and had them installed, during the 2½ years of the life of this government than kids in years 9 to 12 had at the end of 12 years of the Howard government - 300,000 installed, 210,000 at the end of 12 years of government. What this means in the electorate of Cowper is that we funded 5,241 new computers and delivered 3,972 of them. If the Leader of the Opposition has his way, there will be no more computers for kids in that area.Then when it comes to trade training centres, of course we have been benefiting schools around the country - 230 projects benefiting 732 schools. But if the Leader of the Opposition has his way then 1,800 schools will not be able to benefit from our Trade Training Centres in Schools Program, getting real skills for real jobs. What that means in Cowper is that, if the Leader of the Opposition had his way, the $4.5 million project benefiting Macksville High School and the trade training centre there, which is being participated in by Bowraville Central and Nambucca Heads high schools, would not go ahead. The $1.5 million project for Bellingen High School's trade training centre would not go ahead - real kids losing out on real opportunities because of the conduct of the Leader of the Opposition. This is extreme policy making aimed at education, aimed at kids. I am still looking for a member of the opposition who will stand up for their local community and tell the Leader of the Opposition he is wrong. The member for Cowper most certainly is not one.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question and I inform the House that I am advised that since the end of April the US market has fallen by eight per cent, the UK market by 6 per cent, the euro markets by five per cent, Hong Kong by five per cent, Japan by nearly 11 per cent, and Australia has been down by just over six per cent. That is the first point. Can I also go to the second point, which I partly referred to before: Australia's resources stocks have been down over the same period by about five per cent. That is less than the overall ASX. Let's just be very clear about that.Furthermore - and I draw this to the honourable member's attention, because facts are a problem when you are running a fear campaign - over the same period of time the Canadian resource stocks have been down by about six per cent and Australian stocks by five per cent. Can I just say to those opposite: I do not think there is a debate in Canada at the moment about tax reform in the mining industry. I would suggest to her that she actually pay attention to factual analysis of what is happening around the world. The member for North Sydney sought before, frankly, to mislead the House in terms of key facts concerning projects. We have had that now from the member for Curtin -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker -  - If Joe's feelings are hurt, of course I will withdraw. - If the feelings of the member for North Sydney are hurt, of course I will withdraw to accommodate the House. Can I also say in response to what the member for Curtin was saying before that I draw her attention to a statement made quite recently by the chief currency strategist of the CBA who, when talking about share market movements in recent times, said:These are sort of factors that have been going on which are not at all related to the mining tax. And just to further push that point home, some of the shares of the big offshore mining companies such as Vale - that is the big company from Brazil - have fallen by a similar magnitude. - I defer to the Portuguese pronunciation skills of those opposite. Can I say therefore that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has sought to construct an argument based around the share market impact of mining stocks. Firstly, as far as the Australian index is concerned, it has generally performed better than most other comparable indexes. Secondly, in terms of our mining stocks, they have performed better than the Brazilian company Vale that I just referred to as well as the Canadian exchange, and I referred to those figures before.It was very good to see the member for Curtin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, out there engaged in her protest activities the other day in Perth. It was a bit a like protest by Prada I thought. You had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition out there campaigning hard in a designer type demonstration. It was good. It was effective. The message was heard clearly. But I would say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: don't let the facts get in the road of a good fear campaign.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. As he knows, the government are determined to make sure we provide welfare responsibly and we are determined to also make sure that welfare encourages personal responsibility and supports people to do the right thing, especially by their children. That is why our major welfare reforms, commencing in the Northern Territory, are critical. Income management will be used to fight passive welfare and also to increase personal responsibility. What we want to see is people making sure that their children go to school, and we want to see young people getting into work and training. We intend to do everything we possibly can to fight passive welfare and to link income support to school attendance and to study and work. These requirements are not in place at the current time.Our reforms that are currently before the Senate extend the benefits of income management to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people who are in need of financial protection and better financial structure in their lives. The reforms that we intend to put in place are non-discriminatory. They will apply across the Northern Territory, in the towns - places like Tennant Creek and Katherine - as well as in the suburbs of Darwin and Alice Springs.From our point of view, income management is a very useful and important tool for protecting vulnerable people, particularly for protecting children. It makes sure that welfare payments are spent on the essentials of life - things like food, clothing and rent - and not on alcohol and drugs. I am certainly very aware that there are very strong views held on welfare reform, but where is the dignity of a life spent on welfare? Where is the dignity for children in not being properly fed or clothed? And I have to say there is no dignity at all in teaching the next generation that a welfare cheque is the best that they can expect from their lives. So, from our point of view, income management is a vital measure to protect the basic rights and to make sure the most vulnerable in our community are protected so that they can have the same sorts of aspirations that other Australians aspire to: a decent job, a decent home, a safe and healthy life.We do have a number of people calling for this legislation to get through the Senate as quickly as possible. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner Mick Gooda and the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance in the Northern Territory are just two calling for the passage of these reforms in the coming fortnight. The legislation in the Senate at the moment also reinstates the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act in the Northern Territory. So it would be completely irresponsible to delay these reforms, which are designed to protect and assist vulnerable people. We want to see this legislation debated and agreed to in the Senate in the next fortnight so that vulnerable people in the Northern Territory are able to get the help that they need and that they have been waiting for for too long.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyne for his question. On the question of the constituent to which he refers, can I say that we will obviously examine the circumstances surrounding that constituent. I am advised on my way to the dispatch box by the health minister that there is some gap between one set of arrangements and another, and this may well have affected an individual concerned. - On the matters raised by the honourable member, we will examine them further and I will have the health minister respond to him direct.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. It is a very good question across the country, not just in the northern suburbs of Brisbane. But, of course, one of the biggest risks does currently live in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, although he is trying to get a seat somewhere else, and that is the member for Dickson. He, as the shadow health spokesperson, and the Leader of the Opposition of course do not support GP superclinics. He has not bothered to turn up and see that the improved share of services being provided to his community in Strathpine is actually something that has been welcomed with open arms. But let me go back a few steps, because there is some other good news about the superclinics program across the country which I think members would be interested in. I know the member for Gilmore, who does not appear to be in the House at the moment, would be interested to know that the new electorate of Gilmore but the current electorate of Throsby is soon to benefit from the Shell Cove superclinic. I was there today with the member for Throsby and the member for Cunningham to turn the first sod for this superclinic.Before those opposite interject, I would like to ask whether anyone in this House, other than, of course, the two members who were with me, know how many doctors there currently are in Shell Cove, Shellharbour Village and Flinders. When this superclinic is open early next year, it will provide GP services, nursing services and allied health services, and currently in all of the three surrounding suburbs there is not a single doctor. This is the legacy that was left to us by the previous government. This has been turned around by our investments in superclinics, but unfortunately it is slated by the opposition to be closed. So future clinics that will be invested in, that were announced in the budget, have already been put on the Leader of the Opposition's cutting list, which we know is something that the Leader of the Opposition has such a bad reputation for.But it is not just the Shell Cove superclinic. The Parliamentary Secretary for Health and the member for Kingston last week inspected the start of work at the $25 million Noarlunga GP Plus Superclinic, which will be offering multidisciplinary care with extended operating hours. Last Wednesday I was pleased to inspect, with the member for Hasluck, the plans for the $10 million Midland GP superclinic. I inform those opposite that there was a very enthusiastic -  -  - The member for Dickson is not keen for me to finish this sentence because he is aware that the state Liberal MP for the area, Frank Alban, was there with the member for Hasluck and me to inspect the plans, because of course this is a joint project between the Western Australian Liberal government and our government. In fact, Mr Frank Alban, the local member, threatened - and I will quote his somewhat colourful language - quite serious bodily harm to any Liberal who dared to question the future of the clinic. This Midland superclinic is going to be in the old railway yards, and he said that any Liberal who wanted to oppose the clinic would be 'hanging from the rafters of the railway yards'. I would not like to go that far, but I do think that he is clearly making a point that people who understand the services that are being provided in the community support them. Unfortunately, those opposite do not.Now I want to talk little bit more about the Strathpine superclinic, which is of course part of the question asked of me by the member for Longman. Since January, when this clinic was opened, to 26 May - the latest data that we have - there have been more than 17,000 presentations at this clinic: 11,300 GP consultations, 1,800 pathology consultations and 3,900 allied and nursing consultations. You have to wonder, given these extraordinary numbers, how it is that the member for Dickson, on a margin of just 217 votes, does not think it a good idea to provide thousands of services to his constituents in Strathpine. There are not only six new GPs at the clinics; there is a new female GP -  - Yes, Mr Speaker, I think that is a question that is being asked in the electorate of Dickson. - As I said, there is a reason that the opposition are so touchy about this: they have slated GP superclinics for their health cuts. The Leader of the Opposition has a record for pulling a billion dollars out of our hospitals. He already has on his list of the next cuts GP superclinics, investments in primary care infrastructure, e-health, and now also diabetes.The member for Dickson has not had the decency to turn up at the superclinic in his electorate to see what services they are operating. The question that the member for Dickson and the Liberal Party have to confront next is: when we open applications for GP clinics across the country to be able to apply to expand their facilities - and in the seat of Dickson there are 145 doctors who will be able to apply for grants of up to half a million dollars - will the member for Dickson be writing to those GPs informing them of this great program available to assist in the expansion of their services that can support their constituents, or will he be writing perhaps more honestly to them and telling them -  - that this support is not provided? It is important because I was asked about the support for primary care services in the northern suburbs of Brisbane. There are doctors in the northern suburbs of Brisbane who want to expand their practices, who want to be able to employ nurses and allied health professionals, and our government is making a program available where up to half a million dollars is available for those practices. The Liberal Party oppose it and the member for Dickson needs to spend a little bit more time concentrating on getting a fair share for his constituents rather than just worrying about his own shares -  - and that would be a better investment of his time here in this House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question and her very clever alliteration. That is an innovation for question time. I am aware that these claims have been raised about Brungle. I am aware that they received some publicity. I am also aware that there is a question about the quotes as opposed to the actual costs involved for Brungle. What I would say to the member is: yes, I am aware that an investigation has been conducted into the claims about the quotes versus the actualities, and I am very happy to provide the member with details should she want further information. The school, as I understand it, is in the electorate of Eden-Monaro, so obviously the member for that electorate in this place will be very well aware of the matter. I can also say to her that, should she or any member of the school community believe that further work needs to be done on this question, they can refer the matter to the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce, which has been set up with the purpose of looking at these questions. It is led by a leading Australian businessperson who is of course travelling to schools as we speak and dealing with any questions schools may have.I remind the member - and she knows this from her own local school community; I am very well aware that she does - that, if we look across the Building the Education Revolution program, we see it has involved 9,500 schools and 24,000 projects. There are many, many school communities, including in the member's own electorate, who are delighted with their project, delighted with the investment and delighted with the support that it has provided to local jobs, to the extent that there are concerns that there be a clear process for addressing these issues through the implementation task force. I also remind the member that, if we had determined to go the way that she indicated with her vote in this House and that the Leader of the Opposition indicated with his vote in this House and not provided economic stimulus, we would see a couple of hundred thousand more Australians unemployed and we would not see one dollar spent on the schools in her electorate. I know the member who has asked this question reasonably well, and I do not genuinely believe that she wanted to see zero invested in her local schools.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. I know that she is deeply concerned with fairness in Australian workplaces, particularly for Australian women. She has asked me about how workplace relations systems can support fairness for working women. Of course you can support fairness for working women if you have a decent safety net that cannot be stripped away, if you have a proper pay equity principle that allows equal pay cases to be taken and appropriately prosecuted, if you have a low-paid bargaining stream which enables predominantly female dominated industries to enjoy the benefits of collective bargaining, and if you have an independent umpire and a regular minimum wages case which means that minimum wages are fairly adjusted, as we have recently seen from Fair Work Australia. You can support working women if you allow appropriate flexibilities at work, underpinned by the safety net; you can support working women if you protect good working women, women who have proved to be hard workers, from unfair dismissal. Of course the Fair Work system does all of that.Australians remember very vividly Work Choices - a system of workplace relations supported by those opposite that did not give any of these protections to working women, that enabled the pay of working Australians to be cut back with no compensation. Let us quickly go through the statistics. Under the Australian workplace agreements that the Liberal Party used to rejoice in, we recall the statistics that 63 per cent saw their penalty rates cut, 52 per cent saw shift work cut, 51 per cent saw overtime loadings cut, 46 per cent saw public holiday pay cut and 22 per cent were provided with no pay rise over the life of the agreement, some for up to five years. This was bad for working people but it was particularly bad for working women. Let us look at the statistics in female dominated industries. Research in 2007 found in retail, obviously female dominated, that casual and part-time sales assistants working a 12-hour week lost on average 12 per cent of their earnings if they were on an Australian workplace agreement - a truly amazing statistic. Permanent part-time retail workers on the same hours lost 18 per cent of their earnings on Australian workplace agreements. In hospitality, once again a female dominated industry, it was the same story. Workers on Australian workplace agreements suffered losses of between six and 12 per cent of their income - rip-off after rip-off, particularly for working women.Research on Victorian workers under Work Choices found that if you were a median worker on an Australian Workplace Agreement you earned 16.3 per cent less compared to the median worker on a collective agreement. If you were a woman, you earned 18.7 per cent less than a woman on a collective agreement. For the most disadvantaged groups, female labourers and related workers, AWA workers were paid a whopping 26 per cent less than similar women on collective agreements. These are stunning statistics about the rip-off that Work Choices was for working women. What that rip-off means is that women went to work and could not complain because of the threat of unfair dismissal; they had absolutely no right to take an unfair dismissal claim in almost all Australian businesses - you just had to cop it, even though that pay reduction might mean that you could no longer pay your mortgage, even though that pay reduction might mean that meeting the ordinary household bills to put food on the table was really putting stress and strain on you.Many Australians might believe that these are the horror stories of the Work Choices past but we need to remind ourselves these could be the contemporary stories of the future if the Leader of the Opposition has his way. He is lock, stock and barrel committed to Work Choices. He is turning his head because he does not want Australians to know the truth. He is on the record, time after time, as a devotee of Work Choices. Even in his budget reply speech he endorsed the central elements that made Work Choices the rip-off that it was. The message for working women is very clear. When they look at the Leader of the Opposition they see a man with a track record of statements that would concern women, including working women, and they see a man committed to industrial relations extremism and committed to the return of Work Choices.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Equally, we could talk about the interventions of the likes of the former leader of the Liberal Party, John Hewson, who recommends a profits based tax. We could also talk about the contribution to the previous debate on a profits based tax by the former Treasurer of Australia, Peter Costello, and the former leader of the National Party, Tim Fischer. We could also go to the comments from a range of contributors to this debate who have all argued that we need a profits based tax for the future. The member for Goldstein is entering the chamber; he has argued for one. The member for Wentworth has argued for one.There is a very clear fault line in this debate and it is as follows: we on this side of the House support tax reform based on profits in the mining industry rather than production in the mining industry. That is the core point of this reform. And the reason we argue for it is that a profits based system adjusts itself to rises and falls in commodity prices over time. So the Australian community benefits from the rises, but at the same time we understand that mining companies pay less when commodity prices come down. That is the core rationale for this reform, and the second one is this: to assist initial companies who are out there investing in the mining industry to undertake their corporate activities without being slugged with a flat, volume based tax in their first years of operation. That is the economic rationale for this reform.What we have here is a very clear alternative. The government, together with many in the mining industry, including Twiggy Forrest, Marius Kloppers, the MCA and many other leaders in the mining industry such as Don Voelte, say that we need to bring in a profits based tax for the future. There are only two voices in this nation that oppose this form of reform, a profits based regime, and that is the Leader of the Opposition and Clive Palmer. They are the two who stand opposed to this fundamental reform. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, on these questions, that the business of reform is always a tough business. He says he is opposed to the question of reform and he says he is opposed to the type of reform we have put forward, but I always look at what the opposition do rather than what they say.We go back to the good old member for Dickson; how are his shares performing today? When he bought his BHP shares on 4 May, two days after the government announced its tax reforms, BHP shares were trading at $38.53. Today they are trading at $39.20. Well done, Member for Dickson! He has done well. So worried was he about the impact of the government's profits based tax that he ripped in and spent $2,000 on BHP shares two days later. I always think actions speak louder than words. But, from listening to those opposite, presumably they would have invested in mining companies elsewhere. Had the member for Dickson invested on the same day, 4 May, in Brazilian mining companies like Vale, which we talked about yesterday, he would have seen the shares fall by four per cent in value. Old Pete Dutton could have invested in some Canadian mining shares! Cameco is down two per cent since 4 May, Teck Cominco is down six per cent since 4 May and, worse still, London Mining is down 18 per cent since 4 May. He got just one thing wrong, though: I am told that in the last week BHP is up 1.5 per cent, but - guess what? - I am told Rio is up five per cent. Mr Speaker, keep your investments onshore! So terrified are those opposite by the real impact of the government's proposed tax reform that they went in there and put their own money on the line and bought those BHP shares. Actions speak very much louder than words.</DOC>

 - This government is about the business of reform - reform in the economy by keeping our economy strong in the midst of a global recession; reform in making sure we are bringing our budget back to surplus in three years time, three years ahead of time; reform in productivity investments, in education, skills, training and infrastructure; reform in regulation, creating a seamless national economy; and also reform in the tax system - because what we want is a stronger economy but also a fairer share for all Australians.Social policy reform is equally important - the reforms brought about in education by the Minister for Education, the Deputy Prime Minister: the introduction of the national school curriculum; the introduction of the My School website, which enables people to look at the performance of individual schools; and the interventions in the literacy needs of individual schools.Similarly with health reform - ensuring, through the agreement which was reached with the states and territories for a National Health and Hospitals Network, funding will flow for those reforms from 1 July. We are also committed to critical reform like paid parental leave. For 12 years they did nothing about paid parental leave. This government acted and, depending what happens in the Senate, this will be a core reform on the part of this government.There is a further element of reform as well, and that goes to the future of welfare reform. The reason I raise it in the parliament today is to leave a very clear challenge with the Leader of the Opposition as we look at the future of these two sitting weeks ahead of us, and that is our commitment to making welfare reform work by encouraging individual responsibility, by fighting passive welfare, by helping people move from welfare dependence into work, education and training, and by making sure that welfare payments are spent in the interests of kids. We are of the view that welfare should not become a way of life for any Australian and that encouraging welfare dependency helps no Australian. Also, taxpayers expect that their support for our welfare system is properly invested, including bringing younger Australians into the workforce or into proper training arrangements for them.Right now we have inadequate incentives in Australia to bring about a break from welfare dependency on the part of those families which have had a long experience of it, often going back a number of generations. What we need are new incentives to do that. This is a core element of this government's welfare reform. From 1 July this year, provided these reforms are considered and supported by the Senate during this sitting fortnight, these welfare reforms will commence in the Northern Territory for Indigenous Australians and for non-Indigenous Australians. They will extend the benefits of income management to Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in need of financial structure and support. They will also ensure that more welfare is spent on life's essentials, like food, clothes and rent, and less goes to alcohol. They will also support and encourage families to make positive decisions about the critical things for their families, like education, health and nutrition. In practical terms, this means that this reform extends to the entirety of the Northern Territory community.My challenge is very simply this: on the key questions of reform will the Leader of the Opposition commit to ensuring that these reforms are passed during this sitting fortnight? He shakes his head, or he nods his head - I am not quite sure which it is. But it would be very useful for the country to know which side he will come down on in this debate. I appeal to him and encourage him to enable his senators to give positive consideration to this. This is welfare reform, which the previous government did not entertain. I challenge him to do so for this sitting fortnight so that we can get on with the business of long-term social and economic reform for Australia.</DOC>

 - I welcome again a question from the Leader of the Opposition about tax reform. The government is about the business of tax reform to get a profits based tax system for the mining industry and to ensure that, as a result of that, we have better super for working families, tax cuts for Australian corporates, tax breaks for Australian small business, and infrastructure investment across all the resource-producing regions of Australia. That means in regions like Gladstone and Mackay, and also in the West where we have got critical communities in need of infrastructure investment. That is why we are engaged in this business of tax reform.My challenge to the Leader of the Opposition, as he has again asked a question on this, is this: does he have no spine for reform at all? What I have heard in this debate is the Leader of the Opposition simply siding each day in the debate with Clive Palmer, Clive Palmer's friends and relations, and other people who obviously stand opposed to change in the industry. The Leader of the Opposition also refers to threats to particular projects. He refers to the particular statements of individual chief executives. I draw his attention to the answer I gave yesterday to the member for North Sydney. If you go through one by one each of the projects which have had statements made about them, it is very important that we actually reduce them to some scrutiny. The Leader of the Opposition just referred to Rio Tinto. Again I say to the Leader of the Opposition, bear this fact in mind: on 6 May there was a splash in the newspaper saying:_ Rio Tinto has shelved plans to spend $11 billion expanding its _ iron ore operations in Western Australia _A few hours later - three hours later - we had Rio submitting a notice to the ASX market which included the following statement:Rio Tinto today confirmed that no decision has been made to shelve any projects in Australia _I say to the Leader of the Opposition, as he engages in his fear campaign on tax reform: there are two clear paths for the future - either you embrace tax reform around the need for a profits based regime for the future because that is where the bulk of the industry say the reform needs to occur, or you simply stay in Clive Palmer's corner - Clive Palmer who bankrolls the Liberal Party and the National Party, Clive Palmer who controls the policy direction of the Liberal Party and the National Party, Clive Palmer who dictates the direction of the Liberal Party and the National Party. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to, for the first time, stand up for the national interest rather than Clive Palmer's interests. We are in the business of reform; the Leader of the Opposition has no spine for reform when it comes to tax reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question because, as she knows, this government is determined to make welfare work. We want to see welfare used as a driver of personal responsibility. We also want to make sure that payments are spent responsibly in the interests of children. Welfare should not be a destination or a way of life. It is also the case that welfare has to be a two-way street. Governments should support individuals and families in tough times, but welfare recipients should also behave responsibly and make sure that they spend their payments in the interests of children.Our reforms will extend the benefits of income management to vulnerable Australians in the Northern Territory. Under these reforms, income management will be used as a tool to fight passive welfare and to increase personal responsibility. At its core, these reforms are all about human dignity - the dignity of earning your own pay cheque and the dignity of making sure that your children go to school each day and get a better start in life. There have been a number of people in the Northern Territory, particularly women, who have spoken out about the value of income management to them and their families. Bess Nungarrayi Price, originally from Yuendumu, said:Income quarantining was a good thing that happened for our people saving money in order to have food on the table for their children, have food for themselves and have clothing.Andrea Mason from the MPY Women's Council based in Alice Springs said:Women see it more as a way of taking back control over their finances or their lives.A teacher in the Tiwi Islands said:Before it was the case that children were skinny and covered in sores walking around half naked. Today these kids are walking around healthy with food in their tummies.These are critical reforms to make sure that vulnerable people in the Northern Territory, especially children, get this vital help. The Senate needs to pass these reforms and pass them urgently.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for North Sydney for his question. The real concerns which this government listens to are those which are driven by the national interest, not by the partial interest of certain individual elements of the mining industry. The real concerns that we are listening to are those working Australians who retire without enough superannuation. The real concerns we are listening to are struggling small businesses who at present do not have sufficient tax breaks. The real concerns we are listening to are the good folk of Gladstone, the good folk of Mackay and others in regional Australia who are crying out for better investment in their roads, in their rail and in their ports. These are the real concerns we are listening to.I notice that the member for North Sydney in his question made reference to an analyst saying that we should be concerned about the relative impact of tax reform against the mining industry here as opposed to that in Canada. Obviously the member for North Sydney is not fleet of foot in actually listening to what I said before in response to an earlier question. If you were to compare BHP stocks over the last month that we have been involved in this protracted debate on the future of tax reform for the industry, you would find that BHP has performed better than critical Canadian mining stocks. Furthermore, the Australian Stock Exchange more broadly, I am advised, has performed better than most other bourses around the world. When it comes to the individual mining index of the ASX, generally it has performed better than most other bourses around the world. Therefore, on this quite discomforting question of fact as opposed to fear, why doesn't the member for North Sydney, instead of just reading the clips of a morning, undertake a little bit of research?The member for North Sydney goes back to the good old question of iron ore and the good old investments of the member for Dickson, whom he sits next to. He should inquire from the member for Dickson what has happened with companies like BHP, whose principal resource lies in iron ore in the west and coal in Queensland. Mr Speaker, if you look at the performance of BHP stocks in recent times against Canadian and other international equivalents, it has been going pretty well. In fact, they have been going better than most of the other stocks on the ASX. I say to the member for North Sydney: have a yarn to the member for Dickson about how his investment is going. It is up from 3853 to 3920. He bought it two days after the government announced its tax reform changes. It is going okay so far. Joe, ask Pete for a bit of advice on how you should invest in the future. - We will track that through the pecuniary interests and see how it goes. I would strongly suggest to go Rio as well because they are doing even better.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question and his ongoing diligence in raising aviation issues, which he and the member for Blaxland continually do. The fact is that the government have embarked on a process of having a comprehensive strategy for aviation policy for the long term. We have said that safety and security must be our No. 1 priority. Last year the House would recall that regulations restricting access to cockpits on aircraft were disallowed in the Senate, in my view much to the shame of the Senate. Those regulations have been resubmitted and I understand that there is a disallowance motion again which will be debated in the Senate, and I ask all responsible members of the Senate to think very carefully before they again return cockpits to an unregulated situation.There is also very important legislation being debated before this House today. It goes to the heart of safety in aviation. The aviation sector is changing dramatically. General aviation is growing. Private ownership of aircraft is growing. The use of helicopters is growing. And with this growth the aviation safety regime must move with the times.We have introduced legislation to increase the excise on aviation fuel from 2.854c to3.556c per litre. That will result in an estimated $89.9 million of increased revenue over the next four years, and every single cent of that money will be going to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. It will be going to fund important safety surveillance, safety analysis and safety inspections. They will be able to employ 97 additional safety inspectors. -  - 'Bureaucrats', they say opposite. They expose their attitude towards aviation safety and towards anyone who works for the public sector with that outrageous slur on the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. We saw during the debate earlier today the member for Farrer be critical of CASA and the safety inspectors going about their job and question whether we should have random drug and alcohol testing of pilots. -  - Frankly, it is extraordinary that this is an issue of partisanship in this House. This should not be an issue of partisanship. There should be a consensus position. We have spent two years developing this position. In December 2008 the government released an aviation green paper and on page 56 of that paper it put forward a process of industry stakeholder comment outlining a process of where we needed to go to put CASA on a sustainable financial footing. We then had a process of one year of discussions with the aviation sector. In December 2009 we produced an aviation white paper which on page 103 outlined the importance of putting CASA on a sustainable financial footing. This legislation does just that.It is important to note that the previous government raised the fuel excise some 11 times. In 2004-05 fuel excise was $65 million and $49 million was appropriated for CASA. In the following year $65.9 million was received from aviation fuel excise and the appropriation amount was some $40 million, a cut of $9 million to aviation safety inspectors, to CASA, the agency. Who was the minister at the time? It was the current shadow minister for aviation, the Leader of the National Party.We know that those opposite are intent on opposing for opposition's sake. But this is not a matter of high principle; this is pure obstructionism. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: get control of the Leader of the National Party. This is the man who wants to be the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, the Leader of the National Party who is opposing legislation to increase the number of aviation safety inspectors at a time when we have a considerable increase in the aviation sector. They represent a huge risk. We know they represent a risk to the economy. We know they represent a risk to national security. But they also represent a risk to aviation security and safety. - They have a couple of hours to think again. If they think that aviation safety is an issue which is partisan, then they are wrong. They are wrong and they will be held to account by this government.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the member for Mayo for his question. He raises in particular the Olympic Dam project in South Australia. The member for Mayo will be aware of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition said only a few weeks ago that this new tax proposal of the government's 'is already threatening multi-billion dollar investments, most of all the $22 billion expansion of Olympic Dam in South Australia'. The shadow finance minister has chipped in to say:Olympic Dam could well be put off for ten or twenty years.When asked about Olympic Dam, BHP chief executive Marius Kloppers said on 26 May:_ it is not frozen. We are carrying on. We are spending money, there are 200 engineers working on it. Otherwise we would have made a statement to the contrary. - The honourable member for North Sydney bellows an interjection. I always know with the member for North Sydney that volume is disproportionate to logic. That is the nature of his interjections. - I thank again the member for Mayo for his question, because once again he is forced to confront facts as opposed to the fear campaign which those opposite are mounting. The member for North Sydney says, 'What about Morgan Stanley?' Can I say in response to that that I thought the CEO of BHP spoke for BHP, rather than the representative of Morgan Stanley. But I will leave it with those opposite, as they claim to have better connections with corporate Australia than this side of the House.This also forms part of a pattern of what has been suggested by those opposite in terms of the impact of tax reform on individual projects. Remember, of course, that particular claim in relation to Clive Palmer. Two of Clive's projects were going to be torpedoed in South Australia. It is about four weeks on, and we are still trying to find those projects. Maybe the member for Mayo could help us; we are still searching for them. I simply conclude by making a point about projects and companies like Clive Palmer's. It is important that the member for Mayo listen to this because I am told his illustrious predecessor, a very good friend of mine, Alexander Downer, is in fact on the board of a company called Resourcehouse, of which Clive Palmer is owner and chairman. So I know there is a good and strong connection between the seat of Mayo and Clive Palmer's company and this broader campaign of fear concerning companies and associated tax reform.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for this very important question. It is the case that Australia did come through the global financial crisis in a very strong position. We did that for two reasons, one because of the timely and powerful stimulus that we put in place, which is supporting employment right across the country, particularly in places like Leichhardt where it is necessary and required as we speak. Not every section of the economy is growing at the same speed, and that is why we do need continuing economic reform. I think all Australians can be pretty proud of their efforts during this global financial crisis, and you can see this in the latest employment numbers - 250,000 jobs have been created in this country since the crisis began. Contrast that with what is happening elsewhere in the developed world. Those opposite might want to ignore that, because the truth is that, had they been in charge last year and the year before, there would not have been 250,000 jobs created in this country. Unemployment would have been much higher, and of course small business closures would have been very, very significant. There are small businesses with their doors open as a result of stimulus, and there are breadwinners earning an income, in jobs, because of stimulus. That is very important, particularly in electorates like Leichhardt.I have been asked about the international economy. Global growth is patchy - there is not just a two-speed economy in this country; there is a two-speed global recovery as well. Of course our region is growing stronger than the rest of the world. As we know, there are downside risks to that recovery particularly with what is going on in Europe. We can face that situation with confidence because of the underlying strengths in our economy. Our economy is recovering solidly, our unemployment rate is low, our financial system is stable, and of course our public finances are very strong - and that was demonstrated in our most recent budget. This is what the Governor of the Reserve Bank had to say only last week:Australia's budgetary position is very different from those in Europe and, for that matter, most countries. Public debt is low and budget deficits are under control and already scheduled to decline.That is a very big tick for our fiscal policy. The minutes of the Reserve Bank from a day or two ago say:_ members noted that the medium term outlook remained positive _ The prices of Australia's main commodity exports were still elevated _ the economy was continuing to expand.But we know that, as we expand, we have to meet the challenge of economic reform. That is why in parts of the country, particularly parts like Leichhardt, businesses, families, are crying out for a cut in their corporate rate of tax. They need economic reform. Small business needs support. Employment in small business needs support. Of course, all of those great mining communities need the infrastructure investment. That is why economic reform is so important and that is why the attitude of those opposite is so grossly irresponsible.If we are going to build on our strengths, keep up the momentum for reform, then what we need is a far-sighted reform program. This side of the House has one; that side of the House does not. They have this incredible view that miners are paying too much tax and that there should be a tax cut for miners and a tax increase for all the small businesses in Leichhardt. That is the approach of those opposite. All of those struggling small businesses around Australia that they pretend to stand up for potentially face a corporate tax increase with those opposite. Those opposite stand for higher taxation for the entire business community; we on this side of the House stand for tax reform and a fair go for Australian families.</DOC>

 - I always welcome questions from the member for Curtin. It is of passing interest to everybody that any national government will spruik its national book at a particular time. Of course, what is interesting is how markets themselves behave. I would again draw the attention of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to what has happened in equity markets in recent times. First and foremost, can I advise the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who cut a striking figure as a protester over there in Perth, I thought, chanting the revolutionary song, that revolutionary motto, 'Billionaires united shall never be defeated' - protest by Prada, designer demos; it was good -  -  - Furthermore, I would say in response to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that she should pay some attention to the fact that Australian resources have fallen by about three per cent, which is less than all comparable resources indices in the world. The Canadian index has fallen by four percentage points, the Australian index by three. This is since the introduction of the RSPT announcement on 2 May.Also, can I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: I know that facts always create a problem when you are dealing with fear. Facts always get in the road of fear. Not only did Australian resource stocks fall by around three per cent; Australian major banks over that same period of time have fallen by nine per cent. So I would suggest that, when you have got a change in the index -  - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked specifically about Canada and she also asked about Latin America. Can I draw her attention to the fact that Australian resource stocks have fallen by three per cent since the introduction of RSPT announcement; Canadian resource stocks have fallen by four per cent, where there has been no RSPT announcement. I would think that says something by way of a matter of fact. Furthermore, Australian resource stocks have fallen by three per cent in that period of time; general stocks have fallen by nine per cent in that period of time. - Can I also say that against the overall performance of, say, the Australian resource stocks against Canada, which is the point I have just referred to, I have here Brazilian resource stocks which are down nine per cent over the same period of time. - I have not yet seen this morning's report from the Somali stock exchange. Brazilian resource stocks, which are actually host to a company called Vale, in the period since the announcement of the government's tax reform on the mining industry have collapsed nine points and the Australian resources are down three points. I simply go back to the core question of fact as opposed to fear. It would be very useful if the member for Curtin, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, actually engaged in a little bit of factual research rather than simply xeroxing the releases that have been produced by others. Again I go back to that great protest in Perth along the lines of: 'What do we want? Tax cuts for billionaires. When do we want it? As soon as the MCA wants.'Mr Speaker, you know something, we are actually on about the national interest here. We are on about tax reform for the nation. We are on about how you get better super for working families. We are on about how you bring about tax cuts for 2.4 million Australian businesses. We are on about how you give tax cuts to the corporate rate for 770,000 Australian businesses and we are on about how we deliver infrastructure for the good people of Western Australia, the good people of Queensland and the other resource producing regions of the country. That is what we are on about. Mr Speaker, can I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: just pay a little bit of attention to the facts before you stand up at the dispatch box and seek to promote fear.</DOC>

 - Unlike the opposition the government are committed to ensuring Australia's long-term prosperity. We also accept, unlike the opposition, that the role of government varies, given the economic challenges that confront the government, from time to time. For the last 12 to 18 months the challenge to government was different to the challenge that confronts Australia at the moment. That related to the fact that we had to manage the Australian economy through a major global financial crisis. I remind the House that, just like the opposition opposed the decisive action we took during that period, the opposition again stands in opposition to major tax reform which is about Australia's future and managing varying economic challenges in the future.Coming out of the global financial crisis I remind the House that, because of our action, the unemployment figures of last week were 5.2 per cent. I know the opposition cringes every time we get good employment figures. I also note that, in April, for the first time in 13 months we experienced a trade surplus, which is a further major achievement for the Australian economy. I also acknowledge that from the Australian community's point of view, when it comes to the resources sector, at times we have booms and at times we have slumps.That is what this tax reform is about. It is about how we as an economy actually manage those challenges. I refer to Mr Battellino, the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, who said yesterday:_ booms have very significant impacts on the economy and do cause a lot of stresses and strains. -  - The deputy governor went on to say:_ the challenge for the Australian economy for the next few years is going to be how to accommodate this mining boom _That goes to one of the key issues with respect to the tax reform before the parliament at the moment, the key issue of infrastructure and our capacity as a nation to actually invest in infrastructure to assist the mining industry for the purposes of realising all the potential that the Australian mining industry has available.I remind the House that, over the last decade, that is where the Australian community was let down by the previous Howard government. They were good at spending the benefits of the mining industry's gains and very bad at investing in the future of the mining industry when it came to infrastructure and the skilling of the Australian workforce. I also remind the House that the Australian community is entitled to a fair return on the development of its natural resources. The mining community appreciates that, when prices are high, it should be expected to pay more out of its profits as a return to the Australian community. But we also appreciate that the mining industry understands that the current volume based state royalty regime, not a profits based tax system, is bad for it during bad economic times. That is why it has historically approached state and territory governments for relief from royalty payments during those periods. The Australian government is therefore absolutely committed not only to putting in a profits based tax system, something that the mining industry has argued for, but also to ensuring that we as a community have the capacity to invest in the infrastructure related projects that are so important to the expansion of the mining industry in the future. I also remind the House that that is also why we made key investments in the skilling of the Australian workforce in the recent budget.Let us go to the infrastructure fund, a $6 billion fund aimed at trying to assist those regional communities dependent on the mining industry to cope with all the stresses and strains of the boom that is currently underway because of growth in China. We are the beneficiaries of that growth in China, but it is also our responsibility to ensure that on this occasion we regain market share lost under the previous Howard government in a number of key commodities and no longer just live off the back of increases in commodity prices. For those purposes, the House should also not forget that, unlike the opposition, we saw this challenge in the lead-up to the last election. Therefore, in addition to the superprofits tax that we are now considering, we committed up to $100 million a year out of the proceeds of the Gorgon project to the Western Australian government for the purposes of assisting in infrastructure development in those key regions in Western Australia.But when you come to key infrastructure decisions it is not just about the tax regime and it is not just about the infrastructure fund that we have established but also about a range of other government decisions which go to achieving these major investments. Yesterday, for example, I referred to the potential British Gas decision which is so important to Gladstone in Queensland. I advise the House that I also made a decision yesterday under the National Gas Law to grant a 15-year no coverage determination to the British Gas group's proposed Queensland Curtis LNG project. The 15-year no coverage provisions in the National Gas Law are designed to bring on efficient investment in pipeline assets. This decision was consistent with the recommendations of the National Competition Council and therefore provides investment certainty for this aspect of the BG Queensland Curtis Island LNG project - another step forward in a range of key decisions with respect to the potential investment decision by BG.I raise these issues to remind the House that we are absolutely committed to putting in place the necessary parameters to maintain the strength of the Australian economy, just as we did through the global financial crisis. Just as the opposition opposed our action then, so they now oppose the introduction of a new tax system which is to the long-term benefit of the mining industry in Australia during booms and slumps. We as a government are committed to an outcome that will provide the certainty investors require whilst also ensuring the Australian community gets a fair return from the development of its resources. Unlike the opposition, we are about developing policy, taking hard decisions, pursuing reform and investing to ensure Australia's long-term future. The opposition, as usual, remain opposed to any major reform in Australia because they stand in support of their own self-interest and against Australia's national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. He refers in particular to correspondence from Wesfarmers. As I have already indicated in today's debate in the House on the future of tax reform in Australia, there will be claim and counterclaim by a whole range of Australian corporates, many of whom have come out in strong support of the government's tax reform proposals. - The Leader of the Opposition asks us to name some. I draw his attention to the range of financial services companies in Sydney. I also suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he reflect upon the contributions to this debate by a whole range of corporates, particularly those associated with the financial services sector, who understand one of the impacts of these reforms - namely, that the flowthrough impact on super is to boost the overall supply of national savings for the Australian economy.Furthermore, can I also say to the member for Groom that the letter he refers to goes on to the question of the impact on earnings for superannuants. Can I draw attention to the fact that the performance of the Australian Stock Exchange, which is one of the principal sources of earnings for superannuants, has outperformed most other bourses across the world. Furthermore, could I say this in response to a debate which has much claim and counterclaim associated with it: before, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in making her very cogent point to this place referred to the Chilean mining minister, Laurence Golborne. It always pays to do your research, because we have a report from Bloomberg today, which is that they are having a debate on mining tax in Chile as well. It said that Chile's mining minister, Laurence Golborne, urged the congress of Chile to approve the proposed changes in the mining laws of his country. It also said that the government of President Pinera, which took office in March, is seeking to introduce an optional sliding tax rate on profit and to deliver $700 million in additional revenue next year and in 2012. The bill says that it is very good for the country because it does not hurt investment and allows the government to cash in when economic cycles are benefiting miners. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition -  - Therefore, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjects in this debate that mining companies around the world are somehow immune to tax changes in other jurisdictions, she is wrong. Furthermore, in the country that she specifically refers to, there is a debate right now in the Chilean congress to introduce a profits based tax, and the question of optionality goes to the rate of such a tax. Can I say to those opposite, therefore, that when they engage in -  - Furthermore, the report says that, in Chile, mining companies will likely reject the tax increase. This debate is universal. Mining companies around the world do not want to pay more tax. In this country we believe that mining companies should pay more tax when prices are high for a resource owned by the Australian people. We believe the Australian people deserve a fairer share. We believe they deserve a fairer share for better super for working families, a fairer share for small businesses and their tax concerns and a fairer share for the regions that need infrastructure invested in them. This is a debate between those who support the reform and those who oppose the reform. Those who support the reform believe a profits based regime for the future is the right way to go.The Leader of the Opposition stands with his new best friend, the pin-up boy of the Liberal-National Party, Clive Palmer, as the two voices out there opposed to any profits based reform in the mining industry. There will be a range of claims and counterclaims. You will have people right across the industry commenting on it. You will have people like Roger Corbett who came out quite rightly and said as a director of Fairfax Media and Wal-Mart - and he is also on the Reserve Bank - that these are resources owned by Australians and that Australians should extract from those resources the best possible advantage that they can. In principle, he supports a resources tax.Therefore, those opposite will simply take a position in this debate which is subservient to the likes of Clive Palmer in pursuit of a sectional interest and in pursuit of an individual who bankrolls the Liberal-National Party in Queensland to the tune of nearly $1 million. They do not stand for the national interest; they stand for a partial interest; they stand for an individual corporate interest. We are about the business of tax reform for the nation. We stand on one side of the debate prosecuting a hard debate on tax reform. Those opposite have evidenced no spine for tax reform whatsoever.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and for his interest in supporting jobs and schools. I also thank him for his interest in a strong economy and in making sure that Australian working people can get a fair share, particularly through having a quality school for their children to go to. I noticed the interjection from the other side. Obviously, we know that it is this side of the House that believes in a strong economy, in supporting jobs and in giving Australians a fair share through a good school. In the member for Solomon's own electorate he voted for, and those opposite voted against, 20 libraries, seven classrooms, 16 multipurpose halls, three early learning centres, four language centres and one science centre.On this side of the House, we voted for 24,000 projects in individual schools and those on that side of the House voted against them. On this side of the House, we voted for what has formed one-third of the economic activity in the non-residential sector over the last 12 months to April and those on that side of the House voted against that economic activity - a third of the economic activity in that sector and a third of the jobs.In dealing with Building the Education Revolution as economic stimulus, the program has been rolled out quickly. With 24,000 projects, we have always said that there would be school communities that were delighted with their projects, that there were school communities that would have some concerns, including concerns about value for money. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Of course, we have always said that there will be school communities delighted and some that needed assistance and had concerns. That is why we created the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce. We need to be dealing with the facts. That brings me to a report in today's Australian newspaper which suggested that a project in the Larrakeyah Primary School in Darwin was poor, that the school was unhappy and that the project was of such poor value that it was even smaller than the local McDonald's. I advise the House that I have today spoken to the school principal, Mr Graham Chadwick. He advises me and I advise the House of the following. He says that in his school Building the Education Revolution has been a fantastic program from the start. As soon as it was announced, he started work with the school council's infrastructure committee.A former student of the school, Hully Liveris, serves on that committee. He is an architect and his wife Emma teaches part time in the school. Hully, the school principal Graham, and Richard Wiltshire, who is president of the school council, the commander of the local Larrakeyah base and a former student of the school, worked with Des Hodges, the project manager appointed by the Northern Territory education department to deliver transformational change to that school and they are delighted with it. The school is growing in numbers because the Defence Force base is growing in numbers. At the same time the school serves around 120 students who live in apartment developments in Darwin, part of the new residential construction in that city. This meant that the school needed additional classrooms but was very concerned to keep its local play area available, particularly for the kids who live in the apartments. - As a result, the school community worked to deliver a project which is delivering an extended assembly hall with an integrated canteen which is big enough for the whole school community. The entrance to the school has been remodelled and redesigned so that it is now near this assembly area. This means that kids from the local Defence Force base can come into school without having to go near the area where the cars are - obviously safer. As a result of this development, the old canteen, which was in the middle of the play area used by the early education facility has been demolished. A demountable which was on a strip of under-used land close to the boundary with the Defence Force base has been removed and another school will benefit from that demountable. The five new classrooms have been placed there. As a result of this design, there is an additional space in the assembly hall, the new canteen, five new classrooms and additional play areas to that which were in the original design of the school.In addition, the old Cyclone fencing has been removed and replaced with powder coated pool fencing. There is a feature timber wall on one side of the school as a barrier between them and local industrial projects which are on the other side. All fittings and furniture have been included like interactive white boards in each of the classrooms, desks, chairs, industrial fridges, bain-maries, and the list goes on. The principal says that he is delighted with the project and so is the local P&amp;C.The member for Solomon is very familiar with this school and would be able to give interested members further details of this Building the Education Revolution project. The member for Solomon also advises me that he has some passing familiarity with the local McDonald's to which it has been compared. What he says is that the local McDonald's is small, predominantly designed to facilitate drive-through on two sides - that is, it is big in car park, big in drive-through but a relatively small building. Anybody requiring further details of that may also choose to ask the member for Solomon.All of this adds up to the fact that in dealing with the Building the Education Revolution I want to get value for money. The government wants to get value for money. In order to do that, each and every day we need to deal with the facts. I have advised the House of the facts about Larrakeyah Primary School as explained to me by the school principal.</DOC>

 - I welcome yet another question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She came to the dispatch box before seeking to assert that mining tax changes were somehow unique to this country and uniquely, therefore, punishing the mining industry in this country. The purpose of my intervention in the debate was twofold: firstly, to demonstrate that mining stocks in Latin America and Canada had done worse than in Australia and, secondly, there is a debate in the Chilean congress now on changes to Chile's mining tax laws that are increasing those mining taxes and the mining industry is opposed to them. That is the purpose of this intervention.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for that question because there is good news for expectant mothers and their families in the reforms that the Rudd government is introducing. I must say I think that the member for Dobell's baby and partner are in the audience. Perhaps particularly baby Matilda might be interested in this answer. I did not know that they would be there when we were preparing our question. There is good news because the package of maternity reforms that are starting to come on line do offer many more choices for women and their families if they are expecting children to make sure that women can access high-quality, safe maternity care as well as providing support for our talented midwives. We have introduced a package of services to provide new and innovative options for thousands of Australian women and their families - improved Medicare rebates for doctors, historic recognition for midwives and a new insurance product to ensure appropriate professional protection.Members might recall that earlier this year the government passed reforms in this House providing MBS and PBS access to midwives and nurse practitioners, the first expansion of front-line access to a new professional group in the last 25 years. When this reform takes effect on 1 November this year it will expand choices for women and reduce financial pressure on those who choose midwifery care in the community. I also wanted to bring to the attention of the House that our $120 million package also includes the government establishing a new government supported professional indemnity scheme for eligible midwives. This insurance product is now available for sale and its coverage will commence on 1 July.Something that the House has not had reported to it to date is another initiative starting on 1 July - an expanded and improved pregnancy, birth and baby hotline. This new expanded helpline will provide more comprehensive care and advice and information to women during pregnancy on any concerns they might have with the demands of a new baby, including maternal nutrition, breastfeeding, a baby's development and sleeping habits. An estimated 180,000 women and their families are expected to access this new helpline. Although the Leader of the Opposition has been talking through most of this answer, I think even he will be pleased to know that funding will be provided to SIDS and Kids, PANDA, SANDS and Bonnie Babes Foundation to provide referral services and peer support for those mums experiencing, for example, perinatal depression or grief through miscarriage or stillbirth. This helpline will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week and will offer non-directive, non-denominational professional advice. - The member for Dickson is forgetting that a promise made in an election campaign by the Liberal Party without funding and not during his time of government does not count as a commitment that they ever delivered. It is our government delivering funding to SIDS and Kids, PANDA and Bonnie Babes and he is quite determined to misrepresent this new announcement and new service, something that they should be ashamed that they never provided.What we want to do is offer help to new mums during what can be a very exciting time but can also sometimes be difficult and confusing. We want to provide help and information and choice to women, not give them a lecture. This is in stark contrast to the complete failure of the Leader of the Opposition's own baby and that was the National Pregnancy Support Helpline. Mr Abbott's pregnancy helpline was one of the few decisions that he actually made to expand health services as a health minister. The only problem was he allowed his personal beliefs to interfere and get in the way of providing completely accessible and non-judgmental public services. Since $13.3 million was put into the helpline from May 2007, it has received just 5,500 calls. That is five calls a day over three years at a cost of more than $2,000 per call. No wonder women did not call this hotline of the Leader of the Opposition, it could not give women information about depression, breastfeeding and family planning. It could only counsel options of what was available but not provide any information beyond that, forcing callers sometimes to go to Google or the Yellow Pages if they wanted to make contact with any other service provider or information service.The reason for those problems is that Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, does not live in the real world or understand the information that many women and girls might want and need. Unfortunately, he has a record of judging women through his own extreme views. He jokes about women and their ironing. He is on the record as saying that he is dead against paid maternity leave. And he used his position as the health minister to make it hard for women to get information and support, failing to understand the trauma, grief and outright dilemmas that many women experience. - Let us be honest: if this discussion was just about personal views, it is entirely a matter for the Leader of the Opposition. But when your personal views interfere with the national policies that you make then it is a problem. This help line will provide real help and real services for women. We are proud that we are not letting our personal or extreme views interfere with the policies that are being supported. Women need and want this service. We are pleased to provide it. It will be a valuable service. It will stand in stark contrast to the service provided by the Leader of the Opposition, who wanted to deny information and support to women at times when they needed it.</DOC>

 - I always welcome questions from the member for North Sydney, because volume and substance are always in inverse proportions. The member for North Sydney enters this debate pretending that somehow he stands on the side of the angels when it comes to tax reform. The reality around the world is very simple: whether in Chile, Brazil, Canada, South Africa or anywhere else in the world, mining companies do not wish to pay more tax. Guess what? In this country the Australian government wants mining companies to pay more tax. The reason that we want them to pay more tax is to fund better super for all those Australian families who are listening into this debate today. Those Australian families are worried about whether their nine per cent is going to give them enough to retire upon when they get to the age of 65. That is standing up for working families.We are also standing up for 2.4 million Australian small businesses, who deserve a tax break. - They need the support of this government. Then we go to the broader needs of the economy and the need to support Australian corporates - all 770,000 - who would benefit, I am advised, from a two per cent cut in the company tax rate, a rate which the Leader of the Opposition plans to increase by two percentage points. - The member for North Sydney seeks to intervene to suggest that somehow it is unique to this country that there is a debate about the future of tax change. It is not. The underpinning point put by the member for Curtin before was that somehow our mining industry was suffering in relation to that of other countries. To the extent that the stock exchanges are measurements of this, I draw her and his attention again to what is happening in Canada, Brazil and around the world in terms of the performance of our mining stocks relative to the rest.I go back to the core point, which is that those opposite stand in this place as defenders of the interests of Clive Palmer. Clive Palmer says that there should be no change to the existing tax regime for the Australian mining industry. This government stands for reform of the tax system in Australia. This government stands for bringing in a profits based tax for the mining industry in Australia.In this country, we have the mining industry, its peak body and the heads of most of the major mining companies saying that that is the sort of reform - a profits based regime - that we need for the future. Those opposite, led by the Leader of the Opposition and Clive Palmer, say that it is all fine and dandy. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition goes further and says that they are already paying too much tax. Nobody in this country believes that. No-one in this country accepts the view that the poor old miners cannot fork out an extra dollar to help working families. It does not matter where they are in this country, people see this fear campaign for what it is. We stand for facts in this debate; those opposite stand for fear.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. It is extremely important that registered political parties have stable and coherent candidate selection processes in order to enable Australian voters to know who they might be voting for, to become acquainted with individual candidates so they can exercise genuine choice. Unfortunately, as the string of points of order have just indicated, there are serious problems with these processes in the Queensland Liberal National Party. First we had the member for Dickson scuttling away to McPherson to try to become their candidate there. He was rejected. Then he went back to Dickson. And more recently we have had the member for Ryan disendorsed by the Liberal Party -  - It is a matter of public record that the member for Ryan has been disendorsed by the Liberal Party. It is also a matter of public record that their candidate for Wright, Hajnal Ban, has recently been disendorsed. And of course there is speculation regarding the candidate for Forde, Bert van Manen - published in the Courier-Mail today. He is under threat of disendorsement with local party members moving a motion to disendorse him, and a senior Liberal National Party source was quoted as describing him as 'safe for now'. We all know what 'safe for now' means. Clearly they are setting themselves up for another disendorsement. I note that the Gold Coast Bulletin indicates that the next candidate for preselection, the next cab off the rank, for the seat of Wright will be a certain Bob La Castra, a former scriptwriter for Bananas in Pyjamas. Given the opposition's problems with policy development, I think that is an ideal candidate for the Liberal National Party. He could write some pretty good policies.It is not only this side of the House that is concerned by those problems. The Courier-Mail in its editorial today has referred to a 'crisis of faith' in the Liberal National Party and described the party as a 'rabble'. The Australian in its editorial has referred to 'the forest of deadwood MPs and senators', 'a batch of dud candidates', 'a team of time-servers' and 'the amateurish, insular world of LNP politics'. Former member for Longman and former minister Mal Brough described the situation thus: 'Queenslanders have a right to feel let down, disappointed and led up the garden path. There is no Liberal or National with a federal focus for them to support.'It appears that there is more to come because the candidate for Longman for the Liberal National Party, one Wyatt Roy, appears also to be under threat of disendorsement. Recently in an interview on 4BC, within the one interview he managed to claim that both sides of politics supported the invasion of Iraq, which of course is not true. He then said that he did not know which year this invasion occurred. He then said that the Liberal National Party did not have a policy on child support. When asked for the party's policy on asylum seekers he said, 'Well as we have said, we will turn back the boats, we will _ ah _ go through the process of turning them into legitimate _ ah _ arrivals and we will begin to look at that _ how we go about doing that.'So they clearly have a state of extreme confusion. And the problem for Mr Wyatt Roy is that he has been effusively endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition. The reason that is a problem is because the member for Ryan was previously effusively endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition, and Hajnal Ban was also effusively endorsed by the Leader of the Opposition - shortly before being disendorsed. The Leader of the National Party has even described Mr Roy as a future prime minister. Those of us who know the Leader of the National Party can probably understand that because most of the people he encounters probably look like future prime ministers to him.There is a very serious aspect to this. The Australian people deserve better than this rabble. They deserve better than the chaos that is occurring in the Liberal National Party in Queensland because people are entitled to understand who they are being asked to vote for, to become acquainted with them, to hear what they have got to say and to know what they are on about. They are being denied that opportunity in Queensland. The Liberal National Party in Queensland is demonstrating yet again the merit of Bob Hawke's old saying, 'If you cannot govern yourselves, you cannot govern the country.'</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition acting for the Leader of the Opposition for the question. Of course, what the government has said consistently about the resource super profits tax is that there would be consultation with industry. We are actually in a process that started around two years ago with the Henry tax review and with the extensive consultations undertaken for the formulation of the Henry tax review, including the receipt of around 1,300 submissions. At the moment, there is consultation involving around 80 companies. Each of those consultations is important to the government. There was consultation yesterday involving the Treasurer and the resources minister, who met with the executives of BHP, Rio Tinto and Xstrata. I do not propose to go into any of the details of those discussions as they are confidential, but I do note that those discussions continue with the around 80 companies involved in the consultations. The government is seriously engaged in that process. Of course, it is appropriate for the Treasurer and for the resources minister as well as the Prime Minister himself to participate in these consultations and in the various meetings that are occurring. Each of those ministers, including the Prime Minister, is participating.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question - the first sensible one we have heard today. I know that the member for Corangamite, like all members on this side of the House, is desperately concerned that working Australians have the benefit of a strong economy and the benefit of work. We understand that, when working Australians lose their jobs, it can be a personal tragedy for them and for their families. During the global financial crisis and global recession that threatened this country, the government did what we needed to do to keep the economy going. This month we saw our unemployment rate decrease to 5.2 per cent and our GDP grow by 0.5 per cent in the March quarter. What these figures make clear - and they are particularly clear from the national accounts figures - is that our economic growth is being underpinned by stimulus spending. For example, take the Building the Education Revolution program alone, which is responsible for around a third of the economic activity in the non-residential building sector to April 2010. We should reflect one moment and compare this with the kind of unemployment rates being experienced overseas - the United States at 9.7 per cent, the eurozone at more than 10 per cent and the UK at almost eight per cent, representing a tragedy for literally millions of working people.As Australians, we know that in times past, when there have been economic difficulties, it has taken a long time for us to climb out of those economic difficulties, particularly a long time for us to see unemployment rates start to fall. In the 1990s unemployment climbed to 10.9 per cent and long-term unemployment peaked at more than 32 per cent. It took around eight years to fall back to pre-recession levels of six per cent. In the recession of the early eighties, the unemployment rate climbed to more than 10 per cent. It took five years to fall down to the pre-recessionary levels of six per cent. In these circumstances, we should be saying to ourselves and to each other that it is great for working families that we are already seeing unemployment fall following the economic downturn brought to this country by the global financial crisis and global recession. -  - Of course, I do not expect the opposition to indicate any interest in the jobs of working Australians, because if we had followed their strategy an extra 200,000 working Australians would have been out of work and we would have seen this nation in a deep recession. In addition to the tragedy of unemployment, there is also the loss of skills and the loss of the ability to give young Australians a start. If we look at earlier economic downturns - let's look at the early 1980s - we saw a 28.7 per cent drop in the 1980s in apprenticeship commencements and it took five years to recover to pre-recession levels. In the 1990s there was a 35 per cent drop and it took 13 years to get to pre-recession levels.In this economic downturn, on the early data we can say we are already moving to returning to pre-recession levels. We do not want to see a generation of young Australians stranded. If we had taken the advice of the opposition, we would have seen that generation stranded. We would have seen more than 200,000 extra Australians out of work. In terms of analysing this advice from the opposition much has been made of their economic folly and their inability to analyse and respond to what needed to be done in the face of the global financial crisis and global recession. I think there is more at work here than simply that kind of economic folly. There is malice at work because they showed in government their complete indifference to working Australians, their job security and their needs by introducing Work Choices. In opposition, through denying economic stimulus, they continue to show that complete indifference to the needs of working families to have a job.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question and note that it is based on the normal level of research the opposition does for question time. That is, they get out the newspapers, have a little read of them, spot an article, get out the scissors, clip it out and then bring it in and base the question on it. It is an act of pure genius that they are capable of reading the newspapers. I do not want to deny the shadow Treasurer an answer to his question based on his cut and paste, so the answer is as follows: the Minister for Trade attended a meeting of senior departmental staff of his department on 10 May in Canberra. He spoke to those staff and addressed a range of policy issues. As part of those remarks I understand that the minister urged the officials of his department to engage more closely with other departments and become more active in the policy development process and that is a good thing. - The shadow Treasurer may want to just listen for one moment about his cut and paste. I am advised that the Sydney Morning Herald report of the minister's remarks is not accurate. The shadow Treasurer may want to listen to that. The problem with cut and paste and the lack of original research is once again on display.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. As a health professional herself she always takes a particular interest in these issues. There is a lot of very good news in the latest report that has been released by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. It is showing good news for those families and Australians, the very many millions of them, who rely on public hospitals for their treatment, whether it is elective surgery, turning up in emergency departments or for a range of outpatient services. We are proud of the fact that, when the Rudd government was elected, we made commitments which immediately boosted funding to our hospitals. We were repairing an enormous amount of damage that was left by the Leader of the Opposition in his time as the health minister.The latest report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that hospitals have started to benefit as the funding starts to hit the front line. This report shows that there has been a very big increase in the amount of elective surgery performed. If you want to compare the 2008-09 year of this report with the last year of the former government, 2006-07, when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister, 38,000 additional elective surgery procedures have been undertaken. It surprises me that some of those opposite are murmuring because a large number of those 38,000 people would live in their electorates as they do across the entire country. It means they are not waiting as long as they used to for their surgery.Have a listen to these figures. Public elective surgery increased by 3.1 per cent. This is over and above the previous average increases, which might account for population growth of 1.7 per cent - a very significant increase. Importantly, the number of people who are waiting longer than a year for their surgery, the very long wait patients, has dropped from 4.8 per cent in 2004-05 down to 2.9 per cent in 2008-09. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report notes that this was the first year of the Rudd government's targeted $600 million election commitment to improve access to elective surgery. That increased the number of Australians who are obtaining their surgery on time.Just as importantly, this report shows another significant jump, which I would have thought all in the House would welcome. This is in the number of doctors and nurses working in our public hospitals. There are now more doctors and nurses than ever before. In 2008-09, there were an additional 2,200 more doctors at work, an eight per cent increase from the previous year. We have also welcomed an additional 4,781 nurses, a 4½ per cent increase from the previous years. These new doctors and nurses are delivering more services to Australian families and to patients across the country.The report also notes - and I think particularly on this side of the House people will be interested - that the Commonwealth's share of hospital funding increased for the first time in the decade in 2007-08 as the Rudd government's election commitments started to pay off in hospital services. Of course, this means that our reform plans are starting to deliver more on-time surgery, more doctors and nurses and more funding for the front line. - Those opposite might actually start interjecting at this point because they know that this stands in stark contrast to the record of the Leader of the Opposition. He made it harder to access elective surgery. He cut $1 billion from our hospitals, never put a single cent into elective surgery, made it harder for Australians to access GPs by putting a cap on GP training places and left the country with a shortage of 6,000 nurses. Tony Abbott's legacy was to make it harder for Australians to get access to public health services. - The Leader of the Opposition's legacy made it harder for Australians to get access to public health services. The most depressing part about this is that the Liberal Party have indicated that we are about to go for another around. They want to cut another billion dollars out of our health services - from primary care, from e-health and now also from diabetes. What today's report makes clear is that, if you do invest strategically, you can turn around some of the statistics of our public hospitals, but if you cut money, which the Liberal Party now say they want to do if they are re-elected, we will just go back to the bad old days. That is a risk Australians cannot afford.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I stand by my answer of last Tuesday. I repeat what the Deputy Prime Minister has had to say. The trouble with your side of the House is that there is no attention to detail, no capacity for creativity and the only thing you ever run off is what you read in the newspaper. You do not even go past the front page and then you do not even bother to check whether or not it is accurate. -  - Mr Speaker, it is true that I attended a DFAT retreat session -  -  - I do not think they are interested in the answer, Mr Speaker. -  - If they looked at the article, they would see that the session was on 10 May. So we are not just talking about a report on the front page today which is inaccurate; it relates to a discussion I had back on 10 May. It is also true that, while that discussion was Chatham House rules, I can confirm a number of things because it is important -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is important - because people are trying to misrepresent it - that I say a number of things on the record. It is true that I had a discussion with the department about the importance of interacting more with other departments of government. That is because we take the view that trade has implications beyond just trade negotiations, that we actually understand the economic dynamics of trade and the importance of having engagement across portfolios. That is a statement I have made on a number of occasions including in this House. I also believe it is important that within the department there is more interaction and engagement with the agencies of the department - with Austrade, AusAID and EFIC. What is not accurate is that I told departmental officials that I found out about the details of the Henry tax review and the changes to the timing of the CPRS legislation in newspapers. I did not say that to the media. - I said it on the radio, did I? I think the opposition needs to understand the importance of what it stands for. Let me go to this point because, as I understand it, the question that is asked -  -  - The truth is that had those on the other side bothered to read a statement that was put out by me earlier today they would have understood that point. But let me also go to what the thrust of this question is about. As I understand it - if I have this right - what we are being accused of is being a government that is not consulting with the full executive. - Is that the nature of the complaint?The member for Dickson then left the chamber. -  - Me? - I just remind the House that the thrust of this question was about the lack of consultation. Let me just remind the House about the Leader of the Opposition being forced to apologise, back in March, to his colleagues for failing to consult them on his plan to tax big business to fund a 26-week paid maternity leave scheme. This is the person who is accusing us of putting taxes up, and he not only introduces a tax increase of 1.7 per cent, he fails to consult. What has this got to do with it? It has got to do with the fact that you have no consultation. You are a sclerotic group over there with no creativity and no ideas -  - and you come into the House accusing us of it! So what was the Leader of the Opposition's statement, then? Mr Abbott, in defence of that failure -  - The Leader of the Opposition's answer to his failure to consult is: sometimes it is better to ask forgiveness than permission. The next time he wanted to go into his party room with a proposal for acceptance - this was the $10,000 stay at home payment for mums - rather than showing forgiveness they just rejected him. So do not come into this place and lecture us about lack of consultation.I said the other day that I was consulted in relation to the RSPT. I stand by that. What I do say is that this is a government that is united in the purpose of better returns to this nation of what the nation owns, and that is the resource base.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for Ballarat for her question, because on Tuesday this week 25,000 Australians delivered a very clear message to this parliament. Whether they were nurses, teachers, hospitality workers, construction workers, or students and their mums and dads and grandparents, they all signed a petition calling on each and every one of us - all of their elected representatives - to do the right thing and vote for Australia's first paid parental leave scheme.Australian families have been waiting decades for paid parental leave, and now legislation for Australia's first paid parental leave scheme is in the final stages of passage through this parliament. When the bill passes, Australia will finally catch up with the rest of the developed world and deliver this vital support for families. Under our scheme, eligible families will receive 18 weeks of paid parental leave, paid at the federal minimum wage. It will start on 1 January next year. Of course, the scheme designed by the government is fully costed and fully funded in the budget. It is fair to both businesses and families. This will be a huge win for Australian families. Parents will finally get the support that they need to stay home with their newborn babies. Of course, it means that children will get a better start in life.Businesses too will benefit. They will be able to retain their skilled workers and we will see particular advantages for seasonal workers, casual workers, contract workers and the self-employed. They will now get access to paid parental leave. For many of them it will be for the first time.One of the particular advantages of the government scheme is that families will have support to make their own work and family choices. Under our scheme parents will be able to transfer the leave so that mums and dads will have more options for balancing their work and family lives, because on this side of the chamber we recognise that in today's families more and more dads want to be more hands-on at home. This is a historic reform. It has been a very long time coming, and it is this government that is going to deliver Australia's first paid parental leave scheme.</DOC>

 - On this side of the House jobs, jobs and jobs go to the heart of our agenda - jobs, jobs and more jobs. If those on that side of the House had had their way last year, this country would have been in recession. But, because we took action to stimulate the economy and to support demand, jobs in this country have grown by 250,000 over the past year - something everybody on this side of the House is proud of. Where would this country be if those opposite had been in control? We would be in recession.When it comes to getting the big economic calls right, we on this side of the House got that call right and those on the other side of the House got it dead wrong. When I go to G20 meetings and sit down with finance ministers, they say -  - Central to the government's reform agenda, central to the modernisation of resource taxation, central to the boost for superannuation, central to the investment in infrastructure and central to the cut in company tax is to support jobs and business in this economy. That is what is central to our agenda. I can absolutely guarantee that the rounds of reform that we are putting in place will grow our economy for the long term.What are we dealing with here? We are dealing with an opposition that mismanaged the last mining boom. As a consequence of their mismanagement, they put upward pressure on inflation and capacity constraints emerged in our economy. We on this side of the House are absolutely intent on making sure that we manage mining boom mark 2 so we maximise all of the opportunities that will flow from that for all of our citizens - and, of course, that includes supporting employment.Let us take the example of small business. If those opposite had had their way during the global financial crisis, tens of thousands of small businesses would have hit the wall and tens of thousands of people would have lost their jobs. What we are going to do now as the economy recovers is put in place a generation of reforms that will support economic growth, that will deal with capacity constraints, that will invest in infrastructure and that will make all of our companies much more competitive.What are those on the other side of the House saying about our proposal? They are saying that the mining companies in this country pay too much tax. Effectively they are arguing for a tax cut for the mining industry, plus they are going to increase the corporate rate by 1.7 per cent for all companies over a certain level. So there is a big tax out there, a very big tax slug from those opposite, for Australian corporates. We are asking some of the very profitable mining companies in this country to pay a fair share of their superprofits to the owners of those resources - the Australian people. As the price of commodities goes through the roof, those opposite have the extraordinary proposition that the Australian people should not get a fair share of it. - We on this side of the House will not sit here and watch those windfall profits walk straight out the door. They have to be used to create employment and support businesses in this country to deal with the challenges that will flow from mining boom mark 2. We will not sit back and let that rip-off continue. We on this side of the House are determined to ensure that a fair system is put in place so we can grow our whole economy, all of our businesses can grow together, we can deal with our capacity constraints and we can support employment, particularly in small business.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question and for her ongoing interest in infrastructure in her regional community in Queensland. The Minerals Council of Australia made it very clear when Mitch Hooke said on 26 May 2009:There are significant gaps in Australia's export infrastructure and some of the nation's existing capital is in a state of disrepair __            _            __ too often governments in the past have abrogated their responsibility to local communities and thus constrained the investment that private sector has wanted to make.These are issues that are raised with us by state governments, by local governments and indeed by the private sector. We have argued that there is a great need for infrastructure investment, particularly in states such as Western Australia and Queensland. The Leader of the Opposition has argued that that is the job of the private sector - they are doing it all and there is no need for the government's Regional Infrastructure Fund.I am asked about what the attitude is of mining companies. I certainly acknowledge that I receive continual representations. Just this week a letter BHP Billiton wrote to me on 11 June was received in my office, on 15 June. It goes to the heart of both infrastructure need and the government's plan to address that infrastructure need. It says it all about why the Regional Infrastructure Fund is necessary. I will read some of the letter because I think it speaks louder than some of the rhetoric we are hearing in this debate:Dear MinisterThe purpose of this letter is to outline concerns in relation to an area on the Landsborough Highway that BHP Billiton Cannington Mine believes to be a significant hazard to all motorists. This highway is heavily travelled by large trucks and general motorists as well as the Cannington Mine personnel.It goes on to say:In February this year a Toll North truck carrying Cannington Mine concentrate was involved in a crash at Rutchillo Creek.It further goes on to say:This is the second event that we are aware of where a truck has crashed at this location. The previous event occurred on 28 October 2006 when a Mitchell Corp truck carrying gravel travelling south met another truck travelling north at Rutchillo Creek.Since the event in February this year, BHP Billiton Cannington Mine, working with Toll North, has undertaken research relating to road conditions and crashes in the area. The research indicates that a zone from Nora Creek through to Bull Creek is highly dangerous.And it goes on to say:It is our belief that this area represents a significant risk to all motorists using the road and that an urgent upgrade is required.It puts some of the debate that we are having at the moment in its proper context: that we know that the resources boom is putting real pressure on infrastructure and that has an impact on all those who work directly in the industry but also those who live around those communities.I acknowledge the fact that these are genuine concerns raised by BHP Billiton, as are other concerns raised by major resource companies and indeed by the trade unions that represent those workers, such as the Mining Division of the CFMEU, and the Australian Workers Union. If anyone was in any doubt whatsoever about the need to make sure we are in a position to invest in infrastructure in those regional mining communities, this letter says it all, in the words of BHP Billiton. I table the letter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. As the Prime Minister has made clear, and as the Treasurer has made clear even as recently as his answer to a question in question time today, obviously in considering the resource super profits tax we considered what was best for economic reform and economic growth in this country. The member raises with me the circumstances of businesses in his local community. Well, let us actually look at the resource super profits tax package, because the member might like to reflect on this question: is it in the interests of businesses in his local community to have a company tax cut? Is it in the interests of business in his local community to have the special tax benefits for small businesses? - I was asking whether the member for Grey may have reflected on the benefits for small businesses in his community of the new small business tax write-off arrangements that are in this package. Of course the government, in designing the resource super profits tax, considered what was appropriate to ensure that the nation benefited from this resources boom, that we still continued to see mining companies grow and make good profits, that we still continued to see working people who work in mining earn good wages and that we could see a fair share for the nation overall, including the companies and small businesses in his electorate as well as the working Australians whose superannuation would grow from nine to 12 per cent in his electorate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for the question and in doing so remind the House that, yes, from Australia's point of view the outlook for Australia's resources sector has never been brighter. -  - Yes, Mr Speaker, all they can ever do is talk Australia down. -  - We as a nation have always been rich in natural assets. The real issue is our capacity to develop those natural assets by putting the necessary reforms in place. In that context I remind the House that demand for Australia's LNG is set to grow. One of the reasons is the tough debate this government took on 25 years ago about the introduction of a petroleum resource rent tax, which saw the biggest ever investment in Australia's history - the Gorgon project of $43 billion - last year. Similarly, demand for our minerals continues to grow because of the growth in China - and we all have regard for the Indian market that is yet to come on. One of the reasons we are well placed is the key reforms that Labor in government took on in the eighties and the nineties. It was those reforms that well positioned Australia for the challenge that confronts us in the 21st century.Labor has always been up to standing up for reform in Australia. We have lost market share in the last decade because of the failure of the Howard government year in and year out to invest in infrastructure and to invest in the skilling of Australia. Just think about the reforms that set up Australia under the Hawke and Keating governments, reforms quite often opposed by the coalition because they are never interested in Australia's national interests - they continually talk Australia down domestically and internationally. Let us go to some of those reforms: the floating of the dollar; embracing free trade and open markets globally; our engagement with Asia, which has given us the market opportunities in China and India; the issue of introducing productivity bargaining - something I know a little bit about - and the capacity to negotiate -  - Yes, Labor in government is proud of its reforming record. I understand why the coalition wants to run away from this debate, because it was never up to the tough debates about reforming Australia. I also remind the House of the importance of the savings and retirement income debate and introducing the superannuation guarantee.It is for those reasons that we have decided to take on another tough process of reform - the issue of Australia fronting up to the debate about a resource super profit tax, a profits based tax system, something that the minerals sector demanded that Australia put in place, something that was on the table for consideration under the Howard government, something that the Howard government ran away from and something that we are prepared to actually take forward to conclusion.This debate is about certainty. It is about fairly rewarding risk and it is about providing the Australian community with a fair return for the nation's resources. Think about the broader aspects of this debate. Yes, it is about a new approach to a profits based tax system in Australia, but it is also about infrastructure. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government referred earlier today to demands by the Minerals Council of Australia for us as a nation to invest in infrastructure. Infrastructure, to the coalition, was not about fixing the Australian national railway system; it was not about investing moneys in Port Hedland roads; it was not about fixing Esperance port; it was about projects such as Tumbi Creek. We can all remember the 'Regional Rorts' program and the coalition's approach to infrastructure. There we had a creek that drained itself, but what did the coalition do? It decided to allocate scarce Australian dollars to put in place a so-called draining opportunity.The member for Canning then left the chamber. - Yes, Mr Speaker. I am talking about infrastructure and skilling and the associated processes of government. The coalition has referred to a few media articles in question time today. I have also come across an interesting media article, in the Australian of yesterday. It is about the member for Curtin, the Acting Leader of the Opposition. I think this really goes to the national interest debate at the moment. - Mr Speaker, it goes to the serious question of consultation with industry. - I will show you, Mr Speaker. It refers directly to consultation with industry - yes, the member for Curtin's consultation. It says:Forget the publicity shots next to Twiggy Forrest -  - That is why the article goes on to talk about backroom discussions and consultations.</DOC>

 - It is terrific to finally have a question about housing affordability from the opposition, who took house prices from about four times annual income to about seven times annual income during their term in government. -  - Have a look at interest rates and the unaffordability that we saw because of interest rate increases that, when you were in government, you promised would never happen. Turning for a moment to the suggestion that has been made about the mining tax and housing costs, this is an absolute furphy that is being perpetuated once again by the self-interest of the opposition in league with their bosses, the mining companies - bought and paid for by the Australian mining companies.We know that what is affecting housing affordability is the huge investment that this government has made in ensuring that more homes are built. Half a billion dollars through the Housing Affordability Fund has helped thousands of Australian home buyers buy a more affordable home. Hundreds of thousands of blocks and homes are more affordable because of the Housing Affordability Fund. More than a quarter of a million Australians have been helped into a home of their own by the first home owner boost, seeing the largest proportion of first home buyers entering the market in decades. I will tell you something else. -  - I will. I will tell you a lot more. If you had bothered to read beyond page 1 of the newspapers, you would have found that the ABS statistics for the March quarter on housing construction say that one in seven homes being built at the moment are being built -  - Mr Speaker, I will finish on this point. It is to say that if you look at the March quarter statistics from the ABS on housing starts you will find that one in seven homes are being built because of this government's investment in stimulus - one in seven housing starts and one in seven housing jobs that would not have happened if you had been in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question, and I acknowledge her support for her 55,500 constituents that stand to benefit from this government's superannuation reforms. There is no question that there are challenges confronting Australian women in building adequate retirement incomes. Research released last year showed that the average payout for a woman on retirement was only $73,000 compared to $155,000 for men. As a result of this difference, men hold about 60 per cent of superannuation balances while women hold over 30 per cent.A report issued yesterday by the Melbourne Institute showed that women aged 55 to 59 are expected to live for 21 years in retirement despite having only adequate retirement incomes for two years. That is exactly the reason for the government's reforms to superannuation - to bring in more fairness to the superannuation system in Australia. Our changes will result in increased retirement savings for 4.1 million women across the country, including 2.1 million women on lower incomes and 100,000 Australian women over 50 who will be able to access the improved concessions for top-up payments to superannuation.As I said before, the member for Parramatta can report to her constituents that she is supporting 55,000 of those constituents in getting better superannuation payments. But some members elsewhere in Sydney will have a more difficult task. Take, for example, the seat of Hughes. There, the Liberal candidate will need to report to the people of Hughes why he opposes 53,000 of them getting better superannuation benefits. He will need to justify to 27,000 women in Hughes why he stands against them getting better superannuation payments and why he opposes 7,500 women over 50 getting better superannuation benefits through increased superannuation concessions. That is what the Liberal Party will need to justify to the people of Hughes, and that is what the Liberal candidate for Hughes will need to explain to the people - why he stands against them getting better superannuation benefits. I think the impact of the government's superannuation reforms were perhaps best summed up by Fiona Reynolds, Chief Executive of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, when she said: 'It's all about building a fair and just society that takes care of those who need it most, and those who say now is the wrong time - they were wrong 25 years ago when we introduced super and they are wrong now.'I am asked about the impact of our tax reforms on people's retirement incomes, and this is something those opposite have been very voluble about. They have been very vocal about the impact on retirement incomes. They have claimed that the resource super profits tax is a tax on the retirement incomes of Australians. I am sure every honourable member welcomed the report last week from the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia which showed that the claims of the opposition are complete dross - complete dross; it hit them for six. As the Australian Financial Review said:_ the ASFA position debunks a central claim in the mining industry advertising campaign against the resource super profits tax - that ordinary superannuation investors would suffer if the tax was imposed.So the opposition's arguments that these reforms and this tax would damage retirement savings have been dismissed as scaremongering by those who would know best - those responsible for superannuation funds in Australia, the trustees and those who run the funds. The opposition say: 'What would they know? They only run the superannuation industry.' They know better. Well, the superannuation industry has got news for them: they are wrong. They are talking nonsense - more bad news for the opposition and their scare campaign on the resource super profits tax.But there is at least one member opposite who has received some good news. I am sure he is already aware of this, because he would be in his office, looking at his computer, checking it out at the moment - and I know many members on this side are concerned for the welfare of the member for Dickson! I can inform the House that during question time BHP has again been trading for more than it cost on the day the member for Dickson bought his shares. Again, he makes a much better investor than he would a minister, I think it is fair to say -  - I think it is fair to say the member for Dickson's share campaign -  -  - has been a whole lot more successful than the opposition's scare campaign. - I withdraw.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question and I am sure that his concerns about the circumstances of aged care in his electorate and more broadly are very genuine. I am of course aware of the issue involving the aged-care workforce, including aged-care nurses. As the member may know, the Australian Nurses Federation, very properly, has been raising this issue with members of parliament because it is concerned about the wages and conditions of people who work in aged care. It is also concerned about how these wages and conditions compare with alternative occupations for nurses and, consequently, what that means for the workforce in the aged-care sector.I think the member would acknowledge that these are complex questions, because costs in aged care end up being borne, of course, by government but they also end up being borne by individuals. They end up being borne by government and individuals in a circumstance where, as we all know, our society is ageing, people are living longer, the circumstances in which they want to live the remainder of their lives are changing and the demand, particularly for ever-increasing quality, is high. That means that there are lots of costs and complexities that need to be worked through.That is why we have got the Productivity Commission working on this question. Of course, we will continue to work in dialogue with the Australian Nurses Federation and others who properly raised these issues on behalf of the industry. As a government we have endeavoured to lift some of the pressures in aged care, particularly some of the pressures about the availability of capital, and you would have seen some of the measures that have been taken there in recent budgets. But I understand the member's concern is genuine, and we will be continuing to work with the aged-care industry, including in his electorate.</DOC>

 - I thank my friend and colleague the member for Werriwa for his question and recall fondly working with the Macarthur Business Enterprise Centre and participating in a Werriwa small business forum to engage small businesses in the Building the Education Revolution program and other aspects of the economic stimulus package. In response to the question from the member for Werriwa, under the government's tax reform package 25,000 small businesses on Brisbane's bayside will benefit from the instant write-off of assets valued at up to $5,000, giving a very welcome boost in cash flow and a very strong incentive for those 25,000 small businesses to invest in productivity-raising assets.I can also advise the House that the small business companies on Brisbane's bayside will benefit from the head start, the early start, on the reduction in the company tax rate made possible through the tax reform package as funded by the resource super profits tax. We know that anyone with any knowledge of Brisbane would know that the whole area of South-East Queensland is overwhelmingly a small business community. It is driven by small businesses, and nowhere is that more evident than in the bayside suburbs such as Alexandra Hills, Victoria Point and Wellington Point on Brisbane's east. In that area, covered by the seat of Bowman, I can advise the House that there are no fewer than 11,676 small businesses. I can further advise the House that 96 per cent of all the businesses in that area are in fact small businesses and that amongst them there are 3,000 tradies.So it begs this question: why won't the member for Bowman stand up for his local small business community? Why will he vote against the Rudd government's small business tax breaks that are being funded by the resource super profits tax? I ask the member for Bowman further: why did he betray his local small business community by voting against our economic stimulus with more than $143 million going into his electorate? He voted against that. He voted against $3.3 million for the Redland City Council for 10 community infrastructure projects. He voted against projects in 34 different schools under the Building the Education Revolution program, including Alexandra Hills State School and Hilliard State School. I can advise the housing minister that he voted against 179 social houses being built in his electorate. I can tell the roads and infrastructure minister that he voted against fixing a black spot on the Beenleigh-Redland Bay Road. Why would you do that? He voted against jobs for tradies in his electorate. He voted against small businesses in his electorate. Why would you do that? The Liberal Party says that it is the party of small business - 'Look at us, we proudly represent small business' - and time and time again the coalition has voted against helping our small businesses, supporting our small businesses. Nowhere is that clearer than in the bayside suburbs of South-East Queensland where the member for Bowman has betrayed those small businesses. Given a choice between supporting Clive Palmer and supporting the 11,000 small businesses in his local electorate, what does the member for Bowman do? He supports Clive Palmer every time. Clive Palmer is a very wealthy man - hello, here's Clive's friend and defender. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Clive Palmer is a wealthy man. He owns a very big mining company. Clive Palmer owns a football team. And Clive Palmer owns the Liberal and National parties. That is the truth of the matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Of course, we are still waiting for her to stand up for her electorate and particularly for the trades training centre that she seeks in Vincentia. Once again, what we are seeing this action from the opposition - except, I would have to give it to the shadow Treasurer that at least, when he is going to base his question on newspaper reports, he gets them out of the newspaper reports that day, which probably implies that the shadow Treasurer reads his newspapers every day. But what the member for Gilmore has done is base this question on a newspaper report from a number of days ago. What the member may want to know - and the problem, of course, with just reading the newspaper and then assuming that without any further research one should rely on it and use it for question time - is that the matters in that report have already been dealt with by the New South Wales department. In particular, I am advised that the New South Wales department has made it absolutely clear that the claims in that report that somehow money - those incentive payments - is being conveyed is not right. Incentive payments are there and they can be paid if projects are brought in in accordance with certain project milestones. The report also has, from my recollection, sources of estimates rather than any other source of information. -  - Can I indicate to the member that the things that she has asserted in her question as fact are simply not correct. Can I also say to the member: I, like her and like members in her electorate, including the parent representative that she quotes, am very concerned to get value for money. That is why I, as minister, and the Rudd government have appointed the Building the Education Revolution Implementation Taskforce to assist schools with value for money. If the member wishes this matter or any other matter to be dealt by the implementation task force then she is more than welcome to take that course.What I would say to the member in terms of the framing of her question and what I would also say to the shadow minister relating to a report in today's paper is that I do not believe it is appropriate, whatever the opposition might think about the Building the Education Revolution, to have members of the opposition vilifying people serving on the task force and making assumptions about the task force. - The task force is led by a leading Australian businessman, Brad Orgill. He is doing, in my view, a very good job. He was the leader of UBS. That is a major, major corporate appointment in this country. I think it is pretty cheap indeed, regardless of political persuasion, to be making assertions about the work of Brad Orgill. It was included in the member's question today. It is included in quotes from the shadow minister for education in today's newspaper. I think it is completely inappropriate and quite wrong. So, if the member wants the task force led by a very high calibre Australian to deal with any of these issues, of course she is welcome to do so.</DOC>

 - I want to first thank the member for Throsby for her question. I know that she cares deeply about the social housing that is being constructed in her electorate from the stimulus spending in education and community projects because she has been a fierce and effective advocate for the people of the Illawarra. She is a supporter of the new services and the new buildings that are being constructed and, very importantly, the new jobs that go with them in the Illawarra. But she has asked me about south-west Sydney, and I am pleased to be able to say that I was in south-west Sydney the other day, visiting the electorate of Macarthur. I wanted to have a look at some of the terrific new stimulus spending on public housing that is happening in the electorate of Macarthur and particularly in the suburb of Rosemeadow. I had a look at a 57-unit development that is being purpose-built for seniors in Rosemeadow. No doubt the member for Macarthur has seen it. The units have been designed for seniors with all of the features that they need - grab rails in the bathrooms, detachable hand-held shower heads, wide corridors for walkers and wheelchairs, as well as six-star energy efficiency rating. The cost of living in these properties is lower because the energy bills are lower.Very importantly, this new construction is supporting jobs in the area. We were shown around the site by Steve Fussell, the project manager for Watpac Ltd - a construction company that is working on projects right across New South Wales. Steve told us that on an average day there would be about 60 people working on this site - that is, 60 people who would not be working on that site if the member for Macarthur and all of the members opposite had had their way on stimulus spending. Steve said that he had worked through other downturns and has had to lay people off. He knew the difference between laying people off and putting people on, which is what he had been doing during the downturn.We met Martin Munro, the National General Manager of Watpac, who told us that the stimulus plan had got it right and that, because private construction work had not fully recovered, the work that they were getting from the stimulus package was more important than ever. If you have a look at those ABS statistics that I mentioned to the shadow minister for housing - he is not paying much attention now, obviously - you will see that one in seven of the private dwellings being constructed are either public housing, funded through the stimulus, or private dwellings bought off the plan and also part of the stimulus package. All those jobs would not be there if the opposition had had their way on the stimulus package.When it came to the stimulus, it was not just housing they opposed. Look at what was happening in Macarthur when the member for Macarthur and all of the members opposite opposed all of those other stimulus measures. They did not want the one in seven homes to be constructed. They do not want the 51,000 working people of Macarthur to benefit from the superannuation increases that they would achieve if the resource super profits tax is passed. They do not want the 8,436 small businesses in Macarthur to benefit from the instant write-offs of up to $5,000. They do not want those 8,436 small businesses to benefit from the drop in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent. They did not want the schools of Macarthur to benefit from the 141 projects and the $114.3 million being spent on school -  - I am referring to these programs because they are also part of the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan along with the social housing package. It is distressing that the members opposite not only do not want to hear about what is happening in the electorate of Macarthur but also actually voted against jobs in the electorate of Macarthur. They voted against computers in schools - a thousand computers for the schools of Macarthur. They voted against $1½ million for three black spot projects in the electorate of Macarthur. They voted against 25 community infrastructure projects. - I am concluding, Mr Speaker -  -  - and I take advice from the Speaker, not from you. The Liberals opposed all of these projects - these new homes, these computers in schools, these school upgrades, these park upgrades and these road upgrades - and they opposed every single one of the jobs that went with them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I am still waiting for the relevant shadow minister to ask me a question on border protection and on this particular issue this year. As the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I said on 9 April, we had been looking at whether there were changed circumstances in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. As a result and based on the advice we had received, the government made the very important decision to suspend the processing of people seeking asylum from those two countries.As was said at the time, we did not suggest that the boats would necessarily stop. We understand - as does the opposition if they are fair dinkum - that this issue is driven primarily by international factors. That is what was said by the previous government and that is the case now. As a result of conflicts around the world and within our region, because of violence in Afghanistan, because of the conflicts within Sri Lanka, we have seen an increased number of vessels seeking to come to our shores. That is why this government has dedicated more resources than any other government when it comes to protecting our borders. As a result of that - here comes big mouth.The member for Fowler then left the chamber. - As I was saying, this government has dedicated more resources to deal with this matter than any previous government. If we were to accept the logic of those opposite that there was an increased number of arrivals as a result of something that was done by this government then one would have to conclude that the Howard government did something in 1999, because the greatest surge of arrivals in our history happened under the previous government. That is the reality. They like to pretend otherwise, but the greatest number of arrivals and the largest year of arrivals, as the former minister for immigration and the former Attorney-General know, happened under the previous government. We know that this is a complex issue. Everybody in this House, if they want to be fair dinkum, knows it is a complex issue.In relation to the question that has been asked, of course we are working very hard with our neighbours within the region. We are working very hard with transit - The member for Goldstein then left the chamber. - We know this is a very difficult issue. That is why we are working very closely with transit countries and source countries in the region and that is why we have been working very closely, for example, with the Indonesian National Police. I can say that, as far as reducing the flow of those seeking to come to our shores goes, we have had a disruption of almost 5,000 within Indonesia and other countries, preventing them from embarking on perilous journeys. That is because of the good work that was undertaken by the Australian Federal Police in conjunction with the Indonesian National Police. We will continue to do whatever we can to tackle this very complex issue.Can I say in conclusion that it is entirely phoney for those opposite to pretend that this issue can be resolved with a silver bullet. I know there is a myth that has been perpetuated by the opposition, but the facts are these: the actual decline in numbers that occurred 10 years ago happened because of the greatest repatriation of asylum seekers since World War II, when 4.3 million people returned to Afghanistan in six years and many returned to Iraq as a result of changing circumstances. In the end, this matter will be solved through regional cooperation and global cooperation of transit countries and source countries. That is why I am confident that we will be able to resolve this matter through the efforts of our agencies and the cooperation of those countries within the region.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for raising what is an important issue. The government's commitment to jobs and job creation goes across every portfolio. Members would be aware of the particular challenges in some of the more remote parts of the Northern Territory, where for generations people had jobs without fair wages and in recent years fair wages have been available but not many jobs. The commitment from the government, through what has been a relatively modest program delivered in a partnership between my department and the Indigenous Land Corporation within Minister Macklin's department, has been to work cooperatively with the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association. We have a window of opportunity at the moment where some of the old stockmen and women are still alive and some of the people who are able to act as mentors for young people coming through are still with us. If we can make the connections with the cattle stations for the training and employment, we can actually close the gap in a way that should have been done many years ago. It is an opportunity that will not necessarily be available in exactly the same way for many more years into the future, with the mentors being available as they are right now.When I was last in the Northern Territory, it coincided with the visit of my Indonesian counterpart, Minister Suswono, who is responsible for receiving many of the cattle in Indonesian ports that are exported out of the Northern Territory. Together we visited Tipperary Station not long after the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government had been there. There were 14 Indigenous young men and women who were being trained by a senior stock handler in a certificate II course and being able to get basic training with a direct connection following that to particular cattle stations. I think the significance of this program in terms of total employment numbers is very modest, but the significance of how it changes the lives of those involved was made clear when one of the participants, Tanya Callanan, spoke to me afterwards. We had a conversation there on the cattle station. I asked her how this was different from other training courses in which she had been involved in the past and she said, 'Well, normally I get a certificate.' I said, 'Aren't you getting one this time?' and she said, 'No, no, I'm getting a certificate; on this occasion I'm also getting a job.'</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Today I thought it was appropriate, with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Leader of the Opposition's chair, to reflect on a recent visit I had to her electorate in Western Australia. I visited Curtin and there I learned some things about education in Western Australia and about jobs in Western Australia. Curtin is a very nice electorate. I enjoyed my visit there. I particularly enjoyed finding out about the 19 libraries our Building the Education Revolution program is delivering, the 27 new classrooms that are being delivered, the 16 multipurpose halls and the refurbishment of all of the schools in the electorate of Curtin. I also enjoyed finding out about the new computers that kids in the electorate of Curtin had as a result of this government's computers in schools program. There they are in the electorate of Curtin. We have delivered 1,792 computers. That is very important because under this government there would be more to come to join those computers. Under the opposition, of course, there would be no more computers and no more delivery of Building the Education Revolution.I was also interested to find out that there are 29,757 small businesses in Curtin and these small businesses would be looking forward to the reduction in company tax and the special measures for taxation for small businesses in the government's resource super profits tax package. I believe as well that there would be 42,000 taxpayers in Curtin looking forward to benefiting from the government's superannuation reforms. So I learned a lot about the electorate of Curtin when I was there.I particularly enjoyed a visit to Dalkeith Primary School, and I want to conclude my contribution to question time by marking the moment by indicating I have some gifts for the member for Curtin today. 
A government member - Always generous! - Always generous, that's me. One of the things that I found out there was that people like a fair day's pay when they have done a fair day's work. So, to remind them of Work Choices when that was not the case and to help the member for Curtin in her election campaign where she will be promising Work Choices again, I have brought her a mouse pad to mark the moment, and for the wall of her office I thought she might particularly appreciate  the front page of the Cambridge Post in her electorate recording my visit to Dalkeith Primary School under the headline 'Revolution in Lib land' - a very good headline, a very flattering photo of the children there. They look very attractive. I will let others judge about the photo of me. But the revolution in Lib land I think will go well on the wall of the member for Curtin.</DOC>

I said that consultations were going well with very significant sections of the industry, that we were talking to many companies - both large and small - and that we were doing that in a genuine and productive way, and I said that their behaviour had been honourable. I also said that there were a small number of companies that were not behaving in an honourable way. I went on to say that this is information that has been given to me confidentially. I also went on to say that it is well known to many opposite and to many in the gallery that strong-arm tactics have been used in the industry. I would note that one senior journalist yesterday confirmed this on television.I stand by everything that I said yesterday. I also said that I had admiration for the mining industry as wealth creators. We should get the record right here. I said that we were having a vigorous debate.

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question, because each time I have been to his part of Tasmania local small businesses and local government have asked me, 'When is the National Broadband Network going to be connected?' We already have that connection work underway. In fact, in the honourable member's electorate we will be connecting up the first homes to the network in July of this year.Yesterday was a good news day for the future of the Australian economy, because what we need for the future is the infrastructure of the future. The government has committed to building a stronger economy and also to delivering for families across the nation. A national broadband network is a key part of the infrastructure of the future. In the 19th century we had the state governments of Australia then laying out the infrastructure of that century and the one that followed - laying out the railway system and laying out the telegraph system. For the needs of the 21st century we need the infrastructure of the 21st century, and that is a national broadband network. That is why we are delighted with the agreement reached yesterday between the National Broadband Network and Telstra. This is a good agreement.In 2007, Australia had the third most expensive internet services in the world. Also, in 2007, our broadband was 35 times slower than that of the fastest nation. So we were the third most expensive and we had a system 35 times slower than that of the fastest nation in the OECD. That is why in March 2007, we, then in opposition, committed to building a national broadband network. Since then, we have had sustained negotiations with Telstra. As a consequence of those negotiations, we have reached an important agreement with them on the future of the network. This agreement paves the way for faster, cheaper broadband services right across the nation. It paves the way for a more efficient rollout of the National Broadband Network across the nation. It paves the way for families having access to broadband across the nation, for small businesses having access to broadband across the nation and for schools and hospitals having access to broadband across the nation.The government is committed to delivering optical fibre with speeds of 100 megabits per second. That is around 50 times faster than is received today. Furthermore, with a mix of next-generation wireless and satellite technologies, we will be delivering broadband to all Australian families. That is because we make no distinction between Australians who live in the bush, who live in the regions and who live in the big cities. We want to make sure that they are all wired to the economy of the 21st century.In practical terms, what will this mean for families and businesses out there? It will mean that we will have slashed telephone bills for small business. I would think that would be good for small business. We are going to have enhanced business services such as teleconferencing. We are going to have videoconferencing. We are going to have virtual private networks. So the need for small businesses in one part of the country to fly or drive to another part of the country just to do a deal gets removed as a result of this brand new technology. It helps businesses right across regional Australia to sell their products or their services to the markets of the world, to sell to them online. It enhances the capacities of our hospitals to deliver e-health in regional and rural Australia. It produces e-education as well, and high-definition, multichannel and interactive TV services. It will also help farmers to electronically track their livestock, monitor their crops and have instant access to market and weather conditions. - I notice that the voice for the future over there interjects - the member for O'Connor. Wilson, this is welcome even in your electorate. They want it in your electorate, because it helps them in their businesses, it helps them in their primary industries and it helps the schools in your electorate, as it does in the electorate of every other member represented here. There is just one difference: you are not prepared to admit it.For students across Australia, it will open up new opportunities: 3-D interactive learning experiences and specialist training. When mixed with the computers in schools program brought about by the Minister for Education, it will ensure that our students have full access to this technology for the 21st century. Then we come to the question of jobs. This project alone is capable of generating 25,000 jobs across the country, including in areas such as north-west Tasmania, where jobs have been lost as a result of closures in other industries.The Australian government is proud of this achievement. It is proud of the agreement which the minister has reached with Telstra. This is a good agreement for Telstra, a good agreement for the National Broadband Network, a good agreement for the nation, a good agreement for small business and a good agreement for families who need access to the technology and the infrastructure of the 21st century. That is the practical stuff we are engaged in in building a stronger economy for the future and making sure that all Australian families have a share of that future as well.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the member for Bradfield for his question. In response to his question I would draw attention to the fact that the modelling produced as part of the Treasury's report underlines not only the growth in the economy and employment overall as a consequence of the government's tax reform package but, on top of that, the growth in employment activity within the mining industry as well. That is underlined in the Treasury's analysis and reflected in the Econtech report.Secondly about tax reform, I would say to the honourable member that he should also pay attention to the fact that in his electorate he would have some thousands of small businesses who are currently, frankly, in line to obtain a new tax advantage from what the government has put forward. We are also, in terms of those incorporated companies within his electorate, promising them a two per cent tax cut; he is promising them a two per cent tax increase. That is the difference between us and them. The overall impact of these tax reforms on the business community therefore generates a more competitive business sector. They draw its costs down and therefore boost its profitability and the activity and employment it generates in the whole economy.I would also like to know how many working people in the honourable member's electorate would benefit from increasing super from nine per cent to 12 per cent. Let me say to the honourable member: there will be many people in his electorate of Bradfield whose current anticipated retirement income will not be adequate to service them effectively in their retirement years. What we are on about is better super for something like 7½ million working families. What we are on about is a tax cut and tax breaks for about 2.4 million Australian businesses, as well as a reduction in the company rate, affecting about three-quarters of a million Australian businesses.The honourable member goes to the impact specifically of our proposed tax reform on the mining industry. I simply alert the House to one fact - that is, let us look at how the old stock market is performing today. The Rio share price just prior to the time that the government announced its tax reform proposals was $72.10. As of today, Rio has passed that level and is now trading at $72.25. I say to the honourable member opposite that we should look at the market's assessment of the real impact of the proposed tax reform on the bottom line performance of the mining industry overall. There is a difference between fact and fear, and what the honourable member has done in his question is to have sought further to perpetrate fear. I would suggest that we have a debate based on fact.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question. I am surprised that the member for Bradfield is not asking questions about broadband and communications, because I know the member for Bradfield actually understands the need for structural separation. But it seems when they go across there and sit on those benches the intellectual integrity gets drained away.Every Tasmanian knows about the importance of broadband. They know that this government's plan for a national broadband network is the largest nation-building infrastructure project in our history. The announcement of a financial heads of agreement between Telstra and NBN Co. is indeed historic. The agreement clears a path to move Australia from the copper age to the fibre future. The agreement ensures structural separation - reform promoted by the member for Bradfield in his book and reform that will boost services, competition and innovation in Australia. For the first time we will have a national wholesale only network that is not controlled by any retail company.In total, this agreement guarantees a faster, cheaper rollout of the National Broadband Network, with higher take-up rates. This is a win for Australian businesses and a win for all Australian households. This is recognised particularly in regional Australia. That is why it has got such strong support from Tasmanians, who understand the threat that those opposite present to the future of the Tasmanian economy. But it is not just in Tasmania; it is not just in the south.Up the in the Far North, the Far North Queensland chairman of the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:I think this will be good for the regionalisation of Australia, particularly e-commerce _ We need people to come to regional Australia, with good broadband it will create opportunities.Indeed it will. But those opposite are determined to oppose this forward thinking. The opposition spokesperson, Tony Smith, has said:This hugely expensive and risky venture is something that no responsible government would contemplate in the first place _He is half right, because no coalition government would have the vision to contemplate such a proposition. The shadow finance minister has gone out there and opposed it as well. Indeed, their alternative is that they are going to create a $1 billion fund to:_ invest in 21st century education and communication tools to improve learning opportunities in the regions _It is like trading in your iPhone for a walkie-talkie.The opposition are stuck in the past. The problem is not just that they are stuck in the past but that they want the rest of Australia to stay back and keep them company. That is the problem with this Leader of the Opposition. No matter what area of policy you look at they are stuck in the past, too afraid to make the leap into this century that is so necessary for our economic future.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. In response to his question I refer him in part to the answer I gave to an earlier question from the member for Bradfield, and that goes to the aggregate impact of the overall tax reform package which the government has put forward and its impact on growth, employment and investment in the mining industry. In fact, it is projected that investment in the mining industry will increase by between 4.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent as a result of the reform, and that employment within the mining industry will increase by seven per cent as a result of the reform being brought in by the government. And that is because we are bringing in a profits based tax as opposed to one which is based on production.The Leader of the National Party talks about the impact of this tax reform proposal on the industry more broadly. I also note in passing, as in fact did the Treasurer in answering a question, that if you look at the National Party's constituency - and they had their conference over the weekend - it is pretty interesting to know where they actually stand on the question of the National Broadband Network. What is the Leader of the National Party, claiming to represent the interests of all those regions out there, actually saying about their desire to have decent, reliable, cheap, broadband services? - As those opposite would be aware, we in the House are pleased today to be welcoming the Vice-President of the People's Republic of China. Earlier today with him I witnessed the signing of a number of agreements. The nature and content of some of these agreements are quite interesting. One is a facility agreement -  -  - Mr Speaker, I know this might be difficult for those opposite to listen to but it does go directly to the question which has been asked by the Leader of the National Party, which is: what is the impact of tax reform on overall perceptions of confidence in the mining industry? Today, together with the Vice-President of the People's Republic of China, we witnessed the signing of a facility agreement for $US1.2 billion between Karara Mining Ltd and the China Development Bank Corporation. Furthermore, we also saw a cooperation agreement between Resourcehouse Ltd, Export-Import Bank of China, the Metallurgical Corporation of China and China Power Holdings to establish a $US8 billion China First Coal Development project involving the construction of a mine and a 476-kilometre railway to the port of Abbot Point near Bowen. That is what was signed in our presence earlier today. Perhaps there is a third one which I should draw our attention to as well, and that is an engineering and procurement contract cooperation agreement for China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd to provide procurement engineering and design services to Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. At current estimates the expansion, I am advised, would add up to $A5 billion of annual export revenue to Australia.Here are three sets of agreements which have been signed in my presence and the presence of the Chinese Vice-President about one-and-a-half hours ago. I know that those opposite have difficulty in confronting the facts in this debate; they would much rather run a fear campaign. This government is interested in tax reform because it delivers better super for working families - 7.5 million of them; better tax arrangements for our 2.4 million small businesses right across the country; tax cuts for some three-quarters of a million incorporated Australian businesses; and a dedicated infrastructure fund for our resource states, Queensland, WA and elsewhere, to build the road, rail and ports that they desperately cry out for for the future. So I say to the Leader of the National Party - apart from the fact he is not interested in representing in this chamber his constituency's interest in the National Broadband Network - that on the question of the impact of our tax reform proposal he should look very carefully at the facts and the content of what is occurring out there in the community, and if his overall argument is that there is no confidence on the part of international investors in the impact of the government's tax reform proposal, I would ask him to look very carefully at the three sets of agreements which were signed in my presence and the presence of the Chinese Vice-President today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question and I acknowledge his longstanding commitment to improve broadband access for his constituents. In fact, I recall meeting with his constituents on the very issue on a number of occasions. The agreement that was announced yesterday is a very important step for the telecommunications sector in Australia for microeconomic reform and for the Australian economy, and indeed the Tasmanian economy where the Broadband Network is being rolled out first. I understand that it is supported by none other than the Tasmanian Liberal Party. It is good to see that progress is occurring in Tasmania and in Australia on this vital area of microeconomic reform that is crucial for kick starting productivity growth in the economy and also for reform in our health and education sectors.It is a crucial reform. In particular, this agreement is critical because of the need to transition from copper to fibre and to ensure that we have a genuinely structurally separated industry where no one telecommunications retailer controls the infrastructure. I first raised the issue of structural separation as shadow minister for communications back in 2002, with the active support of the then Leader of the Opposition, now Minister for Trade. Since that time the Labor Party has been committed to solving what was one of the great public policy disasters imposed on this nation by the Howard government, and that was privatising Telstra without reforming the structure of the telecommunications industry, which therefore left Australia with a totally dominant player, a privately owned monopoly player, in a sector that is rapidly becoming as important to the economy as the financial services sector. Since that time Labor has been committed to ensuring that we have a genuinely productive, efficient, competitive telecommunications industry sector that delivers world class broadband to all Australians and ensures that we have a truly productive, competitive infrastructure and do not have an industry structure that impedes that.The problem with the stalemate that emerged from the former government is that we had massively complex regulatory arrangements that delivered incentives to Telstra to gain the regulation and to delay innovation and to delay competition and, as a result, Australia progressively fell further and further behind comparable countries in the quality, the speed and the access of broadband that was being made available to our citizens and our businesses. In that scenario, in that stalemate, there was no legitimate prospect of anybody - private or public player - building a universal national broadband network. We had over that period 17 different Howard government broadband plans -  -  - I am now told it is 18, so maybe I missed one, but we had dozens of different plans, all window-dressing and all designed to cover up the stalemate that was put in place by the Howard government on broadband. The Rudd government is in the process of breaking that stalemate and yesterday's agreement was a landmark step in breaking that stalemate. It means that the government is now working in partnership with the entire telecommunications sector to deliver world-class broadband throughout Australia, to kick-start productivity in our economy and to kick-start reform of sectors like health and education.Not only is this agreement good for our economy, not only is it good for Tasmania and for the rest of Australia but also, in my view, it will be good for Telstra shareholders. As broadband unfolds, more and more of our business activity will shift into the digital world and, as the single biggest player by far in the telecommunications sector in Australia, Telstra is superbly positioned to benefit from the improved opportunities that that will provide to all telecommunications providers. We as a government are also providing a range of compensation to Telstra, for the customers being transitioned by Telstra to the new network, for the infrastructure that Telstra owns that the NBN will now be able to use and, of course, for the government taking on board the heavy lifting of the universal service obligation that has previously been dealt with by Telstra.All of these things are opening up new opportunities for our economy, for Telstra, for our education sector, for our health sector and for other parts of the Australian economy. But this does raise one big question: where now, in the wake of this agreement, does this leave the opposition? With the entire telecommunications sector now working cooperatively and constructively with the government to deliver world-class broadband across Australia to kick-start our productivity for the future, where does this leave the opposition? At this point, it is still blocking in the Senate, still opposing and still proposing to put forward John Howard's program No. 18 or No. 19 - yet another rinky-dink, you-beaut, acme broadband proposal that is all about window-dressing, all about pretending to tackle the problem but is in fact doing nothing. It is time the opposition reconsidered its position, got with the strength and understood that the entire sector now is working hand in hand with the government to improve broadband for the future of Australia and for the future of Tasmania and for delivering the productivity gains that we need to improve our economy and for delivering long-term sustainable growth for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. She asked specifically about the impact of our proposed tax reform on employment and Indigenous Australians. I would say in response to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the government's advice is that we will see an overall increase in employment in the mining industry to the tune of some seven per cent. Activity in the mining industry would increase by 4.5 to 5.5 per cent.Furthermore, I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for this particular question, because it goes to what I would describe as previous campaigns concerning the impact of reforms by previous Labor governments on employment and in this sector in particular. I recall in particular the virulent position of those opposite to the introduction of native title legislation. I recall in particular the position of those opposite, which was that if we were to introduce native title legislation in the 1990s that would be the end of the mining industry, it would be the end of certainty in the mining industry, there would be no growth in the mining industry and there would be no further jobs in the mining industry. That proved to be false, false, false and false. - Therefore, the deputy leader's question goes to the impact of our proposed tax reform on employment in the mining industry and, as a consequence therefore, for Indigenous Australians. I would simply again say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: when it comes to consistency of standards, she should reflect fully and honestly on the campaign waged by those opposite against the introduction of native title legislation and its impact on employment in the 1990s. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects, 'Why is this faintly relevant?' I seem to remember he had something to do with Work Choices and the campaign which was run -  - Therefore, when it goes to the impact on employment as a result of government policy change and government policy reform, we have already seen two very large fear campaigns in the past, one on native title and the other on Work Choices, which those opposite projected would result in the collapse of the mining industry, a collapse of investment and a collapse in confidence - and, frankly, all of those claims have been proven to be untrue.The second point I would make is this, in terms of the role of the mining industry in generating employment. I was talking to the Minister for Resources and Energy about this just the other day - in the recession last year, the global recession, can I say to those opposite there are some claims around that in fact the mining industry, on the employment impact, helped see Australia through. Well, of course, the mining industry played a role. I would also draw attention to the fact that they were the first sector in the economy to shed jobs during the global financial crisis -  - Fifteen thousand jobs, I am advised, in the middle of 2009 had gone from the major companies across the various sectors of Australia. I would simply ask people to reflect on that fact. I am advised by various ministers behind me that that the fall in employment in the sector could have been by as much as 15 per cent. The rest of the economy, backed by a government stimulus strategy, continued to generate employment, including in retail, including in small business and including in the rest of the economy, because we got in there and we worked together to generate further activity, further profits and, therefore, further employment. Therefore, the overall argument that employment was somehow held up as a consequence of a 15 per cent shedding of jobs by the mining industry during the GFC is palpably untrue.Again, let us simply confront a few facts here, because what we have dealt with is the hypocrisy of the opposition's claims concerning previous campaigns. But, on this theme, let us also reflect on how the share price is going for the member for Dickson. The member for Dickson's share prices have been doing very well -  - I would have thought the House would be interested to see how the member for Dickson's share price had been performing. - In my discussions with the mining companies over time, both Rio and BHP - and other mining companies, including FMG - in fact have been providing significant employment programs for Indigenous Australians, and we have welcomed that. In fact, the work that we are doing in terms of GenerationTwo with 'Twiggy' Forrest for added employment for Aboriginal Australians, both in the mining sector and beyond the mining sector, has been important. BHP has been one of those companies, which brings me to their share price - on 4 May it was $38.59 -  - BHP, like other companies, have actually performed well over the course of the last month. Their share price is up. Therefore, that reflects that in fact the sector overall, despite the fear campaign being mounted by some, is actually progressing well relative to other resource companies around the world. So, on the question of employment and activity in the mining sector, can I say to those opposite, who continue to interject on this matter in their new-found concern for Indigenous employment in Australia, that once again this flies in the face of facts and reality.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for this very important question because it is very important that mining boom mark II is managed much better than mining boom mark I. -  - I am sure everybody in the House is aware how those opposite ignored something like 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank about the emergence of capacity constraints in our economy that put upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates, and how they used to come into this House, day after day, and say that infrastructure was nothing to do with the Commonwealth government; it was all the responsibility of state governments. They simply washed their hands of important responsibilities during mining boom mark I, and, of course, the consequence of that was rising inflation and rising interest rates.One of the key challenges this government faces is that there is a resurgence in global commodity prices, and that brings great opportunity for Australia because even in the middle of all of the uncertainties that we see in the global economy, particularly caused by uncertainty in Europe, what we do know is that this region is growing strongly. I want everyone to think about this at the moment. Take the first three months of this year, the first quarter of this year: on an annualised basis, the Asian economies have grown by 10 per cent. Think about that and think about where we have come from in such a short period of time, and compare that with the gloomy outlook elsewhere in the global economy. This demonstrates that we have a two-speed global economy. And, when that translates to this country, it can also translate into a two-speed domestic economy. We certainly welcome the fact that global commodity prices are up. We have the price of iron ore doubling since last year and very large increases in coal prices. This is great news for Australia providing we handle it properly, plan for the future and invest in infrastructure.And, as the Prime Minister pointed out before, the agreements that were signed here today with the Chinese officials point to very strong inward investment into the sector. Seven out of the 10 agreements that were signed today were in resources and energy. And, of course, our terms of trade are expected to rise to their highest level in 60 years. The terms of trade are going to hit their highest level in 60 years. That exceeds the peak of the previous boom.Consider that in this context. There was a report from the IMF last week. This is what the IMF had to say:_ within five years Asia's economy _ will be about 50 per cent larger than it is today - think about that - _ account for more than a third of global output, and be comparable in size to the economies of the United States and Europe.Why is all this important? This is important because what it does bring is great opportunities and great challenges for our domestic economy.Last week we had the Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Battellino, talk about the stresses and strains that are put on an economy when you have a terms of trade boom and implications for inflation, particularly if we do not deal with the capacity constraints and particularly if we are not concerned with those sectors of the economy that are not the immediate beneficiary of a terms of trade boom. Many small businesses and many medium-sized businesses have to compete for labour and have to deal with the higher dollar. All of these things become a reality in the middle of this great opportunity that Australia has that comes from the Asian Century. And we can only maximise our opportunities from that if we are forward-looking and we put in place tax reforms which deliver the benefit to everybody in the economy and tax reforms that recognise that we are having a terms of trade boom and that the price for our mineral resources - the mineral resources we own 100 per cent; the mineral resources that can only be dug up once - should be reflected fairly in the return to the Australian people. If those prices are going to be permanently higher, then we, as the owners of those resources, are entitled to a share of it.What do those opposite say? They want to see this boom, this windfall, walk right out the door and do nothing about these essential challenges facing our economy. They want to do nothing about investment in infrastructure, do nothing about making our companies more competitive by giving our small businesses a tax break, do nothing about making the corporate rate lower and do nothing about any of those things because their approach to this is to do nothing - except to say the miners are paying too much tax, and not even the miners are game to say that.So we do need to talk about this as a nation because what we need to do is to leave to our children a lasting legacy from this boom that comes from the bounty and the opportunity of the Asian Century, and that is why we on this side of the House are so determined to build up our national savings so that we can fund some of that investment. We know how important national superannuation was, and that pool of savings was used last year to recapitalise our companies coming out of the global recession. We are going to need our savings increased to fund further investment in this country as we go forward.But what is the view of those opposite? Do nothing, ignore it. We know that there is a two-speed domestic economy. We know that even now, despite the fact that we are one of the strongest growing advanced economies, many in small business are still struggling, and they will continue to struggle in a two-speed domestic economy. That is why it is the responsibility of government to face up to the hard-nosed reforms that are required to make our economy more prosperous. But, of course, those opposite only have one solution: to bring back Work Choices, cut wages and oppose any future reforms. We on this side of the House understand the challenge of reform, how to maximise the opportunities flowing from the Asian century and how to support our businesses and their employees, and we will continue to do it.</DOC>

 - As I have said on numerous occasions, the government is having very constructive discussions with a wide range of companies, both big and small - serious companies that see Australia as a very attractive place to invest and will continue to invest here for a long time. Only late last week the Prime Minister and I and the resources minister met with representatives from Chevron. They are making a $43 billion investment in this economy and are considering doing more - and that is what they said to us in their discussions with us at the end of last week. And there are many companies like that; many companies outside of the petroleum and gas sector are looking to this country. Only late last week we had a report that Peabody was looking at substantially investing more in coal in this country. -  - They announced they were. - You might want to believe your own propaganda, but it is simply not true. - Australia is a very attractive place for them to invest in and many of the investors from China that were here have the same view; they have this view in the United States and they have it elsewhere. This is an attractive place to invest, it is a very good place to invest, and they are continuing to invest. The question that I have been asked is: what have the government done in relation to one particular company? What the government have done is to sit down and talk to companies, as we said we would do. - All of the estimates in terms of the budget and our resource super profits tax are there in the budget papers. We are doing now what we said we would do from day one, which is to sit down and talk to industry about this proposal, to talk to them about generous transitional provisions, to talk to them about all the detail of the tax as it affects their sector and as it affects individual companies. Those discussions are ongoing and those are discussions which I am confident will be successfully concluded.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The visit to Australia by a high-level delegation led by His Excellency the Vice-President of China is a very strong statement about the strength of the trading relationship between Australia and China. Nowhere is that more important than for my own portfolio responsibilities of Resources, Energy and Tourism. In 2010 alone China was Australia's largest two-way goods and services trading partner with over $85 billion in total trade. I therefore welcome, on behalf of the House today, the signing of 10 agreements between Australia and China worth over $10 billion, seven of which relate specifically to my Resources and Energy portfolio. These agreements will see major upgrades to infrastructure and in doing so deliver jobs and economic prosperity not only to Australia but especially to our major regional communities.For example, I go to the Bowen Basin and I refer to a US$8 billion agreement relating to China First Coal Development, Resourcehouse, the Export-Import Bank of China, Metallurgical Corporation of China and China Power Holdings. That agreement alone will lead to the construction of a mine, a 476-kilometre railway to the port of Abbott Point, near Bowen, and a coal-loading terminal. It could result in approximately $4 billion in export earnings a year for 25 years alone. Other agreements refer, for example, to an undertaking reached between Fortescue Metals Group and China for procurement, engineering and design services to fast-track the expansion of Fortescue's iron-ore project in the Pilbara. On current estimates the expansion will add more than $5 billion to the annual export revenue of Australia.I then go to the agreement between Karara Mining, the China Development Bank and the Bank of China, which goes to the potential development of the Oakajee iron ore project in Western Australia, a project supported by an investment by the current government of $343 million to facilitate the port development for that key project, a project neglected by the previous government. In terms of South Australia, I refer to the Arckaringa Energy project, which could see high-value, clean-energy products including liquid fuels, chemical feedstocks and power as a result of that particular opportunity. I am also pleased to report that my department has entered into a memorandum of understanding with China's National Energy Administration for further close cooperation on energy, notably in oil and gas, coal, coal seam methane, low-emissions technologies, renewable energy and uranium.Also, I do not forget the importance of tourism in a $30 million marketing package announced by the Prime Minister, going to boost tourism from China. That market alone is currently worth $2.8 billion to Australia's burgeoning tourism sector and is expected to grow by over 10 per cent on average to $5.5 billion by 2017. I am pleased to say that a high-level engagement will be held with the Chinese administration in tropical North Queensland for the purposes of trying to extend some of that growth out of the Chinese market to Cairns and related regions.These announcements are a very strong statement about the strength of the trade relationship between Australia and China. They are also a very strong statement about the fact that Australia is a very attractive place for investment. I simply say that from the Australian government's point of view we will continue to work to deliver agreements such as this. I also indicate that we will continue to engage with the resources sector to put in place major taxation reform which delivers a profits based tax system whilst also ensuring as a result of those consultations, as evidenced by the announcements today between Australia and China, that Australia is a very attractive place for investment and that there will be jobs growth and ongoing investment in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I assume it is to me because in the broad it raises matters associated with employment. I think that was the connection that the member for Kennedy was thinking of. I can understand that the member for Kennedy is concerned about a reaction in the community of Malanda relating to local milk supplies no longer being available for sale, with one of the big supermarket chains coming into town and consequently creating a circumstance where local milk will be transported thousands of kilometres and processed and transported back. I can understand his concern about that. I can also understand his concern about the implications of the resources super profits tax for employment.Whilst I understand the member for Kennedy's concerns are genuinely and personally deeply felt, and we have had the opportunity to discuss his concerns directly, the modelling for the resources super profits tax, and the modelling particularly of the impact on employment, shows that it will expand the resources sector and its output by 5.5 per cent and expand jobs in mining by seven per cent. So, whilst I do appreciate that the member is representing some concerns about marketing changes in his electorate that could be causing community concern, and I do understand he is raising some matters that are on his mind about the resources super profits tax, the modelling does show a growth in employment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner very much for her question. As she knows, last Thursday legislation was passed through this parliament to deliver Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. Australian families have been waiting decades for paid parental leave, and the wait is now finally over. It is this government that will deliver paid parental leave to Australian families on 1 January next year. Our scheme is going to be fair to families and fair to business, and it will be low-income women in particular who will be the biggest winners. These are the women who are working as cashiers, working as hairdressers or working as food attendants, all of them most unlikely to have had paid parental leave in the past.Many of these women also work in regional areas of Australia, and they will now get paid parental leave for the first time. Our scheme is fair to those working mums in regional areas who are going to get the same level of paid parental leave as the high-income earners in the city. Of course, we know that for 12 years those opposite refused to deliver paid parental leave, and this Leader of the Opposition said that paid parental leave would happen over his dead body. I just have to let the Leader of the Opposition know that it is finally happening, and someone had better call the undertaker!The Leader of the Opposition is now saying that he is in favour of paid parental leave, and he has dreamt up a new scheme. But this scheme that he has recently dreamt up is going to deliver a triple whammy, especially in regional Australia. He is going to deliver a new tax that is going to hurt business in regional Australia, there are going to be higher grocery prices for families in regional Australia and he is also going to deliver an unfair scheme that will see higher income earners in the city get up to $75,000 as a part of his scheme.We have recently discovered that the Nationals were not consulted when the opposition leader decided on this new scheme. This is what the Leader of the National Party, Mr Truss, had to say just last week:We've expressed some reservations about elements of the scheme. We have expressed some concerns about the size of some of the payments.Others, like Nationals senator Fiona Nash, have been even more forthcoming. She has been out there, sighted in a Win News package that was played all around regional Australia on Friday, welcoming the government's scheme and its benefits for regional Australians and regional families. So we see more and more cracks emerging in this so-called coalition. On paid parental leave we see the Nationals walking away from the Leader of the Opposition. They know, just like families know, that this Leader of the Opposition cannot be trusted on paid parental leave. It is only this government that can deliver paid parental leave to the families in Australia.</DOC>

On the question of the impact of the government's insulation safety program - that is, the inspection program - as the honourable member would be aware, we currently have that program underway for a foil insulation safety program, and that is designed to cover some 50,000 homes. In relation to non-foil insulation we also have a program of inspection, which covers a considerably larger number of homes.The minister responsible for the area continues to keep our inspection regime under review. Should there be any changes to it in the future, the House will be informed. I say to those opposite that, as a consequence of problems which have arisen in the implementation of this program, we are seeking to ensure that safety is maximised in the community, and the minister is attending to this task with full diligence and full application. I thank the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question. He is someone who stands up for his electorate in this parliament. Particularly, he has stood up for his electorate when it comes to investment in local schools. I am asked about our Trade Training Centres in Schools Program, and I am very pleased to report to the House that already the Rudd government has approved funding for 230 trade training centres, benefiting 732 schools. This is a program that is being rolled out exactly as was promised. Over 10 years, each school is entitled to a grant of between half a million dollars and $1½ million, and schools have chosen to work together to make multimillion dollar facilities. Every time the opposition criticises that, it is criticising the choices made by school principals to get bigger facilities. By the end of this year, approximately 68 trade training centre projects will be complete, benefiting 173 schools. Trade training centres are going to enable kids to get the real skills they need for real jobs.Of course, the opposition is completely opposed to giving kids that kind of chance of getting real skills for real jobs. If the opposition is elected, it will stop approximately 900 schools benefiting from the trade training centre program over the next four years, and 1,800 schools will be prevented from benefiting in total. Even worse than that, it will rip money directly out of the hands of around 200 schools which have been promised that money - the Leader of the Opposition is going to come along and rip that money out of the schools' hands.Today I can report to the House that round 3 of the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program closed on 4 June and, when the closing date arrived and the applications came in, there were 73 applications from 214 schools. The funding requested was $242 million; the funding available in this round is $103 million, meaning that it is oversubscribed by $139 million. Under the Rudd government an independent panel will assess these applications, pick the schools to benefit in this round and then schools that have not benefited in this round or earlier rounds will be able to apply over the 10-year program so that every school benefits. But, if the Leader of the Opposition is elected, none of the schools that have put applications forward in this round will ever see one cent - not one of those schools that have laboured hard on their applications will ever see one cent.Of course, the hunt continues for someone in the opposition who will stand up for their electorate and stand up to the Leader of the Opposition about these cutbacks. I ask today: will the member for Calare be someone who stands up for his electorate? He represents 27 schools participating in six trades training centre projects. He wrote to me in December last year asking for more money for training apprentices in schools and he said in relation to some of the successful trades training centre schools: 'I congratulate those schools for their foresight in applying for and receiving this funding.' Well, I trust the member for Calare will now go back to his constituents and suggest that they have the foresight to select a member of parliament that will stand up for their interests and deliver trades training centres to their local schools.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question, because it goes to overall reform in health and hospitals and it goes to the question -  -  - The question goes to the overall reforms in health and the role of mental health within it. -  - In the most recent budget, the government made a $175 million investment in the important reforms needed in mental health. These will, in part, deliver more youth-friendly mental health services, more mental health nurses and more support for people with mental illness, including funding for 30 new headspace youth-friendly services, as the national advisory council has in fact recommended. Already, funding for mental health specific programs will double over the next four years, to $1.1 billion between 2010-11 and 2013-14 from $516.5 million allocated between 2004-05 and 2007-08. This is on top of the funding for mental health through the Medicare Benefits Schedule, including psychology services subsidised through Medicare and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.Many in the mental health sector would prefer that patients with mental health problems be treated in community settings where that is appropriate. The government's $1.6 billion investment in subacute care beds will help provide more step-up and step -  - The government's $1.6 billion investment in subacute care beds will help provide more step-up and step-down subacute services for people with mental health needs, easing their transition from acute care to the community. Furthermore, this means that patients can be given more appropriate and timely care out of a hospital, helping them to get the treatment that they need more quickly.As part of the establishment of the National Health and Hospitals Network, the Australian government will also undertake structural reforms so we can improve mental health services in the future. The government will take full funding and policy responsibility for primary health care, including mental health services for common disorders such as anxiety and depression, including those currently provided by the states and territories. The government will also establish Medicare locals in communities across the country who will be a platform for providing better coordination of primary healthcare services and help address gaps in services, including for Australians suffering from mental illnesses. Furthermore, the government also agreed with the states and territories that it will consider changes to roles and responsibilities for specialist community mental health services which the Council of Australian Governments is considering in 2011. These are important first steps, and the government is acting to put the foundations in place so that it can improve mental health services into the future.On the question of the overall investments that we have undertaken within mental health in the most recent budget, let me further inform the House that $78.8 million will be spent over four years to deliver up to, as I said before, 30 new headspace sites around Australia, providing extra funding for these sites and expanding telephone and web based support services for young people. - Therefore, in response to the member for Dickson's question - animated as I know he is by a range of considerations in the debate in the parliament today, including the performance of his BHP shares -  -  -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I welcome this question concerning mental health services and I certainly appreciate the predisposition now for the Leader of the Opposition to listen to this reply calmly. - The government is investing $175 million to improve our mental health system. These figures were contained in the most recent budget. Members opposite might be interested to know that the particular additional investment for Headspace will result in additional treatments for some 20,000 young people across the country. This is actually quite a large investment. Furthermore, I say to those opposite who are interjecting that the service provided by Headspace did not exist prior to the election of this government. - No, I am going to say that it did not exist on the scale which now exists under this government. -  - Mr Speaker, I was asked about mental health services and I am outlining in detail the additional investment made in the most recent budget - an investment of $175 million. Secondly, I was indicating the additional investment we provided to the Headspace services, which provide additional support for 20,000 young Australians each year. I would have thought, given the nature of the question, that that may have been of interest to the House.Furthermore, we are providing $58.5 million over four years to be directed to deliver care packages to better support up to 25,000 people with severe mental illnesses through the access to allied psychological services arrangements. Thirdly, we are investing $25.5 million over four years to expand the Early Psychosis Prevention Intervention Centre - otherwise called EPPIC - model, building on its successful implementation in the state of Victoria. Fourthly, there is $13 million over two years to employ an additional 136 mental health nurses to provide an estimated 11,700 additional services. As I said, that reflects the government's additional investments in this area so far.I also draw the House's attention to the additional investments we are making overall in the training of medical students in the future and to their training places within the hospitals. The government's plan is to increase the overall number of GP training places by 5½ thousand over the decade ahead and to increase the overall number of training places in a given year - doubling it, I think, to about 1,300 a year, starting a year or two into the future. Additional medical staff around the country will assist in the wider provision of general health services, including necessary referrals for specialist mental health services as well.We regard this as an important area of priority in the overall health reform agenda. We have, with the states and territories, engaged in a substantive negotiation on the reform of the health and hospital system. We have produced a reform for the National Health and Hospitals Network. In that system, for the first time, the Australian government will become the dominant funder of the public hospital system of Australia and the dominant funder of the recurrent costs of that system as well. That system also provides a range of services for those suffering from a range of mental health conditions.On top of that we have fully recognised - and I have said this in previous debates - that when it comes to further priorities for reform we have to place more emphasis on outstanding areas of demand in mental health on the one hand, and aged care on the other. Those constitute the collective priorities of the government. We have made a good start with the National Health and Hospitals Network. We have made some start in relation to the priorities for mental health. We intend to address these priorities together with those in aged care in the rolling implementation of our reform program. Better health and better hospitals for the entire Australian community are fundamental priorities for this government. We intend to get on with the business and I simply make this point to the House: our additional investments in this sector account for some $7½ billion over the three years to come in contrast to the $1 billion which was ripped out of the system by the Leader of the Opposition when he was minister for health prior to the last election.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for the question. As a South Australian, he would have been alarmed to read in the Advertiser on the weekend the comments of the coalition spokesperson on water, suggesting that the solution for South Australians with what has happened with water was for them to move north. The government's plan is to help people with the difficult transition. We have the Water for the Future plan within the Sustainable Rural Water Use and Infrastructure program and the water purchases under the Restoring the Balance program - which have all been water purchases from willing sellers. Let us not pass over the threat that we have in the Basin. Water going into the Murray over the last 10 years was at half the long-term average and over the last three years it was at one-fifth of the long-term average.I am asked about impediments. I have to say - and this will probably not help me get another question here - that the Leader of the House has been saying something which I believe is untrue. He has been saying that those opposite say one thing here and another thing when they are away. Going through the transcripts on water, I have discovered that they say at least two things here and make hundreds of contradictory statements when they are away from here. In what was a carefully scripted, 'gospel truth' statement from the Leader of the Opposition on 14 January - all written out for the Sydney Institute - he said that, if the states have not given federal control by 2012, a coalition government 'will put the appropriate constitutional change to the people at a referendum'. That was put forward as coalition policy.The other part of that coalition policy is meant to be a group of nine people in this room, those known as the National Party. The Leader of the Nationals on 18 June on Sky News said 'The Nationals have never been keen on the idea of a referendum.' For the Nationals these issues came to a head in National Party heartland on the weekend when they held their conference in Canberra. Here in Canberra, in the lead-up to the conference, the member for Mayo - not usually an object of sympathy but for whom, on this one, I have some sympathy - held the line and committed to the importance of a referendum, just as his Liberal colleague Senator Birmingham started to describe the referendum as 'only being a last resort'. But, as the National Party rolled the coalition's view here in Canberra on the weekend, Senator Joyce - who is meant to be the coalition spokesperson on water, presenting the position of the coalition on water - said:My view on a referendum is that it is the last proposition before the coming of Christ.Keeping with the 'gospel truth' theme, Senator Joyce really said:My view on a referendum is that it is the last proposition before the coming of Christ.On water, those opposite have held every possible position, but let us not forget where this began. It began in a carefully scripted statement - the one we are told we are meant to be able to able to believe - which was presented not as a Liberal Party position but as a coalition position. For some reason, those opposite are willing to let nine people in this room dictate to the rest of their party everything when it comes to what happens outside the major cities.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question on mental health. I say in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question on mental health that, when it comes to the Headspace program, as I indicated in my earlier remarks, this government has expanded services in this sector - and I made that quite clear in my additional remarks in my earlier answer. The reason that we have expanded those services is that, together with the Minister for Health and Ageing, I visited one of those services which was operating in Sunshine in Melbourne -  -  - This question is, I think, highly relevant to the usefulness of these services and why we as a government took the decision to expand them by some 20 or 30 sites across the country. These services are providing for young people in the community a place where they can comfortably go and then access the whole range of services which may affect their current mental health condition. It is designed specifically to be done in a non-threatening environment. It is specifically designed to be a welcoming environment -  - I would say in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question again that on this specific program, the Headspace program, one of the things which he himself might reflect upon is why when health minister he did not, I am advised, provide continuing future funding for the program which was previously established. That is one question which we are interested to hear the answer to. This government in fact chose to continue that funding and, furthermore, we chose to expand those services. We chose to expand those services because of the key value which they provide to young people in the community.When I visited the one at Sunshine, I saw the number of young people accessing it because it was friendly, open and non-threatening, enabling young people to go there, outside of a school environment, where they may be concerned about presenting particular mental health problems to school counsellors et cetera. That was why it was judged by many professionals in the field to be so successful - which was why we have backed its expansion.The Leader of the Opposition asked more broadly a question about the government's priorities when it comes to health and the debate which surrounds that. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, on the question of mental health, we as a government intend to continue our investments in this area because it is an area of continuing and outstanding concern for the whole community. It does not matter where you go in Australia, mental health concerns are real. - On the question of mental health, we believe that this is a huge priority for the future of the country. We welcome debate on the subject. We welcome debate from those who agree with the government's reforms and those who disagree with the government's reforms. We do that more broadly in the health and hospitals debate of the nation. On the health and hospitals debate of the nation, it is passing strange that the gentleman asking the question - the Leader of the Opposition, who engages in this debate - was the person who gouged a billion dollars out of the public hospital system of Australia when he was the health minister.  -   -  
 - The government is passionate about health and hospitals reform. We know that we have a lot more still to do when it comes to reform in mental health and a lot more to do when it comes to the whole need for reform in aged care as well, as I have said repeatedly in recent debates. But do you know something? We are getting on with the job of this, and that is what the National Health and Hospitals Network is all about - $7½ billion worth of additional funding flowing from 1 July, compared with $1 billion gouged out of the system when the Leader of the Opposition was last responsible for the health portfolio.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question, because I know that as a Queenslander he is particularly interested in the outcomes of our early investments in elective surgery and what they have delivered across the country. It is not surprising to me that those opposite, particularly the member for Dickson, have not asked this question, because the previous government's record on investing in elective surgery was the grand total of zero dollars. Never in their entire time in government did they invest a single dollar in elective surgery, despite the large numbers of people waiting for surgery.I have released today the latest report of the Elective Surgery Waiting List Reduction Plan. It shows that since our election an extra 76,774 elective surgery procedures have been performed across this country. That is over 70,000 working families, mums and dads, grandparents and others who are having their hip replacements done, who are not waiting as long for their ear, nose and throat surgery and who are having cataract surgery done, all because this government was prepared to invest in elective surgery - something that the previous government never did. If we compare, in fact, the first nine months of 2009 with the same period in 2007, when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister, 35,000 extra patients received elective surgery because of the blitz money that came online immediately when we were elected to government. What we see now is that the percentage of patients being treated within clinically recommended times has risen from 79 per cent under the Liberal Party to 86.3 per cent now. Of course, we know that there is much more to be done. That is why we have introduced, as part of our national health and hospitals reform plan, a commitment to lifting that over time to a 95 per cent target and making sure that if people are not seen within the clinically recommended time then they are able, under an elective surgery guarantee, to have that procedure undertaken somewhere else.I was asked specifically about the issues in Queensland and whether there are any impediments to this good news. Of course, the largest impediment to the ongoing benefits flowing from the national health and hospitals reform investments is the Leader of the Opposition. His record is one of pulling a billion dollars out of hospitals, and now the investments in Queensland will be at risk if the Leader of the Opposition is elected as Prime Minister. I am sure that the member for Capricornia would be concerned about the $76 million being invested in Rockhampton Hospital. I am sure that the member for Brisbane would be concerned about the more than $100 million being invested in a new oral health centre in Brisbane. I know that the member for Leichhardt, who is not here today, would be worried that the -   -   - I beg your pardon - the member for Herbert is not here today; the member for Leichhardt is always here.  -  
 - Of course, it is a major mistake to confuse the member for Herbert with the member for Leichhardt. One who has not been protecting the interests of his community - the member for Herbert - and one who has been arguing for investments in health which have been committed and are starting to deliver in Cairns. In fact, the report that was released today makes clear that the additional surgeries undertaken in Queensland were only possible because our investments allowed seven major hospitals, including Cairns hospital in the member for Leichhardt's seat, to expand capacity. Ipswich, Mackay, Nambour, Princess Alexandra, Royal Brisbane, Women's, Toowoomba and Townsville - all of these hospitals are expanding.We have not heard a single thing from those opposite, even from the Queensland members who stand to benefit from these investments, on how they will make sure that they are protected from the knife that Mr Abbott always wields when he gets to be in charge of health expenditure. One billion dollars ripped out of our hospitals and now we have these investments at risk. He has already promised in the budget reply that more than $800 million will be ripped out. The member is in such intense discussion now, because he does not like looking at me when I talk from the dispatch box for some reason, and will not even commit to extra investments in primary care. The member for Dickson has promised to rip nearly half a billion dollars out of diabetes initiatives.We just ask, simply: what is next? What expenditure in health is free from the razor gang that are in cahoots over there because they do not like listening to these success stories when 76,000 extra people have been assisted by our investments and many, many more thousands stand to benefit in the future, so long as Tony Abbott does not wield the knife that he wielded when he was the health minister.</DOC>

 - The first thing that I would say in terms of the government's tax reform plan is that the proceeds of that reform are to go to reducing company tax for all Australian companies, to reducing the tax burden on 2.4 million Australian small businesses and to providing on top of that extra superannuation for some 7½ million Australian workers. That is the basis of our reform.Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition made reference to a speech given yesterday by the Secretary of the Treasury. My understanding is that the speech was delivered by the Secretary of the Treasury to the Australian School of Taxation, based at the University of New South Wales. My further understanding is that he was talking to students of taxation and urging them to continue working on tax theory in research for the purposes of policymakers. I quote his speech:The Allowance for Corporate Equity model appears to offer the most promise.On paper, it offers a more neutral treatment at the corporate level between debt and equity financing decisions, which has the added benefit of reducing the need for complex rules.Addressing the students, he then said:I urge you to continue this work; not with a view to an immediate tax reform package, but to ensure that policy makers have access to the analysis ...I draw the attention of the Leader of the Opposition to the interesting fact that the Business Council of Australia has provided a similar submission in support of such a theoretical examination. I quote the BCA's submission to the Henry tax review:An alternative to lowering the corporate rate, an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) regime, also has the potential to be attractive for the economy.The adoption of an ACE  -  whereby companies would be permitted to deduct an imputed normal return on their equity  -  removes a bias in favour of debt financing and has the potential to stimulate investment both for locally based companies and inbound investors.An ACE has been adopted in other countries, but further detailed analysis of its application in Australia is warranted.The government will not be adopting that model in Australia.The bottom line is that the government's position in relation to the resources super profit tax is that it applies to non-renewable resources in Australia. That is the entire basis of the regime. The Leader of the Opposition would know that from my earlier answers in this place. It is a taxation arrangement designed to deal with the non-renewable resources of this country. Once they are extracted and removed, they are not returned to Australia; they have gone forever. That is why they have been separately taxed for a long time through the royalties system. We propose tax reform based on a profits based tax, not a production based tax. That is the core of our reform and is therefore unique to the resources sector.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government has introduced reforms in recent days for paid parental leave. We have introduced reforms in recent days concerning welfare. We have introduced reforms in recent days concerning the future of the telecommunications industry in this country. We have also introduced reforms that will bring about a national broadband network to service all households, businesses and other institutions in this country, including schools and hospitals.The passage of the government's welfare reform legislation through the Senate last night represents a significant step towards delivering both stronger economic management and a fair go for all Australians. This legislation makes welfare work by encouraging individual responsibility and fighting passive welfare. It also helps people from welfare dependency into work, education and training. It also makes sure that welfare payments are spent in the interests of kids.There is no dignity in a life on welfare. The cycle of welfare can in fact be vicious, embracing our children and subsequent generations. Our strong view is that where there are rights there are also responsibilities. This applies in particular, and with no greater severity than, to the way in which we manage the children of our country. They have a right to be treated with fairness and it must be ensured that they have appropriate respect as well. We have a responsibility to treat others, especially children, with the same fairness and respect. We have a responsibility to make sure that children get the best chance in life; to make sure that our children are fed, housed, properly clothed, go to school and see a future for themselves.The legislation that we have introduced through the parliament and that was passed last night introduces income management to fight the insidious and destructive impacts of passive welfare as well as increasing personal responsibility. We will fight passive welfare and link income support to school attendance, study and work. Income management ensures that more welfare is spent on life's essentials like food, clothes and rent and less goes to alcohol or drugs. The legislation provides for greater assistance to families to help them manage their finances to put them on a stable footing so that they can provide for their families and move forward into work or training.The legislation demands that responsibilities of parents are met. They have the responsibility to make the right decisions about the important things life, such as education, health and the wellbeing of kids. We are working with parents, starting in the Northern Territory, to build a better life for kids, for young people and for families. What does this mean in practice? For example, an unemployed young person aged 18 to 24 is currently receiving Newstart and has been doing so for 13 weeks out of the last six months. This person would be moved onto income management under the new scheme but can be exempted if they enrol in full-time training or education or if that young person has shown that they want to work by working at least 15 hours a week for six months of the last year.A mother in Alice Springs, for example, is currently on the parenting payment and may have been on that payment for, say, 18 months. Under this proposed scheme, she will move into income management under the scheme but can be exempted if her children are going to school and she is up to date with their child health checks and immunisations.These are very basic reforms. They go to the real working lives of individuals. They go to the practical circumstances which people find themselves in. The overall strategy we are seeking to pursue is to get the balance of rights and responsibilities correct and to make sure that we break the cycle of long-term, chronic welfare dependency. I believe that all members of this House share that ambition for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous residents of the Northern Territory. It is for that reason that the legislation last night also represents an important step in restoring the fairness of the Racial Discrimination Act. We have ensured that welfare reform applies to both Indigenous Australians in the Territory and to non-Indigenous Australians in the Territory, putting all Australians on an equal footing.This is an important reform for the government. It is part of a record of reform for the government in a range of areas, most recently embracing social policy, economic policy, health policy and the economy. We intend to get on with the business of further reform.</DOC>

 - I welcome this question from the member for North Sydney on the impact of taxation policy on Australian companies. There is a fundamental difference here: we intend to take the Australian company rate down two percentage points; you propose to take the company rate up two percentage points. That is the basic difference. I could not see a more basic difference. But, of course, I note the member for North Sydney - and I refer the him to the answer I gave the Leader of the Opposition in my last question - has also referred again to share market performance. I will not go to the member for Dickson again, but I notice he is performing well: when he bought in it was $38.53; it is now up to $39.97. He has scored a neat 100 bucks in only one month's work, and that is what has happened since before the introduction of this tax. 
A government member - He's pointless! - The question was about the profitability of firms. I also draw the member for North Sydney's attention to the following performance of a few mining stocks since before the government introduced its plan for a new superprofits tax on the resources sector. Mount Gibson Iron, for example, on 30 April was $1.71. It is now up to $1.74 a share. Pan Australian Resources Ltd was at 52c and is now trading at 55c. Fortescue, I have to admit, was trading at $4.58 before the introduction of the package. It is now $4.57. We are down 1c, so sorry about that. Rio Tinto was $72.10. It is now up to $72.34. Here is another one: Centennial Coal was trading at $4.30; it is now up to $4.78. It is not going too badly at all. Newcrest Mining was trading at $33.09. It is now trading at $35.74 - not too bad at all. We also have Lihir Gold, which was trading at $3.81 and is now trading at $4.40. We have Paladin Energy Ltd. It was trading at $4. It is now at $4.04 - and so the list goes on. - I say to the Leader of the Opposition and the member for North Sydney that of course share markets go up and down; but, insofar as we have seen developments over the last month, I think they point to a certain distinction between fact and fear. We are trading in the business of what actually is the factual impact of the proposed taxation regime we have put forth on the future of the Australian company sector, and that is to bring down the company rate by two percentage points. You propose to take it up two percentage points. We proposed to bring in tax breaks for small business - all 2.4 million of them. You propose to rip those tax breaks away. I could not see a more fundamental distinction between what we stand for on tax reform for Australian companies and what you stand for on tax nonreform for Australian companies.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question, as he is aware that this landmark legislation to make welfare work for all Australians passed the parliament last night. This legislation delivers on our government's commitment to the fundamental values of fairness, responsibility and opportunity. It also, very importantly, delivers on the government's commitment to reinstate the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. The government knows the importance of this change, particularly for Indigenous Australians. Reinstating the Racial Discrimination Act means that Indigenous people, particularly in the Northern Territory, will now be able to take greater ownership and drive change around all the issues that are so important to them.These welfare reforms are about making sure we do everything possible to protect vulnerable children. In every single circumstance, we want to make sure that welfare is not a destination, is not a way of life, for people in Australia. These changes will start in the Northern Territory and will extend the benefits of income management. They will also provide strong incentives to encourage people into work or training and to encourage people to be more responsible parents and make sure that their children go to school. Of course, we understand that the vast majority of parents do do the right thing by their children, but we want to help parents who are under pressure, particularly those who need assistance to get better financial structure into their lives, and provide them with more support.These reforms are about providing additional support to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians to make sure that we bring order and dignity to the lives of the most vulnerable and the most disadvantaged in our communities. The reforms will also provide additional funding for financial counselling and money management services so that people get extra help to manage their finances, and there will be a matched savings incentive to encourage people who are on compulsory income management to save. I want to make it very clear that age and disability pensioners will not be automatically income managed. Case-by-case income management will happen only if Centrelink staff identify an individual as vulnerable to coercion or if an individual is recommended by child protection authorities. These are landmark reforms, all designed to both support and protect vulnerable Australians so that every child in our country can grow up expecting to have a job and expecting to go to school so that they can get a better start in life.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the member for Barker for his question. He refers, of course, to Woolworths. There is a big distinction between what Woolworths would pay in company tax under this government's proposals and what it would pay under those opposite. We would bring Woolworths' tax down two percentage points; they would put it up two percentage points. That two percentage point increase is to fund the universally supported proposal for paid parental leave by the Leader of the Opposition, whereby he would whack a 1.7 per cent levy on Australian companies who have a turnover in excess of $5 million. Last time I looked, Woolies had a bigger turnover than five million bucks. Therefore, there is a four percentage point difference in the tax between what the member for Barker's party proposes and what this government has put forward by way of tax reform. I also refer the member to my answer to the previous questions from the Leader of the Opposition and the member for North Sydney.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question, because she understands that this is the biggest nation-building infrastructure project in Australia's history. Broadband will transform the way we do work, the way we communicate and engage with each other and the way we deal with the health and education sectors. This will deliver right across the nation, and others agree with us. The Age editorial today said this:Building the NBN is a visionary task whose historic significance will outstrip even that of infrastructure projects such as the Snowy Mountains Scheme, which fired the imaginations of past generations ... Physical distances cannot be shrunk, but their tyranny may at last be overcome under the new forms of human connectivity the NBN will make possible.That is why this project is so important. First services start in Tasmania just next month. Smithton, Scottsdale and Midway Point will for the first time have high-speed, affordable broadband. The rollout of some 6,000 kilometres of fibre optic backbone links is underway to some 100 regional locations.The upgraded Australian Broadband Guarantee program will provide tens of thousands of existing and new customers with faster speeds and bigger monthly download limits. The agreement between Telstra and NBN Co. will ensure that the NBN is delivered faster, cheaper and with higher take-up rates, with benefits for both business and households. But it is under threat because those opposite are so out of touch that they simply cannot believe that the government is playing any role at all. Indeed, the shadow finance spokesperson has said:This is government gone mad.That is their position. The opposition will scrap the NBN, ripping up vital infrastructure, ripping billions of dollars out of rural and regional Australia. But they do have something to take its place. In its place they will set up a billion-dollar regional education fund and will invest the interest, about $60 million a year - $60 million a year in total - to deal with 21st century education and communications tools across the whole country. They want regional and rural Australia to miss out on broadband, just as it did under 12 years of coalition government -  - and just as it did under their 18 failed broadband policies. Since then they have had three different shadow ministers, none of whom have been prepared to take that leap into the 21st century, leave their walkie-talkies behind and move into the digital age. They simply are not up to economic management and the challenges of this century.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question. I draw the member's attention to the impact of the government's overall tax reform plan, which in fact is to boost employment in the mining industry by something like 7.7 per cent. That is on the back of the range of measures contained within the overall tax reform plan.Secondly, he refers to a small business. I do not know whether it is incorporated or not, but incorporated small businesses within his electorate would be entitled to a two percentage point tax cut. If they have a turnover in excess of $5 million then they would of course get a two per cent increase in their effective company rate as a consequence of the policy which he is putting forward for the next election. I know the National Party so strongly supports the Leader of the Opposition's plan for a two per cent levy, in effect, to pay for the Leader of the Opposition's Paid Parental Leave scheme.I also say that when it comes to the employment performance of the mining sector it is very important to put this into the context of the last 12 months. In the middle of last year the minister for resources informed me that we had had something like a 15,000 cut in the overall mining workforce in Australia. That is a very large cut. Of course, they were wrestling with circumstances in the global economy at the time. If that cut had been reflected across other sectors of the economy in percentage terms it would have meant that at that time we would have been seeing something like a 19 per cent unemployment rate across Australia. That is the level of reduction which occurred in employment in the mining industry last year.I draw the honourable member's attention to the importance of tax reform. The government's bottom line when it comes to tax reform is to get it right. The government will be sticking to the framework that we have put forward. The government believe in a profits based tax. We believe in a tax which is set at 40 per cent, a tax which applies to existing projects and one which delivers revenue for the stated policy priorities of the government. That is the sort of framework we are taking to the negotiations with the mining sector at present. Some of those companies are negotiating with us well, others less so. I doubt very much whether some of the big mining companies will be singing and dancing in the streets over the prospect of paying more tax. We intend to get on with the business of tax reform, better super for working families in the member for Maranoa's electorate, tax cuts for small businesses in his electorate, tax cuts for incorporated companies in his electorate and, overall, a good reform for the nation.</DOC>

 - Ah, the member for Bradfield! - He used to have such a good view on these issues until he got into the Liberal Party. I thank the member for Braddon for his question. The development of the National Broadband Network is going to open up enormous opportunities for improvements in the delivery of government services to Australians, and not just direct government services but also services that are largely financed by government, such as health and education services, and a range of other areas where governments are very directly involved. The National Broadband Network is going to open up great opportunity for innovation, for the development of better ways of doing things, for improving the quality of services and for diminishing the costs of government service delivery.Neither the government nor anybody else is in a position to be prescriptive and to project precisely what these improvements will be because, inevitably, what is going to occur is a range of innovation, of product development, of new applications, of experimentation which will drive an evolutionary change throughout government service delivery and also throughout the private sector in this country.I just want to refer to a few specific examples to illustrate the possibilities that the broadband network is going to open up. First, in education, by breaking down geographic barriers we will be able to have a situation where people in classrooms or tutorials will be able to interact with others on the other side of the country or on the other side of the world and with specialists in particular areas who will no longer only be accessible if they happen to be in the same city or the same town as that class or tutorial, which will inevitably involve an expansion of capability for education.Second, in health, an example which is already being trialled now is people who are genuinely ill remaining in their homes, not in hospital, and being monitored on a round-the-clock basis by machines that can determine their heart rate, their blood pressure -  - It may be occurring now, but it is not happening in many parts of Australia. The key thing about a ubiquitous broadband network is that it enables an expansion of those capabilities. What is already being trialled also contains the capability for videoconferencing between doctor and patient, which means that people will be able to stay out of hospital, have lower costs, be closer to family and stay in their own homes as a matter of course. Yes, it is being trialled now, but this does not happen as a matter of course.Third, there are a range of smart grid technologies that will enable a more efficient use of the electricity grid in all parts of Australia by being able to monitor continuous flows of data - where there are disruptions and where there are problems - to enable a more efficient use of electricity transmission. Finally, there will be a range of opportunities in the area of traditional government service delivery - for example, the capacity to videoconference link with people who have specialities in particular areas of service delivery that are not located in every town and every suburb because by definition they are specialists that only deal with a relatively small number of problems.I do stress that no-one can predict precisely how all of these things will unfold, but the government is already committed to developing a greater use of technology to improve the delivery of government services - for example, making the australia.gov.au site a single portal for access of citizens to government services across the board with a universal password accessible to all. - The Luddites in the Liberal Party mock all of these developments because they are still blocking the National Broadband Network. They are still there after the entirety of the telecommunications sector from Telstra down are now in partnership with the government to develop world-leading, universal, ultra-high-speed broadband for the improvement of the quality of life, the improvement of productivity and the improvement of government services in Australia. The last remaining obstacle to pushing Australia's productivity and government service delivery into the 21st century is the Luddite opposition. It is about time you woke up to yourselves, got out of the way and helped progress Australia into the 21st century.</DOC>

 - Once again I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because it goes to the whole challenge of tax reform. I refer also in my answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question to what I said to the first question he asked in question time today concerning the taxation arrangements for non-renewable resources. I simply reiterate that point.The Leader of the Opposition also asked about the reception this tax reform proposal has received from various elements of the mining industry. Can I draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to what I informed the House of yesterday with those seven separate resource related agreements, which were signed in the presence of myself and the Vice-President of the People's Republic of China. Agreement No. 8 was a cooperation agreement between Chinese companies and a company called Resourcehouse Limited to establish a US$8 billion China First coal project involving the construction of a mine, the construction of 476 kilometres worth of railway to the port at Abbot Point near Bowen and the construction of a coal-loading terminal. The project is expected to result in approximately A$4 billion in exports and the -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your guidance and support. In the first part of my answer I referred to that element of the question and I dealt with the application of this tax reform to non-renewable resources. This part of my answer goes to the assertion in the question from the Leader of the Opposition concerning the impact of this tax reform proposal on mining companies. I was using an example of an agreement signed yesterday in the presence of myself and the Chinese Vice-President between Chinese companies and a company called Resourcehouse Limited for US$8 billion. Who owns Resourcehouse Limited? Clive Palmer owns Resource House Limited. There we have it - Clive Palmer, at maximum, representing the same principle, at minimum, we have had from the member for Dickson. When it comes to this impact of tax reform, the member for Dickson goes out and buys some shares and earns a tidy 100 on the way through. Clive says he is prepared to put an $8 billion project on the line and have it signed yesterday, notwithstanding the impact of this proposed tax reform. When it comes to those opposite, we watch what they do, not what they say.</DOC>

 - I thank my friend the member for Bendigo for his question and for his interest in the 10,140 small businesses in his electorate. He represents a regional area and nowhere are the benefits of the National Broadband Network for small business so clearly evident than in regional Australia. In regional Australia the National Broadband Network offers small business teleconferencing facilities, even the capacity in a place like Bendigo and surrounding areas to telecommute so that people do not have to go into the city every day but can use these high-speed broadband facilities, which are around 50 times faster than facilities available today. It is very easy to envisage a future for small businesses operating from their own regional centres but then saving the expense and time of travelling all around Australia to meet clients. Initially they may meet face-to-face but perhaps they will follow up with good quality teleconferencing facilities. They may also improve their web based presence - another great advantage of the National Broadband Network - where small businesses are able to present the best possible face to customers and clients.At present, although 96 per cent of small businesses around Australia have an email address; only 57 per cent have a web presence. In the tourism industry, it would be great to have that interactive web based presence so that people can have a look at the facilities on offer in Bendigo without visiting - they can even do that from overseas. There are so many wonderful opportunities. That is what we believe on this side of the parliament. So much do we believe it that the minister for tourism and I have combined, with the support of the Prime Minister, for a small business online program to get more small businesses into the 21st century through a web based presence and interactive services.I am asked: are there any obstacles? Yes, there are. I have to advise the House that the coalition, if it were to win government, would shut down the National Broadband Network. Can you imagine any vandalistic behaviour higher than shutting down the National Broadband Network as the government seeks to move us and small businesses from the copper age of the 20th century into a fibre future for the 21st century?The shadow minister for communications had an observation to make about this. I was involved in a debate on television with him and I was arguing for the benefits of the National Broadband Network. He said: 'That would be good but we all have wants. I'd like a 53 Corvette.' I can present to the shadow communications minister a stunning little 53 Corvette, a lovely little number. Doesn't it say everything? We are talking about the 21st century and the shadow minister for communications says, 'I want to go back to 1953.' This guy would make John Howard behind the white picket fence look like a progressive. He wants to go back to 1953. I had a look at some of the features of the 53 Corvette. If you go to the top of the line for a 53 Corvette, do you know what you can get? An AM radio! And if you want to pay a fair bit more, you can get door handles that open the door from the inside rather than from the outside! He was not even born in 1950, but I have had a bit of a look around because he is a friend of mine and he is interested in a 53 Corvette. I can offer him a 53 Corvette for the princely sum of $199,500. He would have to go to Tennessee to get it and would be fresh out of the National Corvette Museum, just like the coalition is fresh out of the museum of the 20th century, while this government moves into the fibre age of the 21st century.</DOC>

 - The first thing I will say in response to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's question is in terms of the impact of the proposed RSPT. Under the proposal the costs of employment, training and support for Indigenous employees, provided they are legitimate operating costs, are deductible prior to the RSPT being calculated. That is the first point of fact. Secondly, I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the government's overall tax proposal is designed and reinforced by Treasury modelling to boost the overall level of employment in the mining industry. Furthermore the Deputy Leader of the Opposition refers to the employment impact of the mining industry itself. I would draw attention to Treasury testimony at Senate estimates on Thursday, 27 May. It is worthwhile putting this into context. It says:In the first six months of 2009, in the immediate aftermath of the shock waves occasioned by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Australian mining industry shed 15.2 per cent of its employees - that was last year - Had every industry in Australia behaved in the same way, our unemployment rate would have increased from 4.6 per cent to 19 per cent in six months.I think it is very important to put the overall employment performance of the mining sector in relation to Australia's overall workforce size into context, and I would simply suggest to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that she does so as well in terms of the aggregate impact of the tax reform proposal, including us bringing down the company tax rate by two points and those opposite bringing it up by two percentage points.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Hindmarsh for his very important question, because there was extensive consultation with the mining industry prior to the report from the independent tax committee and, of course, there has been extensive consultation since that time. Indeed, it was the Mining Council of Australia that made a submission to that committee arguing for a profits based tax. This is something that is not accepted by those opposite. They do not think that there should be a replacement of mining royalties with a profits based tax. That is not even a position which is held by the mining industry itself. So we can see that those opposite simply do not have a clue about what they are saying and that has been demonstrated in the House today.We saw the appalling ignorance of the Leader of the Opposition getting up and comparing mining companies to all other corporates in Australia in terms of the charges that they have to pay. No other company in Australia gets access to a free public resource. No other company in Australia has access to something which is owned 100 per cent by the Australian people. - That is why for over 100 years mining companies in this country have paid a mining royalty to recognise it is a non-renewable resource which can only be dug up once. It is to the very great fortune of Australia that the price of this non-renewable resource is getting higher and is likely to be higher for some time to come. It is a fair thing that the Australian people should share in that prosperity. But the Australian people have been getting short-changed for some time. Of course, that is why the Henry report recommended a profits based tax to replace royalties. The Australian people have been getting short-changed and the consequence of that is that we have not had the resources that we need to invest and to strengthen our economy more broadly.I know those on that side of the House do not recognise the fact that Australia has been getting short-changed, but there is one Liberal who does - the Premier of Western Australia. The Premier of Western Australia thinks that we have been getting short-changed by a royalty regime. This is what he had to say yesterday:Had we not done what has been done today, Western Australia would have been essentially selling its iron ore for decades to come at half price. That's not acceptable.Australia is being short-changed. Australia deserves a fairer share of its mineral resources. We deserve a fairer share of our mineral resources so we can do something for all of our companies - for small business, for corporates - to make our economy more competitive, to deal with the capacity constraints in the economy, to invest in infrastructure and to boost superannuation to boost our national savings to strengthen and broaden our economy.What is the reaction of those of opposite? Nothing should be done. Let the windfall walk out the door or let the state governments occasionally jack up their royalties a little bit, have different regimes in every state, have a ramshackle regime that does not provide fair value to the Australian people and let that go on forever. That just shows how unqualified those opposite are to run this country and what little understanding they have of what we must do to prosper as a nation in the Asian century.We on this side of the House have a fundamental economic reform program which will create jobs, which will encourage investment and which will make our companies more competitive. What we seek through consultation, which has been extensive with the industry, is a sensible and balanced outcome for the country. We seek a profits based tax at a 40 per cent rate applying to existing projects and producing the revenue that can strengthen and broaden our economy. We will not shirk our responsibility to the nation. We understand the importance of long-term reform.The Leader of the Opposition was in here before talking about jobs and there were questions from the backbench about jobs and about people working at Woolies. Many people in this country would not have jobs if this government did not step up to the plate and stimulate the economy and support employment. And we will do it again because we understand the importance of long-term reform, and those opposite do not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question. Can I say that of course Professor Mendoza has made an important contribution to the public debate on this because mental health is a priority of the government and health reform generally is a priority of the government. The government has many health policy advisers, some of whom have agreed and disagreed with elements of health reform. When it comes to mental health reform, I would simply say to the member for Dickson that the government is currently engaged in a series of measures which we believe improve the level of services for those suffering from a range of mental illnesses. The first relates to the expansion of headspace, youth-friendly mental health services, and that is through a $79 million additional investment, and also expanding the early psychosis prevention and intervention centre -  - an expanded investment of $25.5 million. -  - Furthermore, there is $13 million over two years to employ 136 extra mental health nurses, $58.5 million - The member for Bowman then left the chamber. - directed to deliver care packages to better support up to 25,000 people with severe mental illness, to be delivered through access to allied psychological services arrangements. I further say to the member for Dickson that, as a result of the government's $1.6 billion investment in sub-acute beds, these will also assist in providing the step-up and step-down sub-acute services -  - In response to the Leader of the Opposition's intervention and the earlier question by the member for Dickson, we are all familiar with the printed statement or with the interview, which was printed yesterday or the day before, by Professor Mendoza. This government understands that mental health reform is a complex, hard, long-term task. We understand full well that the challenges of mental health are such that we must take the steps that we have outlined already and this is a further area of reform. I actually welcome the contribution of all those out there who are passionate about mental health reform, and that includes Professor Mendoza and it includes the Australian of the Year. Many of those who have a public voice on these issues will from time to time be critical of what the government is doing and they will from time to time be supportive of what the government is doing. That is because this government is committed to the business of open dialogue with the sector on the future of health reform. - No.Ministers accept the fact that they must be informed through a check of press, television or other sources of possible questions that may be asked of them in order that they may provide satisfactory answers.Clearly, this answer is not satisfactory, not explaining why Professor Mendoza resigned, and I ask that he either answers the question or sits down. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. In response to the two interventions by both the member for Mackellar and the Leader of the Opposition and the earlier question by the member for Dickson, I have said that Professor Mendoza's statement or interview was published in the newspapers. We the government cannot speak for him. He speaks for himself. And I have said further that we welcome contributions to this debate, as we have done throughout the process of health reform.The minister for health and I have heard, in the various public forums we have conducted around the country on health reform, contributions from medical experts including those in the mental health sector over the course of the last six to nine months, many of whom agreed with the policy directions of the government and many of whom disagreed with the policy directions of the government. That is what the process of public consultation is about. The business of government is to frame a health reform which is fiscally responsible, hence the $7.5 billion expansion in health and hospitals we announced as part of our health reform program earlier on. Part of those investments also go to the question of sub-acute beds in hospital - an additional $1,300 million, some of which can be used of course for patients with various mental health challenges. Also, action on mental health since the government has come to office includes investment in perinatal depression, investments for the workforce, investments in suicide prevention and the establishment of a range of other measures as well. These are steps that we have taken in the overall challenge of mental health reform. There is much more to be done in this area. There is much more to be done in the area of aged-care reform as well. But I make these comments against a background of a government which has brought about a fundamental reform to the system. - I thank again the member for Dickson for his intervention. I would also note that the member for Dickson has said earlier on, in 2009, when referring to the state of our overall health system and public hospital system, 'Patients as well would have seen a dysfunctional system over the last 10 years particularly when you talk about public hospitals.' - There he goes: it is pass the parcel and pass the blame to others. The whole function of the reform of the health system, the National Health and Hospitals Network, is to end the blame game so that we can bring about fundamental reform for the system: more doctors, more nurses, more hospital beds, bringing down the waiting time in accident and emergency and bringing down also the deferrals for those who are in the queue for elective surgery. Mental health reform remains a priority of the government. There is more to be done. Aged-care reform - much more to be done. We are getting on with the business of these reforms.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. I know that she is very interested in education in regional communities, including most particularly in her own. I know that she, like I, was disgusted to find that the track record of the Howard government on participation by students from rural and regional areas in universities was one where participation had gone backwards - had gone backwards to 18 per cent. Nothing effective had been done to get more country kids into universities. Nothing effective had been done to invest in country schools. Nothing effective had been done to invest in quality teaching. There was no national curriculum. Nothing effective had been done to encourage more country kids to finish year 12.We have been turning around that shameful track record of neglect of the education of students in country Australia. We have been investing in buildings and equipment at schools, we have been investing in quality teaching, we have been investing in trade training centres and we are helping more country kids get to university. Through our Bradley reforms we are rewarding universities for enrolling students from low SES backgrounds - and, of course, country kids tend to have low SES backgrounds. Our loading is actually worth 15 times more than the previous equity funding. Universities have already responded to the Bradley reforms by growing places by more than 40,000. It should be received by this parliament as very good news that the fastest growth rates are amongst the cohort of students who come from the lowest socioeconomic backgrounds - that is, our reforms are working to get more poorer kids, including country kids, into universities. We have also reformed student income support so the system is better and fairer, and in every electorate in this country more students are getting youth allowance as a result.I am asked about recent policy developments, and of course I tend to follow the statements of one of my counterparts, the Leader of the National Party - the man who would be Deputy Prime Minister if the Leader of the Opposition and his team became the government of this country. That is something for people to contemplate - the man who would be Deputy Prime Minister. On the weekend he announced, 'A new coalition government will create a $1 billion regional education fund,' and I thought, 'That's very interesting - a $1 billion regional education fund.' But $1 billion in the hands of the Leader of the National Party is not really $1 billion, because Senator Williams from the National Party clarified it all on radio for us, and I thank him. He was very clear and he said:... the plan is this. And it's been ticked off by Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey, that we put the billion dollars invested, away, and what that billion dollars earns in interest, we then spend in regional Australia to improve education.So it is not $1 billion on regional education; it is $1 billion invested and the interest spent on regional education. Then Senator Williams went on to say the kinds of things it was going to be spent on:... we want to see ... the good teachers ...So they are going to spend on good teachers with this interest - say, around $50 million on $1 billion they are going to spend on good teachers. What they do not tell you is that they are taking $400 million out of our quality teaching program. So they are going to spend on good teachers on one side and there will be a $400 million rip-off on the other side. It is a very edifying interview. Senator Williams went on to say:There'll be incentives for the buildings ...That will come from the interest on the $1 billion that is also going on quality teaching. What he does not tell you is that the rip-off the other side means that 1,800 schools will never have access to a trade training centre. The rip-off the other side will mean that schools will not get their Building the Education Revolution projects. Then he goes on to say that this interest on $1 billion that is going to pay for good teaching and pay for new buildings is also going to pay for infrastructure. Prime Minister, you would find that remarkable, wouldn't you? What they do not tell us is that the rip-off the other side is that they are going to stop the provision of 120,000 new computers. I see the Independents in this parliament starting to smile. I see them smiling away, because they know a bit about the National Party. What they know about the National Party is tricked-up announcements to try to fool country Australians but proof yet again, proof positive, that what the National Party actually stands for is selling out country Australia, and this time they are selling out country kids. It could not be more obvious.</DOC>

 - In response to the Leader of the Opposition's question, had we followed his prescription in response to the global crisis there would have been 200,000 more people out of work. Had we followed his prescription, we would have done the New Zealand model and had 200,000 to 300,000 more people out of work. When the Leader of the Opposition speaks about jobs and he speaks about employment, he speaks with a complete want of sincerity. Rather than follow his prescription for the challenge facing this economy for jobs for Indigenous people and for jobs for non-Indigenous people, when the challenge was there to act we acted through a stimulus strategy to generate employment for the entire country. - That was the first point. The second is that in terms of Indigenous employment I find it interesting that suddenly the Leader of the Opposition wages into this debate. On the question of Indigenous employment, can I remind the Leader of the Opposition of the range of measures this government has taken to support Indigenous employment across the country, including through direct support of Indigenous employment and training programs within the mining industry as well.On the overall question of, shall I say, uniformity of view on tax reform proposals, I would draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the interventions in this debate by his predecessor the member for Wentworth, who himself has come out and indicated there are many arguments in favour of changing the tax system in order to make it profit based as opposed to volume based. If the Leader of the Opposition was fair dinkum about economic investment, fair dinkum about the economy, fair dinkum about jobs he would not have simply hauled up the white flag -  The member for Sturt then left the chamber. 
 - If the Leader of the Opposition was fair dinkum about jobs, why did he go missing in action during the global crisis? Why did he say there was no room for stimulus? Why did he say that we should have followed the New Zealand road? Had we followed his prescription and sat on our hands and done nothing, 200,000 to 300,000 more Australians would have been out of work. This government stepped up to the plate, took the action necessary and generated the jobs that Australia needs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck very much for her question. She knows that this government supports Australian families making their own work and family choices; that is why we provide support through a range of measures - the baby bonus, family tax benefit parts A and B and, from 1 January next year, Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. Just today I have announced that from 1 July the baby bonus will increase by more than $100, to just over $5,300. This regular indexation increase will also see other family tax benefit payments increase for more than two million families.Last week the Senate passed what can only be described as landmark legislation that does deliver Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. Of course it is the case that Australians have been waiting decades for paid parental leave, even in the face of those opposite who, as we know, were dead against it. It is now the case that this government has delivered. One of the things that our paid parental leave scheme does is make sure that families are able to make their own work and family choices. We want families to be able to choose how to share the ongoing paid parental leave. We do know that there are more and more dads who want to have a hands on role at home. By contrast, I was interested to see that not only is the opposition leader's paid parental leave scheme unfair to business, as we know, and unfair to families, but also he will not even let mums and dads figure out how they want to share the ongoing leave. Under the Leader of the Opposition's scheme, it is only mums who are going to be able to take two weeks of paid leave.This would not be surprising to anybody on this side of the parliament, because he really is so stuck in the past. He is completely out of touch with the reality of families today. In most homes today it is families together - mums and dads together - who work out what is going to suit their circumstances, and more often we are now seeing dads deciding that they might spend some time at home. Of course it is this Leader of the Opposition that is showing that he really does not understand, that he really does not want to support the choices that those families want to make. We do know that when it comes to husbands and fathers this opposition leader has some very, very low expectations. This is what he told ABC Radio a little while ago:If we're honest, most of us would accept that a bad boss is a little bit like a bad father or a bad husband. Not withstanding all his or her faults, you find that he tends to do more good than harm.I have to say that this is appalling from the Leader of the Opposition, and is a great kick in the guts to all of those very committed dads out there. This opposition leader is a huge risk to mums and dads who want to be able to figure out their own work and family relationships. He is totally out of touch with the choices that families want to make.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I would simply ask her to reflect on one thing, and that is in the period of the previous government there was a policy of putting kids behind razor wire; this government does not put kids behind razor wire - because we have a different set of values. We actually believe in making sure we have got the policy right. If people come to this country and they are judged to have legitimate asylum status, they stay; if they are seen to be illegitimate, they are sent home. That is our policy, but, in terms of how we handle people on the way through, we will do so with dignity and respect - and that does not include putting kids behind razor wire, like the previous government did.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. I know she has always taken a keen interest in the services that the government is instigating to support women in her electorate. I am sure that all of the House would be pleased in noting that yesterday we announced the new pregnancy, birth and baby helpline, which will be available from 1 July, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to provide support to people who are considering pregnancy, who are in the middle of their pregnancy and wanting advice and support and who have recently had children and might want advice about the early weeks and months of a baby's life. The independent charitable organisation the Royal District Nursing Service is going to be running this service, offering information and counselling on a wide spectrum of topics relating to pregnancy, birthing and the life of the new baby, including issues such as nutrition for mothers and babies, breastfeeding, relationship support and healthcare options.One of the things that we get asked in the community all the time is: what are the things that you are proud of as a government? What is making a difference to what you are doing as a government? I can say today that I am very proud that, for any young couple around the country who might be deciding today that they want to start a family, the range of supports available because of the actions of this government are far more extensive than those that were available when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister in the previous government. This expanded helpline, which will provide real advice, real counselling and referral through to services with particular expertise, was something that was not available when the Leader of the Opposition was the previous health minister. If a young couple are deciding to start a family they will be able to talk about the choice of care they want during the pregnancy. Whether they want to see a midwife in the community and get a Medicare rebatable payment for that or whether they want to see their GP, an obstetrician or perhaps a combination of all of those, that is now going to be available under our changes - something that was not available when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister.My colleague Minister Macklin has already mentioned paid parental leave. Anyone who is getting pregnant and starting a family now will know that by the time they are having their baby they will have an option to receive paid parental leave to support them financially during the early days of a new baby's life.We can also be confident that people who are discussing whether they want to have children in the future will know that they will be protected if their new status as a parent requires them on occasion to be late to work or to have flexibility in their hours. Instead of having the fearful situation they had under Work Choices, where they could be threatened with dismissal for not being able to turn up, this is something that will be protected by the changes that were introduced by the Deputy Prime Minister.On top of this we now have 24-hour support for breastfeeding services - something that was not available under the previous government. A non-government organisation that was struggling to make ends meet, with women who provided the service having to pay for the calls themselves to ring someone back who needed support, is now funded by this government - something that the Leader of the Opposition did not support when he was the health minister.We have also introduced a perinatal depression support service. We know that a great number of women are affected by depression during their pregnancy and in the early years of the child's life. It is a serious problem and one that needed a coordinated and serious response, and we are very proud that that service is now up and running.Of course, we could go through the years of the child's life and look at the increase to the childcare rebate or at the 15 hours of preschool care. All of these things were not available when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister and a senior member of the government - because the Leader of the Opposition did not believe in providing this sort of support to working families at times when they were making a decision whether or not they would have children. We are very proud of this record. Unfortunately, because the Leader of the Opposition let his personal views get in the way of good policy, that was something that he never supported. -  - </DOC>

 - I am so pleased to have the question from the member for Kingston, who brings to this chamber her experience as a psychologist and who, as the chair of the caucus status of women committee, has played a terrifically constructive role in working on issues, including the sexualisation of children and particularly young girls in advertising culture. She has, as all members in this House have, an interest in making sure that young Australians are getting positive messages about their future relationships. We know that kids in their teens, as they go into their 20s, are very, very interested in what their relationships are going to look like in the future.We launched on Sunday a campaign called 'The Line' with four terrific young performers - Lisa Mitchell, Maya Jupiter and Pez and Tenielle Muslin - who signed a pledge and donated their music to the government campaign. I am showing the images to members. This campaign will be predominantly online, but there is also associated magazine and radio advertising. It asks young people to examine some of the issues about relationships: how do you have a respectful relationship; how do you have self-respect and respect for other people; how do you communicate openly and honestly; and what does it mean to be in an equal relationship? It is terrific to have the support of these young performers, because we know that young people love their parents and listen to their teachers, but they are very, very influenced by their peer groups and they are very, very influenced by their heroes - their musical heroes, their sporting heroes. Having these people sign the pledge and be publicly supportive of this campaign is terrifically important.Young people will be able to go onto this website and engage in online conversations. I think there are almost 4½ thousand fans already of the site. Members and senators, of course, are able to link their website pages or Facebook pages with the site so they can direct their constituents to have a look at them. Parents and teachers are able to access the site and use it for information when talking to young people about respectful relationships. This work builds on the respectful relationships programs that we have been rolling out in schools, sporting groups and community settings right around Australia.It also coordinates very well and very closely with the work we are doing in homelessness, because we know that domestic violence is a huge issue in the area of homelessness and is a huge cause of homelessness. Today, we have had services from around Australia upstairs in the Mural Hall talking to members on both sides of the House who came to have a look at the work that is being rolled out right around Australia. We were particularly fortunate not just to have the Prime Minister and representatives of the parliament there but to have Renee, Jess, Emma Cathy and Alan - five people who have experienced homelessness firsthand - talking about their experiences and the way in which new services and new housing have helped them in their lives.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition can never resist a triumph of rhetoric over logic. -  - When it comes to the contribution of the mining sector to the future of the Australian economy, one fact, and one fact alone, should confront the Leader of the Opposition if he is faintly interested in facts. That fact is as follows. Last year, on the question of jobs, the mining industry in fact cut employment by nearly 16 per cent. That is what happened as the rest of the economy sought to grow employment. That was no-one's responsibility in particular. It is, however, a fact when it comes to jobs.Secondly, what the Treasurer has also referred to is the fact that the profitability of some of our largest mining companies has increased exponentially across the decade on the back of rising commodity prices yet the return to tax through the form of royalties has not kept pace. That causes us to conclude that tax reform is necessary to make a difference. Thirdly, on the question of what that tax reform would therefore fund, support and invest in - providing better super to 7½ million Australians, providing tax breaks for 2.4 million Australian small businesses, a two percentage point cut in the corporate rate for Australian corporations - it would include, of course, other investments as well, not least of which would be in infrastructure, concerning the infrastructure needs of the resource states in particular.Finally, can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, the challenge for this economy and the challenge for the future is to make sure that we have a globally competitive economy across the field. That means for every sector of the economy - our manufacturing industries, our service industries, all of whom have been doing it tough with a high Australian dollar, all of whom can benefit from a reduction in the company rate, all of whom can be benefited also by a range of other measures. But none of this happens for free. You have got to obtain the revenue source to fund it by other means. That is why we are proposing tax reform. That is why this government will get on with the business of tax reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Today the government released the 2010 edition of Australia's health. This is a major report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on the health of Australians. It bears some reading because it points to a critical factor, which is the impact of chronic diseases in our country. Diabetes is now three times as common as it was 20 years ago. Up to 32 per cent of all potentially avoidable hospital admissions are for people with diabetes. Secondly, the overall cancer rate has increased by four per cent in the decade to 2006 and it is projected that the number of new cases of cancer in 2010 will be around 115,000. That is a 10 per cent increase on 2006. Thirdly, 61 per cent of adults and 25 per cent of children were either overweight or obese in 2007-08 and the rate among children has been doubling and more than doubling over the last two decades.The reason I emphasise these three conclusions of the health report by the AIHW is that, together with the ageing of the population, it underpins what we have now got to do with the reform of Australia's health and hospital system. What we have had is the number of hospital admissions rising by 37 per cent in the decade to 2007-08. Health expenditure across our nation passed $100 billion for the first time in 2007-08, reaching $103.6 billion. Our hospitals cannot be expected to continue to shoulder the burden which arises from the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases together with the other admissions to our hospital system. That is why we need national health and hospitals reform. That is why the government today introduced landmark pieces of legislation to deal with this challenge, to help deliver the range of reforms that we have outlined through the National Health and Hospitals Network - a network which will be funded nationally and run locally.The Federal Financial Relations Amendment (National Health and Hospitals Network) Bill 2010 will see the Commonwealth dedicate a third of GST revenue into the hospital system. It means that each time any Australian pays a dollar's worth of GST at the shops, 33c of that will be dedicated to the health and hospitals system. That is an important reform because that funding helps deliver better outcomes for accident and emergency, better outcomes for elective surgery, better outcomes in terms of available hospital beds, better outcomes in terms of the availability of doctors and nurses in our system.Under this reform the Australian government will take on 60 per cent of the efficient price for all public hospitals, 60 per cent of the buildings and equipment needs of our public hospitals and 60 per cent of the research and training undertaken in our public hospitals. And for the first time the Commonwealth will also become the sole funder of GP and primary health care and of aged-care services as well. The legislation today will remove the incentive to shunt patients from Commonwealth funded GP and primary-care services into the state funded hospital system. This is the blame game. It must be brought to a stop. The way in which you bring it to a stop is to resolve the fundamental funding arrangements which underpin the distribution of responsibilities between the Australian government and the states. The new funding arrangements will mean no more blame between governments about indexation rates and no more arbitrary cuts to indexation rates, as have happened in the past.There was a further piece of health reform today. The government moved legislation to establish the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare. This will help reduce the harm caused by preventable errors, reduce healthcare costs resulting from unnecessary or ineffective treatments and formulate safety and quality standards with clinicians, professional bodies and consumers. Building on the foundation of this national system, the government is now investing $7.4 billion, starting on 1 July, to increase our capacity and to deliver more doctors, nurses and beds. This includes 1,300 new beds, 2,500 new aged-care beds or places, a four-hour target waiting time for treatment for accident and emergency and elective surgery being delivered on time for 95 per cent of patients. If you do not receive elective surgery within that clinically recommended time, you will receive free treatment at a public or private hospital. We are also funding 6,000 new doctors over the decade ahead, providing better financial support for 4,500 nurses and providing upgrades to around 425 GP and primary care clinics around the country.These are fundamental reforms, fundamental reforms that cost money and that therefore require reform to Australian Commonwealth-state financial relations. The legislation introduced by the government will underpin the future investment in the health and hospital needs of Australia for the decade ahead. Had we not acted, our advisers concluded that there was a grave danger that our system would reach a tipping point.That is the government's plan. It is a clear-cut strategy. The alternative, as we know, is a Leader of the Opposition who as health minister ripped a billion dollars out of the system. We are growing the system by the investments that we have proposed to deliver better health and better hospitals to all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mayo for his question. Part of his question dealt with the competitiveness of the Australian mining industry. I draw the member for Mayo's attention again to what is happening around the world. Since 2 May, Australian resources have fallen by just under one per cent on the stock exchange here. Canadian resources are down two per cent, Brazilian resources are down 10 per cent and United States resources are down eight per cent. I therefore suggest to the member for Mayo that, when he suggests a particular connection between tax reform proposals here and the confidence of markets in the Australian resources sector, the facts stand in the way of the fear campaign which those opposite are seeking to perpetrate.Furthermore, I say in response to the honourable member's question that this government is committed to tax reform and to doing it through a process of consultation and negotiation with the industry. Since the announcement of the tax, the Treasury panel has engaged some 80 companies across the country. On top of that, ministers, including the resources minister, the Treasurer and I, have met representatives of the mining industry on numerous occasions for consultations and negotiations.The government, as we have said repeatedly, is working to reach a balanced outcome with the industry. A balanced outcome necessarily involves a proper consideration of the national interest. The government is committed to the framework that it has put forward. The framework is a profits based tax, a 40 per cent tax, a tax that also applies to existing projects and a tax capable of delivering the revenue to meet the government's policy priorities and to broaden the base of our economy.I have no doubt that many of the big mining companies will not embrace any outcome that would see them paying more tax. No doubt they would be joined by those opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, who thinks that these companies are paying too much tax already. At the end of the day, the government is interested in a sensible and balanced outcome that supports the future of the industry, that delivers tax reform and that - critically - improves the overall competitiveness of the Australian economy by improving the company rate and the small business rate and by boosting the superannuation earnings of 7½ million Australian workers.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - A profits based tax is in our national interest. The future of the mining industry is bright. In recent days, we have seen the forecasts from ABARE in their quarterly outlook for commodity exports released yesterday. Minerals and energy export earnings are forecast to increase by 29 per cent, or almost $38 billion, in 2010-11 and hit $170 billion. You would not get a sense of that if you were listening to the scare campaign that is being waged by a few large mining companies. The fact is, there are very bright prospects for our mining industry. That is why we have put forward a very sensible proposition for a profits based tax.In the last day, the Western Australian Premier has jacked up royalties substantially - to the tune of $300 million. Did we hear anything about that from those opposite? No, we did not. Did we hear anything about retrospectivity? No, we did not. Did we hear anything about it suppressing investment? No, we did not. And that is because our mining industry is very profitable. It is very profitable on an elevated terms of trade that is going to stay that way for some time to come. The Australian people are entitled to get a fair share of those elevated terms of trade. Those opposite just want the profit to walk out the door and to be lost to the Australian people forever. What we want to do with the proceeds of a profits based tax is to invest those in strengthening and broadening our economy, as the Prime Minister was saying before.Nevertheless, we continue to get these scare campaigns. I see that the Queensland Resources Council is out today predicting doom and gloom. But at the same time the Queensland government is saying that there are strong mining exploration applications and that they have been unaffected by the RSPT. We saw the US coal group Peabody last week talk about a very substantial expansion in Australia. And of course we have seen the Association of Superannuation Trustees blow the whistle on this scare campaign, calling it scaremongering and irresponsible. And irresponsible it is. What gives the lie to that irresponsibility are these forecasts from ABARE. What they demonstrate is the absolute irresponsibility of those opposite, who say that the mining companies are paying too much tax. So we have this ridiculous position where those opposite are saying that the miners pay too much tax while some miners are saying that they could pay a bit more. But of course there are some companies that those opposite are in league with that will never agree to pay more because they are not interested in pursuing the national interest.The Australian people are entitled to get a fair share of the boom in commodity prices that is going to last for some time. That does bring great opportunities to our country but it also brings challenges. So on our part we are having a sensible discussion and negotiation with the mining industry, because we are determined to get a balanced outcome for a 40 per cent profits based tax - a 40 per cent profits based tax that can deliver the revenue so we can give a business tax cut to all the companies in Australia, so we can do something about investing in infrastructure and so we can do something about boosting our national savings, which is very important for our long-term prosperity. The final word today about a profits based tax comes from the deputy head of the IMF, who said in Sydney today that he 'supported it in principle'. 
An opposition member - Do you? - Do you? Do you support it in principle? The mining industry supports it in principle. -  - They do not have principles, and they are to the right of the mining industry - that is where they are. They are to the right of the mining industry - that is a pretty hard thing to do. But of course it does not surprise me, given the extremism that you have on the opposition frontbench - their desire to bring back Work Choices and their desire to watch this windfall profit walk right out of the door, of no benefit to the Australian people. We will stand up for the national interest in this debate. We will stand up for the long-term national interest of this country. This is what the IMF said. It will stand up for the workers. You on that side of the House have never stood up for the workers. When the workers of this country needed you in their hour of need, you went missing and voted down the stimulus. If you were in power -  -  - there would be 200,000 more people unemployed in our country. So do not come in here and claim that you stand for employment. Do not come in here and claim that you stand for the workers. You slashed their wages and working conditions. You got right behind Work Choices and, when the workers and small businesses of Australia needed you, you would not support the stimulus. We on this side of the House stand for employment, we on this side of the House stand for jobs and we on this side of the House stand for small business. - </DOC>

 - I think the mining man of Australia award goes to the member for Dickson today, because the price that he bought at was $38.59 and today it is $39.12. Hear, hear, the member for Dickson! Here is a man who puts his confidence in the government's policy - buys in and sees his share price go up. When we look at those opposite, actions always speak louder than words and, secondly, facts also triumph over fear. When it comes to facts and fear, let me draw this to your attention. On the question of Canadian mining stocks, Australian resources, since the 2 May introduction of the government's tax proposal, have fallen one per cent; Canadian stocks have fallen two per cent.So, can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the member for Dickson that we watch very carefully what those opposite do rather than what they say. We watched carefully what Clive Palmer did two days ago, when he initialled an agreement through his representative, in there with the Chinese - for a project of $5 billion to $6 billion, from memory. We also saw initialled, projects involving other Australian companies only two days ago.Fact and fiction. Fact and fear. I just think we should always observe the behaviour of the member for Dickson. He is a bellwether in terms of what those opposite actually think is going on in the mining industry rather than what they say is going on in the mining industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. In doing so, I am pleased to advise the House that companies in both the petroleum and minerals sectors are seriously engaged in constructive discussions, not only with the Resource Tax Consultation Panel in Canberra this week, but also with the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and me. I say that because they appreciate that megaphone diplomacy is not going to assist in working out the generous transitional arrangements that are available for the purposes of bedding down this major change in taxation in Australia.We all appreciate, as do many in the industry now, that there is going to be a resource super profits tax in Australia. It is also understood that is going to involve a headline rate of 40 per cent. The focus of these discussions is on delivering generous transitional arrangements that not only ensure that we have a capacity to gain for the broader Australian community a fairer share of the return on their natural resources, but also deliver measures that will broaden and strengthen the Australian economy.This is a reform that, unfortunately, the member for O'Connor does not appreciate the significance of. I say that because we are talking not just about a change with respect to the taxation of minerals and petroleum resources in Australia but also about how we as a nation front up to the all-important issues of superannuation payments, how we take pressure off retirement income, and how we lower the burden for Australia's 300,000 smaller businesses, many of whom are represented by the tourism sector, for which I also have responsibility. When it comes to broadening our economic base, it is also about taking pressure off our resource-rich regions and the difficulties they are now experiencing on the infrastructure front.In that context, I say to those companies who are engaging in a very professional and constructive way with the government that we appreciate the way in which they are approaching those negotiations. They understand that this is an important reform and that the best way to inform the outcome is to engage in the process of consultation established by the government. They understand that, at the end of the day, there will be a transition, in association with the capacity to further attract ongoing investment with Australia, which will further enlarge the Australian economic cake.In the context of the discussions I also draw the House's attention to the huge price spikes that we have seen in recent years in such commodities as iron ore, where the price increases since 2004 have been over 500 per cent; and coal, where the price increases have ranged from 300 per cent to 400 per cent. Also, interestingly, there has been a growth in world demand for petroleum and LNG products.These commodities will clearly deliver the vast bulk of the revenue under the RSPT and the PRRT. With respect to many other mineral resources, I simply remind the House, in a calm and measured way, they should appreciate that many of them will be better off under the proposed RSPT. Indeed, the RSPT actually involves a revenue loss for government and a tax cut for many companies that are mining less profitable commodities, because those companies will benefit from royalty refunds and the government's contribution to unutilised losses.Can I say in conclusion: the government is committed to this fundamental reform of Australia's resources taxation system. This will deliver not only opportunities for the resources sector but also many significant opportunities through the broadening of the Australian economy, while also taking pressure off the Australian economy for the purpose of future retirement incomes.</DOC>

 - Of course, the government welcomes continued debate about the actions the government has taken to keep Australia out of recession. That is why I so much welcome this particular question from the member for North Sydney. He should pose himself some pretty basic questions. Based on the Treasury's analysis, had we not acted with stimulus, this economy would have gone into recession. Had we not acted with stimulus, 200,000-plus more Australians would be out of work. Had we not acted with stimulus, the impact on Australian small businesses would have been catastrophic, as it has been across the world.Has the member for North Sydney asked himself this question: why is it that Australia now has the second lowest unemployment rate of all the major advanced economies, at 5.2 per cent? Why is it approximately half that of the United States, and approximately half that of the euro area? Had we generated the same unemployment rate - double-digit unemployment - that we have seen in those parts of the world, do you know how many more Australians would be out of work today? Half a million, Joe - half a million about whom you do not care. - The member for North Sydney shakes his head. If you go from 5.2 per cent, Joe, to 10 per cent, let me tell you it adds up to about half a million more people out of work. Now, you might regard that as a mere piece of collateral damage; we on this side of the House do not. We are proud of the fact that we intervened in the economy. We protected this economy. We made sure it did not go into recession. We acted in a way to keep unemployment low. We have done so with the lowest debt and lowest deficit of the major advanced economies and, on top of that, we have emerged with the second-lowest unemployment level of the major advanced economies.On the final part of the member for North Sydney's question - which underlines fundamentally how he has failed to engage in the detail of the debate on tax reform, because we know the member for North Sydney is not big on detail - the tax reform proposal put forward by the government is entirely directed towards the reforms of the taxation system for company tax, small business and investment in infrastructure, and associated measures in superannuation. The member for North Sydney knows that to be true. If he bothered to read the budget papers, he would know it has nothing to do with the budget bottom line; it is to do with tax reform.The government is proud of having intervened to assist the economy to remain out of recession. Many families out there in Australia are still doing it tough and many small businesses are doing it tough, but let me tell you: had those opposite prevailed, with their prescription for sitting on their hands and doing nothing, this country would be in the middle of mass unemployment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. The presentation of costed and detailed policies is crucial for Australia's longer term prosperity. That is why the government has put out detailed policies - detailed, costed plans - for long-term sustainable growth for Australia's future, including investment in infrastructure, skills, health reform, deregulation, regulatory reform, the National Broadband Network and of course tax reform. All of these are components of a wider, detailed plan to build long-term sustainable growth for the Australian economy.Unfortunately, we have not heard a great deal from the opposition by way of detailed, costed policies. We have heard an awful lot from the Leader of the Opposition about what they would undo but very little about what they would do, were they to be elected. We have heard that they would cancel the computers in schools program, they would scrap the trades training centres. They would stop reforms to private health insurance, they would get rid of GP superclinics, they would abandon reforms to e-health that would make our health system more efficient. They would scrap the tax reforms that would deliver a lower company tax rate for Australian businesses, better superannuation, more infrastructure and better tax breaks for our small businesses. It is long overdue that we heard from the Leader of the Opposition what his economic strategy is, what his health reform strategy is, what his education reform strategy is, what his national security policy is. It is long overdue that we actually got some policy.I do confess that this area is not a complete void; there have one or two things announced - for example, the opposition's great big new tax to fund its Rolls Royce paid parental leave scheme for people on up to $150,000 a year. Interestingly enough, this tax means that company tax for larger businesses in Australia would go to almost 32 per cent, in contrast to the government's proposal, which is that it would go to 28 per cent.Mr Speaker, if you have been watching the media over the last 24 hours, you would have noted that the United Kingdom, under the new coalition government headed by the Conservatives, have just decided to drop their company tax rate from 28 per cent to 24 per cent. What that indicates is that we as a nation do not have the luxury of time in responding to the pressures - that have been there for some time and that were put on hold for a period because of the global financial crisis - about the headline rate of company tax. It is a very important reform to reduce the headline rate of company tax. This government is doing that. The opposition proposes to increase that rate. That is just one item.The second item I noticed over the past 24 hours was the Leader of the Opposition announcing the creation of a parliamentary budget office. This triggered some vague memories in the back of my mind, and I discovered that it was remarkably reminiscent of some very interesting email exchanges that occurred last year between Godwin Grech and various Liberal luminaries. It would appear that Godwin's ghost lives on! He is still drafting strategy for the opposition. Also, the Leader of the Opposition is out there making commitments for the period after the forward estimates end. Whether it is about road projects or pension indexation, he is out there saying to people, 'Look, we'll do something about that beyond the forward estimates.' That is 2014. So what he is effectively saying is, 'You've got to elect us twice before we deliver on our promises.' These are policies on lay-by. You front up and commit initially and then you have to be voted in again before people actually get delivery! I am sorry, but this simply is not good enough. This is not good enough. We are within months of a national election. The Australian people are entitled to serious, detailed, costed positions from the opposition that they can form a view about and so they can make a decision about whether or not they want to take the risk of this erratic opposition leader running the Australian nation and our economy. That is a risk they cannot afford to take.</DOC>

 - I endorse the remarks made by the minister for small business, and the reason I endorse them is that they go to the impact of competition policy - what can actually occur out there in the marketplace. I imagine, knowing the minister for small business very well, that he would have been talking about competition policy, because that is how you keep competitive pressures in the economy and keep prices low - and that is one of the principles for which we stand.A second way in which you can actually contain price rises is through effective consumer protection laws. I note the efforts recently by the minister for financial services to make sure that we have got proper consumer credit protection laws, the first national consumer credit law in the country, which brings together the conflicting jurisdictions of the states into a single form, enabling consumers to have enhanced rights to deal with any exploitative behaviour towards them on the cost of credit and the conditions associated with credit. On the question of the impact on prices associated with the introduction of the government's proposed tax reforms, once again I would refer the member to the detailed findings and conclusions of the Treasury modelling. 
Opposition members - Oh! Oh!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I know he is particularly interested in the latest information about cancer statistics across the country. I was recently in his electorate to make an announcement about our regional cancer services that are providing chemotherapy in Clare and in Gawler, both in his electorate, and also about a new linear accelerator at the Lyell McEwin Hospital, so I know that he, along with many others in the House, would have been interested to see in the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's report today that unfortunately the rate of cancer, and the diagnosis of cancer, is growing in our country. Unfortunately it shows us that we can expect, this year, that 115,000 Australians will be diagnosed with cancer, a 10 per cent increase on the figures from 2006. The good news is that we are getting better at detecting and treating cancers, and survival rates are improving.One of the reasons the government has invested so much in cancer services, particularly services in regional areas, is that the outcomes for those Australians who are diagnosed with cancer and live in rural and regional Australia are still significantly worse than the outcomes for Australians living in one of our capital cities if they are diagnosed with cancer. We were not prepared to let that difference continue. The government has also announced that it is taking very serious action when it comes to trying to reduce the rate of smoking tobacco. Tobacco is a killer product. Unfortunately we still have many Australians who use it, and our increasing the excise is aimed at trying to reduce the numbers of people that will take up smoking to start with. Of course the world-first introduction of plain packaging will help make it less attractive for young Australians into the future.I am pleased to be able to tell the House that, although the Institute of Health and Welfare report shows the number of Australians who are diagnosed with cancer will increase, the 20 additional regional cancer centres across Australia will have an enormous impact on the treatment of cancer. The projects that we have announced to date represent 14 extra linear accelerators, 22 additional radiation oncology bunkers, over 250 chemotherapy beds or chairs, over 140 patient accommodation places and 10 scanners such as CTs, MRIs and PETs. Communities across Australia have been calling out for these investments, and unfortunately the previous government did not listen to many of those calls. So I was very interested to see in the Townsville Bulletin on 12 June this advertisement from the Liberal Party, with the Leader of the Opposition saying:We will deliver a PET Scanner immediately. 
Opposition members - Hold it up higher! - Unfortunately, during nearly 12 years in government, the Leader of the Opposition did not deliver a PET scanner to those people of Townsville. As the health minister, he did not deliver it. I think members opposite might be embarrassed to know that this advertisement that they are so gleefully calling out about is an absolute lie from the member opposite. This government has committed $70 million to deliver cancer services to Townsville -  - Order! The minister will resume her seat. - This includes a PET scanner -  - Let us actually go through the facts. We have been in government for nearly three years. We have made a commitment to $70 million of cancer services in Townsville. That comes on top of a $250 million commitment in Townsville to expand the hospital. There is $70 million for regional cancer services in Townsville and Mount Isa, including a PET scanner due to be delivered in 2012. This will be the first time ever that north of Brisbane there is a PET scanner. There was not one when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister. There was not even a promise when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister. Now that we have provided the money and provided the timetable, we see an advertisement which includes the absolute lie that it should suddenly be believed that this man opposite, who did not provide a PET scanner when he was the health minister, is now going to deliver one without money, without funding, without the time and not at the public hospital. This advertisement is an absolute lie, and the Leader of the Opposition should be ashamed of himself. - With pleasure.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. Let us just remind the shadow minister about the audit report and about the appointment of Mr Orgill, because of course the shadow minister was out squealing for months that an Auditor-General inquiry into Building the Education Revolution was required. Indeed, he called for it. He was squealing for months about the need for an Auditor-General inquiry. Then, when the Auditor-General did report, what the shadow minister squealed about was that the Auditor-General had not found the kinds of things that the shadow minister wanted - squeal, squeal, squeal.The independent watchdog has spoken. The independent watchdog in his report said that there were early positive signs that Building the Education Revolution was achieving the goals for which the program was established. He admits that the shadow minister's squealing about the Auditor-General's report was his squealing that this was not good enough because the Auditor-General had not looked at individual complaints and had not looked at individual projects. Whilst the shadow minister was out there squealing and yapping, as he does, and implementing education cutbacks in the coalition's policies, we were getting on with the job of supporting jobs in Australian communities and modernising schools. To make sure that dollars spent on schools were value for money, we appointed Mr Orgill, a leading Australian businessman, to lead a task force inquiring into value for money. So Mr Orgill is on the job in schools, sleeves rolled up, inquiring into value for money.What does the shadow minister come and squeal about now? Apparently, a leading Australian businessman is not good enough for him. Let me tell you and let me tell the House, Mr Speaker, that I suspect that any Australian of judgment called to choose between Brad Orgill and the member for Sturt would pick Brad Orgill any day of the week.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for her question. She is deeply interested in the quality of Australian education and in making sure that every child gets a fair chance for a great education - something that those members opposite have shown no regard for in government or in opposition.Yesterday I asked the House to contemplate one simple proposition: when is $1 billion not $1 billion? Of course the answer to that riddle is: when it is promised by the National Party. Yesterday I revealed to the House that a so-called $1 billion education promise by the National Party was nowhere near a $1 billion education promise; it was apparently a promise to spend the interest on the so-called $1 billion policy.But today I can reveal that in fact it is a little bit more interesting than that. So the member for Calare, when asked what the interest on the $1 billion, around $50 million, was going to be spent on, could not name specific programs that would receive funding. He went on to say, 'It's not meant to be a dot point policy.' So apart from an illusion about the funding, it is an illusion about the outcomes. They have absolutely no idea what it is they should do to improve the life chances and life prospects of country kids - truly remarkable.It goes on. The member for Parkes has assisted us even more than the member for Calare. The member for Parkes is recorded in his media as saying of this so-called $1 billion policy, which is really the interest on $1 billion that they have no idea how they would spend:It's an aspirational statement and not yet policy, but sent a positive message about education.Quite remarkable.Now if this were just a fight and confusion between members of the National Party, then of course everybody would say: 'Business as usual. That's what we expect from the National Party'. But, no, this policy has been sold, specifically sold by Senator Williams as a policy that has had the tick of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. So let the record show, because I believe, Mr Speaker, it should, that what the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer - the man who would be Deputy Prime Minister if the opposition were elected as government - stand for in education is this: they have promised $1 billion, but they really mean the interest on it, and they have no idea what it would be spent on and really, in the words of the member for Parkes, it is not a policy at all, it is just an 'aspiration'.I know what this really means, and let me make it very clear for the House: it is another phoney policy from an opposition that is erratic and irresponsible and on a mission to mislead Australian voters. The reality is when in government they watched the participation rate of regional kids in universities fall, and in opposition they are showing absolute contempt for these kids and their life chances.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. This is of course an issue of real concern to many military superannuants across the nation. Unfortunately it has been an issue of concern for many years now. The circumstance before the last election was the current government, the then opposition, came forward with two principal promises at the election with regard to this issue. One was to conduct an independent review to examine the indexation methodology and to see whether in fact it properly reflected how superannuation payments ought to be treated. The other was to release the report of what was commonly called the Podger review into military superannuation which had been conducted over a year and a half under the previous government. It had been in the possession of the then government for some months, but not released prior to the election.The review in relation to indexation was conducted by Trevor Matthews, a distinguished actuary. That review came down with a set of recommendations, which I believe the member is familiar with. Those recommendations were that the system should not change currently; that the government should investigate if a potentially superior or more appropriate indexation method became available and to look at that, but otherwise not to change the system. Circumstances are that the government accepted those recommendations.As for the situation that the member mentions, I will go to both issues. One is the position around superannuation for members of parliament. As he is aware, the system has changed in recent years and certainly with regard to new members of parliament - those who have been here over the last couple of terms - the circumstances are that they are not under that more beneficial scheme. I admit I certainly am, as are many here in the chamber still, but we are fading fast.As for the question about the issue of age pensions, we have to be careful about the use of the word 'pension'. It is a word that creates a lot of concern within the veterans community as to what in fact a pension is. The clearest point we can make there is that pensions are periodical payments, but there are in fact different types of what are commonly called pensions. The age pension is an income support payment that is part of the safety net provided to those who do not have access to other forms of income. If they receive it on a part basis then they receive it on a graduated basis according to other sources of income. It is designed to protect the poorest in society; it is designed to ensure that those who need it get it.This government through the Harmer review made significant changes with respect to that and in fact with respect to those that I have responsibility for in the veterans affairs portfolio with some $1.1 billion worth of income support payments over the forward estimates. The circumstance with respect to a superannuation pension is that it is on top of that - it is an additional payment. Many of those military superannuants that the member is concerned about and that many of us are concerned about are in fact also part pensioners at the very least and receive income support payments to a degree according to their individual circumstances.I know the member has been concerned about this issue for some time because I am aware that in fact earlier this year, I think, he endeavoured to move a motion during private members' business with respect to this issue and was apparently not given permission by the opposition to move it. I understand that is something that has been a cause of some concern within the veterans community in recent times.I would also make the point that this has been an issue for a long time. The circumstance with respect to that is that the situation of the opposition also needs to be focused on. My understanding is that the Leader of the Opposition has made a statement along the lines that, when back in government and when the budget is back in surplus, there will be a need to 'tackle this issue'. My question to him is -  
Opposition members - The question's to you! - After more than a decade in government, almost entirely as a senior minister, in a situation where -  -  - As a minister in a government that had surpluses for most of those 10 years, why was action not taken then? I think that is a question that also has to be asked out there within the community in terms of the bona fides of those present here today.The situation with respect to the government's position in response to the Podger review into military superannuation is that we agreed to consult with the ex-service community and the defence community post the last election, subsequent to the release of that report. We did and the response from those communities was, 'We don't like it; we don't want it.' That has produced a dilemma for the government - there is no question about that. My commitment, and I have made it quite public, has been that we will be releasing a position on military superannuation in the next few weeks. I will be ensuring that that is there for the ex-service community and the defence community to consider in the lead-up to the next election. I am committed to doing that and the government is committed to taking action.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her very important question, because I think the government absolutely understands what life is like for many families and many people on fixed incomes who are grappling with a very tight household budget. We understand that. As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs was saying before, that was one of the reasons that we moved to put in place the historic increase in the age pension and disability support pension - something that had not been changed for a long, long time. This was a historic and very significant increase in the base rate of the age pension and disability support pension, because we recognised that many of those people were doing it tough. That is something that we did in very difficult budget circumstances last year but not something that those opposite could find the political will to do in almost 12 years. We moved to do that because we understand what life is like when people are on tight budgets.We understand the importance of employment when people are trying to pay the bills. That is the fundamental reason why the government put in place the substantial, powerful and temporary stimulus into the system - to support employment, because if you do not have a job it is pretty hard to put food on the table and to meet the family costs. So we moved with the stimulus to protect households, to protect their employment and to keep the doors of small business open because we understand how difficult it can be for some people to make ends meet. That is why we are also delivering a third round of tax cuts, which will be coming through this Thursday. - They are ours. We have delivered two and this will be the third. We are proud that we are delivering these tax cuts because we do understand what life is like for people on low and middle incomes and for people on fixed incomes. We have been focused on that from day one. We have been focused on it in terms of child care with substantial increases there. We are focused on what life is like for people on low and modest and middle incomes when it comes to paid parental leave. Of course, that is why the third round of tax cuts, which are going to be delivered next Thursday, are so important and why the government is so committed.For a worker earning $50,000 a year, the tax cut starting on 1 July this year is worth $450 a year. We understand that that is not a lot of money, but it will help make ends meet. It is very important to give this extra help that can make a difference in terms of tight family budgets. This means someone earning $50,000 a year is now paying $1,750 less in tax than they were when the government came to office. That has been a very substantial cut to their tax bill in the period that the Rudd government has been in power of almost 20 per cent.What we are doing is putting more incentive into the system for the people who work hard, and that is important. It has also been accompanied by a range of other measures in terms of child care, the education tax rebate, paid parental leave and, of course, as I mentioned before, the very substantial measures that have been put in place to support employment and to keep people in jobs. We are proud of the support that we are providing to people on low and middle incomes, because it is support that they have earned, it is support that they deserve and it is support which will help them in the long run meet the costs of living, but, more importantly, it will strengthen our economy because it rewards Australians who work hard to make our country great.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. On the first point, as I said to the honourable member yesterday, the practice of this government - and, I believe, the practice of previous governments - is not to comment on ongoing security, operational and associated intelligence matters. That is the first point. That is the responsibility of any responsible government on questions of national security, something which the Leader of the Opposition obviously finds amusing. We on this side of the House do not. The second point I would make, in relation to the second part of his question, is that he refers to undetected arrivals. I would simply say that the detection rate under this government is considerably better than that under the last government. The interception rate under this government - wait for it - is 94 per cent. Under the previous government it was 87 per cent. Can I say to the member, therefore, that he might actually again put facts instead of fear. Could he also on this question possibly reflect on the responsibility of a responsible shadow minister, which is to engage his counterpart on questions of security and operational matters. There are protocols which govern these things. I would have thought that any responsible member, let alone a member of the shadow executive, would adhere to those protocols. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The Rudd government have supported Australia's small businesses through the global recession, and we continue to support small businesses during the economic recovery phase. They need our support because they are still struggling. We recognise that and we want to support them in a number of important ways. But at every turn the coalition in opposition have tried to undermine the support that this government has been providing for small business. The coalition voted against our stimulus package designed to help our tradies and the small businesses that supply them. The coalition have indicated that, if elected, they would scrap the small business tax breaks. Why would you do that? They say they are the party of small business, but they would scrap our small business tax breaks. The coalition have said that they would pull the plug on the National Broadband Network, which would be so important to our small business community.Australia's 2.4 million small businesses are required to follow the rules, and we are helping them to do that. We are helping them to follow the rules with Standard Business Reporting, which will start on 1 July, enabling small businesses to meet their compliance obligations with the Commonwealth through the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and to meet their tax obligations with a real reduction in red tape. We are helping small business comply with their superannuation obligations through the superannuation clearing house that will come into force on 1 July again, in just a couple of weeks time. The Rudd government is creating a national business names registration system so that those small businesses that operate across state boundaries do not have to register their business name in each and every state and territory and make those renewals every couple of years.Small business owners, like all Australians, are expected to comply with these basic rules of disclosure and accountability, and parliamentarians are among those Australians who are expected to comply with their obligations of disclosure and accountability. Yet of course the Leader of the Opposition failed for two years to disclose a $700,000 - A Minister can only be questioned on the following matters, for which he or she is responsible _public affairs;administration; orproceedings pending in the House.The minister for small business has absolutely no responsibility for the pecuniary interests of the House, therefore his answer at the moment could not possibly be relevant to the question he was asked. -  - I was asked whether all Australians, not just small businesses, should meet their obligations of accountability and transparency. Of course, small businesses should meet their obligations of accountability and transparency, and that is what we are helping them to do. But there should be one rule for all Australians, whether they are small business owners, whether they are parliamentarians, whether they are working Australians or whether they are companies - and that is my point. I am not suggesting that this case was anything but an oversight. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was asked: should there be a single standard of reporting and accountability for all Australians, whether they are small businesses or other Australians? And I am directly answering that question. The answer is that there is a double standard. There is a double standard going on in this parliament. - Mr Speaker, I will bring my answer to a close by observing that there is a double standard. There is a born-to-rule mentality on the other side of this parliament - the famous 'victory is at hand'.The members for Bowman, Goldstein and O'Connor then left the chamber. - All we are asking for is consistency in standard. This man is a risk to the Australian economy.</DOC>

What I can say to the Leader of the Opposition is that this government, led by the Treasurer with the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson - the responsible minister - will negotiate with the mining companies of this nation. I have said to the mining companies of this nation publicly that the government is opening its door and asking them to open their minds. I have also said that as a show of good faith - and this has been enacted - the government will remove its advertising from Australia's television screens. In return I have asked that the mining companies do the same, and I am advised that BHP has already taken that step. The negotiations will proceed in an orderly fashion, step by step and piece by piece and led by the Treasurer, and at the appropriate time the government will make further announcements about the resource profits tax.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question, and I thank her for her friendship over all of these years we have been in parliament together. As I said earlier today, I grew up in South Australia. I am the daughter of a hardworking family. My father and my mother worked unbelievably hard to provide a safe and secure household for me and for my sister, Alison. From them I learned the value of hard work. I also learned the importance of government services - the importance of quality schools and the importance of quality health care - to making a life, because as a family were relied on both. Families around the nation rely on both. They need to have a job, they need to have a job with decent working conditions and they need to have those quality services.As a government, we are committed to ensuring that we take the steps necessary so that Australians have work. That is why, during the global financial crisis, we did what we had to do to keep Australians in work. As a government, we are committed to decent working conditions, and the threat to that is the Leader of the Opposition's plan to reintroduce Work Choices. As a government, we are committed to lifting the quality of Australian schools. The threat to that is the cutbacks proposed by the Leader of the Opposition to trade training centres, computers in schools and quality teaching. As a government, we are committed to making sure Australians can see a healthcare professional - that they can see a doctor or a nurse - and to do that we are investing in ensuring that this nation has more doctors and more nurses, and we are investing in Australian hospitals. Of course, the threat to that it is the predisposition of the Leader of the Opposition to cut health funding, demonstrated when he was the minister for health.These are the great issues for Australian working families. These will be the great issues at the forthcoming election, where we as a government will say to Australians that we will provide the services families need, we will protect their jobs and ensure they have decent working conditions.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I do not know if he has ever conducted a genuine negotiation, but I have. As a government, we were elected with our fair work policy. We were elected to get rid of Work Choices. We were elected to get the balance right. Of course, we have honoured the policy commitments in our Forward with Fairness policy but, along the way, we sat with the representatives of business and we talked about the details. We negotiated. We talked. We sat with the representatives of working Australians - representatives of our great trade union movement - and talked. We sat especially with the representatives of small businesses around the nation and talked. Those talks led to a better outcome. They led to a better Fair Work system than we otherwise would have had. It is that spirit that the Treasurer, on my behalf and working with the minister for resources, will take to these negotiations with the mining industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question, I thank her for her representation of her local community and I thank her for her the amount of her lifetime that she has devoted to ensuring that Australians have fair and decent working conditions. The 2007 election was fought very, very clearly on the proposition of whether Australians wanted fair and decent working conditions or they wanted the now Leader of the Opposition's Work Choices plans. The Australian people spoke in 2007, and they rejected Work Choices. They rejected it because of its power in stripping away pay and conditions. They rejected it because of the insecurity it gave them, never knowing if that was the day that they would be presented with an Australian workplace agreement that took basic conditions away. They rejected it because of the insecurity and unfairness of never knowing if that was the day they would be told that they no longer had a job and that they had no right to look for a remedy or contest the reasonableness or fairness of their dismissal.These things were not abstract; these things were real. They were real for people like Sonya and Chrissie who feature in reports analysing the impact of Work Choices. They worked in aged care, a 24-hour industry, and they lost their penalty rates under Australian workplace agreements. They told in the lives of people like Jo, a young casual kitchenhand who faced pressure to sign an AWA against her will. For three months she refused, so the boss refused to give her any shifts. It is this kind of unfairness that we have eradicated with our Fair Work system. It is exactly this kind of unfairness that will be back if the Leader of the Opposition has the opportunity, as Prime Minister, to resurrect his much-loved Work Choices.</DOC>

 - Once again I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. As the Leader of the Opposition knows, I have said today there will be genuine negotiations. I have said today that it is about those who agree that Australians are entitled to a fairer share of the mineral wealth in our grounds working together to get the right result. Now the government believes Australians are entitled to a fairer share of the mineral wealth in our grounds. We believe that is the birthright of Australians, the minerals that we all jointly own and have inherited - minerals that can be dug up and sold only once. The mining industry has acknowledged that it can pay more tax, so the government and the mining industry have an agreement that they can pay more tax. We believe they should pay more tax. That is a very firm foundation stone for negotiations and, with the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Treasurer, we will build on it.Interestingly there are people in this parliament beyond that consensus, who do not believe that Australians are entitled to a fairer share, who do not believe that the mining industry can pay more tax. Those people are the Leader of the Opposition and the team that he leads. They are outside the consensus on which we will build. As we build on that consensus, of course, we will keep the Australian people informed, as is proper and appropriate, but our intention is to genuinely negotiate. And once again I would take this opportunity to thank, as I am advised, BHP for exhibiting goodwill today by removing its advertising, as the government has removed its.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for this very important question because the government is about supporting the living standards of Australian families, particularly when times are tough. Of course, that is why the government moved so swiftly and powerfully when the global recession, through the global financial crisis, had such a dramatic impact on economies around the world and led to such a reduction in demand for our economy. We moved powerfully to support employment. We moved powerfully to support small business. Because nothing is more fundamental to your living standards than the capacity to earn a wage, to have a job, to keep your small business open and operating. That is why the stimulus has been so important.And, although it is being withdrawn, it is still supporting employment in a whole range of sectors in the Australian economy, because this government understands that not everybody is doing as well as others. And, even though we have a strong economy, and even though we have a low unemployment rate, which is absolutely important to supporting living standards, there are many people in some sectors of the economy who are still doing it tough. There are many people, for example, in non-residential construction who are significant beneficiaries of the stimulus programs that we have put in place, that the Prime Minister has put in place, that the Minister for Housing has put in place. These are very important for keeping the doors of small business open and for keeping many tradies, in particular, in employment. That is one way you can support living standards, particularly when you have uncertain international events in countries such as Greece. It is very important to support living standards, and that is why the government's action was so important to stimulate our economy.This was, of course, opposed by those opposite. We know that if they were to have had their way, they would not have supported the stimulus packages. They certainly did not support the bank guarantees. Of course that would have had a dramatic impact on unemployment in this country. The thing about unemployment is that, when it is high and when it is there for a long time, it destroys skills and it destroys capital and it destroys small businesses and it destroys communities. So this government is absolutely up for supporting the living standards of the Australian people.Now that the global economy is recovering, we have to do more. We understand that many people are still under financial pressure. For many people they still find it pretty tight when the family budget comes down, and it is hard to wrap it around the pay cheque. So a lot of people out there have trouble making ends meet, which is why we have done a number of things since we have been in government. First of all we had the historic increase to the age pension. Single pensioners on the base rate of pension had been living in poverty for a long period of time, but we took the gutsy step to make a fundamental, historic increase in the age pension, which is so important to the living standards of so many people on fixed incomes.But it is not just what we did in terms of the age pension. It is what we have done with the education tax rebate - so important to families when they are sending their kids back to school, finding it difficult to buy everything that they need, to get the kit for the kids to go to school. The education tax rebate is absolutely important, also what we have done to increase the childcare tax rebate. All of these things have been very important to living standards.But a very important measure that is continuing is the three sets of tax cuts delivered by this government. We understand that, when you work hard and you do a bit of overtime, you do not want all of that being gobbled up, either in the tax take or in the withdrawal of family payments. That is why the tax cuts which will commence next week are so important. They are not large, but they will help people get by - they will make life a little bit better. A worker on $50,000 will get an extra tax cut of $450 per year from 2010-11. Over the three rounds of tax cuts, for a worker on $50,000 that is a tax cut of $1,750. For a worker on $80,000 it is an extra $300 a year, but for that worker over three rounds of tax cuts that is $1,550. That is what we are doing to support living standards, but it is also important when it comes to the tax system because you reward effort. These tax reforms and these tax cuts are an important part of strengthening the economy by giving people extra incentive to work. That is important as well.We know that those opposite opposed our stimulus. I do not know where we would be in this country in terms of levels of unemployment had they been in power through last year and the year before. And, of course, they have not supported many of the other initiatives that we have put in place as well. But we do know what would put a wrecking ball through family finances and security if they were in power, and that would be Work Choices. This, more than any other policy, demonstrates how those opposite do not understand the importance of supporting living standards, because when they last were given a chance to support the workers of Australia they attacked them viciously - and they are coming around for Work Choices mark 2.We on this side of the House are proud of what we have been able to do to support living standards. We know more needs to be done, but at least there is a bit of extra help coming next week.</DOC>

 - I thank the same old Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question and wish her well as she serves her third leader. -  - I have made very clear the government's attitude. -  - They just need to settle down a little bit, Mr Speaker. I have made very clear the government's view about the negotiations: our door is open; we are asking the mining industry to also open its mind. I believe that people of goodwill can sit around a table when there is already a foundation stone of agreement, and here we have one - that the mining industry can pay more tax and that Australians are entitled to their fair share. When you have that foundation stone of agreement and you have people of goodwill sitting around a table, then you can work issues through.I particularly am reinforced in that view because it is only a few short hours ago that I indicated publicly that the government would remove its advertising from Australia's television screens and I asked the mining industry to reciprocate that act of goodwill - and already we are seeing our goodwill reciprocated. This does give me confidence that there is room for negotiation; there is an ability to work together in a spirit of goodwill. And we will.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. The member for Ballarat is, of course, chairing the inquiry of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government into smart infrastructure. The first meeting was held here in the parliament, attended by over 200 experts in a full-day seminar. I congratulate the member for Ballarat on her work on that committee, and also the member for Hinkler. This is a committee that works in the best traditions of bipartisanship in this chamber.The Gillard Labor government is working very hard to deliver a high-speed national broadband network -  -  - because we understand that high-speed broadband will be the communications backbone for smart infrastructure. This is about an agenda for the future. Intelligent transport systems will be able to provide commuters with real-time information about relative congestion, the time to be taken and the pricing of various travel options to facilitate informed decisions. Smart energy meters will give you an informed choice of energy source, price tariff, emissions intensity or just-in-time hot water heating.Already Australians can see the promise of smart infrastructure in reality - like our investment in the Kwinana Freeway in Perth to install advanced technologies like variable speed limits and real-time lane management systems, making a real difference today; or our $100 million investment in the Smart Grid, Smart City demonstration project, trialling advanced technologies to improve energy efficiency for homes and businesses; or our $45 million investment to trial advanced train management systems in South Australia with satellite based GPS and wireless broadband communications to manage train movements.We take these issues seriously as part of the future agenda because we know that Access Economics has found that the application of smart infrastructure could increase GDP by between $35 and $80 billion over the first 10 years. This is one of the reasons why a national broadband network is so important to our future. It is at risk from the opposition, and it is just one of the reasons why this Labor government deserves to be re-elected.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question - although, coming from him, it somewhat surprises me. Obviously, as Deputy Prime Minister I worked with and supported closely Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. That was the appropriate thing to do. It was also appropriate for me, as a senior member of the Labor government, to think and particularly to canvass in my own mind views about the performance of the government and the best way of making sure that we were a government that was always, each and every day, serving the interests of the Australian people.As is now a matter of record, and I said it this morning, I did form the view that this was a good government that in some areas had lost its way. I also did form the view that the best way of making sure that this government was back on track, providing to the Australian people the leadership that they deserve - focused on their jobs, their working conditions, health, education, the infrastructure they need for the future and the big challenges like climate change - was to take the course that I took last night and this morning. I am well aware that there are others who will look at that and will form a view as to whether I took the correct course. That is the nature of politics; that is the nature of making decisions about the questions of how the national interest is best served. I made a decision, and I stand by it absolutely.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Australia's commitment to Afghanistan is, of course, displayed not just by our military commitment but also by our civilian commitment and our civilian contribution. This reflects our view that the effort in Afghanistan will not be successful by military action or security enforcement alone but by civilian reconstruction and reconciliation as well - a political strategy.Yesterday the Minister for Defence and I welcomed the new command structures in Oruzgan Province announced by the International Security Assistance Force. The Minister for Defence yesterday and today detailed the military arrangements. I do not propose to retail those for the House, but it is important to have a very clear understanding of our civilian contribution. Australia will play a significant role as far as capacity building, reconstruction and the civilian contribution in Oruzgan Province are concerned. A senior Australian official will be the lead administrator of the provincial reconstruction team, effectively coordinating the civilian reconstruction effort. This follows on from a commitment that the government made in April of this year to substantially enhance our civilian and diplomatic presence not just in Oruzgan Province but in Afghanistan generally. By the end of September we will see that complement increased from 30 to 50, with increases not just from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the diplomatic front but also from our development assistance agency, AusAID, and from the Australian Federal Police. That is a substantial contribution which we continue to make. This sees in Oruzgan Province a continuation of the building of roads, the building of schools and a significant capacity-building effort.The necessity for these changed arrangements has of course come as a result of the Dutch decision to withdraw from Oruzgan Province. I make the point to all members of the House that we very much compliment the Dutch on their efforts. We have worked very closely with them in Oruzgan Province in respect of both military matters and civilian reconstruction matters. I have had many conversations with my Dutch counterpart, Foreign Minister Verhagen, up to the recent Dutch election, and we welcome very much the prospect and the hope that the Dutch will continue to make some civilian and military contribution in Oruzgan Province.We know that Afghanistan is difficult and dangerous. At the beginning of question time, all members of the House rose to formally pay their respects to the three soldiers recently killed. In that context, we are of course very conscious of the security and protection of our civilians. As I have indicated publicly, Australian defence forces will continue to make judgments about the protection and safety of our civilians who operate in Oruzgan Province and in Afghanistan generally. We will continue to make those security judgments and provide force protection when they make decisions, to use the defence phrase 'beyond the wire'.I conclude by drawing the House's attention to the changed arrangements which have recently been made - indeed, made overnight - to the personnel command as far as the International Security Assistance Force is concerned and the appointment of General Petraeus. We welcome General Petraeus's appointment. We have worked well with him in the past. We know him well. Indeed, the Minister for Defence recently presented him with an Order of Australia in the United States for the contribution he had made in the Iraq effort in cooperation with Australian forces. We worked very closely with General McChrystal.I finish on this point. We very much support the Obama strategy, which was developed as a result of the Riedel review and as a result of General McChrystal's review, in which General Petraeus also took part. The basis and substance of that strategy is that we can only be successful in staring down international terrorism in Afghanistan if we make our efforts not just on the military side but also on the political, reconstruction, capacity-building, reconciliation and political rapprochement side. We look forward to working closely with General Petraeus as he assumes his leadership of the ISAF military forces.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. What I say to him is what I said publicly this morning, which is that I accept my fair share of the responsibility for the decisions taken by the government - of course I do. I also accept the responsibility for forming the view that the government needed to do a series of things better and I am here, obviously, in this position as Prime Minister to ensure that we do just that. In doing that, we will be addressing questions like the future of the resource super profits tax, and that has already been canvassed in the parliament today. We will be addressing questions like investments in the great wind and solar power of this country. We will be addressing questions about how we can continue to improve our education services, how we can continue to deliver better health services and how we can ensure, having protected jobs during the global financial crisis and having done what we needed to do to protect jobs, that we continue to modernise our economy, including by providing to it the benefits of high-speed national broadband so that we can seize those economic opportunities of the future.The member for Mackellar then left the chamber. - I do acknowledge that the member for Sturt is a performer in search of an audience but, whilst he continues that search, we in the government will continue to focus, as we have today, as we will tomorrow, as we will the day after, on the needs of working Australians. I would have to say that sometimes when I come into this parliament - and today seems to be one of those days - it seems to me that the Leader of the Opposition has forgotten that the purpose of this place is to serve the national interest and particularly to meet the needs of working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question. The government is committed to delivering long-term sustainable growth for the Australian economy. As part of that commitment, there are a number of specific strategies that are being pursued. These include infrastructure development, improvement in our skill formation, the National Broadband Network, tax reform and, specifically within my own portfolio, the area of deregulation - of reforming the regulatory arrangements in our country to relieve the burden on business.There are many different things occurring on a range of fronts, none of them in itself dramatically transformational but in aggregate a very important program of reform across our economy that will eliminate inefficiency, reduce costs and red tape and boost productivity in the medium term. The most important process is the Business Regulation and Competition Working Group of COAG, which is gradually progressing 27 separate items of reform that are being implemented one by one over a three- to four-year period, with a payment of $550 million, or a proportion thereof depending on delivery and performance, to be paid to the states at the end of that period.There have been occasional wobbles. Every now and then there have been small delays, but I am happy to report to the House that the total package is on track - that this very broad, detailed process of regulatory reform is on track. Every now and then a state upper house causes a bit of a problem. Every now and then there is a slight delay because of a state election, but nonetheless this process is on track.I will give an illustration of some of the very important areas: the development of a uniform national occupational health and safety regime, the development of harmonised environmental assessment processes between the states and the Commonwealth, a national trade-licensing scheme so that individuals in trades such as plumbing do not have to have separate licences for separate states, the development of uniform national consumer credit legislation, uniform national consumer protection legislation, a uniform national regime for registering business names - particularly important for smaller businesses - and, of course, the standard business reporting mechanism that is due to commence very shortly that enables businesses to have a single channel of information reporting to governments, state and federal.There is also a process of Commonwealth reform occurring which involves me, as Minister for Finance and Deregulation, partnering with individual line ministers to pursue particular processes of regulatory reform, such as improving product disclosure statements under the financial services reform process, getting them down from 50 and 80 pages to a sensible size. We have pursued this reform across a number of areas already, such as managed investments and superannuation, in partnership with the respective ministers for superannuation and corporate law, formerly Senator Sherry and now Mr Bowen.There is also a process under way of reforming our visas to ensure that we reduce the total number of different kinds of visas available. There are now over 150. That is going to be rationalised, working in partnership with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. We are well advanced in the process of improving the approval process for health technologies, in partnership with the Minister for Health and Ageing. There are a number of other processes that are under way: rationalising antidiscrimination legislation, improving the regime for the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority and improving the excise arrangements that are administered, in some cases, with overlap between the Australian Taxation Office and Customs.There are many other areas that are going to require our dedicated attention. I would like to pay tribute to the work of my minister assisting, Craig Emerson, who has been a very diligent and dedicated contributor to this process. There is much more work to do to improve the regulatory arrangements and relieve the burden on business, but very substantial progress is occurring and this is a key part of the government's wider strategy to deliver long-term sustainable economic growth for Australia's future.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for Petrie for that question. She understands, through her personal life as well as her working life, just how important it is to support the work and family choices of all families in Australia. We know how critical it is to value hard work, especially of mothers, whether they are in the paid workforce or at home.The member for Petrie understands that all women will most likely spend some periods of their lives in the workforce or at home, combining both their work and family responsibilities. That is why the government provides financial support, through family tax benefit part A and part B and the baby bonus. From 1 January the government will deliver Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme. Australia will finally catch up with the rest of the developed world. Eligible working parents will be entitled to 18 weeks of paid parental leave, paid at the federal minimum wage. The government made sure that this was budgeted for, paid for, in last year's budget.The government are making sure that our Paid Parental Leave scheme is fair to both business and families. This is a huge win for Australian families. It is also a particularly important win for those families who have traditionally missed out on paid parental leave. Access to paid parental leave is certainly rare for women on lower incomes. As a result of the government's Paid Parental Leave scheme, we estimate that around 30,000 working families with incomes of less than $50,000 are expected to benefit. We also know that there are many casuals, many part-timers, many contractors and many self-employed women who have previously missed out. As a result of our scheme, around 10,000 self-employed women will gain access to paid parental leave each year. Many of those women will get paid parental leave for the first time. These are very real benefits for families in Australia, delivered by this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question and also for his passionate advocacy for affordable, accessible childcare solutions for his community. This government has a very clear record of supporting Australian families to manage their budgets, particularly when it comes to the costs associated with early childhood education and with child care. This is perhaps most clearly demonstrated by the $17.1 billion investment in early childhood education and child care over the next four years from this government. To put this in context this $17.1 billion in investment is around $10 billion more than that offered by the previous government in their last four years.We, of course, have delivered on our election commitment to increase the childcare rebate from 30 to 50 per cent of parents' out-of-pocket expenses, with this extra support going directly to parents to help them with the cost of living. We also met our election commitment to increase the maximum that families could claim from $4,354, as it was under the previous government, to $7,500 per child per year, under this government, a substantial increase of some $3,146 a year or 72 per cent.Last year, 670,000 Australian families benefited from these significant reforms, which enabled them to claim up to half of their out-of-pocket childcare costs, up to $15,000 per year per child. We also know that, as a result of the childcare rebate increase, a family earning $80,000 with one child in full-time care receives some $2,239 more in childcare rebate under this government than they would have under the previous government.As a result of these changes ABS statistics also show us that childcare costs to parents fell by some 20 per cent. In 2004, the out-of-pocket costs for a family with an income of $55,000 a year with one child in long day care was 13 per cent of their disposable income. This has significantly declined to seven per cent by 2009. For a family with an annual income of $115,000 per year the amount of the family budget spent on child care has declined from 11 per cent to seven per cent over that same period.In addition to the childcare rebate, we are also providing $8.4 billion in childcare benefit over four years to low- and middle-income earners across Australia, which means that the Australian government will cover around 80 per cent of the costs of child care for these families. We absolutely know that it can be really tough for family budgets and it can be tough to provide childcare solutions for those families. That is why, in total, we will provide $14.4 billion over four years for parents through the childcare rebate and through the childcare benefit. This is $8 billion more than the Howard government provided in childcare fee assistance in their last years.We have shown time and time again that we recognise the importance of child care and early childhood education. We are committed to affordable and high-quality child care. Unlike those opposite we are absolutely prepared to put our money where our mouth is and deliver for Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Of course, I understand that Australians feel a sense of discomfort, disquiet and even anxiety when they see boats intercepted at sea and asylum seekers taken to Christmas Island and potentially other locations for processing. It does make people anxious; I understand that. They look to the government to make sure that we are managing these questions, to make sure we are understanding the full complexity of these questions and to make sure that we are protecting the nation's borders.I have a copy of the press release that the member refers to, which I issued as shadow minister in 2003 so it was quite some time ago. But if one looks at the content of the press release, as opposed to just the headline, it indicates that it was my view in opposition that, in order to deal with questions of asylum seekers and refugees, we needed strong, regional engagement with our neighbours, particularly Indonesia. I still believe that. If we look at the content of the press release, as opposed to the title of it, it was also indicating that I thought it was appropriate that there be additional naval assets protecting our border. And guess what? Under this government we have more assets patrolling our border, more than ever before under any other government. What I would say -  -  - I understand that this is a complex area of management and a complex area of policy. I also understand that this is an area of policy where views can differ and people want to put forward different views in the debate. The only thing I would say is that, when views are put forward, we owe it to the Australian people, as we address these questions, to make sure those views are properly informed by the facts.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for his question and his interest in ensuring we maintain the security and safety of our airports and our aircraft. That is why this government is proposing tougher laws for aviation related crime. Under the proposal of the government there will be maximum penalties for aviation related crimes. Penalties will increase as a result of the consultations that we have had with the airline industry, the major airports and the state and territory governments. We have also spoken with the representatives of the employees, the workforce in those places.We have to do everything we possibly can to make sure that our airports are safe and our aircraft are safe. It is for that reason I would also ask that the opposition quite genuinely consider supporting the regulations that have been proposed by the Minister for Transport on the capacity to enter cockpits. That is also very important and incidental to this very important initiative. We would increase jail terms for serious hoax offences - such as calling an airline and saying a bomb is on a plane or threatening to bomb an airport - to up to 10 years jail. This currently carries a two-year maximum jail term. It is the view of the government - and I think the view of the opposition, having seen their comments - that this is not a significant enough penalty for such a serious offence. For that reason, we are looking to increase the threshold to make it more similar to penalties for other types of hoaxes. For example, where people might say they have contaminated goods in supermarkets, which could endanger the community, there are currently penalties of up to 10 years. This would match that type of penalty.There are 14-year jail sentences proposed for offences against aircraft or aviation environments, such as damaging a runway or air traffic control facilities at a major airport, which currently carry a maximum jail term of seven years and 10 years respectively - we look to lift that - and 20-year jail sentences for very serious offences that pose danger or cause harm to groups of people, such assaulting a pilot or endangering an aircraft while in flight. These offences currently carry maximum jail terms of seven, 14 or 15 years. It is the view of the state and territory governments, the sector and others that we increase that penalty. There will remain, of course, life in jail for those who would commit offences such as hijacking or destroying an aircraft and being reckless as to causing death. The increase in penalties will provide greater consistency with other criminal legislation and will provide greater safety and greater deterrence to commit such offences.These measures build upon the significant achievements of this government in aviation security. The government announced in February this year a $200 million package to enhance our aviation security. That was a very important initiative. These laws, if enacted, will complement those initiatives and will also complement the announcement, made in December last year, that we will go from the unified police model at our major airports to an all-in model which, in effect, means we will have the Australian Federal Police undertaking the security of our major airports. It will probably take three to five years for the transition to occur. We are working very closely with our state counterparts to ensure we do that as seamlessly as possible and to make sure we provide security at our airports as we bring about that very important initiative.These are very important penalties. They are enclosed within legislation before the House and we would call upon the opposition to support them, in order to ensure that our airports are safe and our aircraft are safe for Australians and for visitors to this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Of course I regret and am sorry for any harm caused or inconvenience or anxiety that Australian families have felt arising from the Home Insulation Program - of course I do. As is well known in this parliament and well known in the community, there were some tragic deaths involving young people that are the province of proper inquiries - coronial inquiries, occupational health and safety inquiries and the like. When any person dies at work, obviously that is a tragedy. We have proper processes to investigate such tragedies and they are in train now.I say to the member that the government acknowledged, and I acknowledge on the government's behalf, that this program did become a mess and the government had to act. We did act and we continue to act through the relevant minister to deal with the consequences of this program, including the need for inspections. But what I would also say to the member who has asked the question is that he is well aware that the insulation program was part of the urgent delivery of economic stimulus as we did what had to be done in response to the global financial crisis. These were difficult circumstances: the biggest global economic downturn since the Great Depression. We faced a prospect where hundreds of thousands of additional Australians could have been out of work. I understand from the voting record of the member and the voting record of the Leader of the Opposition that they continue to be and were at the time less concerned than us about keeping Australians in work. But we are driven by a passion of ensuring that we keep Australians in work. - And of course I can say to the member that that is not what I am saying. What I am saying is that we provided urgent economic stimulus because we were deeply and passionately concerned about the circumstances of working Australians and wanted to enable them to have the benefits and dignity of work and the ability to take a pay packet home, to pay their mortgages and provide all of the things that families need for the care of children and for looking after themselves. That is what is drove us to provide economic stimulus.On the Home Insulation Program, we have and I am prepared to fulsomely acknowledge the major problems with this program that caused the government to terminate it and which means now that the relevant minister, Minister Combet, is dealing with arrangements including the making available of home inspections.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. I know that he has been following the health debate with great interest and that constituents in his electorate are already benefiting from the investments of the North Lakes health precinct, particularly those constituents that need renal dialysis. I was asked about the broad range of our health reforms, particularly the investments we are making to train more GPs to deliver more services to working families, particularly the elder, who are big users of health services.A major part of our health reforms is looking at what we can do in the provision of GP services, whether that is through GP infrastructure, GP training places, rural incentives to make sure that we have enough GPs working in our regional capitals and in the bush, after hours support or making sure that we pay for practice nurses so that they can assist GPs in their work. I am very pleased to advise the House that tomorrow applications will open for GPs to apply for funding of up to half-a-million dollars for more than 400 GP practices across the country to expand their facilities, to employ extra staff and to train the future workforce. We are very excited about this development because it means that our constituents across the country have the opportunity of having enhanced services in their areas. It will make it easier for them to see a GP when they need a GP.Unfortunately, this investment is opposed by those opposite. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has a bit of an issue when it comes to GPs. He capped their training places when he was the health minister. He has on his budget list already savings that will pull hundreds of millions of dollars out of GP areas. One of the things that he did not do when he was health minister is adjust the rates that were payable to supervisors who are prepared to train GPs. I can also announce that I have just recently provided information to the AMA, the AGPN and the College of GPs to provide an increase of 20 per cent in the funding to support those GPs who want to train young GPs to stay in general practice in the future.We are very proud of our record. We know that when we commit to training 5,500 GPs over the coming decade that we will need to encourage more of our existing GPs to help train others. That is what this announcement this week will provide for. I hope that the Leader of the Opposition will seriously reconsider the budget cuts that he has flagged, because I am sure that we will be overwhelmed with GPs across the country from electorates on this side of the House and on that side of the House anxiously wanting to apply for these funds, which will expand their services and provide more benefits to families across the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. If the Leader of the Opposition is genuinely interested in these matters, then I ask him to respond positively to my invitation to members of the opposition who accept that climate change is real and who accept that pricing carbon is necessary for us to achieve our emissions reduction objectives to join the climate change committee.The government have seized the opportunities that we believe this new parliament presents to work in a methodical way when considering all of the options for pricing carbon. It is not going to be easy, but I believe you can achieve things when people work together in a spirit of good faith. I understand that the opposition is going to invite me to engage in a series of rule-in, rule-out games about what will be considered during this process and I am not going to do it. There is not a company board or an executive committee of a local tennis or cricket club in this country that takes options off the table before they go and sit down to work through issues. We are going to go through a proper process with the multiparty committee. Of course, the government will then make the final decisions about what the government's position will be, but we will go through this process step by step in good faith. I have written to the Leader of the Opposition about it and I ask him to embrace this positive opportunity, rather than seek to be a wrecker on this question which is so important to Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. Obviously, Australian athletes and supporters are very much focused on the Commonwealth Games in India. Of course, we would want the focus to be on what will happen at the Games and the potential for our athletes to win medals, but obviously the focus has also been on security questions. I take this opportunity to advise the House that the Australian government has been working closely with the Indian authorities on Games security since early 2009. A task force has been set up to provide travellers with the best available information, which is contained in the India travel advice and a Commonwealth Games bulletin on the DFAT website.This information is reviewed regularly, and my purpose in raising this matter today is to draw people's attention to the fact that this advice has been updated today. I encourage all Australians in India or people intending to travel to India to read the updated advice carefully. That advice states that Australians should exercise a high degree of caution in India. Australian authorities continue to receive reports of possible terrorist attacks in New Delhi, Mumbai and other major cities, and the risk of a terrorist attack is high. The updated advice also notes that some public places should be avoided.The Australian government continues to seek assurances about the safety of Commonwealth Games venues. Ultimately, of course, the Australian government is not in a position to independently verify the safety of games venues or security in India more broadly. Instead, we urge every Australian in India to read the travel advice carefully and make an informed decision.I would like to say a word on reports in the media today that two extremist groups are planning to attack the Commonwealth Games. I have seen those reports and I am advised our initial assessment is that those specific reports lack credibility. Of course, we are following this up with the Indian authorities and we will provide any information should it come to light. As I have said, our best assessment of the security situation is contained in the India travel advice and every Australian in India should read that advice, think carefully and make an informed decision.Can I conclude by saying a word about this advice and our relationship with India. This advice is not meant as a slight on the government and the people of India, who are our good friends and partners. Our travel advice is our best factual assessment of the situation on the ground in the country concerned. It is not a judgment or a criticism; it is simply a service provided to help travellers make an informed decision. I am sure I speak on behalf of all the members of this place when I say that we all want to see a peaceful and successful Commonwealth Games - nothing would please the Australian community more.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is the case that for a long time the government have had the ambition and also the goal of putting a price on carbon. That is not disputed and I reiterated that at great length during the last election campaign. But we know what happened in the last election campaign: those opposite said that not only did they not believe in the science of climate change but also they proposed to do nothing about it. We said that we would seek community consensus on this critical question, that we would come to this question with an open mind. And we do come to this question with an open mind.Those opposite once believed in a price on carbon and they believed in it in this parliament for two years plus. The member for Wentworth led that charge until it was voted down in this House by the now Leader of the Opposition, and voted down in the Senate three times. As we go forward, we must do the right thing by our society and our economy. Business certainty, job creation and our future prosperity demand that we deal with this very important question. We will deal with it by finding community consensus. What the member opposite wants to do in this debate is to reach a conclusion. The government will go through this multiparty process with other members of parliament with an open mind to find a solution in the national interest. Those opposite think it is in their political interest at the moment to make these points.We will not be deterred from pursuing the national interest. The national interest and a prosperous economy demand that we deal with this. Business certainty demands that we deal with this. You have already seen an investment strike when it comes to investment in power stations. We must deal with this. You have seen the statements from the business community and you have seen the statements from Mr Kloppers. They all indicate that the future of our economic prosperity means that as a parliament and as a community we must deal with this very important question. This multiparty committee that has been put together is part of finding the common ground between us and the Independents and the minor parties - and, of course, the common ground that exists with some on the other side of the House who are not game to speak up at the moment. We will not be deterred by a scare campaign. We will put the national interest first. The national interest demands that as a nation and as a community we deal with this important question, not the short-term political interests of those opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. Of course, it should be a source of great pride to Australians that the Australian nation is emerging from the biggest global economic downturn in 75 years stronger than any other advanced economy in the world. It should be a source of great pride to Australians that during the worst global recession in 75 years we kept our economy growing, we created more than half a million jobs in the first term of this government and we will see our budget return to surplus in 2012-13. If we do the quick comparisons with countries overseas it shows how much we have to be proud of at this time. Advanced economies contracted by a record 3.2 per cent in 2009 and now face an uncertain outlook. The US and the euro area are grappling with unemployment rates that are almost double our current rate of 5.1 per cent. The major advanced economies will be struggling to even halve their deficits by 2013, when we will be returning to surplus.This shows the pivotal role played by timely government action and by the provision of economic stimulus - economic stimulus that prevented literally hundreds of thousands of Australians becoming unemployed; economic stimulus that prevented an economic circumstance where inevitably we would have faced bigger debts and bigger deficits. We should, as a nation, be proud of this, and I am proud that as a government we took the right steps to keep Australia working.Now, of course, there is the task of seizing this moment as we emerge stronger than any other advanced economy from the global financial crisis and building on that strength. In order to do that we need to ensure that we do deliver on fiscal consolidation, and we are engaged in the fastest fiscal consolidation process since at least the late 1960s. As part of that process, this side of the House ensured that every single proposal we announced in the election campaign was properly costed and was offset by matching savings - in stark contrast to the $11 billion black hole the Leader of the Opposition hid each and every day of the election campaign because he simply did not want Australians to see it.Now we need to build on this prospect of future prosperity with investments in infrastructure like the National Broadband Network - infrastructure that will ensure we have a competitive advantage rather than exporting jobs to Korea or to Singapore because we lack this vital infrastructure - and investments in infrastructure in the form of roads, rail and ports. Of course, we are making record investments in these areas; investments, too, into the potential of Australians, their skills and capacities, through the education revolution, recognising that when you boil it all down the greatest competitive strengths of this nation and its economy are the skills and capacities of the Australian people. We will be delivering this economic strategy step-by-step as a government during this parliament, working collaboratively and in a positive way for the benefit of all Australians, who want the prosperity and opportunities that future economic strength will provide. - </DOC>

 - I am happy to answer the Leader of the Opposition's question. As the Leader of the Opposition probably knows, I was asked during the election campaign about rumours which were then in the media that the government had plans to expand the Curtin detention centre to 3,000 - that is, that it would cater for 3,000 asylum seekers. As the minister for immigration has made clear in recent days, the government has no intention to expand and will not be expanding the Curtin detention centre to 3,000. What, of course, was occurring at the Curtin detention centre during the election campaign was a series of construction works -  -  - During the election campaign, works were occurring at the Curtin detention centre, and I refer to the detail of those works. They were stage 1 accommodation for the approximately 600 detainees then at the centre. The works for stage 1, which began in May 2010, included the letting of contracts for the supply and installation of demountable buildings, installation of fencing and security systems and critical infrastructure work required to support 600 people.Of course the government is, through the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, working with the Department of Defence. Departments look at contingencies and at options. You would expect them to do that. That is the normal part of prudent planning. Those things have occurred and will continue to occur - the two departments looking at contingencies and options. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in recent days, made some detailed statements about expanded capacity and those are available for members of the House and for members of the public.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. Recent economic figures show yet again that the Australian economy is one of the strongest economies in the developed world. We also have an extraordinary performance when it comes to job creation, a performance which I know all members of the House are proud of because it means that more Australians are taking home a pay packet. What that means for those families is greater security. Going to the core of this government's objectives in economic policy and in social policy more broadly is that we create the jobs and provide the job security which all Australians pray for for themselves, for their families and for their community. Because employment growth has been so strong, we are one of the strongest advanced economies.In the last couple of weeks we saw the publication of the June quarter national accounts. In that quarter the Australian economy grew by 1.2 per cent - to grow by 3.3 per cent through the year. We have seen the creation of 53,000 full-time jobs in August alone and something like 349,000 jobs have been created in Australia in the past year. There is no figure we are more proud of than the fact that in our term of office something like 567,000 jobs have been created.To put this into perspective, two years ago we were contemplating the collapse of Lehman Brothers which had just happened. We were contemplating the global financial crisis, which then turned into a global recession. We have dealt with that in this country better than just about any other advanced economy. These figures are so important because they show that we are transitioning from stimulus led growth to private sector demand. What that means to this economy is that we can be optimistic about our outlook.We are not necessarily immune from what is going on elsewhere in the world but we are in the strongest growing part of the global economy. Yes we see there are still downside risks when we look at what is going on in Europe and to some extent in the United States, but what we can see in these figures is something very special - not just jobs growth but the fact that consumption is returning and that investment is going to be strong as we go forward. Planned business investment for 2010-11 is going to be $123 billion, a very substantial increase on what was expected a year earlier - a substantial increase of 24 per cent. Of course, as we all know, investment is much stronger in the mining sector. These figures indicate that that growth and that planned investment is broader than just the mining sector, and that is important.When you compare that with what is happening in Europe or in the United States, you see that this is a very good outlook for Australia. It does not necessarily mean that everything is going right for every business or that every family is necessarily doing well, but the fundamentals are falling into place. As we go forward, it will mean that we will not be dealing with the rubble of high unemployment and capital destruction which flows from a recession. We are moving forward from a position of strength, from very solid foundations. That is why the government is so determined to put in place our future agenda, which addresses long-term challenges, particularly the challenges which will flow from mining boom mark 2. That is why we take the recommendations of the Henry report seriously when it comes to company taxation. - That is why we want to bring down the company tax rate. That is why we want to give small businesses in particular a very substantial tax cut, a very substantial incentive to invest in plant and equipment. That is why we are investing in fundamental infrastructure like the National Broadband Network. Nothing could be more important to future productivity and to all businesses in Australia than the productivity benefits that will flow from the NBN. These are the vital policies that need to be put in place by the 43rd Parliament to broaden, strengthen and protect our future prosperity.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question. The starting point for consideration of policy in the area of climate change is the climate science. The scientists are telling us that carbon pollution is contributing to climate change. The government respects the science. To have a strong economy we need to have a sustainable environment. That means we need to start reducing our carbon pollution levels. In this area the government has three priorities: first, to continue our strong support for renewable energy investments; secondly, to promote energy efficiency; and, thirdly, to work towards the introduction of a carbon price.The most efficient way to reduce carbon pollution levels, as the House has heard on many occasions before, is through a market mechanism and in particular the development of a carbon price. A carbon price is a key economic reform that is in this nation's interests. It will provide an incentive to reduce pollution levels. It will unlock investment in renewable energy. It will unlock investment in low-emissions technologies. It will generate certainty for business investment. It will position this country well for our long-term economic competitiveness. The Treasury had this to say about this particular issue in the blue book that was released in recent days:The introduction of a pricing regime will support strong long-term growth by steadily transforming the economy instead of imposing sharp, more costly adjustments in the future. This is a key economic reform in respect of which it is important that we build consensus for such a public policy position.In that respect, as the Prime Minister reported in an earlier answer, the government has established the multiparty climate change committee to help achieve that consensus for this important change. The Greens and the Independents are taking a responsible position in relation to this committee and, of course, the coalition has been invited in good faith to participate in the multiparty climate change committee where all ranges of options will be properly considered. A carbon price is mainstream economic thinking. If the opposition need some guidance on that, I would refer them to the editorial in the Australian Financial Review today which addresses that. They do not get it right all the time, but they are certainly on the money today and I would recommend consideration of it. All that we see from the opposition on this issue is pure opportunism, wrecking this consensus. You should act in the national interest to contribute to this debate about the introduction of a carbon price. It is an important economic reform needed in our country. Play a constructive role.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyne for his question. It is a timely one because the government has made an agreement with the Independents and, with the very strong support of regional members on both sides of the House, as well as on the crossbenches, a new application round for the Health and Hospitals Fund will commence by 1 October - very, very shortly. The final details of that application process will be made available. We have existing rules that apply for Health and Hospitals Fund applications, as was noted by, I think, the new member for Denison and others, but we have drafted additional guidelines which emphasise that this will be a particular round for rural and regional investments.Members might be interested to know that, of the first $3.2 billion that was invested through that fund, 37 per cent of those investments were in rural and regional Australia. So this is not a new area for the government to be focusing on, but we are very pleased that we are able to make additional money available for these applications. It probably will not surprise anyone in the House that it is not just the member for Lyne but the member for New England, the new member for Riverina, the member for Eden-Monaro and many others who have already taken the opportunity to ask me about this hospital round. I think there will be a lot of interest in the community and we look forward to high quality applications being made available.The member also asked for an update on the local hospital networks and particularly for New South Wales. I know this is an area that he has taken a strong interest in. Just as we were coming to question time today, the New South Wales government released, following a public consultation process, its final proposed local hospital network boundaries. It is proposing to go from what is an existing eight local area health services - which I know in your electorate but in many others people had a view were far too big - to 18 local hospital networks. The New South Wales government has proposed that further work be done on some cross-jurisdictional issues, for example, that affect Queanbeyan in the seat of Eden-Monaro, and also some boundary issues to the north in the seat of Richmond. I know that in your electorate of Lyne you will be particularly interested that there is a proposed mid-North Coast regional local hospital network.Of course, the agreement through COAG means that proposals put by any state or territory government still need to be agreed between governments and signed off by them. We will look very closely at these proposals. We are pleased that New South Wales has gone through a public consultation process, which many members in this House have been actively engaged in. This local hospital network proposal will bring people closer to their service delivery, so that people will be able to have a say and have local clinicians on their local hospital network governing councils. We very much look forward to looking closely at those proposals to ensure that all of our reform objectives are met, but I think the member for Lyne will be very pleased when in the coming days we are able to make available the final details of the special rural and regional Health and Hospitals Fund application round.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Our efforts in Afghanistan are of course centred upon the 1,550-troop commitment we have in Oruzgan province, as well as the substantial diplomatic, civilian and development assistance effort that we make both in Kabul and in Oruzgan province. I know - and this was reflected by the condolence motion we had yesterday, when the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Fadden spoke - that those individual, personal contributions and sacrifices are very much appreciated by the House. We will, we hope in the course of this year, provide the opportunity through a parliamentary debate for all members of the House to comment upon the strategic commitment that we are making to Afghanistan. I have been in discussions with the Leader of the House about the nature and timing of that debate. The Leader of the House will consult interested parties in due course. At this stage we want to hold the debate and provide that opportunity in the course of this year.Last week I was in Kabul and Oruzgan province with the Chief of the Defence Force and the Secretary of the Department of Defence. In Kabul I met with two Afghan ministers - the Minister for Defence, Minister Wardak, and the Minister for the Interior, Minister Mohammadi. What struck me was their very strong commitment to the transition to Afghan authorities of security arrangements and their strong and deep commitment to the training process now in place. Our mission in Oruzgan province, of course, is to train the Afghan National Army and to assist in the training of Afghan police to enable the Afghan authorities to take care of security matters themselves.In Kabul I also met with General Petraeus at International Security Assistance Force headquarters and discussed a number of points of interest to the House. Firstly, ISAF and General Petraeus, and our United States ally, very much appreciate the work we do in Afghanistan, not just those personnel in Oruzgan but also the embedded Australian defence personnel in ISAF headquarters. They are very much appreciated by ISAF, which is a United Nations mandated force. I also met with Ambassador Sedwill, NATO's Senior Civilian Representative, and indicated to both General Petraeus and Ambassador Sedwill that we were looking favourably at the prospect of providing more police trainers and that we would ensure that within the allocation of 1,550 we would provide the 20 additional artillery trainers which have been requested by NATO.In Tarin Kowt, in Oruzgan province, I met with our officers and our troops. They have been doing it tough, as the condolence motion yesterday reflected, but are making good progress on the training of the Afghan National Army. We started that task in December 2008 and it has only been very recently that we have been training all of the kandaks of the Afghan National Army 4th Brigade. This is making a substantial contribution to the effort.I spoke with the CDF, the Secretary and with our officers and troops on the ground about force protection measures. Over the last 12 months the government has increased force protection measures by over $1.1 billion and these are in the course of being implemented in Afghanistan. The Secretary, the CDF and I came away from Afghanistan wanting to see whether it was possible for us to do more, so far as force protection is concerned, in the IED area, which has been very problematic as far as our troops are concerned. We are also very pleased that the transition to the Combined Team Oruzgan - now with the United States presence, following the withdrawal of the Dutch - has gone very well. We will have the opportunity to discuss all of these matters and more in the course of the parliamentary debate, and the government is very much looking forward to that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Durack for his maiden question as the member for Durack. I am pleased that this is the first question that I will have answered as the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and the first time as the member for McMahon.The proposition put by the opposition is that there was a secret plan to extend detention centres on the mainland of Australia. There is one little problem with that equation as it was in the budget and in the additional estimates to the budget. You can imagine the conversation around the cabinet table, 'We have a secret plan to extend detention centres. Where will we hide it? I know. We will put it in the additional estimates to the budget - the Liberals will never look there.' But the shadow minister for immigration was right on to it! You have to get up pretty early in the afternoon to get one past him!He issued a press release on 15 July pointing out that the government had made provision to extend detention centres in Australia. On 17 September I announced plans to deal with the short-term pressures on our detention centres. I also said I would be making further statements about the long-term pressures on detention centres in Australia, and that budget allocation remains available for that expenditure when I make that announcement and when I have completed the review. It is good to see the shadow minister for immigration is right on the case yet again. - The member for Durack suggested that there is a plan for 3,000 places at the detention centre at Curtin. As I said on 17 September, 'That will not happen.' The Prime Minister has again said today that it will not happen. The department of immigration always enters into contingency planning for operations. I say again in the House: there will not be any extension to the Curtin detention centre anywhere near approaching 3,000 detainees. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. Australia considers Pakistan to be a friend of our nation. Therefore, when you have a friend in need, Australia's response is always to assist. -  - Some 21 million people have been affected by the floods in Pakistan - a number greater than the combined impact of the tsunami in 2004, the Pakistan earthquake of 2005 and the recent earthquake in Haiti. The floods have left some 10 million people dependent on emergency food deliveries, about eight million people without shelter and, on top of that, some two million children in need of fundamental enduring humanitarian assistance.Australia, as a friend of Pakistan, a fellow democracy and a fellow member of the Commonwealth, believes that our responsibility was to act and act quickly in support of that country in a time of great need. As a result, Australia was one of the first nations to contribute to the Pakistan global flood appeal. Australia now contributes some $75 million to that appeal. Globally we rank as the No. 5 donor to Pakistan at its time of great and dire humanitarian need.On 16 September I visited the Australian aid facility - a field hospital at Multan in the southern Punjab. I think all members of this House would be proud of the Australians in the field doing their job. We have a contingent from the Australian Defence Force, a contingent from AusAID and various other medical professionals numbering almost 200. They were in the field very soon after the crisis hit and to date have provided emergency medical treatment to more than 5,000 people. There are 200 or 300 people presenting a day and as the doctors said to me, 'Saving children's lives every day against the ravages of diseases such as cerebral malaria, cholera, Nile River disease and others.'It might also be of interest to the House to know that our aid effort there is being led by a gentleman by the name of Tang Lee. Tang Lee came to this country on a boat as a Vietnamese refugee in the 1970s and now leads Australia's aid effort in Pakistan. He represents Australia well and does our nation an enormous degree of pride. Pakistan is not out of the woods yet by any stretch of the imagination. According to the World Food Program, we will have some eight million people dependent on emergency food assistance through until July of next year.Australia's aid so far is being delivered through international agencies of the United Nations such as the World Food Program, the World Health Organisation and UNICEF, which are all doing fine work, through international agencies, such as the Red Cross and the Red Crescent, and through Australian NGOs, led by World Vision, Caritas, Save the Children and others. They are doing fine work on Australia's behalf. We must monitor the situation very closely, because there are eight officials who are deeply concerned about a possible outbreak of waterborne diseases. I will be representing Australia at a meeting of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan in Brussels in the middle of October. We will consider again the needs of that country in the period ahead. I reiterate to the House: Pakistan is a country of 175 million people, a country which is central to Australia's security and strategic interests in terms of the international campaign against terrorism and a fellow member of the Commonwealth. Australia is proud to assist.</DOC>

Secondly, it was the subject of negotiations and discussions between me and the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Timor-Leste in New York. Thirdly, it was agreed that it would form the subject of discussions when the Bali Process meeting is held in the months ahead.

 - I thank the member for Capricornia. I congratulate her on her great victory in that seat and I know that she is a huge promoter of regional development, like many others in the House, including those on this side. I had the opportunity today to address the National Press Club. Finally I was granted a pair at 8.30 last night, and we were able to scramble that together. I think that highlights that the new cooperative process the opposition says it is engaged in is taking some time to settle down. Unfortunately there was not the opportunity for other members who wanted to attend that speech to do so - and I notice that the member for New England is nodding accordingly.Of course this government is committed to the development of this country through its regions. We have always held that view. If you look at the Governor-General's speech yesterday you will see the emphasis that is given to that. Of course a significant reason for that emphasis being given was the agreement that the government reached with the rural Independents in particular, which was important in this government forming its majority. I thank the member for New England and the member for Lyne in particular, but I have had the opportunity to speak with the member for Denison since and I hope that with the other Independents we can find the time to go through the basis upon which this strategy can operate to their advantage. I have also been approached by many members on the other side of the chamber, notably the member for Gilmore, who I saw at a restaurant last night. She and the whip who in the end granted that leave to me both invited me to their regions. I will be delighted to go.Obviously the structure is important. The cabinet committee that has been established will give strategic advice and play a coordinating role to ensure not only that the views of the regions are considered but that the proper proportionality is achieved. The parliamentary committee is to be established. It will be chaired, as I understand it, by the member for New England, and of course we are also seeking greater cooperation from states and local government in this delivery mechanism.We also want to work through Regional Development Australia. It is a vital organ for the dissemination of the views and the creative ideas of our regions. Regional Development Australia was formed under the government in its last term. We look to strengthening its role and using effectively its voice and local input, its local empowerment, to inform us about the way in which the nation's resources are effectively and efficiently allocated. Those resources are significant, and I will have the opportunity on other occasions in this chamber to go through them. The key thing here is that we want to find the right balance between local input delivering on national objectives. That is the new approach to regionalism that this government will pursue. I look forward to the cooperation not only of those who have signed the agreement with us but of all other members who genuinely believe in the development of our regions and who want to play a constructive role. Get on board, because we are in the market for great ideas.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moncrieff for his question. Once again, we have got a misrepresentation of what is contained in the red book. The Treasury makes the point very strongly that the government's medium-term fiscal strategy is very important and it also makes the point that it is being adhered to. It makes that point very strongly at the beginning of the red book - the importance of a medium-term fiscal strategy to operate in conjunction with the wind-down of the stimulus. The fact is that we have a fiscal strategy in place which will bring the budget back to surplus in three years - three years early. This is something that has been strongly supported by international credit rating agencies, the IMF and the RBA.The government, when it chose to stimulate the economy during the global recession, outlined some strong fiscal rules to ensure that when growth returned to above trend we would engage in fiscal consolidation, and that is precisely what we have done. Fiscal stimulus is being withdrawn and, at the same time, we are applying our very strict fiscal rules. These are strongly supported by the Treasury in the red book, but they are also well understood in the wider business community. An economics research note out today from Macquarie Research Economics makes a couple of very important points. The very important point is, as the Prime Minister said before, that we have the biggest fiscal consolidation in place since the 1960s in this country - 4½ per cent of GDP over three years. That was demonstrated for everybody to see in the May budget. This is what Macquarie economics said in their note today. They make this point:A closer look at Treasury projections makes it harder to argue that the rate of fiscal consolidation is too slow. Indeed, if Treasury forecasts are achieved and the budget is returned to surplus by 2012-13 then this would be the most aggressive period of fiscal consolidation since records began in the 1970s.And that is correct. They go on to say in their note:The rise in receipts has been complemented by a relatively steep decline in government expenditures - because of the application of our two per cent rule. They conclude by saying:By any measure this is an aggressive consolidation. Just as the stimulus was aggressive so, too, was its removal.And it is the change in stimulus that matters for growth. The premise of the question is wrong. The premise of everything said by those on this matter during the election campaign was false and deliberately deceptive, because we have done -  - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. Standard and Poor's in a recent report have talked about how strong the government finances are, and they have certainly given our consolidation a very significant tick. You have also seen the Governor of the Reserve Bank completely repudiate the claim that is made by those opposite frequently, which is that government debt is pushing up interest rates. That is also false and deceptive. If I could just quote -  - The red book doesn't say that. If I could just quote the Governor of the Reserve Bank:_ the Australian government borrows in a global market. There are free global capital flows here and the long rate in Australia is driven more strongly by what happens in global markets than by what happens here _It is a strong fiscal consolidation for the good of the economy by a government committed to very strong economic management.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. He does know the devastation that can affect individuals and families as a result of problem gambling. Like him, the government is committed to working to reduce problem gambling, particularly the harm that comes from poker machines. All members would be aware that we received a Productivity Commission report not long before the election. We made that report public. That Productivity Commission report highlighted the effectiveness of precommitment schemes. They set out the ways in which precommitment schemes do allow those who play poker machines to set their own limits and to be able to stick with them.Members would be aware that the Prime Minister has entered into an agreement with the member for Denison to make sure that the Australian government, working with the states and territories, introduces a full precommitment scheme for poker machines by 2014. I would like to inform the House that today an evaluation is being released of a significant precommitment trial that has been undertaken in South Australia. This does demonstrate the benefits of precommitment. The evidence from the trial does show that precommitment encourages better money management and more informed spending decisions.During the trial - just to give members a specific example - net turnover on poker machines by problem gamblers using the precommitment scheme decreased by 56 per cent, without impacting on the spending behaviours of those recreational gamblers. I do think this is a significant piece of evidence that will help us in our work. I also welcome the announcement today by the South Australian government that precommitment technology has now been rolled out to 74 gaming venues across that state. I think this does demonstrate the willingness of the states and territories to address problem gambling.The Assistant Treasurer and I met with the member for Denison and Senator Xenophon last week, when we agreed to establish a ministerial committee, an expert committee, to advise us on these issues. That will include technical experts, representatives from the industry and those who are involved in counselling and supporting people who suffer from problem gambling. I look forward to that ministerial committee being established under the leadership of Professor Peter Shergold and I thank him for his willingness to undertake that task.Today the House agreed with the government's proposal and also, of course, agreed with the member for Denison that we establish a joint select committee on gambling. I look forward to members across the parliament participating in that very important committee as we work together to address the problems that do arise from those who have difficulties with gambling.</DOC>

The honourable member should be aware that the Prime Minister has allocated the administration of Building the Education Revolution to the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Senator Evans, and that in this chamber Senator Evans is represented by my colleague the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government on matters relating to jobs, the BER - which is an economic stimulus measure - and workplace relations.

 - I thank the member for Fowler for his question and his genuine and longstanding interest in police matters and indeed in advancing the cause of our magnificent police forces in this country. Today is National Police Remembrance Day so it is an appropriate question. It is also appropriate to update the House on the commitment by this government to increase sworn officers in the Australian Federal Police. Three years ago we undertook to swell the ranks of the AFP by 500 sworn officers over a five-year period. We now have 335 extra officers of the Australian Federal Police, 200 ahead of schedule. That means we have officers dedicated not only to protecting our citizens but also to engaging with their counterparts within the region and around the world. As most people would know, the Australian Federal Police's role has broadened over the 30 years since its creation. Therefore, this government continues to dedicate resources to ensure that it can do its job. We are also transitioning the police arrangements in our major international airports, ensuring that we move from a unified policing model to have the AFP be the primary police force for security at those airports.As I said, it is National Police Remembrance Day and I would like, on behalf of the government, to take this opportunity to pay tribute to those officers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty and to pay my respects to those who have lost a family member or a loved one in such tragic circumstances. Only very recently we were reminded of this great sacrifice by the death of New South Wales Police officer Detective Constable William Crews. I am sure every member of the House shares great sympathy for Mr Crews's family, friends and colleagues for their loss.I am also relieved that the opposition has relented and reversed its original decision not to allow me to attend today's National Police Remembrance Day ceremony by not allowing a pairing arrangement. I am happy to say that the opposition did change its original position, allowing not only the minister responsible for the Australian Federal Police but also the shadow minister to attend and lay a wreath for those fallen in the line of duty. This is an important day for the police around the country. It includes all law enforcement agencies in all jurisdictions. It is an important time for them and their families and I am looking forward to being accompanied by the shadow minister this afternoon to pay our respects.</DOC>

 - Can I say to the member who has raised the question that I accept what he has said in the parliament in relation to an individual matter involving a constituent, but I would obviously want to talk to him about some further details, particularly information about the family involved and the circumstances of the fire. If he wants to give me additional information about that then I will be happy to look at it.More generally, as the member opposite would be aware - I have said this publicly; I have said it in this parliament before; indeed I think I had occasion to say it in question time the first day that I was Prime Minister - I acknowledge and the government acknowledges that the Home Insulation Program was beset by problems. It became a mess. That is why we brought it to a conclusion. That is why we have the inspection program, which is rolling out, and that is why the relevant minister has been overseeing arrangements, including arrangements dealing with businesses that were entitled to compensation under the scheme that we set up. This has been well known for a long period of time now. As the member would be aware, these matters are being looked into by the Auditor-General, for example, so there is an appropriate inquiry looking at the program which is now closed. Can I reiterate that if the member wants to give me details of the individual constituent matter then I will be more than happy to look at that matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his ongoing interest in this area. This morning I had the pleasure to launch Cyber Storm III, which is a major international cybersecurity exercise. It goes without saying that fortunately our geographic isolation over the years has proved to be a tremendous asset in terms of defence against conventional threats. Regrettably that geographic isolation has no relevance at all with respect to dealing with threats in the cyber environment. This point was made in the National Security Statement of the government and the need to maintain a secure and resilient network is vital to our social and economic prosperity, and indeed to the proper functioning of government. In terms of that concept of resilience, just as we are referring to a storm, the goal is to do what we can to prevent the damage from the assault, to respond to the assault, and to bounce back as quickly and as effectively as we can from the assault with the minimum of disruption. Those principles apply equally in respect of the Cyber Storm III exercise.Members will also recall that, as part of the cybersecurity strategy that we announced in November 2009, we established the Computer Emergency Response Team in the Attorney-General's Department and also the Cyber Security Operations Centre. Just to give some context to the issue, in the eight months of the existence of the Cyber Security Operations Centre, it has received 1,000 requests for assistance. About a quarter of those requests were deemed of sufficient seriousness to warrant further action.Cyber Storm III will operate over four days. It will test our preparedness and the relationships between government, business and the international community, because we know that the cyber environment knows no boundaries between agencies, governments and individuals, nor does it have any restrictions by national boundaries. The exercise simulates an assault on critical infrastructure and also on nationally important systems and services. It will evaluate individual capability - that is, the capability of individual organisations - but more significantly combined capability. In that context, could I acknowledge the tremendous work by the United States Department of Homeland Security and also the cooperation that we have received from Canada, Great Britain and New Zealand, who are also participating in this exercise.I also thank and recognise the significant work of over 50 organisations involved in the communication, finance, transport, utilities and government sectors. This exercise will assist in raising awareness, but it is also a demonstration of the practical work that is occurring at a domestic and international level to make our society, our economy and the delivery of government services that much safer and that much more effective.</DOC>

 - I presume that that question was about pricing carbon and about the cost of living. On the issue of pricing carbon, I remind the Leader of the Opposition that around a year ago - in fact, it was on 2 October 2009, so the one-year anniversary of these remarks is coming up very soon - he said:We don't want to play games with the planet. So we are taking this issue seriously and we would like to see an ETS _That is, an emissions trading scheme, which of course is about pricing carbon. That was Tony Abbott on 2 October 2009. On this question of pricing carbon, all I can hope is that the Tony Abbott who is with us on 2 October 2010 is the same man who made that statement, because if the Leader of the Opposition was able to show between one year and the next that he could say and believe the same thing then on 2 October 2010 presumably he would accept my invitation to work in good faith on a multiparty committee to work through options for pricing carbon. But I am not optimistic on this. I am generally an optimist, but I am not optimistic on this because, as we know, the Leader of the Opposition has had every position possible to have on pricing carbon, causing the member for Wentworth to describe him as a 'weather vane' - you have to look out the window to work out what he believes today. - On the question of cost of living, I am glad he has raised it because Australians have avoided the opposition leader's 'great big new tax on everything', which he was intending to impose by increasing company tax that would have increased prices at shops - at Woolworths, at Coles - and it would have put a burden on working families.What the government has done, and will continue to do, is to act to ease cost-of-living pressures on working families. That is why we have lowered tax, for example, so that a person on $50,000 a year is now paying $1,750 less in tax than they were in 2007-08 - that is, 18 per cent less tax. We have increased pensions; we have introduced the education tax refund, and we are intending to extend that so that people can claim against the cost of school uniforms; we have increased the childcare tax rebate to help take the pressure off working families using child care; we have introduced the teen dental plan to help with the expensive cost of dentistry; and we as a government will introduce the promised changes to family tax benefit A to assist families with the cost of teenagers, which would increase by up to $4,000 the amount of family tax benefit that families receive; we will move to pay the child care tax rebate fortnightly; we will introduce paid parental leave from 1 January next year; we will make tax returns easier, including an automatic deduction; and we will provide tax relief for savings accounts. So any time the Leader of the Opposition wants to talk to me about cost of living I am more than happy to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. In the coming days I will be travelling to Brussels to participate in the Asia Europe Meeting. This is a forum that has been meeting since 1996. It is the eighth such meeting but it is the first time that Australia has been able to participate in this meeting. I think it is good news that Australia will have a seat at the table as leaders from Asia and Europe meet. At these discussions I will seek to pursue discussions that relate to Australia's security and prosperity.On the question of security, I will be taking the opportunity to discuss our continued cooperation with NATO partners on Afghanistan. On the question of prosperity, obviously this is one of the international meetings at which, as a nation, we pursue dialogue with the world about recovery from the global financial crisis. This is another opportunity to talk through the economic issues that the globe has faced, and continues to face, from that event, which of course triggered a global recession - the biggest synchronised economic downturn we have seen since the Great Depression.At the time that the global financial crisis started there were great fears that this would lead to a new round of protectionism - that under pressure people would turn inward and that under pressure people would demand of their leaders and of their governments a return to protectionism. I think we should be congratulating ourselves and, indeed, the reactions of leaders around the world that those grim fears about a wide-scale return to protectionism have not been realised. Australia has played its part in world economic forums, including the G20, in making sure that the world did not close down, the world did not move back to protectionism and the world did not turn its face away from free trade. That is vital for our economic security because, put as simply as possible, trade equals jobs in this great trading nation of ours.So at this international meeting I will of course be pursuing the trade and global economic agenda, understanding that we in this country are able to make our way in a competitive world and we are able to hold our heads up on the world stage when it comes to these economic questions. I will be able to say that we as a nation worked together to see the challenges of the global financial crisis and to rise to meet those challenges. We met them through the provision of economic stimulus, we met them through employers and employees working together to make sure that jobs continued to be there for Australians and, as a result, we are emerging from the global financial downturn stronger than any other major advanced economy in the world, well positioned for the growth of the future and well positioned as a great trading nation to make sure that through trade we continue to increase jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. His question is based on a false premise, and it is part and parcel of an interest rate scare campaign that has been run unsuccessfully by those opposite for years and years. The fact of the matter is this: the Governor of the Reserve Bank has said that the finances of the Australian government are in terrific shape. Those opposite like to pretend that the global recession never happened and that we should not have put in place stimulus to support jobs and small business, and they want to continue with the fiction that somehow the deficit that is in place and being wound back by us is having an impact on interest rates. It is not. You only have to look at the statements of the Governor of the Reserve Bank and, indeed, the statements of bodies like the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the Reserve Bank and the market economists that I was quoting in this House yesterday.The fact is that when those opposite were last in power the cash rate went to 6.75 per cent and interest rates went up 10 times in a row, and that happened after they said they would keep rates at record lows. We will not be engaged in the dishonesty that they are engaged in by pretending that we can control interest rates. Those are decisions for the Reserve Bank. But what we as the government of Australia can do is to keep our national finances in the best shape we possibly can, and that is what we are doing.Yesterday I indicated that we are engaged in the fastest fiscal consolidation since the early 1960s, and we are being given the big tick by the IMF and the Governor of the Reserve Bank for doing that because that is the responsible thing to do in these circumstances. I make the point that interest rates now are lower than they were for 95 per cent of the time that those opposite were in government. The fact is that they did lose control of the economy in their last year in office, and their reckless spending did put upward pressure on interest rates at that stage. They went on a spending spree at the height of a mining boom.It has fallen to us to put in place responsible economic management which will put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on rates, but those opposite should not pretend that governments can control what the Reserve Bank will do when the economy is recovering and it adjusts rates. Governments cannot do that, but what governments can and must do is put in place responsible fiscal policy. That is what this government is doing, and we are doing that in the interests of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. As I was saying before, overnight the Australian economy and Australian economic policy have received a very big tick from the International Monetary Fund. They have said that the Australian government did a very good job in keeping our economy out of recession. - Yes they did. They have endorsed the application of our medium-term fiscal policy, which is as I said before the fastest fiscal consolidation since the early 1960s. The conclusions of this report are crystal clear, and I think I ought to quote the report in some detail. In this report the IMF is strongly endorsing the government's commitment to fiscal discipline and to bringing our budget back into surplus three years early. That is what the IMF is doing. The report states:The exit from the stimulus, which began this year, sees the budget back in surplus by 2012/13. If the recovery in Australia proceeds as expected, this pace of withdrawal is appropriate. This is faster than past consolidations in Australia and plans in most other advanced economies._                      _                        
_While public debt is projected to remain very low by advanced economy standards, returning quickly to budget surpluses as the authorities intend will put Australia on firmer footing to deal with future shocks.That is a very big tick from the IMF. But it is not just the IMF - Standard and Poor's put out a report last week which said this:Australia has one of the strongest fiscal positions globally, with a net general government debt burden less than half the level of the AAA rated median.This is a ringing endorsement of the finances of the Australian government and the Australian people, and that is why this government have put at the very core of our economic agenda a very strong fiscal consolidation. It is a bit rich to be lectured on fiscal rectitude by those opposite, because they had a $10.6 billion costing con job at the heart -  - Mr Speaker, it was a question about spending and its impact on the economy. You would have thought that, if they wanted to make the critique that they are making, there would be some alternative policy. But the fact is they would spend more and their surpluses would be much lower, and what Treasury found was a $10.6 billion black hole -  - We on this side of the House understand how important strong economic management is; that is why we are bringing the budget back to surplus in three years, three years early. What we have been doing in this House has been endorsed by the IMF and other responsible authorities. That goes to the very core of this government's strong economic management credentials.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. First and foremost, pensioners have had a historic rise in the pension as the result of the actions of this government. I pay tribute to the relevant minister, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, for her making that decision, which has assisted pensioners around the country. Undoubtedly many older Australians, many Australians on limited and fixed incomes, still find it very, very difficult to make ends meet. I understand that.Electricity prices, power prices, place a particular burden on people. I understand the member for Gilmore would be concerned about this but I would ask her to recognise that experts in the field, whether it is TRUenergy or others in the energy sector, are telling us that one of the factors that puts great upward pressure on electricity prices is the lack of investment in new power generation. That lack of investment in new power generation is occurring because of a lack of certainty by industry about what will happen with carbon pricing. So for as long as industry is uncertain we will see this lack of investment, and it is this lack of investment that puts upward pressure on electricity prices.This really is a matter of common sense. We are talking about multibillion dollar investments and consequently people want certainty. In the election campaign the member for Gilmore may have seen that the government committed itself to introducing mandatory standards for electricity generation in relation to the future of power stations. We do not want to see in the future new power stations constructed that are high carbon emitters; we do not want to see new dirty coal fired power stations constructed. We will work in consultation with industry to set the standard that will be there for the future and that will give some certainty to industry as they invest.Beyond that, industry is asking us to address the question of carbon pricing. The government has set about doing that through the multiparty committee working in a collaborative way to look at options for pricing carbon. If the member for Gilmore is seriously concerned about these questions, and I accept in good faith that she is, then the best thing for her to do would be to seek to persuade her party leader, the Leader of the Opposition, to become involved in the process and to go back to the version of the Leader of the Opposition that existed on 2 October last year. He has just got to take himself back 12 months to when he believed in pricing carbon. If he believed in pricing carbon then, there is no reason he should not believe in it now and be involved in this process.The member for Sturt then left the chamber. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. In answering this question, I say very clearly to the House that I have taken inspiration from the first speech in this parliament yesterday by the member for Greenway, who gave a great dissertation about the National Broadband Network. In her speech she reminded all of us that if you look across human history it is divided into those who embraced the challenges of the future and those who were stuck in the past. Inspired by the member for Greenway, I found another few examples of people who did not see fit to embrace the challenges of the future. Thomas Watson, the Chairman of IBM, said in 1943:I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.He might have missed the challenges of the future. HM Warner of Warner Bros said in 1927:Who the hell wants to hear actors talk?And Decca Records said in 1962:We don't like their sound, and guitar music is on the way out.These are a few examples of people who missed the challenges of the future. In the modern age we have the Leader of the Opposition saying that the National Broadband Network is a 'white elephant'. That will join this series of quotes as yet another example of someone who cannot embrace the challenges of the future.When we look for inspiration about the challenges of the future we should probably look at some of the studies around the world looking into the benefits of broadband. I draw the House's attention to the United Nations Broadband Commission for Digital Development, which demonstrated the economic benefits of high speed broadband in its report:In the 21st Century, broadband networks must be regarded as vital national infrastructure - similar to transport, energy and water networks, but with an impact that is even more powerful and far reaching.The report goes on to say:_ for every 10 per cent increase in broadband penetration we can expect an average of 1.3 per cent additional growth in national gross domestic product (GDP) _Broadband is the infrastructure of the future, which is why the government is committed to building it. Meanwhile, we see the other side on a mission of destruction to prevent Australia having this technology of the future.Members of the parliament and members of the Australian public may have seen claims from the opposition about cost-benefit analyses and the National Broadband Network. I draw the attention of the House and members of the public to the fact that an independent McKinsey-KPMG implementation study has been conducted into the National Broadband Network. It was done at a cost of around $25 million and it has produced a weighty tome that makes War and Peace 
look like an airport novel. I recommend members, if they are seriously interested in understanding the economic benefits of the National Broadband Network, to look at that implementation study. We are committed to the technology of the future. I say to the opposition: it is time to stop the campaign of destruction, to recognise the benefits of the National Broadband Network and to work with the government to ensure that Australia gets this technology of the future.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the member for Wentworth about this very important national investment, which has got the potential to lift the speed of our economy, to substantially improve productivity and to take the Australian economy into the 21st century in a confident way. He mentioned the red book, and I think there would have been similar advice in the blue book as well. It pays to read these documents in full, because what the red book said to the incoming government was simply this. It said: 'A more competitive and hence more efficient and productive telecommunications sector will come from the NBN.' It went on to say: 'It is a transformational infrastructure resource for the economy, enabling new and enhanced ways of delivering business and government services and facilitating communication.'Nothing could be more dishonest than to put that question the way it was put by the member for Wentworth, because the fact is that Treasury is very, very supportive of the NBN and has been involved in the process from day 1. It is important we go through this, because the fiction has been maintained by those opposite that there has not been a substantial business case built for the NBN, and of course there has been a very substantial amount of study and work from experts, both domestic and international. It started with the independent expert panel shortly after we were elected. Sitting on that independent expert panel was the Secretary to the Treasury. They are quoting Treasury advice. It is very important to understand these linkages. - Mr Speaker, the very first risk is not to build the NBN. - The Treasury secretary was on the panel that we appointed, which concluded that none of the private-sector proposals offered value for money. So we then moved through. We took the decision to build the NBN and we then commissioned an implementation study by McKinsey and KPMG, which concluded there was a strong and viable business case. That is a study of something like 500 pages. Those opposite have been wandering around the country saying that we decided to embark upon this, we did not have any advice, we did not have any analysis and we did not have any costings. We had all of those, and all of that is presented in the implementation study. It says the project can expect to earn rates of return of between six to seven per cent. That gives us enough to pay back the cost of funds over time and to pay back the taxpayer.But with any major investment of course there is a risk. There is always a risk with any major undertaking that a government enters into, and the Treasury is logically saying to the government, as they have done and will continue to do: 'This is a very important project for Australia. You are going to get value for money. We do need it to lift our productivity. But what we have to do is work our way through all the issues.' - That is right and it is not ridiculous. It shows you what a strange and bizarre world those opposite now inhabit that they can deny the logic of the Treasury advice, the logic of the Treasury participation in this process and the logic of the red -

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. The rationale for the provision of artillery trainers is the same as the rationale for our mission in Afghanistan and Oruzgan province generally: to train the Afghan National Security Forces to put them in a position of being able to handle, manage and cater for security issues. That is why we are training the Afghan National Army and making a contribution to training the Afghan police force.This is consistent with the Afghanistan conference recently held in Kabul to set the timetable for a transition to security arrangements to Afghan authorities by 2014 and consistent with the advice of the Chief of the Defence Force that our mission in Oruzgan province can be effected over a two- to four-year timetable. I think the nature and scope of our mission will be better understood as a result of the parliamentary debate, and the government looks forward to that, as I indicated yesterday.I am also asked about other personnel and equipment. It is worth recollecting of course that just over a year ago the government committed itself to increasing our contribution in Afghanistan from 1,100 to 1,550, effectively a 40 per cent increase, and we did that in advance of the US, ISAF and NATO surge, which, rule of thumb, was also about 40 per cent.It is also worth remembering we are not there alone. Often people make comments about these matters as if we were there by ourselves. We are not. We are part of an international coalition both in Afghanistan generally and in Oruzgan province and, as a consequence of that, we of course have access to ISAF enablers, air, artillery and the like.It is also important to remember that the government has recently embarked upon a program of over $1.1 billion worth of force protection measures, and they are currently under way. As I indicated when I returned from Afghanistan with the CDF and the Secretary of Defence, we are looking at whether more measures can be effected so far as countering roadside booby traps or IEDs is concerned. We follow the advice of the CDF in these matters. As the Leader of the Opposition correctly said in the course of the election campaign, if additional contributions are to be made they should appropriately be made on the advice of the CDF, and consistently the CDF has advised, again confirmed today, that the nature and amount of our contribution is sufficient and appropriate for the purposes of our mission.I have seen the suggestions of others and, because we are dealing with a disposition of Australian forces overseas in difficult circumstances, of course we listen to what others say and take them into account. Let me refer to some of them. The first one is a sensitive matter. Of course, all of the aspects arising from the email as a result of the death of Lance Corporal MacKinney, as I have made clear and as the CDF has made clear, will be taken into account in the course of that investigation. We should not disturb that process. As the member for Fadden correctly said the other day, and as I agree with him, we should not second-guess that. All of those matters which go to alleged operational safety or operational weaknesses will be considered as part of that.The number of troops in Oruzgan province is now greater than it was when the Dutch were there. Our training which we effect, which is now all of the Kandaks of the Afghan National Army 4th Battalion, is not done in isolation. I have seen the suggestion from the shadow minister for defence that we should put into Oruzgan anywhere from an additional 450 to 650 troops. I am sure that will be considered in the course of the parliamentary debate. The Leader of the Opposition has correctly said that he will look at these matters on the advice of the CDF. I simply make the observation that I have made previously: that is not the advice that I have received as late as today but we are always happy to ensure the Leader of the Opposition has access to the most up-to-date advice from the CDF.</DOC>

And every member from Tasmania on this side of the House as well as, I am sure, the member for Denison are very appreciative of the fact that the NBN is being rolled out in Tasmania first.

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I know - having visited Corangamite often and with the member for Corio - that as a regional member the member for Corangamite's constituents have been very appreciative of investments to date in their area. The GP superclinic is going very well in his electorate. Not very long ago, I was with both the member for Corangamite and the member for Corio announcing the Victorian government's allocation through our COAG funding for the redevelopment of the Belmont rehabilitation centre, for new beds at Geelong Hospital. I know that the investments in the Deakin Medical School, for example, have been vital in bringing new students to the region, who then have experience in working in hospitals like Colac and elsewhere in the community, and in providing the services and the infrastructure that are needed in the community.The reason I have been particularly asked this question today - and the member for Lyne had some prescience yesterday in asking a similar question - is that today the Prime Minister and I, along with the minister for regional development, announced the opening of the new health and hospitals funding process, with a particular focus on rural and regional Australia. Up to $1.8 billion is available. Four applications will be assessed by our independent health and hospitals board, chaired by Bill Ferris. Applications are open as of today and the guidelines and details are available on the website. Many constituents, represented by members on both sides of this House, will have looked previously at the guidelines and will be familiar with the basic structure. But there is now additional guidance that puts a particular focus on those projects that are going to deliver services to rural and regional communities and also provide a setting for more health professionals to be trained in areas where there are severe shortages. Of course, we will look at doing things in an innovative way. So projects that are training people across disciplines, or doctors and nurses and allied health professionals who are working together or looking to use the e-health system in a new way into the future will be particularly looked at favourably. With some input from members who were consulted on these guidelines, of course those projects need to have strong local support for them to be able to be supported by our government.We are very excited that this is an opportunity for people to look at doing things differently in rural and regional Australia. But I remind those members who represent more urban electorates that the investments we have made to date have invested significantly in the city areas as well. The whole health reform investments mean that, in a few short years, 60 per cent of all capital funding projects for hospitals whether in city or regional areas will be met by the Commonwealth. This particular round will turbocharge - a word that I have, I think, stolen from the member for Lyne - investments in rural and regional Australia. This means that projects that are currently underway, like those in Narrabri, in New England, in Tasmania, at Nepean Hospital, in Rockhampton or in Launceston will then be able to be added to what we expect will be a very large number of positive applications, which we will look at and assess in the context of next year's budget.</DOC>

 - This question is the latest instalment from the shadow minister's campaign that there was some sort of secret plan to expand Curtin. Last week he said that he effectively had a smoking gun, because he found a contract for $2 million worth of fencing at Curtin. He said that it showed that there was a secret plan to expand the Curtin Detention Centre. I was at Curtin the day the shadow minister said that. I said to the centre manager at Curtin, 'Show me this fence - ' - I will, Mr Speaker, and it goes to the shadow minister's claim that there is some sort of conspiracy. I said, 'Show me this fence,' and they said, 'Here it is; it is around the existing accommodation.' It has no relation to the government's announcement. - In relation to any contracts which related to stage 1 - to the original construction of the detention centre at Curtin - I am advised that the situation would be, as per normal, that the contractual arrangements were set between the department and the relevant contractors.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Banks for his question on superannuation. It will come as no surprise to members of the House that our superannuation system is the envy of the world. At $1.3 trillion it is equal to our GDP and is a source of distinct national advantage for Australia. It is the fourth largest pool of funds anywhere in the world and the fastest growing of the top five funds in the world. Having said that, I think the point about superannuation reforms is this: countries only get opportunities occasionally and we cannot afford to be complacent about them. Twenty-five years ago, a Labor government saw the opportunity and took it to create a national savings scheme that is privately run and vested in everyone's interests. Again, there are new opportunities for this nation. When you look at the fact that a male born in 1960 had a life expectancy of 77 and now it is 84, this is a source of opportunity. The fact that the census next year will probably reveal 10,000 centenarians shows we are living longer, which means this nation needs to have adequate savings.The good news is that in order to have adequate savings the government has put in place reforms that will meet this challenge and this opportunity. Our measures are both timely and indeed appropriate. Moving the superannuation guarantee charge from nine to 12 per cent will in fact ensure that people can retire on average weekly earnings with a greater sense of retirement security than the current system would allow. The fact that we are doubling the concessional caps for people over 50 who have superannuation fund accounts under half a million dollars will improve people's incentives to save. The fact that we are extending the superannuation guarantee charge for 70-year-olds to 74-year-olds will allow another 33,000 people to benefit from these reforms. These are big changes and they demonstrate for 8.4 million Australians that they will have better retirement incomes than they otherwise would. There are 3½ million low-income Australians who will have more income when they retire than they otherwise would. A 30-year-old in the workforce on average wages will have an extra $108,000 courtesy of this Labor government's reforms. An 18-year-old entering the workforce will have the opportunity to have an extra $200,000 courtesy of this government's reforms.But it is not just adequacy that makes these reforms important. When you look at the great terms of trade this nation is currently experiencing, we will need to have a matching growing national savings pool to help meet the investment challenges which are inevitable in the next number of years. This country cannot afford to be complacent. It is an issue upon which there is disagreement between the government and the opposition at this stage. I think that sometimes in politics there are good ideas which have to be looked at even if the opposition has initially opposed them. I have no doubt that in five and 10 years time, when some of the coalition members are still here, they will recognise that increasing the superannuation guarantee is something which the whole political process can take pride in. At some point I have no doubt that the coalition will come on board with our initiatives. All I would ask in these reforms is that they save the pain and come on board now rather than risk the irrelevance of an opposition never supporting a national savings pool and never supporting adequate retirement for millions of Australians.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for New England for the question. Can I begin by clarifying to the House what gets released on 8 October. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority will be releasing a guide to the draft plan. What comes out on 8 October -  -  - This is all consistent with legislation that was first put through when the Liberals were in government, so there has been bipartisan support on these sorts of issues. What comes out on 8 October is a guide to the draft plan. That is then followed by a period of consultation. That consultation will be real. None of this adjustment is easy. We are talking about a situation where up and down the Murray-Darling Basin there has been over-allocation and we need to be able to adjust to have a long-term healthy river. We need to be able to do that in a way that pays respect to the importance of environmental flows, to the importance of food production, and to the importance of the future of regional communities. None of it is easy and that is why the levels of consultation go along for the period of time that they do.The guide to the draft plan that is released on 8 October is put together by the authority, not by myself. But I will be doing everything I can to encourage people up and down the basin - those who are concerned about what sort of adjustment comes through and about where we end up in terms of sustainable diversion limits - to make sure that they do participate in that, because we want to make sure that we end up getting the balance right. It is towards the end of next year that we end up with a situation of putting forward, as an instrument before the parliament, the actual planning powers - and when that plan goes forward it is after a long period of consultation, first following the guide and then following a draft plan. I would urge all to be involved with it, but certainly I, as the minister for water, will not be giving public direction to the authority. I want them to take up their independent role. I want them to be involved in what is for many communities an incredibly sensitive issue. We also have to acknowledge that notwithstanding the fact that in many parts of the basin we have had great rain of late. Only about a week ago I stood at Lake Alexandrina and saw something that no water minister has seen for a long time: pretty much a full lake. But we should not allow the fact that we have had good rains in recent times to divert us from the fact that we do need reform. Even if in many parts of the country drought has broken, we know the nature of our continent, we know it will be back and we do know that we need a long-term adjustment for a sustainable and healthy river.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for Robertson for her first question and congratulate her on her outstanding election and her fantastic first speech yesterday. Like her, this government is so pleased to be delivering Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. From tomorrow parents expecting a baby in the new year will be able to apply for paid parental leave. I know every parent who is in this House would understand just how busy it is when a new baby comes into the family, so what we are doing is changing the arrangements so that parents can apply for paid parental leave and family tax benefit three months before the due date of their baby's birth. So this will be a very positive move for families. - Just to make sure that the shadow Treasurer understands: Australia is finally catching up with the rest of the developed world and delivering our first national paid parental leave scheme - never done by those opposite; 12 years they had in government to deliver paid parental leave and of course they refused. We will be delivering this scheme from 1 January next year. Eligible Australian parents will be able to get 18 weeks of paid parental leave paid at the federal minimum wage. This has been a very, very long time coming and will be particularly welcomed by casual workers, part-time workers and those self-employed workers and contractors who at the moment do not have access to paid parental leave.I recall meeting a young family in Sydney not long ago, both of the parents working in casual jobs. They had had a baby who needed to stay in hospital because of health complications, they were trying to manage being in the hospital with their newborn baby, with both of them doing shift work. The mother was trying to breast-feed her baby. She had no access to paid parental leave. In the end she just could not do it any longer and had to give up her job. It is for families like this that this government is delivering Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme, because at the moment less than a quarter of women in low-paid and casual or part-time jobs have paid parental leave compared to three-quarters of women on higher wages. This is a major change for Australian families, one that we are so pleased to be able to deliver. Of course we announced during the election campaign that we were going to make an additional change that will be particularly beneficial for dads. Dads will be able to get extra paid paternity leave so that they too can spend more time at home with their newborn baby. We know this Leader of the Opposition was famously heard to say that paid parental leave would happen over his dead body, but it is this government that is delivering. - This Labor government will deliver for Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I presume the member, in asking the question, has actually studied the Auditor-General's report on green loans and I think if he had done that he would have seen that it recorded, for example, that 'the former minister' - referring to Minister Garrett - 'received incomplete, inaccurate and untimely briefings on program design features and implementation progress, challenges and risks'. It goes on further to say the former minister 'was not served well by his department in this respect due to the poor-quality briefings he received'. When you read the report overall, it is quite clear on a reading of it that there were significant failings in the design and early implementation of the program, that these failings existed in the department. The Auditor-General in fact has not made any recommendations in this report because the government has already acted, obviously, to end this program, to phase it out, to create a new program and has already acted to move the program from the department that it was originally in to the department of climate change. So I would say to the member that if he wants to read the report in full I think he will find that the conclusions of the Auditor-General are very clear indeed about the departmental issues in the administration of this program.On the question of the current role of the minister, I am looking forward with considerable enthusiasm to working with the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth in the further delivery of the government's education revolution. I ask the member whether, for example, he will want to be working with Minister Garrett on things like trade training centres for his local schools, whether he will want to be working with Minister Garrett on things like computers in schools, whether he will want to be working with Minister Garrett on the national curriculum, whether he will want to be working with Minister Garrett on more resources for disadvantaged schools in communities to make a difference for kids from poorer backgrounds for the rest of their lives, and whether he will want to be working with Minister Garrett on all of these measures that make a profound difference for the education of individual children for their lives, hopes and chances and, obviously, a profound difference to the prosperity of the nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. As the House would be aware, on 9 April 2010 the government announced the suspension of the processing of new asylum claims for nationals of Sri Lanka and of Afghanistan - in the case of Afghanistan for a period of six months. The decision to suspend processing was based on growing evidence at that time of evolving country situations in Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. The pause in the processing of claims from Afghanistan is due to be lifted on 8 October, which is next Friday. That is when it is due to expire.In recent weeks the government has been closely considering, with the advice of relevant government departments, what approach should be taken to the pause in the processing of asylum claims from Afghanistan. During the last six months, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has been working to improve its understanding of the issues surrounding asylum claimants from Afghanistan. This has been done in conjunction with relevant and interested governments and has been closely informed by our post in Kabul. After close and careful consideration, the government has formed the view that we should lift the suspension. I announce that that will occur effective immediately.The government considers that it is now better positioned to assess asylum claims from Afghans based on more up-to-date country information. This follows, as I say, an exhaustive review over the last six months. As a result of the more exhaustive country information there been has a decrease in the number of primary acceptances of claims from Afghans who are not subject to the processing pause. Even taking into consideration the possibility of some of these being overturned on review, the percentage of successful refugee claims is likely to be lower than in the past. Those Afghans who are found not to warrant protection will be returned to Afghanistan, consistent with Australia's international obligations.The government is working very closely with the government of Afghanistan and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to enter into an agreement for the return of Afghan nationals to Afghanistan. I hope to be able to update the House and the community on that in the not too distant future. Australia will of course continue to work closely with our international partners and the government of Afghanistan to progress this matter.</DOC>

 - I will undertake to find out the specifics of the 91 because I am not aware of that. Of course, it is essential that any investment made by the Australian government for public buildings should meet adequate fire and safety standards. That should be a requirement. - If it is not then that is something that we need to take up with the responsible bodies in Queensland that commissioned the work. It is also something that we would insist they carry the cost of redressing. This, after all, was what the Orgill inquiry was set up to do - not only to receive the complaints but to seek restitution in relation to them. - The costings have been released. In terms of the costings, because of the interjection on the basis of the question that was sought to be asked yesterday but was wrongly directed to the minister, the Orgill committee -  -  - They claim interest in the answer but never want to listen. This has been their problem with this program all the way through. The member would be aware, if he was interested in this, that we withheld money from the New South Wales government because it was not meeting its obligations properly. If there is evidence that this money has not been spent properly, in terms of meeting safety standards, there is opportunity for each of those so-called complaints to be addressed to the Orgill committee. The question I would ask the member to contemplate when he goes from this place is: have those 91 complaints been referred to the Orgill committee. That is what it was set up to do. The only point I would make in conclusion is that this program would never have happened if those opposite had held the treasury benches. They were a party that had no idea of the importance not just of investing in the future of education but of creating jobs. The Orgill committee is there for responsible complaints. I suggest the member, if he is concerned about this beyond this answer, direct his questions to the Orgill committee.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question, as I know that he has 26,000 pensioners in Hindmarsh who are benefiting from this government's improvements to the pension, and I thank him for his commitment and hard work on behalf of his pensioners.It is the case that this government have delivered very real pension increases to Australia's pensioners, helping them with cost-of-living increases we know they face. As a result of the reforms that we implemented around a year ago, pensions have increased by up to $115 per fortnight for single pensioners on the maximum rate. If you are a couple, it is $97 per fortnight for couples, combined, on the maximum rate. These are increases since September last year.It is also the case that our pension reforms have delivered significant improvements as a result of changes to the indexation arrangements. This has meant larger pension increases for pensioners at each of the three indexation points since last September. Just last week, on 20 September, we saw increases in the pension for around four million Australian pensioners, who benefited from increases to their payments as a result of improved indexation. So, once again, if you are a single pensioner on the maximum rate you will be receiving an increase of $15 per fortnight. For couples, combined, on the maximum rate it is an increase of $22.60 per fortnight.Of course, we on this side of the House do understand how important it is to make sure that we continue to deliver these pension improvements as a result of indexation as pensioners face challenges with the cost of living. We knew that we needed to introduce a new cost-of-living index for pensioners. It is this side of the parliament that delivered that to pensioners, and it is based on a new basket of goods that actually reflects what pensioners buy - not what the rest of the community buy but what pensioners buy. We do understand that pensioners spend more of their pension on things like food, medicines and clothing than the rest of the public do.What our changes mean - not changes ever made by those opposite; changes that were made by this government in our first term in office - is that the value of the pension keeps up with pensioners' cost-of-living pressures. What this means is that total pension payments now for those on the maximum rate are just over $716 per fortnight for singles and $1,079.60 per fortnight for couples, combined. Of course, those opposite had 12 years to deliver for pensioners and not once did they do it. - In fact they rejected a proposal to increase the pension.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I know I was actually discussing with her that questions of redistribution in Victoria are pressing on her mind, but I did not understand she had her sights on Broadmeadows. It is a long way from her current electorate. - In any event, can I say to the member opposite: obviously, the government has made a set of decisions about asylum seeker facilities. They were announced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. As I said yesterday, as the minister for immigration has said today and as I am happy to reiterate, obviously the department of immigration, from time to time working with the Department of Defence, considers contingencies and options for asylum seeker accommodation. There is nothing new in this. Similar processes used to happen under the previous government, the Howard government. I would remind the member, for example, that the Howard government actually dealt with the facility at Christmas Island as a contingency. So this sort of planning goes on, work goes on, and that work has been happening in the department of immigration with, from time to time as it impacts on defence facilities, the Department of Defence. The minister for immigration made an announcement on 17 September about immigration facilities. There are some implications for the facility the member refers to and they are now on the public record.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Kingston for her question. It has been very notable to me, as I have listened to some of the first speeches in the House by new members, that the necessity for a comprehensive, thorough education is clearly identified in this place as being one of the primary and core responsibilities of the national government. I noted with great interest the remarks from the member for Hasluck and the member for Greenway, who in fact used the expression that education is the great enabler. It is, and it is something that this government completely understands.In her speech, the Governor-General talked about education being at the heart of our agenda, and it is. Our aim is nothing less than to make every school in Australia a great school. In just three years we have delivered more for education at every level than did the coalition over 12 years, importantly with an investment of over $63 billion in the four years 2009-2012, nearly double what was invested in the previous four years. We are working on crucial reform through national partnerships - literacy and numeracy, $540 million over four years; improving teacher quality, $550 million over five years; $1.5 billion committed in partnership with the states to schools of low-socioeconomic quality.It is important for people to understand what the government's commitment means, particularly on literacy and numeracy and on low-SES schools - that some 2,500 schools will receive additional support from this government. There is also a bold reform agenda under way, and the Prime Minister referred to it in part. For the first time, a national curriculum is on the way, a draft curriculum for English, maths, science and history, crucial reforms with the NAPLAN tests, a MySchool website with information for parents on nearly 10,000 schools, the kind of information that parents and carers really need and really want when thinking about the education of their children. It is one of the most important decisions they will make. The Digital Education Revolution: over 300,000 new computers are going into schools right around Australia, on track to reach the one-for-one delivery that we have set ourselves by the end of next year. Further reforms to come are improving teacher quality, rewards for performance and the like.I have to make a final point, as I speak to you about education - and as the member for Sturt returns to the chamber - that at the last election the opposition pledged to cut over $3 billion out of education. That was a specific pledge by the Leader of the Opposition, to cut money out of education - one of the most important tasks that the government can set itself. What would that have meant? Over one million students would not have taken the advantage of being able to train in trade training centres. It would mean that over 120,000 students would not have had the opportunity to have computers in schools. When the opposition were in government they put some flag poles in front of schools; this government is committed to making sure that schools have the opportunity to do what every Australian wants us to do best - provide a first-class education for Australian students.</DOC>

I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the government made the announcement today to be transparent with the Australian people about our long-term plans for detention centres. That was why the government today made the statement that I made with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. In part, we made that statement - and I made it clear in the remarks that I made at the start of the statement - because the opposition loves to run around with spurious claims of secret plans, obviously raising fear and concern in communities about what is going to happen next, so we preferred the path of transparency.To take just one example of that, the opposition have continued to insist that there is some secret plan to expand Curtin. Let me take the opportunity to say that they are wrong. The federal budget of 2010 funded a detention centre at Curtin with a capacity of 1,200 places. Less than 1,200 persons were initially moved in there. However, of course the relevant department took the prudent steps in designing the centre and putting the infrastructure in place so that the centre could reach its full capacity efficiently. When Minister Bowen became minister, he reviewed the work that had occurred at Curtin and decided to increase the numbers at Curtin to 1,200. That was the first time the department had been instructed to make the arrangements for staffing - and the detention centre manager, Serco, to move more people into the Curtin site. Minister Bowen made it clear in the announcement on 17 September that work had been underway to enable the decision for the extra 600 people to be moved in.I note all of this became the subject of opposition interest because I was asked during the election campaign about plans to take Curtin to 3,000. There were never any such plans, and today's announcement puts the matter beyond doubt. The reason we have been transparent and made the announcement today is that obviously these matters do become the subject of community concern. We want to make sure that they get the right information.On the question of unauthorised arrivals in this country: as the opposition leader well knows, this is a matter that will not be solved by a three-word slogan. He had a three-word slogan during the election campaign; what he lacked was anything that looked like a policy or plan. The government has a policy and a plan. We have a policy for a regional protection framework, we have a policy for a regional processing centre, and the minister for immigration as recently as last week was involved in discussions on those questions in Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Dili, and we will pursue that dialogue. It is not correct for the opposition to pretend that brandishing a three-word slogan is a solution. It is not. We will continue to work on the regional protection framework and regional processing centre and in the meantime we will be as transparent as we have been today about the government's policies and plans.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his very important question about the global economy and plans the government has to broaden and strengthen our economy.Last weekend I attended the IMF-World Bank meetings in Washington. It was a good opportunity to take the temperature of the global economy, to talk to fellow finance ministers about the economic outlook and of course to share the Australian economic story. It is incredible to think where we were in the global economy just two years ago. Just two years ago last weekend, in Washington, there was a G20 finance ministers meeting, an emergency meeting, which was attended by then President George Bush. What the global economy was contemplating at that time was a collapse of global financial and stock markets and a drop in global demand, and it is pretty incredible to see how far the global economy has come in those two years.Of course, two years ago last week we moved decisively to put in place our bank guarantees to secure the flow of credit to the Australian economy and we announced our stimulus package phase 1. In two years the global economy has come a long way and, of course, so too has the Australian economy. But I guess the message that came out of this meeting over the weekend was that there is still risk in the global economy and, whilst it is recovering, the global recovery is fragile and uncertain. Indeed, the IMF has concluded that the risk has intensified, particularly when you look at what is going on in the European economy and in the United States economy. In those economies you are looking at near-double-digit unemployment and in some countries even more.This is how the chief economist of the IMF summed up the situation:The result is a recovery that is neither strong nor balanced and runs the risk of not being sustained _ in most advanced economies, weak consumption and investment, together with little improvement in net exports, are leading to low growth. Unemployment is high and barely decreasing.There could not be a sharper contrast with the Australian situation: strong employment growth and strong economic growth, compared with all other countries in the OECD. What they are saying in Washington is that what Australia has done is truly something special. Part of the success here is that, while we put in place the stimulus, we also put in place our plans for recovery - the fastest fiscal consolidation that we have seen since the 1960s. Bringing the budget back to surplus, making the investments in infrastructure and putting in place a tax system which is competitive, to broaden and to strengthen our economy - this is the way forward for Australia, and the contrast with all of those other countries at the IMF could not have been more stark.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, though it has caused me to laugh, because the Leader of the Opposition knows, in constructing that question, that what he is saying is absolutely wrong. Let me quote some words to the Leader of the Opposition which I think are very relevant on this point, about the role of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. It was obviously implemented by a bill in the parliament. The words I seek to quote are:This is an enormous step forward from the current governance model, which has remained largely unchanged since 1915 and requires the agreement of all basin jurisdictions before anything can be done. Through this bill, for the first time in the basin's history, one basin-wide institution accountable to the government will be responsible for planning the basin's water resources. It will be expert and it will be independent.They were wise words, and people may be amazed to hear that they came from the member for Wentworth. I am certainly not going to make a habit of it, but on this occasion I would adopt the words of the member for Wentworth. Everything has a first, and possibly a last moment - and that is my last moment adopting his words.What was set up under the Howard government, when the Leader of the Opposition was sitting at the cabinet table, presumably reading his cabinet papers and absorbing what was in them, was a process where the Murray-Darling Basin Authority -  -  -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I understand that. I am a little bit concerned that the member for Wentworth is now showing the Leader of the Opposition the true meaning of the word 'ancient' and denying that that fits the bill. - The point of describing the legislation, and what the Murray-Darling Basin Authority does, is to indicate how the authority is working and where the plan comes in. What has been published is a guide. It is subject to consultation. Then the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will publish a draft plan. It will be the subject of consultation. Then, of course, the minister will sign off a plan and bring it to this parliament. I am determined that, as we work through those stages, as we get to a final plan, the plan is implemented - because that will get the balance right between the environmental needs of the river, the needs of farmers and food producers and the needs of regional communities.I would counsel the Leader of the Opposition in the following terms. I understand this is difficult reform. I understand that it has inflamed community passion. But it is not in anybody's interests - not in the interests of any Australian, any farmer, any regional community - for the Leader of the Opposition to use his status to wreck this process. This is a process -  -  - This is a process that was started by the Howard government. It is a process that needs to be worked through with complete and full community consultation. That is occurring now through the consultations of the authority and will occur through the parliamentary committee led by the member for New England, and I thank him for doing that work.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for what I believe is her first question. Last week I took the opportunity, when in Queensland, to outline my vision for the Australian economy. As the Treasurer has already outlined to the House, we have emerged from the global financial crisis strong. We have emerged with opportunities in the global world. We should be congratulating ourselves as a nation for having worked together to emerge so strong and consequently with such opportunities for the future. But we cannot rest on our laurels. In order to harness those opportunities we need to continue economic reform. That requires fiscal consolidation, and the government has been involved, the Treasurer has outlined -  - The shadow Treasurer is interjecting - a man who could not even be bothered looking at the opposition's costings before election day. If he ever gets round to looking at the budget papers, he will see that the government is engaged in the biggest fiscal consolidation since the 1960s in order to make sure the budget comes to surplus in 2012-13, and it will.Beyond fiscal consolidation, we need to work to expand the supply side of the economy. Obviously what we do with human capital is vital to that. Our taxation system and particularly the reforms we have promised to company tax are vital. Growing the pool of national savings is vital, as is having the infrastructure we need for the future, and the National Broadband Network is pivotal to that so that we do not end up as a nation exporting jobs to other economies that have infrastructure like the National Broadband Network whilst we do not. The National Broadband Network is pivotal to the future. And we need to continue reform in education and health. As I outlined last week, we will be bringing market principles to those reforms. They are vital to the nation's future, to ensuring that we have the skills and capacities that our society needs. They are vital to ensuring that our health system is high-quality and sustainable for all Australians.Last week when I spoke in Brisbane I said we would be walking the journey of reform, the road of reform, every day, and we will.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. He may want to converse at length with the member for Wentworth about the thinking that went into the legislation and conceptualising the task of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. - As the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport so rightly points out, he could have read his cabinet papers when he was at the cabinet table. That would have been another way of becoming fully informed about the matter. I am not optimistic that that was occurring, but there we have it. The member may choose to talk to the member for Wentworth now. He appears to be searching his great speeches of the past in order to get the edited highlights for the member. - Of course the government is concerned about the social and economic impacts of this reform. This is why we have consistently said - I have said and the minister for water has said - that it is vital that we get the balance right between the environment and food production, the balance right for regional communities. But the member asking me the question knows that no change is not an option, no change is not in the interests of regional communities, no change is not in the interests of Australian farmers. He knows that. He also knows that we are committed to water purchases from willing sellers. He knows that we have already embarked on water purchases which have made a difference already in terms of water entitlements. He knows that that process has been engaged in.As we go through the balance of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority process and of course the process of the parliamentary committee, yes, we want all possible information to be brought to bear on the task so that the judgments that are finally made do get this all-important balance right.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Reid for his question. The Carbon Disclosure Project is an initiative comprising no less than 534 international institutional investors collectively representing over $64 trillion under management. In Australia the project's membership comprises 43 partners representing over $420 billion worth of funds under management. Today the annual report of the Carbon Disclosure Project has been released in relation to Australia and New Zealand and the report provides a number of important insights into contemporary business thinking about the issue of climate change and carbon pricing. It indicates that of those companies surveyed 76 per cent of the top companies in the ASX200 see action to combat climate change as representing greater business opportunities than risks to their business. Sixty-seven per cent of the ASX200 companies surveyed saw regulatory uncertainty as a key business risk and 64 per cent of those companies surveyed see significant business risks from physical impacts of climate change. In other words, three-quarters of the companies surveyed see significant business opportunities in the establishment of a carbon price and about two-thirds believe that the lack of a policy on carbon pricing is an inherent business risk.It is no surprise therefore that many of the business leadership in Australia accept and recognise that the establishment of a carbon price in our economy is a necessary economic reform. The Treasurer and I have indicated that a number of the business leadership from across very important sectors of the Australian economy have agreed to join the government's business round table for the purpose of consultation over this important economic reform.The companies represented on the government's round table represent a workforce of around 380,000 people in our economy and collectively generate revenues of around $225 billion. So this will be a very important consultative forum for the government to discuss the issues concerning carbon pricing. This is a very important economic reform to provide certainty to the business community, particularly in sectors such as the energy industry, where we know that billions of dollars of investment are backed up awaiting certainty over the issue of carbon pricing and how such a policy would operate in the marketplace for that investment to proceed. That is why the business community is supporting an economic reform of this nature, and it stands in stark contrast to the policy position of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is out of step with mainstream business thinking -  - and many on the other side in this House understand that issue well. 
An opposition member - You are out of step with the community on climate change, Greg.</DOC>

As the member for Mayo's question acknowledges, we are talking about reforms that began under the Howard government, and I am very pleased to hear that being acknowledged. The level of bipartisanship sometimes gets forgotten in moments in here but on water it has been there.The $5.8 billion that was referred to refers beyond the on-farm irrigation to actual centralised irrigation infrastructure - that is the $5.8 billion that was referred to in the question. Those applications have come in from the states and there is a process of due diligence that the department quite properly is going through in making the assessment on those individual state applications for that money. If there is a call for the due diligence not to occur, I would be surprised by that. It is a large amount of money and the due diligence work that is going on is appropriate.

 - I thank the member for Kingston for the question, which is broad ranging and allows me to deal with some of the broader issues around the Murray-Darling Basin, in particular the concept of just how bipartisan this issue has been. On 11 August, three members of the opposition released the following words:The coalition will release a draft basin plan within two weeks of coming to office and proceed with its implementation without delay. Labor's delays must come to an end.The three members of the opposition who released that statement on 11 August were Senator Birmingham, Senator Joyce and the Leader of the Opposition. So, for all the criticism that we hear about the government in terms of a guide to a draft of a plan, the opposition actually were not going to wait for the final plan. The opposition were going to implement the draft without delay within two weeks. In a media release in the name of the Leader of the Opposition, which I table, they had committed to implement the draft plan.There are three priorities that this parliament is going to have to get right in water reform. They are about having a healthy river, the importance of food production and the importance and sustainability of regional communities.There has been a lot of misinformation over the last week, which I would like to clear up here in the chamber. There has been an argument that the guide to the draft of a plan released by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority represents government policy. It does not. There is a belief in many communities that the government will forcibly acquire water from people. We will not. There is a belief that the plan, whatever it ends up being at the end of next year, will not take account of the good work already done in many communities. It will. There is a long process to go with this reform, but there is a huge cost in doing nothing. There is not only the impact of acid sulphate soils that we have seen in the Lower Lakes, as the member for Kingston would know all too well. There is not only the impact that we have seen from an unhealthy river system over the last decade, with algae going up and down in many parts of it. There is not only the impact on 16 Ramsar-listed wetlands. But I would remind the House that in the Lower Lakes area not that many years ago there were 23 dairy operations. As salinity started to take over the Lower Lakes, the count went from 23 down to three. Let us not pretend that this is somehow a simple old-style battle of environment versus production. Everybody up and down the Murray-Darling Basin has an interest in having a healthy river system. There was a good deal more bipartisanship across the years on this issue than might have been reflected over the last couple of days. But let me remind the House that it is important and it is incumbent on this parliament to get that balance right. It is important that this parliament gets the balance right across those three issues: a healthy river system, the importance of food production and sustainable regional communities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It is a very important question. I can tell him that the Australian Bankers Association has said that banks are not foreclosing on customers due to the release of the guide. So, if he has some further information that he would like to give to me, I would be very happy to follow up on that. This is a serious question. I do take it seriously, so if there is further information that would, if you like, add an extra view to what the Australian Bankers Association is saying I would certainly be pleased to hear that.The government does have a commitment to the security of people who live in the basin. We have a commitment to the security of families and we have a commitment to environmental sustainability, because the two are linked, and to pull the two apart is simply not possible. Everybody knows how difficult an issue this is - whether you come from Queensland or whether you are living in South Australia or any point in between. The government takes these issues seriously and I would be happy to follow them up if there was any further information.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I know the long interest he has taken in water sustainability in his state - his municipality - and I was pleased that he was involved in the Murray-Darling Basin consultation sessions in Renmark last Friday. I congratulate him for his interest.The question is the significance of the engagement of the parliamentary committee which is to be established. It has a threefold purpose. Firstly, the plan that the government brings to the parliament has to be approved by the parliament. It is therefore terribly important that we engage the parliament in the process. The cabinet had a discussion about this almost two weeks ago. We discussed how we could engage the parliamentary process. It was as a result of that that I spoke to the member for New England, and the terms of reference were developed in consultation. I am looking forward to the work of that committee. I think the committee has an important role to play.The second reason it is important for parliament to be engaged is so that it can help us get the balance that is being talked about and which gets derision from time to time on the other side. The fact is that we have been presented with a guide from the Murray-Darling Basin Commission that goes to the flows necessary - in their view, based on the science - to get sustainability of the water system. What we also need is sustainability of the economies and of the communities. We need to ensure that we are getting the human factor involved. The socioeconomic consequences are vital. The truth is that there have been important advances made in many of the communities down the Murray-Darling Basin. What we want is the engagement of parliament to help get that balance and to complement the guide that has been put forward by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.The third reason the parliamentary committee will be important is that it will help us focus on the local involvement. It is important to look at the terms of reference that we have circulated in relation to it, requiring consideration of valley-by-valley initiatives, recognising the effect of initiatives already taken and looking at where water buybacks and infrastructure have worked - in other words, to help us develop best practice in coming to grips with the solutions. We as a government believe that it is terribly important in facing up to these issues of diversity that are consequent upon our geography and our environment that we engage localism in arriving at those decisions.There is no difficulty in facing up to the local communities. What we want to do, though, is make sure that those local communities do not just get angry but channel their interest in this issue to constructive solutions. I hope that members on the other side of the House understand the opportunity that this parliamentary committee presents, that they get behind it, that they get involved and that they come forward with constructive solutions. That is what we are prepared to do on this side of the House, and I look forward to working with the member for New England in achieving that outcome.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Farrer for the question. As I have said publicly, I as minister will not be looking over the shoulder of and watching an independent authority consult on its own document. Quite properly, I as minister did not have a role -  -  - Quite properly, the independent authority developed the guide as an independent authority without ministerial interference. They will then go and conduct their consultation on that document, on their own. I have, as members opposite know from their own electorates and their visits to their own electorates, over the past three years constantly been in and out of irrigation communities and continue to be so. - That is the reason why last Friday I was in one of the irrigation communities in the electorate of the member for Parkes. But I am not going to meetings looking over the shoulder of an independent authority. I notice the Leader of the Nationals. The Leader of the Nationals says, 'When are you going to go to Griffith?' When he was minister for agriculture, the front page of the local paper there, the Griffith Area News, ran the heading 'Where's Warren?' because he never visited. -  - An independent authority has put forward an independent guide and is conducting its own consultation with reference to one thing: legislation that was carried under the Howard government and carried through by the member for Wentworth - legislation which has been bipartisan the whole way through. I will be visiting, as I always have, each and every one of those irrigation districts, but when we refer to Griffith let us not forget that it is known as the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area and that newspaper report I mentioned referred to the Leader of the Nationals as MIA in the MIA.</DOC>

It is my great pleasure, on behalf of the Australian government but particularly on behalf of the Minister for Sport, Senator Arbib, to commend the organisers, to commend Perry Crosswhite and the Australian Commonwealth Games Association and particularly to commend the Australian Commonwealth Games team on what were some tremendous endeavours in India recently. Whilst there were some bumpy roads in anticipation in the lead-up to the games, what we actually saw in Delhi were some truly remarkable feats by Australians. We saw that the Delhi Commonwealth Games provided a stage for true superstars like Anna Meares and Matt Cowdrey or superstars like Sally Pearson to show that they are truly gifted not just in athletic abilities but also in attitude. Whilst sports stars have enjoyed many of these events and many of the games' results, I think that all Australians can appreciate that our team has now arrived home safely and securely. I think it is appropriate that we pay tribute to the organisers and to those who worked so hard to make sure that there were not any security incidents at this event; that this did run smoothly; and that all of the Australian team is now home, is now looking to get back into training and is now looking to represent Australia proudly in London in 2012.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for the question. She was referring to a copy of the draft plan. The draft plan has not been produced. The draft plan comes out next year. It is a statutory document that gets followed by 16 weeks of consultation. What is happening in advance of that is a guide to what they think they might put in the draft of the plan. That is the way the independent authority have chosen to do it. There is a long period of consultation that goes through in all of this, and I will not be telling an independent authority from the sidelines what they should and should not do. What people need to understand with all of this is that, if the option is that people want to argue that somehow the river system is healthy and water reform is not required, they would find very few people willing to say that that was a sensible position. Reform is never easy; reform is difficult. But what we have to deal with here is a situation where, first of all, any reductions that happen through purchases happen only from willing sellers. If you do not want to sell your water, the government does not want to buy it. We have the extra addition to what is being done with efficiencies, whether it is centralised irrigation efficiency, on-farm irrigation efficiency or all the works and measures to more effectively manage the environmental resources up and down the basin. There is a long period of consultation between now and then, and the government will not adjudicate point by point on the work that is being done properly by the independent authority.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. I know that she was particularly keen to follow this issue, because she, as well as many other members in the House, knows that if we are to deliver properly on health reform we need to have enough doctors, enough nurses, enough allied health professionals not only coming through our universities but also getting good clinical training experience in communities where they are needed.That is why the Prime Minister and I were so delighted to announce last week the allocation of nearly half a billion dollars worth of Commonwealth investment in clinical training places for undergraduates. There are 22 professions including not just doctors and nurses - although nurses and midwives account for the lion's share of this investment, as they need to - but also allied health professionals of all types. In the seat of Cunningham, the University of Wollongong, for example, is getting supported places for more psychology students and nursing places. I know that the member for Lingiari, as another example, would be very pleased that in Central Australia there are going to be supported places in nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy. I have not heard the member for Cowper, who was here before, comment on this, but I know that the member for Lyne has. The investments on the mid-North Coast, for example, are supporting more medical students, speech pathology students, physiotherapy students and nursing students across all of the mid-North Coast.It is really important to emphasise here in this House why this investment is so significant. For the first time there has been a proper planning process about the need in the future for doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. For the first time we have invested money to ensure that students get training in places where there are shortages. Thirty-seven per cent of this money is going to support students in rural and regional Australia. Sixty per cent of the money is going to private and non-government organisations because this is to expand capacity; work that has been done well in our public hospitals needs to also be done in private settings. Forty-one per cent of this funding is going to priority areas where there are serious workforce issues. I know that the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing will be very pleased that 41 per cent is going into those areas like mental health, aged care and primary care where there has not been enough training in the past.This is good news. Of course, it is in stark contrast to the approach taken by the Leader of the Opposition when he was the health minister. We are very proud that this multimillion-dollar investment is now turning into supported places for real nursing students, real doctors and real allied health professionals across the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The very clear rationale for Australia's involvement in Afghanistan is that it is in our national interest to be so involved. It is in our national interest to support a United Nations mandated International Security Assistance Force - a coalition of 47 countries mandated by the United Nations. That coalition, including our alliance partner the United States, seeks to stare down international terrorism. These issues will no doubt be very broadly and widely debated by parliament in the days ahead.Let me come precisely to the question that the member has raised in respect of the Karzai government. As members of the House might recall, both before and after the recent presidential election which saw President Karzai re-elected, I said very clearly on a number of occasions that Australia, the Australian government, the International Security Assistance Force and the international community expected to see considerable and substantive improvement from whatever Afghan government emerged from that presidential election process, whether it was a re-elected Karzai government or some other government. We expected to see substantial improvement on corruption, on governance and on human rights issues, in particular the treatment of women and girls, especially when it came to matters like education. I said that on behalf of the Australian government and on behalf of Australia, both domestically and internationally. I said that before President Karzai faced the election and after his re-election. The position of Australia and the position of the Australian government have not changed one iota in that respect.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. He of course was very proud to be at the opening of the Northern Expressway in Adelaide in September. The expressway was opened three months ahead of schedule, thanks to the government's economic stimulus plan. This will cut travel times by up to 20 minutes. More than 3,300 Australians were put into work as a direct result of that project. I congratulate the contractors, because 14 per cent of the people who worked on site and got training were young or Indigenous - well above the 10 per cent target that they had. They showed that the target can be achieved. Those young people and Indigenous workers who I met the four times that I visited the project were very proud, as were their families. They can be proud of the fact that they can see the product of their work.Just this month, the $155 million Mandurah Entrance Road in Western Australia was also opened, again almost three months ahead of schedule as a result of the government's economic stimulus plan. This project had 200 people working on it. It is part of a broader commitment to the region because it provides a link from the new Perth-Bunbury highway, completed last year, into the Mandurah town centre. These road and rail projects that we brought forward as a result of the economic stimulus plan were critical in creating employment during the global financial crisis. They are also critical in building nation-building infrastructure for many years to come.</DOC>

I will be spending a whole lot of time in basin communities, not only speaking with irrigators but also meeting with the townspeople, because we cannot pretend that this issue only affects irrigators. Certainly the irrigators have the option as to whether or not they choose to be willing sellers. Those options are not necessarily available to those people in the town who suffer the economic challenge when a number of irrigators decide to get out and when you have the downstream impacts. Those issues are all worthy of consultation and I will be out there as I have been constantly.In terms of the final issue for the plan, the order of events on this is simple and ultimately the one document that is called the plan is the document that I sign. Up until that point there is a process conducted by the independent authority, and let me tell you just what level of support there has been for that independent authority. I quote:Important elements of this bill which give effect to the National Plan for Water Security include an independent Murray-Darling Basin Authority with enforcement powers; a basin plan which sets a cap on water systems _Speaking in support of the bill when it went through, that was the member for Indi. So please do not come in with the shock and outrage. You support a piece of legislation, you support an independent authority -  - You support an independent authority which is charged with conducting consultation and charged with eventually bringing forward a proposal. But the final responsibility for the plan itself rests with me as minister and then, to survive, it has to survive disallowance in each house of the parliament, and therefore none of us in this chamber will avoid responsibility. No-one in this chamber should think they are going to be able to walk away from what needs to happen in the Murray-Darling Basin. Anybody is capable of being a wrecker and anybody is capable of doing what has been done for the last hundred years in the Murray-Darling Basin and saying, 'Rather than address the reform we would rather just throw our hands up in the air and do nothing.' The responsibility, once I sign that plan, rests with the parliament, and the bipartisan approach which has existed from the day the member for Wentworth first introduced this legislation will come back to the parliament in 2011 when the plan is introduced.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. He has a longstanding interest in matters related to justice. He asks me about the creation of the position of Director of Military Prosecutions. He asks me for the rationale for the independence of the prosecutor and he asks me what role, if any, there is for government in this matter.The position of the Director of Military Prosecutions was of course created by legislation introduced by the Howard government, of which the Leader of the Opposition was a cabinet member, and it was passed by the parliament with bipartisan support including the support in the Senate of the now shadow minister for defence, Senator Johnston, in 2005. It had bipartisan support, as it should. The first and current Director of Military Prosecutions was appointed by the Howard government in July 2006. The creation of the position of Director of Military Prosecutions followed consideration of a number of reports including, importantly, a seminal Senate report in June or July 2005. When the report was received on 16 June 2005 in the Senate, Senator Johnston, the now shadow minister for defence, said - and he was referring to two reports:The most crucial and telling aspect of both of those inquiries was that the reports handed down were unanimous. There was no party politics and no point scoring involved in this exercise.That is a very good analysis for the House to take. It is a very good analysis for Senator Johnston himself to follow. It is a very good analysis for the Leader of the Opposition. It is an analysis which I know the member for Fadden has been following.On 20 June 2008, again in committee, Senator Johnston, when considering some of the reforms proposed to Australia's military justice system, said, 'These statutory officers have to be completely independent.' They are statutory officers, so the notions of complete independence and of no point scoring or partisan politics in these matters are referred to us as advice in analysis by Senator Johnston and we should follow that.We have seen in recent times the first illustration of the Director of Military Prosecutions bringing charges against three Australian defence personnel, as a result of an incident in Afghanistan in February 2009 which saw the tragic death of six civilians. I make no comment on the incident itself; that would be inappropriate. I make no comment on the processes other than to say that they are properly independent of government, as they should be, and that we allow the military justice system to take its course.The one fundamental change that we are dealing with here has been the creation of the position of Director of Military Prosecutions, presented to the parliament by the Howard government and supported by legislation during its time. It is the provision of that legislation that in the course of consideration of the Director of Military Prosecutions bringing a charge or charges that defence service chiefs, the Chief of the Defence Force or his representatives, can make representations under section 5A of the legislation to the military prosecutor about general defence matters, not about guilt or innocence or whether charges should be preferred or not. Indeed, in this case when asking for such representations the Director of Military Prosecutions expressly advised the CDF not to make comments about preferring of charges or not because that would impact upon her independence.It is of course clearly inappropriate for the government of the day to seek to inveigle itself into these matters. Where there is a role for government, of course, is to ensure, as I, the Chief of Army and the CDF have made clear, that the three personnel concerned have access to whatever legal resources and advice they require to properly defend themselves as well as other appropriate support and advice from the defence forces so far as their families are concerned as they go through a very difficult process. We have no alternative, as a result of legislation passed by the House and the Senate, other than to respect that independent process.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Yes, I used that terminology last Friday. As the member may recall, I used that terminology in the House on, I believe, the very first day I was Prime Minister. I have used it consistently since. So there is nothing new in that. I have said to the Australian people consistently - before the election, during the election and now - that this program did become a mess, and the government brought it to an end. Having brought it to an end, obviously the government is working through compensation and inspection questions. We had the Hawke review and then of course we had the Auditor-General's report. What members of parliament would see from the Auditor-General's report and I think what they would conclude as a simple matter of common sense is that a lot has been learned through this process. It has been learned by government and the relevant department. They are important lessons. - The question started with a reference to my statement last Friday, drafted in by whoever drafted the question, and I am responding to that part of it. Having responded to that part of it, I will respond to the other part of it. The other part of it goes to the question of government processes about economic stimulus. The government acted on economic stimulus through cabinet processes, through particularly the strategic policy and budget committee. Decisions were made to roll out economic stimulus in the face of the global financial crisis because we were not prepared to sit idly by and watch hundreds of thousands of Australians be robbed of the benefits and dignity of work, with all that that implies for them and their families' futures.I presume the member's question gets to the issue of responsibility, and I am very happy to say yes, the government take responsibility for the Home Insulation Program. We are absorbing the lessons from the Auditor-General's report. - Can I conclude by saying the government do take responsibility here. The government are moving through. We brought the Home Insulation Program to an end. We had the Hawke review. We have the compensation issues. We have the inspections which are rolling out. Could I suggest to members of the opposition that if they truly want to deal with these questions then at some point they should honestly reflect in the parliament what was said in the Auditor-General's report and the lessons that can be learned from it. I would refer particularly to the statements in the Auditor-General's report about the role of the department and the question of advice. - I would indicate to the member that in his public statement he may also choose to be more accurate about those things.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question. This morning I had the honour of helping to launch Carers Week down at Old Parliament House with the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, the shadow minister for carers - both from the other place - a number of carers, carer ambassadors and the incomparable Noeline Brown, the Ambassador for Ageing. Carers Week is a week for celebration of the achievements of carers and the work that informal carers do all around Australia every day. Today Carers Australia released a report commissioned from Access Economics that tells us that now 2.9 million Australians provide informal care. Some 500,000 of them work as the primary carer or sole carer for those for whom they care.The theme of Carers Week this year - 'Anyone, anytime' - reflects the diversity of our carer population. There is no stereotypical carer. With that diversity comes a range of very different needs. For example, the ageing parents of an adult child with a mental illness or disability have caring needs of their own as they grow older. Thousands of young carers, many of whom are still adolescents, need help to reconcile their caring responsibilities with their ongoing education and training.Across the board, though, we know that the work of carers is almost invariably stressful and physically draining. That is why the government supported the 2008 parliamentary inquiry into better support for carers, an inquiry that resulted in a bipartisan report, Who cares_? In response to that report, the government committed to the development of a national carers recognition framework which would include both legislation and the development of a national carers strategy. To that end, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs introduced the Carer Recognition Bill back into the parliament in the last sitting week, and today the government has launched a discussion paper towards a national carers strategy. Consultation around that paper will be driven by Carers Australia and Children with Disability Australia who will be conducting workshops around the country with individual carers themselves to ensure that they have input into the final shape of the strategy.This framework will build on a range of important initiatives already undertaken by the first-term Labor government. Most obviously, these initiatives improve financial security for carers through increasing by more than $100 per fortnight the maximum single rate of the carer payment, through introducing an annual and ongoing carer supplement of $600 per year paid to almost 500,000 carers around Australia and through introducing new rules to make it easier for carers of children with a disability to get income support. Last year more than 143,000 carers accessed respite care through the National Respite for Carers Program, and that is funded to the tune of more than $200 million in the 2010-11 financial year. The consumer directed care trials that were initiated by my predecessor include 200 respite care packages with individual budgets being paid to carers for them to spend on respite options that they choose. Carers Week has become an important part of the national calendar. To all Australian carers out there, I say that your caring is not just appreciated by those you care for - your loved ones - but also acknowledged, admired and appreciated by all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The decision to place detention centres in particular locations has been undertaken by this government under the same process as has been undertaken before under governments of both political persuasions. I can reassure the member for Mayo that of course the Department of Immigration and Citizenship will be entering into considerable discussions with local authorities, as is always the case when a decision like this is taken, and all impacts will be paid for by the Commonwealth, as is always the case. All education costs will be undertaken by the Commonwealth, as is always the case. All health costs will be undertaken by the Commonwealth, as is always the case.</DOC>

 - About half an hour ago a major agreement was signed in Tasmania. I think it is important to update the House on that. The Tasmanian Premier, as I understand it, is making an announcement at the moment. -  - No, it happened half an hour ago. The agreement involves Timber Communities Australia, the CFMEU, the National Association of Forest Industries, the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania, the Forest Contractors Association, Environment Tasmania, the Wilderness Society, the Conservation Foundation and the Country Sawmillers Federation. It would seem extraordinary to most members in this House that you would ever find an agreement involving all of those parties. Anyone who was watching some of the forestry discussions that happened during the election campaign would be aware that roundtable discussions have been happening for some time among groups that for many years - in fact, for generations - have made it their core business to be arguing and fighting with each other.The nature of what has been agreed at the moment has been presented to the Tasmanian government and will also be before the Commonwealth government. Effectively what we have is the environmental groups agreeing to a sustainable future for Tasmanian forestry. There will be a transition away from native forestry, which the forestry companies are in agreement with. Some of the native forest reserve will continue to be logged during this time but, importantly, there will be a moratorium on areas of high conservation value, including the Styx Valley, the Tarkine and the Florentine.At the same time the environmental groups have agreed that they will no longer be offering blanket opposition to the construction of any pulp mill in Tasmania. There is no commitment to the particular site and there will always be arguments going back and forth with respect to the pulp mill, but there is an acknowledgement for the first time from environmental groups about the importance of downstream processing happening here in Australia. There is an acknowledgement of the importance of timber communities and the importance of the jobs that those timber communities rely on. There has been involvement in the various mills from the work done by not only government but also the independent mills, whether it be the international investment in Ta Ann or whether it be McKay or Britton.For people like the member for Braddon, who have spent much of their career looking after timber communities, it provides an extraordinary opportunity for a long-term sustainable future, overcoming some of the dangers that have been in the woodchip export market over recent months. For those that have been concerned about the protection of Tasmania's native forests, it means that for the first time the areas of high conservation value which have caused so much argument over the years are now under a period of moratorium.The government will look at the details and work through our response, just as the Tasmanian government will. But I do think it is important for the House to acknowledge the extraordinary work that has been done in building a consensus in Tasmania to provide an environmental dividend while acknowledging the important role and future of the timber industry there.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, and let me answer it using the following words in terms of the announcement that the government made yesterday:I think they represent a very sensible balance on the present arrangements. They do not in any way undermine the existing policy. What we will have even more so after these changes are a mandatory detention system with a softer edge, but nonetheless a mandatory detention system.I have to acknowledge those words are not mine; those are the words of former Prime Minister John Howard at a press conference on 17 June 2005 when the former government announced the changes to the Migration Act -  - on which this government will rely to implement the arrangements announced yesterday. - What I would say to the member who is interjecting and shouting and carrying on - it always seems to me that the shorter they are on ideas, the louder they are on interjections, and we are seeing that on display today - is that it seems to me that the shadow minister would not be contending to this place that John Howard was soft on border protection. The amendments to the Migration Act in 2005 -  - and there are some members in this place who were involved in the advocacy from the back bench that led to those changes. The changes to the Migration Act are ones that we are relying on to deal with children and to deal with at-risk families. I believe that that is appropriate. At the same time, of course, we announced our long-term strategy in relation to detention centres. As recently as last week, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship was involved in dialogue in our region about a regional protection framework and a regional processing centre. The government will continue to pursue that regional protection framework and regional processing centre. We believe that that is important to the management of irregular people movement in our region, particularly taking out of the hands of people smugglers the very product that they sell by taking away the incentive to engage in forward transit.None of this is easy and I am not going to pretend that it is. This is complex policy. We have said that consistently to the Australian people. We will continue to pursue it. We will allow the opposition to pursue their three-word slogans.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. Last week I was talking about the importance of hard reform - the importance of hard reform to strengthening our economy, the importance of hard reform to making sure that we continue to have the benefits of prosperity. Our nation has emerged from the global financial crisis stronger than nations around the world. That gives us a fantastic platform on which to continue building for growth. But that means we have to continue with the work of hard economic reform. If we look across our nation today, we still bear many of the hallmarks, even in the 21st century, of the separate colonies that came together to form this nation - that is, we still have many laws in different states dealing with matters which are now truly national.The government has engaged in a drive to create a seamless national economy - that is, businesses that trade in more than one state actually face the same regulation and do not need to adapt because they are trading in more than one state. Our drive for a seamless national economy has also been about recognising the qualifications and credentials of workers so that a tradesperson who is fully registered in one state does not need to go through further onerous processes in order to ply their trade if they move to another state. This is important national reform.At the centre of this important national reform is the reform to our occupational health and safety laws. As people who follow the economic reform debate would know, there has been no more important claim by business over the years for business to work effectively across the country than for there to be one set of uniform laws around the nation. This would reduce business compliance costs by $179 million. That is a direct benefit. But of course the indirect benefits to business are far greater than that. In pursuit of this direct benefit to business, the government worked through a COAG process to generate an agreement for model laws, which all states and territories signed on to except Western Australia. It was not easy. There were nine ministerial council meetings, seven meetings of the relevant agency Safe Work Australia, 20 meetings of the Strategic Issues Group, a national review, 240 submissions and two published reports outlining the structure and content of the act, and those exposure drafts received 480 submissions.At the end of that extensive process there was an agreement for model laws. Key features of those model laws from the point of view of workers were that they would cover all kinds of workers - not just employees - in recognition of the changing nature of our workforce, there would be higher penalties for the breach of a duty of care, there would be no small business exemption, and a qualified health and safety representative would be able to issue a provisional improvement notice and would be able to direct that unsafe work be stopped. These are not rights that are common right around the country today. I take this opportunity to say to Premier Keneally, who has indicated that she wants to walk away from this hard economic reform, that it is in the interests of businesses and employees in New South Wales for the reform to proceed. A deal is a deal, and we will ensure that the deal is honoured.</DOC>

 - I genuinely thank the member for his question. Can I say to him that I just referred to the 2005 reforms in my last answer to a question from the shadow minister and I respect the role that the member asking the question played in advocating those reforms from the back bench of the then Howard government. I recall attending a meeting with him in regional Victoria at which these questions were discussed. It was obvious to me at the time that he was struggling with these issues in his own mind and that he was desperately concerned, and he went on to advocate a change of policy. He was not the only member who did that. Notably, the then member for Kooyong did and the member for Pearce did, and so did a number of others. I congratulate them on that advocacy.But this makes the point that the opposition cannot play this both ways. The shadow minister has come into the parliament today and asked a question of me, trying to indicate to the Australian people that somehow yesterday's announcement was inappropriate and that somehow in making yesterday's announcement the government is softening on mandatory detention or in some way engaging inappropriately with immigration policy. Yet the member then comes in and asks this question. You cannot have it both ways. The only thing I would ask the opposition to do in the modern age - that is, today - is to honour the words of their shadow minister from 16 October, just three short days ago, when he said 'we are happy to listen to any proposal from any sphere of politics about how children can be best managed under the Migration Act', when they come by boat and are then subject to our migration laws. The only thing I am asking the opposition to do is to honour those words of their shadow minister from three days ago. Stop, think, analyse and then determine your position rather than come in here with your three-word slogans thinking that is a solution.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. Today a report has been released by the Climate Institute. It is a report prepared by an organisation known as Vivid Economics. It is a well-respected organisation from the United Kingdom which does research into climate change economic issues. The report that has been released today is an analysis of the implicit or shadow carbon prices that operate in a number of key economies with which Australia trades. The study is in fact one of the first efforts, I think, that has been made to quantify the costs of policies to reduce emissions or to establish what shadow carbon prices there are in particular economies, including countries as important to Australia as Japan, the United Kingdom itself, the USA, China and South Korea.The Vivid Economics report has found that countries around the world are, of course, already taking steps to reduce their carbon pollution and thereby moving to cleaner energy sources and effectively having a carbon price in their economies. Importantly, it indicates that countries with which Australia trades, like China and the United States, already have implicit carbon prices within their electricity sectors. This is a matter that is of interest to the multiparty climate change committee that the government has established to consider the issue of the introduction of a carbon price, and a matter that the government has responded to in response to a request by the member for New England to do an independent analysis of what carbon prices would be operating with some of our major trading partners.In our economy, a carbon price not only will create an incentive to reduce pollution but will also provide certainty for investment by the business community. It will also increase this country's long-term competitiveness, because it will drive investment in clean energy and it will make Australia an attractive investment place in which companies will do business. The energy company AGL, one of our major companies operating in the energy industry, estimates that uncertainty caused by the delay in implementing a carbon price in our economy could cost consumers up to $2 billion a year, or around $60 per household, in higher electricity prices in 2020. The shadow Treasurer shakes his head. I will explain: it is because investment in new baseload electricity generation is being deferred because of the uncertainty generated by the lack of a carbon price in our economy. -  - We have further commentary from the other side. It is not rubbish. If you engage with the major players in the energy sector they will tell you that is the case and they will tell you that is why they support the introduction of a carbon price into our economy. The interjections only serve to emphasise how out of touch those opposite are with mainstream business thinking in this matter. They are out of touch with developments that are going on internationally and their position in opposing a carbon price in this economy is economically irresponsible.</DOC>

 - In thanking the member for Kennedy, I want first of all to acknowledge that there would be no-one in this chamber who has pushed harder for us to make use of the water resources available in Northern Australia than the member for Kennedy. It is an argument that he has been putting long and hard over many years.On the issue of the importation of food, certainly on the products of ham and treated pigmeat and seafood, I agree - with seafood it is certainly true. The problem with fruit and vegetables is the process standard. It is the lack of a sufficiently strong food processing industry in Australia that has caused import figures to go the way that was stated in the question.On the issue of the Murray-Darling, I would remind the House and all members of what I said yesterday: that the figures which have been announced at the moment are not government policy. It is also the case that there is a determination to see how much of what is required can be delivered through gains in efficiencies. Whenever gains in efficiencies are found there is no loss in productivity, and we are quite determined to see how far we can go down that path.The question also refers to a number of other issues which cross over into other portfolios but I think I can provide some information on those. In relation to the north Australian clean energy corridor, from Townsville to Mount Isa the project, as I understand it, is in the order of about $350 million. When round 2 of the Solar Flagships Program comes on offer the Queensland government will be invited to make an application for that project. Obviously the application from Queensland will have to meet the guidelines of the Solar Flagships, but they will be invited to make an application and the expected amount is $350 million. Added to that is the importance of biofuels; $20 million has been put forward by the government to establish a biofuels research centre, which would be based at James Cook University.Across the north of Australia, I do not think anyone would argue that we can somehow transplant the food production of the Murray-Darling Basin, and shift a food bowl in the south to a food bowl in the north. The situation in the north is that the soils are harder and much of the rainfall falls in only a few months of the year, but there is no doubt that a lot more can be done there in the future than has been done in the past. You only have to go to places such as Kilto Station in Western Australia to see where mosaic irrigation has actually brought some great improvements in productivity. I have been to properties in the north where these things have been done and there will certainly be opportunities in the north that have not been there in the south. - I am hearing interjections from the shadow Treasurer about where the water flows. The example that I referred to, from Kilto Station, is using groundwater in that particular instance. Certainly, there is no doubt that more can be done in the future in the north than has been done in the past. I have no doubt that, regardless of some of the biosecurity challenges and the challenges of soils and topography, we will be able to find ways of being able to improve the opportunities for food production in the north generally, including in the electorate of Kennedy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fraser for his first question and congratulate him on his first speech as well. There has been a lot of debate about floating exchange rates or market based exchange rates, particularly given how strong the Australian dollar is. Of course, the Australian dollar reflects the strength of the Australian economy relative to other developed economies. In particular, it reflects very high commodity prices, the highest commodity prices in over 60 years, and it reflects the dynamics of international currency markets. It does make life more difficult for many of our exporters. It makes it difficult for many in agriculture, manufacturing, tourism and education. But of course our economy has benefited greatly from a floating exchange rate over the past 25 years. It has been a very important shock absorber for the Australian economy. It is one of the reasons we have had 20 continuous years of economic growth. No other advanced economy can claim 20 consecutive years of growth. You can see the Reserve Bank today, in its minutes, talking about the beneficial impact on prices at the moment from a strong dollar. A strong dollar has enjoyed bipartisan political support in this House. That has been a good thing, because that is vital for the confidence of global investors and global financial markets. Internationally, we have been a supporter of market based exchange rates. It has been very important that, over the last two years, we have not seen any real outbreak of protectionism, particularly amongst our G20 trading partners. Because, if that were to occur, that would be profoundly damaging to all of our country but particularly to our great exporting regions. There is a debate about how we can get greater flexibility in currency markets going on within the G20, as well as a debate about what other structural reforms must occur in the global economy to rebalance a global economy so we can have sustained growth over time.I think that, as we go forward to the G20 finance ministers meeting this weekend, we would all like to see a commitment to greater flexibility, particularly in currency markets. Because if we do not get that then this debate may descend into another bout of protectionism - the race to the bottom - and I do not think we want to see that. Countries like Australia would be major losers if that were to occur in the global economy. So there is a responsibility as we go forward, particularly through the G20 process, to make sure that the structural reforms that are required in the global economy do come through and of course greater flexibility in exchange rate regimes are a very important part of that.I congratulate the shadow Treasurer for recognising yesterday in this House how important flexible exchange rate regimes are. Unfortunately, the alternative shadow Treasurer does not agree with him. The member for Goldstein advocated direct intervention. Of course, the member for Goldstein would be better served by heeding the remarks of his colleagues rather than seeking - </DOC>

 - I am not sure whether the figures that the Leader of the Opposition is referring to there include urban water as well. If they do, I can assure him that cutbacks to the Murray-Darling Basin have no impact on Warragamba Dam, have no impact on Woronora Dam and have no impact on water pricing generally. With respect to anything dealing with irrigation, I remind the Leader of the Opposition of two things. Firstly, the extent to which any cuts have been floated at the moment are not government policy. Secondly, to the extent that any reductions that would eventually be made through any future sustainable diversion limits are reached through improvements to infrastructure they would have no impact on productivity and the sorts of impacts he was referring to. If you improve the efficiency by which you use the water then you do not have the same impact on price as what has been described there. There are presumptions in the report, which were described just then by the Leader of the Opposition, which lead to the conclusions that he has just reported to the parliament which do not match the policy of this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the Chief Whip for his question and acknowledge from the outset the role he played in the last parliament, from 2008, in arguing very strongly that Australia having an association with the ASEAN defence ministers was most important and arguing for the outcome that we saw last week, the ASEAN-Plus Defence Ministers Meeting. This is a most important strategic development for Australia, which works very well to suit our long-term peace and security interests in our own region, the Asia-Pacific. Australia, of course, has been a longstanding friend and supporter and dialogue partner of ASEAN. This is yet another piece of the ASEAN related architecture which serves and suits Australia's interests very well.In Hanoi last week, in the company of the Chief of Defence Force and the secretary of the department, we attended, for the first occasion, the so-called ASEAN-Plus Defence Ministers Meeting. The 'plus' includes effectively those countries that will be included in the expanded East Asia Summit: the United States, Japan, China, India, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand and Russia. This puts in the peace and security cooperation, in the stability cooperation and in the military and defence cooperation areas all of the key players in our region. It puts into the same room at the same time the capacity for Australia to have a conversation about peace and stability and security in our region, with all the players there at the same time. At the end of this year, we hope, at the East Asia Summit, that the proposed expansion of the East Asia Summit by the ASEAN foreign ministers will be accepted by the East Asia Summit to see a comparable mechanism occur at foreign ministerial and at prime ministerial and presidential level.Australia was asked by the defence-ministers-plus meeting to jointly, with Malaysia, chair an expert working group on maritime security. As an island continent, maritime issues and maritime security are of course very important to Australia - in the traditional sense, in terms of freedom of international sea lanes, but also, regrettably, in the modern sense, for example in relation to the recent development of piracy in our general region. We are very happy to co-chair that expert working group with Malaysia, one of our five-power defence arrangement partners. Of course, the issue of the South China Sea was raised at that meeting, amongst other potential maritime or other territorial disputes, and I repeated, both at the meeting and publicly, Australia's position on that matter. If there are maritime disputes, we want those issues to be resolved amicably and peacefully between the parties concerned, and often there are more than two. We want that resolution to be effected in accordance with international law, the Law of the Sea. From time to time, of course, these disputes, these issues, do raise tensions and concerns in the region, which is why it is appropriate for these matters to be considered regionally, as they may well be in the future, appropriately, in the ASEAN-Plus Defence Ministers Meeting context.I also took the opportunity, in the course of that meeting in Hanoi, to have a number of bilateral meetings with my counterparts, including US Secretary of Defense, Mr Gates. We both agreed on the importance of this development in terms of defence ministers meeting. But he also, as I indicated to the House the other day, underlined the importance in a different context of the forthcoming NATO ISAF Lisbon summit on transition so far as security arrangements are concerned in Afghanistan.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for the question. Obviously, since I answered a similar question from the member for Mayo yesterday and said that due diligence had not yet been completed on a number of these projects, between yesterday and today that remains the case. I can report, though, that some projects have already been completed, including the South Australia Lower Lakes Integrated Pipelines, at $120 million; the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline, in Victoria, at up to $99 million; the $3.2 billion for state priority projects, which focus on improving water efficiency and infrastructure, agreed as part of the Murray-Darling reform agreement in 2008. Obviously, many of these projects -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The project -  - On the project that I referred to: the completion and the way it was funded following the 2007 election were obviously after the change of government, and it was funded within the program, as I am advised. So the fact that funding may have been intended to be done from a different means when the member for Wentworth was the minister does not necessarily change how things were ultimately done when the project was completed following us coming to government. For anyone to subsequently want to argue that projects of that nature are not relevant to the Murray-Darling Basin I think is drawing a very long and sad bow.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calwell for her question. Yesterday the Northern Territory government both received and released the report of the inquiry into their child protection system. The Growing them strong together report does shine the spotlight on their child protection system not coping with the very significant numbers of children who are being neglected and abused. While it is the case, as I am sure all members of this House are aware, that state and territory governments are responsible for their statutory child protection systems, the Australian government will continue to work with the Northern Territory government in the interests of children.We announced yesterday that we will provide additional funding to increase the number of parents on child protection income support; we will provide additional family support services, boost the number of child protection workers, particularly in remote communities; and we will also provide additional funding to strengthen alcohol controls. I am sure it is the case that every single member of this House would agree that one of the most significant responsibilities of any government is to work to protect vulnerable children. No matter where children live, they deserve to grow up happy, healthy and safe.It has been the case that there has been very strong action in the Northern Territory over the last three years. The previous government instigated the Northern Territory Emergency Response and this government has continued that work. We have added an extra $1.2 billion to make sure that we improve the delivery of services in the Northern Territory. - In fact there have been 82 houses built, if you would like to know. Yesterday I released the most recent monitoring report. There is a monitoring report released every six months, and, instead of interjecting and making remarks that are inappropriate in such an important debate, I would suggest that those members who are interested actually read the report and see that there are now additional police on the ground in remote communities which never before had police in their communities. There have of course been tens of thousands of child health checks and specialist follow-up services with doctors and dentists. There are now an extra 140 teachers in schools in remote communities. There are safe houses that have been built and more creches that have been built. Very importantly, we are in the process of putting in place the new income management system which will improve parental responsibility to make sure that welfare payments are spent in the interests of children. Most significantly, for the first time we are introducing the new child protection income management system, which does mean that child protection workers can now refer parents for 70 per cent of income management in cases of neglect. This is the increased support that we are providing to the Northern Territory government. We also recognise that they too made a very substantive response yesterday and will continue to work to make sure that children get the support that they need.</DOC>

 - The question asked by the member for Farrer goes to the importance of works and measures -  - Works and measures, for the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, is when we refer to gaining efficiencies on how efficiently we manage our environmental assets. Too much focus, to some extent, has been exclusively on an argument that says you can only find efficiencies at the irrigation end. If you want to look on farm, you will find that has been the area where people have driven efficiencies the hardest already. Centralised irrigation structures are certainly a good way to go, and that refers to the issues that were raised earlier by the member for Murray in terms of what you are doing there to improve efficiencies. Works and measures says - and this is the reason for the question for Menindee Lakes - as well as how efficient we can be with irrigation, are there ways we can more efficiently manage our environmental assets? To every extent that you can do that you free up more water for productive uses while still delivering the environmental dividend. This government is determined to make sure that for each of these individual projects -  - The member for Dickson describes these as rubbish. - It is terribly sad if we do not look at every possible way of trying to drive efficient use of water so that we can provide security for the environmental assets while still providing the opportunity for food production and strong regional communities. There are discussions between the Commonwealth government and the New South Wales government specific to the Menindee Lakes program. The issue there is not in terms of the quantum of money spent but to make sure that the environmental outcome is delivered.</DOC>

 - 'The greatest environmental challenge of our time.' Those were the words of John Howard on 25 January 2007 at the National Press Club, when he announced in these words: 'The plan I have outlined today is detailed, it is costed, it has been in preparation for some time; it represents a fundamental response to the greatest environmental challenge of our time, and that is of water scarcity.' Those words drive home the fact that the challenges we have in front of us have come forward through a sensible reform that was initiated by the member for Wentworth but is now trying to be spiked by the Leader of the Opposition.In 2007 there was recognition up and down the basin of the dangers of overallocation. There was recognition up and down the basin that the environmental interests and the long-term interests of irrigators were aligned. Whether it is from the algal blooms running up and down the river systems or whether it is from the growth of acid sulphate soils, it was well understood that if you do not have a healthy river it is not just bad environmentally; it is unacceptable for irrigators and unacceptable for the towns and communities that rely on them. That is why decisions were taken for the first time with the support of each side of this House to make sure that we could move towards having a sustainable system in the Murray-Darling. That is why commitments were made to make sure that money was available for infrastructure, for buy-backs and for environmental works and measures and to make sure that Australia no longer continued mistakes that have been made for about 100 years, where one river system was being run as though the state boundaries made a difference to the health of the river system. That is why the former Prime Minister described this as 'the greatest environmental challenge of our time'. And that is why the Leader of the Opposition is not going to get away with wanting to walk away from a commitment that the Murray-Darling Basin needs.</DOC>

 - Last Friday I did exactly what the honourable member described. I went and met with irrigators, as I will continue to do. What I will not do is decide that when an independent authority are conducting consultation on their own independent document it is somehow the time for me to be popping up. In the question reference was made to meetings that I am having with irrigators tonight. I met with the New South Wales Irrigators Council yesterday. More meetings - that have been referred to in the question - are taking place tonight. This is no different to the meetings that have been taking place for as long as I have been a minister in this House and that I have continued since I became the minister for water.The work of the authority has to be conducted independently, but ultimately the document that is called the plan is the one that has the involvement at a ministerial level. So I will be making sure the whole way through that there is a very direct involvement, and the consultation of me being physically out there is how I have done my job the whole time that I have been a minister.In terms of dealing with this draft document let us not forget that there is only one side of parliament in this room that made a commitment to implement the draft plan. Those were the words of the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition has so much confidence in the independence of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority that he was not even willing to wait until we got to the final consultation period. He was not willing to wait for any of that. He was going to take the draft and implement that. We will allow them to conduct their independent consultation -  - and that will not stop me as minister consistently being involved in direct consultation in my role.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Canberra for her first question and commend her on her first speech in the parliament, where she described education as the great transformer. Indeed, it is the conviction of this government that education has the power to shape people's lives for the better. We are committed to making sure that every school in Australia is a great school and that every child in Australia gets a great education. That means that information about school performance and the factors that affect school results should be available to the public. That is a key part of our plan to make sure that education is delivered to all Australians.Those listening will know of the My School website, which has transformed community understanding about school performance and continues to stimulate educational debate. It is a website that has had over 3.6 million visits since it first went up. Last Friday I met with my ministerial colleagues on the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs and the council reaffirmed its support for enhancing the data available on My School from December of this year. Importantly, the enhanced My School website will present financial data for both government and non-government schools. This particular initiative cannot be underestimated. This will be the first time in our country's history that the distribution of resources at the school level will be readily available and transparent to the community. We are committed to ensuring that this financial data is presented in a way that allows fair comparisons between the financial positions of schools. That information will allow parents to understand how well their local schools are funded and, importantly, where those funds are coming from.Financial transparency is important, perhaps not to the coalition given that in the last election they pledged to actually reduce the amount of funding - a cut of nearly $3.2 billion in support for education. In our first four years after coming to power we have spent some $60 billion on education - almost double what the coalition spent in its last four years. Importantly, the enhanced My School website is a part of this government's commitment to providing transparency for parents, for teachers and for others in the community so that they have the information they need to have a greater involvement in their schools. We are giving principals more autonomy, greater independence in how their schools are managed and greater accountability for finances and for education results. This is a genuine education revolution aimed at making sure every Australian child gets the best education that they can and that every Australian school is a great school. - Yes. - </DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. Firstly, it is important to recognise what is being done to remediate the issues that have been experienced with the Home Insulation Program. There are significant safety inspection programs underway in two areas of activity. One is in relation to the former foil insulation that was installed in many homes in Queensland and northern New South Wales. That program is well advanced and is proceeding well and remediating the safety issues that have been experienced along the way. The other program to which the shadow minister refers is the Home Insulation Safety Program, which is inspecting at least 150,000 homes that had non-foil insulation installed within them. I think the latest numbers are in excess of 56,000 homes that have had inspections performed on them. They are being done through contracts entered into by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency.An extensive amount of information has been provided by the government in relation to all the activities, including the investigations of noncompliance of various companies and the programs of inspection themselves. A regular update is provided on the website of the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. Yesterday I and the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency issued a comprehensive statement in relation to the state of play with the remediation of the problems experienced with the Home Insulation Program. The fundamental issue at the core of the shadow minister's question concerns the fact that the inspection program in relation to non-foil forms of insulation that has been installed is targeted. It is targeted according to a risk assessment. It is not, therefore, representative of a random sample of houses across the cohort, if you like, of homes that had non-foil insulation installed. It is targeted. It is not a random sample.The inspection program is only partway completed. We are receiving assistance or have commissioned assistance from the CSIRO in the risk assessment that is being developed to identify the homes to inspect. For example, a poor compliance record is obviously one of the criteria used in targeting organisations for inspections. To release that information would not be representative of experience across the program. What the government proposes to do -  - As I was saying, what the government proposes to do is to continue the safety inspection program on a targeted risk assessment basis, taking the advice of the CSIRO in the process. We are commissioning a firm to assist with the analysis of all the information and develop a final risk assessment when we are further down the track. The issues that I am adverting to are serious ones. It is not, I think, in the public interest that this material be made available at the moment. It is important to get further down the track. What I propose to do, given the insistence of the shadow minister on it, is to give him a private, confidential briefing on progress and the work that is being carried out. It is an offer that is made in sincerity, because the work that is being undertaken is important and it is being undertaken in all sincerity. If he wishes to take that offer up, it would be most welcome, but he would need to take it up on the terms that have been offered.

 - The horrific facts are that one in three Australian women have experienced physical violence and that one in five Australian women will be the victim of sexual assault. These figures mean that each and every year almost half a million Australian women experience physical or sexual violence, yet sadly we know that fewer than one in 10 of these women who experience sexual assault will seek professional assistance and support. We know that the sooner these women can talk to a professional and get that help, that advice, that support, the sooner and the more effectively they can commence their journey to recovery. That is why the government has acted and has launched a new national telephone counselling service, 1800RESPECT, for Australians who have experienced or are in danger of experiencing physical or sexual violence. It is also why I am calling on all members of this parliament to make sure that they can help distribute this information amongst their communities and neighbourhoods, in their local newsletters and the like. We know that for far too long Australians, and particularly those living in rural and remote communities, might not have had access to professional support. They will now have that access as close as their telephones.Importantly, this service is far more than just the referral system which has operated in the past. When an individual calls 1800RESPECT - or, in the old style, 1800737732 - they will have immediate access to a professional counsellor and professional support provided through the truly remarkable staff from the New South Wales Rape Crisis Centre. This free service is now available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and in the coming months we will be expanding the service to include new technologies and to offer online supports as well.The Gillard government have a zero tolerance approach to all forms of violence in our community. We are committed to working in partnership with women's organisations, state and territory governments and the community to deliver a national plan to reduce violence against women and children. However, we know that the best efforts to reduce the occurrence of violence must be coupled with work to deliver justice for victims and to improve the support services which are available in our community. I am sure that all members in this place would agree with the importance of ensuring that Australians have access to these very important support services when they have experienced violence or when they are in danger of experiencing violence. I hope that all members of this House will provide this information to their communities so that we can get support to those who need it most and not let this huge number of Australians continue to suffer in silence.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and remind him that the recent ministerial meeting that I referred to in my earlier answer to the House in fact confirmed that the development of the national curriculum will be continuing as agreed by ministers both previously and at that meeting. I would add, though, that I do not anticipate that this is a process that should be rushed. -  - I make the point that those opposite had a tentative go at a national curriculum and then retreated instantly without any achievement whatsoever. - It certainly is my intention to ensure that, working with state ministerial colleagues, we continue to work robustly on the development of the curriculum and make sure that all of those issues that need to be addressed are addressed in a timely fashion and that a national curriculum is delivered to Australian students, which is a commitment of this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. He has had a longstanding interest in electoral reform and in particular in recent years in looking at the matter of political donations and the like. For the last 25 years this parliament has been the beneficiary of insightful legislation introduced in 1984 that brought the first disclosure of political donations. Over the course of the last 2½ decades, we have seen substantial tightening and increased regulation of political party activity, which has thankfully and thoughtfully kept our parliament at the very leading edge of these measures globally. It has meant that our parliament has never faced the criticism or the accusation that donations to political parties seriously pervert the course of deliberations in this place.But we must be continually vigilant to ensure that our laws and the regulatory environment in which we play are as good as they can be. On two occasions over the past two years the government has introduced a bill designed to increase the transparency of political donations and to reduce the limit from the current over $10,000 for disclosure to $1,000. On both occasions, that legislation passed this place only to be stopped in the Senate. It is because of its knowledge of this parliament that the government, through its commitment to the crossbenchers, will reintroduce the legislation to ensure the $1,000 limit is once again able to be debated in this place. The bill to do that will be introduced in the next few days. That bill will reduce the limit from $10,500 to $1,000.The bill will also prevent donation splitting between different branches of political parties, will ban foreign donations, will ban anonymous donations of over $50 and will increase the timeliness and frequency of donation disclosure. - It will ensure that union donations are disclosed. - It will ensure that disclosure of donations to both sides of politics is observed in the best possible way. It is a fact that donations to political parties are extremely sensitive matters. It is also the reality that the framework that currently supports our Electoral Act and disclosure is a framework that is supported by all sides of this parliament. The best future framework is best constructed by all sides working together to ensure a solid framework for disclosure and to ensure that the reform of party and campaign financing is done in a way that can be supported by the public and that will support the activities of our political parties. I invite members opposite to engage with the government on the improvement of these laws to ensure that disclosure continues to be something that is both the hallmark of our political process and the benchmark for how we wish to be measured in the community. I invite those opposite to support the bill that will be introduced in the next few days and to engage with the government in future discussion on political party donation disclosure and campaign finance reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for what I understand to be his first question, and I congratulate him on his election to this place. He follows in distinguished shoes, after Petro Georgiou's contribution to this House, about which we were talking just yesterday.On his question, obviously, I do not agree with the remarks. Obviously, they are stupid and wrong. I think the member was in the House yesterday when I gave my Prime Minister's statement on Afghanistan. I would refer him to that. That is my view, obviously. It is the view of the Labor Party. If the member wants to research our policy that goes through our national conferences and other places he will find it outlines our view about the conflict in Afghanistan and why Australia is there. As the member would probably be aware, the Labor Party is a large organisation. People join it as individuals. We do not dictate what people think, and neither does the Liberal Party, in my understanding -  - I was making the simple point that the Labor Party is a large organisation and one would expect that there would be individuals in a large organisation who have views that I view as wrong, and I view this view as wrong. However, on the matter of what the member is asking for, I would ask him to contemplate the standard he is setting here. If it is the intention of the Leader of the Opposition to expel every individual from the Liberal Party who makes a stupid statement I will start sending him a weekly list, and presumably Mal Washer is right on the top of it now.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question, which is about an important issue for the future of the country, for the prosperity of every Australian, for the future of health services and for the future of education services. I would suggest that nothing better marks the contrast between the political parties in this parliament than the contrast between her question and the one asked before it. Yes, we are determined to build a prosperous future for this country with world-class infrastructure. Today we are reintroducing into this parliament the legislation that enables the structural separation of Telstra so that we can build the National Broadband Network and give Australia the infrastructure of the future.On the merits of this legislation, the House does not have to take reassurances from me. It can actually turn to the words of the member for Bradfield, Paul Fletcher, who wrote a book called Wired Brown Land? Telstra's Battle for Broadband. He, of course, is now acting as the shadow shadow communications minister, as I understand it. It is a new convention in the opposition that they have shadow shadow everything. The member for Goldstein is the shadow shadow Treasurer. -  - And of course the list goes on. The shadow shadow communications minister, the member for Bradfield, said in his book:My fundamental argument is that we need to get the market structure right first; if we do that, the right technology will follow.Then the member for Bradfield went on to say:_ a market structure in which there are multiple providers of retail telephony and broadband services - and they all operate over the same network on equal terms. For that to happen, none of them must own or control the network. Instead, they must buy services from the owner of the network and in turn the network owner must be restricted to selling services in the wholesale market rather than the retail market.Those are very wise words indeed from the member for Bradfield. Today I would be saying to the Leader of the Opposition -  - The member for Bradfield is trying to insert some more wise words into the debate, and I thank him for his help and contribution. My point, of course, is that we seek expeditious passage of this legislation, because every day that it is delayed is a day of higher prices and fewer services for Australians, particularly Australians in regional areas. I note that representatives of regional areas like the member for Lyne, like the member for New England and like the member for Kennedy have recognised the merits of broadband for regional areas. So to the Leader of the Opposition I simply say: get out a copy of the member for Bradfield's book, have a look at that statement and, in line with that statement, ensure that you do not seek to wreck this reform - and get on with the job of passing this important piece of legislation.</DOC>

As I understand the situation, processing of their refugee claims has been done. Of course, before they would be able to come to Australia there would have to be appropriate security clearances in the normal way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for a very important question. The National Broadband Network is absolutely critical to building a stronger, more modern and more competitive economy. When we came to office broadband speed in this country lagged behind that of 26 other OECD countries. Our internet services at that stage were the fifth most expensive in the OECD. As the Prime Minister was saying before, whenever you go in regional Australia - whether you go to Mackay, to Launceston, to Townsville or to the vast electorate of Kennedy - regional Australians absolutely understand the importance of superfast broadband. They understand the importance of being connected to the national economy and in particular they understand the importance of being connected to the international economy. We are something like 17th out of 31 OECD countries when it comes to penetration, and that is felt particularly acutely in regional Australia.So we do need to strengthen our technological infrastructure through a first-class broadband network as a way to strengthen and broaden our economy. We have extensive research that shows what a boost this will be to GDP. The Centre for International Economics found that it will increase GDP by 1.4 per cent after just five to six years. For business, this means dramatically lower telephone bills and enhanced services, such as high-definition videoconferencing. In all of these areas it certainly means lower business costs, and it means higher employment.Building the National Broadband Network will create something like 25,000 jobs per year. We know that superfast broadband really drives productivity - something like 78 per cent of productivity gains in service businesses and 85 per cent in manufacturing businesses. These sorts of productivity gains can come from this type of information communication technology. And of course it can dramatically enhance workforce participation. We do need to keep up with our major trading partners. Japan and Korea, for example, are way ahead of Australia, and many others are catching up.But of course, all of this is opposed by those opposite. They want to stay with horse-and-buggy communications. They do not want to join the modern era which is going to drive productivity in this economy. We want to build a modern economy, and those opposite simply want to tear it down. Of course, the member for Wentworth was given that job - to tear down this vital productivity-enhancing initiative which is so important to future prosperity in this country. So what we are going to see now is delaying tactics in this House for an initiative which will build our economy for the future, drive our productivity, drive our competitiveness and give us the prosperity that we all seek.</DOC>

 - I know the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, like the Minister for Foreign Affairs, has flown over a lot of countries in the last few days, but Australia is in the same place it was when she left - so, on the basis that Australia is in the same place that it was when she left, we live in the same region. How would you like to define it? 'Asia-Pacific' might be the kind of way that you would define it, I think. Australia has not moved since she left. We will pursue dialogue. But there are formal processes for pursuing this dialogue, including through the Bali process that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has referred to in his various statements. The minister for immigration has also been involved in dialogue in the region. Prior to the parliament commencing its sittings, he was in Dili, he was in Kuala Lumpur and he was in Jakarta pursuing these discussions. So we will work on this dialogue. We are obviously predominantly interested in the countries through which people transit, the most common routes for irregular people movement. You would expect that to be our prime area of interest. But, in terms of working across the region, we obviously want to work broadly with regional partners and neighbours.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The National Broadband Network will be the backbone of our future economy. It will transform our regions, it will drive competition, it will drive productivity and it will drive job creation - the jobs of the new century, the jobs of the future. The bill that I introduced today, the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010, will introduce the structural separation of Telstra, something that should have been done when Telstra was privatised - but there was delay after delay after delay - as is recognised by many opposite now, including the current member for Bradfield. Now this legislation enables it to happen, with significant benefit to consumers. It is a part of the government's comprehensive plan for a truly national broadband network. Over the decade, we saw 19 failed plans from the opposition, none of them complete. We are determined to move on with the job.I am asked why we should not delay. There have been a range of proposals for us to delay this project. Firstly, we were told we had to wait for the ACCC advice. Then we were told we had to wait for the implementation study to be completed. Then we were told we had to wait for the response to the implementation study. We were also told that those opposite were waiting for one of the five separate Senate inquiries that have occurred into the NBN that have produced five separate reports. Now we have more proposals to delay. We are told that we should wait for a seven-month long Productivity Commission inquiry, even though the proponent of this inquiry says that he will not take any notice of whether it gives the rollout the tick or not; he will still continue to oppose it because that is the job that he has been given.We are also being told we need a joint select committee to oversee the rollout of the NBN. So we should not have experts, such as we have got in charge of NBN Co., overseeing the rollout of the NBN; the new development of those opposite is that infrastructure rollouts should be overseen by joint committees. It is a bit like the 'phone a boat' proposal of the Leader of the Opposition when it comes to asylum seekers. The fact is that we have released an implementation study that provides a comprehensive financial analysis. It says that there is a strong and viable business case. It says that there is a sufficient rate of return to cover the cost of funds. It says that there will be positive earnings by year 6. And it says that the cost estimates are conservative. That is why we must get on with the job of building this vital infrastructure, not retreat from it. The only retreat that needs to happen on this issue is a retreat from the wrecking strategy that those opposite have when it comes to the National Broadband Network.</DOC>

 - We are having a very strange day in question time indeed. I regret to inform the member that I do not have committed to memory every page of the budget and every line item in the budget. In the time that I have been in this parliament, possibly the former member for Bradfield might have been able to achieve that feat, but I am not aware of anybody else with that capacity. Obviously, when budget appropriations were done they were done appropriately. As I have said in this parliament before, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship works through -  - I repeat for the member for Mackellar that I do not have committed to memory every page of the budget and every word on every page of the budget. Obviously, the budget deals with appropriations for the department of immigration, and those appropriations are used for detention purposes, including being used for the announcements that have been made most recently. In the announcement made on Monday, there was a net additional spend of $54 million.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. She, I know, is one of the members in North Brisbane who is very pleased with the lead implementation sites that are currently contracted to provide e-health services in three geographic areas across the country: northern Brisbane, the Hunter Valley and in eastern Melbourne. GP Partners in Brisbane have been leading advocates for the benefits of e-health and for the enormous potential, not just when we combine e-health and telehealth in terms of changing Medicare and providing different support for after hours GP services but when we use the power of broadband to ensure that more and more people have access in their own homes. This will also enable teleconferencing and make it possible for GPs and nurses to sit with patients and talk with specialists in the middle of town or perhaps many thousands of kilometres away. Those things will become reality.We have already allocated $20 million worth of investments in those three lead sites. But there is another $55 million that will shortly be available. Expressions of interest will be called for. This will provide benefits for many communities, but particularly for regional communities where there is a great thirst for using new technology and changes and reforms to our health system to deliver better services. These investments and our commitment to introducing an electronic health record, to advances in telehealth and to the National Broadband Network have been widely endorsed. From the health professions, we have the support of the AMA, the Nurses Federation, the College of GPs, the divisions of GPs, pathologists and the Consumer Health Forum. I know that in the audience today there are paramedics, radiologists and others who see this as the opportunity to at last unleash the potential to provide services to our diverse population, many of whom are often enormous distances from places where particular specialised services can be made available. We are determined to make sure that our health system is modernised to make the most of these services and we are determined to make sure that with the implementation and rollout of the National Broadband Network we allow more technology - perhaps technology that we have not even yet imagined - to be developed to provide solutions that meet the needs of the community.Unfortunately, despite the widespread community support for these investments, there is one notable difference. I have been asked about the responses to these investments and, unfortunately, we know that the Liberal Party not only opposed our millions of dollars of investment in e-health but opposed our investments in telehealth and the National Broadband Network. The great potential for what will be available in communities across the country is going to be held back if the Liberal Party is able to get its way and stop these investments.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and obviously his question arises from some publicity in today's newspapers about the minerals resource rent tax. On the direct matter that he raises, I can advise that the Policy Transition Group, which the relevant minister is attending and which is being led by Don Argus, is working its way through a number of issues. That is exactly what it is there for. We have said all along we will credit existing royalties and scheduled increases and the Policy Transition Group will advise on the best way to do that to provide certainty to the industry. Obviously, in implementing the minerals resource rent tax it just makes commonsense that we not give a green light to state and territory governments to increase royalties, with us effectively footing the bill. I would take this opportunity to remind the member - and it is something that ultimately the opposition in this place is going to have to exercise its votes on - that the proceeds of the minerals resource rent tax are going to expand the productive capacity -  - On the question the member has asked me, I have indicated what the answer is and I am simply asking the member and the opposition to also look at the other side of the equation: the reductions in company tax, the growth in national savings and the infrastructure.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for his question. As members know, Australia came through the global financial crisis and the global recession in better shape than any other major developed economy. Our net debt position is a tiny fraction of what it is in major developed economies and we are getting back into surplus well before all of those. While we were putting in place the policies to avoid recession, we were also putting in place the policies to promote the recovery - both at the same time. Absolutely critical were the strict fiscal rules that we outlined in this House early in 2009 - that is, putting in place our two per cent expenditure cap. For example, it is very important in bringing the budget back to surplus, and banking any revenue improvements is also important, but it takes hard work. What that means is that the budget is coming back to surplus in three years, three years early. It means our net debt position is substantially lower than in any other major developed economy at six per cent compared to something like 90 per cent for the other major developed economies. This task and this achievement has been recognised extensively by international agencies. This is what the International Monetary Fund had to say just a couple of weeks ago:_ returning quickly to budget surpluses as the authorities intend will put Australia on firmer footing to deal with future shocks.Then they go on to say of our fiscal consolidation:_ is faster than past consolidations in Australia and plans in most other advanced economies.We had Standard and Poor's make this comment on 24 September:Australia has one of the strongest fiscal positions globally with a net general government debt burden less than half the level of AAA rated countries.It has taken a lot of hard work to do this and it takes more than the effort that we have seen from those on the other side with their $10.6 billion costing con job. You cannot just walk in five minutes before midnight, as the shadow Treasurer did and the shadow finance spokesperson did, and expect that you can be credible. What we have seen is that they ignored the advice of the accounting firm. There was no audit of their costings and they got nine dollars out of 10 of their net saves wrong - nine dollars out of 10 absolutely wrong. - It shows there is no fiscal strategy on that side of the House. - Mr Speaker, I was outlining the importance of a strict fiscal strategy, which the government has implemented with great discipline. At the time that we were dealing with the global recession we put in place strict fiscal rules, but those on the other side of the House do not understand the importance of such a strategy. - I was outlining how important it is to our prosperity that strict fiscal rules are put in place, particularly when it comes to spending, particularly when it comes to banking upward revisions of revenue, and explaining how important it is that those policies need to be seen to be credible, and that a $10.6 billion costing con job, such as those that were put forward during the last election campaign, is completely inappropriate.On the second matter, which I am glad that we have addressed, I congratulate the member for North Sydney for highlighting a point, where he was attempting to raise a supplementary question on a question that had been asked by the other side, and I do thank him for that. But I have to disappoint him that, in my rulings on supplementary questions at this point in time - I repeat 'at this point in time' - that is a bridge too far for me, even though the other jurisdictions that I referred to would have allowed it. In fairness to the member for North Sydney I have given a full explanation. As I said, I have decided that it is a bridge too far to allow it, but it is something that a mature house in other jurisdictions is able to accommodate and maybe sometime down the track, when others besides the Leader of the Opposition and his delegate can ask supplementaries, it is something that we should consider, because it would lead to a much more lively question time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Denison for his question and believe I have good news for him, which is yes, I do commit to keeping the promises at a local level that Labor and Labor candidates made at the last election, including the promises we made in the electorate of Denison. The reason I am able to say that with confidence is that during the election campaign we had a proper process of costing, which means we understood the costs of the promises that we were making. We made proper provision for them and we made proper provision for them in a context where the budget is coming back to surplus in 2012-13 and where across the election campaign our promises were matched by offsetting savings. Consequently I can say yes to the member for Denison with a degree of confidence. Of course, that is in sharp contrast to the circumstance that the opposition found itself in, with an $11 billion black hole -  - and a shadow Treasurer that could not even be bothered looking at the costings. I thank the member for Denison for his question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. The long-term economic future of this country is interdependent with a sustainable environment. You only have to think of the risks to key sectors of our economy, like agriculture, that climate change represents. That is a why the establishment of a carbon price in our economy is needed. It will reduce pollution and help address the challenge of climate change, it will establish certainty for business investments to be made so that investors can understand and properly analyse the returns on an investment over time, it will help drive investment in clean energy, it will create new jobs and it will ensure our future economic competitiveness.A range of leaders in the business community recognise the importance of establishing a carbon price. Mr Graham Bradley, the President of the Business Council of Australia, has indicated that there will:_ inevitably be the need for a market based mechanism that will give us the lowest cost approach to reducing the carbon intensity of our industries.Mr Richard McIndoe, the Managing Director of TRUenergy, has said this:We all would like a price on carbon.Dr Nikki Williams, the Chief Executive of the New South Wales Minerals Council, has said this:The principle of a carbon price is one that the industry supports.None other than the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, said this on 20 May this year, only a number of months ago:Inevitably we'll have a price on carbon _ we'll have to.Admittedly, of course, there has been considerable debate about what form a carbon price should take, but some of the other comments community leaders have made are instructive. One of them said:If you want to put a price on carbon, why not do it with a simple tax? Why not ask motorists to pay more? Why not ask electricity consumers to pay more?That contribution was made by none other than the Leader of the Opposition last year. So he has previously advocated in the media a carbon tax. He also made some comments in relation to emissions trading when he said last year:I think that the science is far from settled but on the insurance principle you are prepared to take reasonable precautions against significant potential risks, and that's I think why it makes sense to have an ETS.Those were the Leader of the Opposition's positions on two different occasions, but neither is the position that we hear now. What we hear now it is rank opportunism and economic irresponsibility. We hear bald slogans and we see empty gestures. He is completely repudiating the national interest of this country with the position he is taking. Mainstream business understands that we need a price on carbon in our economy. That is mainstream business thinking. What we hear from the opposition, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, is all over the place. - They will not act in the national interest, and we call on them to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for North Sydney very much for the question -  - What I can say to the member for North Sydney about the process that is being gone through at the moment is that it is a guide. And because it is a guide for further consultation leading to a draft plan and then leading ultimately to a plan that the minister signs off and brings to the parliament - The member for Dickson then left the chamber. -  Opposition members - He bowed. -  - As I was saying to the member for North Sydney, there is a process - a process on the water act, a process being undergone by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority -  - I am outlining for good reason the process which is in the hands of an independent authority, because it goes to the member for North Sydney's question. What we are intending to do is to have the Murray-Darling Basin Authority go through this proper process. At the same time, the parliament will go through a proper process through the committee led by the member for New England. I understand that the member for North Sydney, inspired by the Leader of the Opposition, may be in the fearmongering business and that he may be wanting to spark a campaign here, but on this side of the House we are determined to work through this complex reform -  -  - We will pursue these reforms. We will pursue them under the relevant legislation guided by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority with the parliamentary committee. There is only one question here: is the opposition seeking to wreck this reform?

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for the question. What needs to be recognised is that what we are trying to achieve, and what we have been trying to achieve since the Water Act was first introduced, is three outcomes: to deliver a healthy river system, to deliver it acknowledging the importance of food production and to deliver strong regional communities. That is the objective. That was the objective when the Water Act was first introduced and this government's determination to reach that objective is there as well. Anyone who saw the National Press Club address today would have seen the comments from the National Irrigators Council, from the National Farmers Federation and from the Australian Conservation Foundation - all agreeing with the importance of those three objectives.Particularly yesterday, following some comments that were made in Senate estimates but also following some comments that were made by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority during its consultation, there was a level of concern and angst both within the parliament and throughout the community generally as to whether or not the act in its current form delivers on those three outcomes. I know the Leader of the Nationals has made comments on it. I know the member for Wentworth verballed me in making comments on it on PM yesterday and in the Herald today - and he knows he has too. But there is a reasonable call for the issue to be clarified. There are two ways to deal with it. You can deal with it in the divisive way of those who have been unfairly, and I think in quite a mean way, describing the member for Wentworth as a roadblock, which I think is the cruelty of the National Party. But what we need to do is to have this issue clarified, because there is actually common ground on the three objectives. There is common ground on those three objectives in communities, through the peak bodies and, I believe, on both sides of this parliament.Last Thursday I sought legal advice on this issue from my department. It has not yet come through. When it does come through, I think it will help inform the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, members of this parliament and the communities that are affected within the basin as to what the requirements of the act are and how the act plays a role in helping us deliver what is referred to as the triple bottom line approach - an approach that acknowledges that everybody needs the environmental outcome. The environmental outcome is important in itself but it is essential for the communities and essential for the irrigators, as is food production, as is having strong regional communities.It is my intention, once that advice is available, to make it available both to the authority and generally. There is an argument going back and forth about what was intended. There are arguments and stories in today's Sydney Morning Herald about divisions within parties and across parties on whether or not the act needs to be changed. My view is: let's have a look at the legal advice. Let's see whether the different views that have been coming from the authority are backed up by the advice itself. Let's acknowledge that the government's triple bottom line approach of all three outcomes is what those in opposition once claimed they sought too when they were in government. It is certainly what the member for Wentworth sought and I hope it is what the Leader of the Opposition is willing to help deliver.</DOC>

 - If the question from the member for Farrer is 'Why didn't I intervene on the authority?' - that is effectively what she is asking, because none of the things that were just referred to could occur without me intervening on the independent authority - the question is about why I was not willing to act contrary to the Water Act. There is a pretty simple answer as to why a minister in the government is not going to act against the law. The authority is independent under the Water Act, which was brought in under the coalition government and which was supported by the member for Farrer. - I find it extraordinary if the argument is that the seeking of legal advice amounts to intervention. If that is the argument, that is absolutely extraordinary. For the benefit of the business that is referred to, and for the decisions that that business is undertaking, can I say this: if the decision is taken in the framework that they do not believe they should be taking any decisions at the moment because there will be water reform, that is a business decision in the context of water reform. If they are making a decision based on a belief that the numbers in the guide are government policy then that is a mistaken belief. The numbers in the guide are not government policy. There is only one side of this chamber that ever promised to implement a draft document, and it was the Leader of the Opposition, during the campaign, who was going to release the draft within two weeks and proceed to implement it immediately. That was never our policy. Our principle has always been that we will implement the final plan. The final plan will be brought down after there has been an opportunity for direct ministerial involvement, and that is the way the act is constructed. That is the way we will operate. Anybody presuming that the guide somehow represents a final landing point misunderstands the intention of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and also certainly misrepresents where the government is at.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby on asking his first question. I congratulate him on his first question and on his first speech, which was a very fine speech. I am asked about the role of trade in generating economic growth and jobs in this country and also about the place of the Doha Round in all of that. The best estimates are that one in seven Australians is engaged in an industry that is involved in exports from this country. My own view is that the total benefit of exports from this country is far greater because, obviously, there are industries that supply our export industries. Even so, one in seven is a very important contribution. Our future continues to be as a trading nation, a nation that therefore through exports is able to generate high-skill, high-wage, high-quality jobs. That is why trade is so important to this country.I would like to acknowledge the wonderful contribution of my predecessor as Minister for Trade, the member for Hotham, for his untiring efforts in seeking to improve market access for Australian exporters. I will not attribute this result entirely to the previous Minister for Trade, but I will point out that we have now had five successive monthly trade surpluses, the most recent one being the third biggest surplus on record. That came as a big turnaround on 76 successive monthly trade deficits under the previous coalition government. I will not blame the coalition for every one of those 76 trade deficits, but of course I would suggest that a majority of them would be the coalition's fault.What has happened since the beginning of that very long run of trade deficits is that the mining industry has now produced a lot more minerals, following investment. But our whole story is not a mining story. Do you know that 54 per cent of our exports are non-mining exports and that during the teeth of the deepest global recession since the Great Depression there has been a growth in service economy exports of an average of 4.6 per cent per annum? I think that is a pretty good effort for our service economy exporters. They still account for only 22 per cent of our exports, but again the former Minister for Trade has been very influential in lifting the profile of our service economy exports and also of our manufactured exports.As to the future, we believe that there is reason for some optimism about the restarting of the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations that stalled in mid-2008. I have been to the United States - for the benefit of the member for Curtin, that is a big country to the far north-east of Australia - and the Doha Round opens up the possibility of much improved market access not only for our manufacturers but importantly for those service economy exports. It seems, as a result of discussions I had with the administration in the United States, that the US is keen to restart these stalled negotiations by augmenting the existing offers from 2008 with a very substantial services package. That would be good for Australia. This government will continue to work tirelessly on those multilateral trade negotiations, on our regional negotiations and on our bilateral negotiations.

I would say to the member that if there is a specific constituent matter that he wants to raise either directly with me or with the relevant minister then I am happy to respond to it. On the Home Insulation Program in general, the member would probably be aware that there is an inspection regime. There is a telephone number that people can ring to get an inspection. Obviously, inspections are proceeding on a risk basis, so there is a way of working through. I am keen, if the member has a specific matter or constituent issue on his mind, to see the full details of it and then I will give him a detailed response.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. I am pleased to be able to report that there have been improvements in housing for Indigenous people in remote communities in the Northern Territory. This is important for many reasons, not the least of which is the reason highlighted by the most recent inquiry into child protection in the Northern Territory that was released last Monday. That report highlighted the role that overcrowded housing plays in the impact on family wellbeing. I think all of us would be aware that decent housing is vital if we are to see a safe environment in which children can grow up.Our housing program in the Northern Territory is now on track to deliver 750 new homes, 230 rebuilds of homes and 2½ thousand refurbishments of homes by 2013, and all of that in remote communities in the Northern Territory. We did in fact exceed our target for the most recent financial year and, as at 11 October 2010, 82 new houses had been completed, and we have 101 houses under construction, in remote communities in the Northern Territory. Six hundred and forty-five refurbishments and rebuilds of houses have been completed and another 105 refurbishments and rebuilds are under way.One of the other important parts of this program is our effort to build a strong Indigenous workforce. We have around 300 Indigenous people currently employed in this housing program - around 30 per cent of the housing workforce in these remote communities is Indigenous, well above our 20 per cent commitment. We have now got the program management costs down to eight per cent, which is a significant improvement. There are now independent assessments that show that this program is well on track. We do of course understand that we have got an enormous amount more to do in remote Indigenous housing, both in the Northern Territory and in other parts of remote Australia. We have made a very, very significant financial commitment to address that need and we intend to get on with the job.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question, which I believe may be her first. What I can say to her is that I presume she is referring to the sample that was referred to in the Auditor-General's report. What I would say to her about that sample is that it was a sample that was risk based, so it is not an accurate sample of the program overall. The figure is not necessary representative of all installations, so consequently the government have determined that we will not be providing a running commentary on the results of the inspections today because that data would not be helpful because of the risk profile. An expert -  - The Leader of the Opposition was clearly not listening. It is not a representative sample of the program overall. What we will do of course is continue to work through, providing inspections to households. They are being provided on a risk basis. There is a number that people can call and obviously all foil is being inspected. At the end of those processes we will obviously be in a different position in relation to information than we are now where the data that the member refers to is not a representative sample overall.</DOC>

 - Can I thank the member for Blair for his question. This is a very important project. I recently visited RAAF Base Amberley with the member and we were briefed by Wing Commander Murray 'Dog' Jones about this project. Earlier this year, the RAAF took delivery of the first 11 Super Hornets, and I can advise the House that three more are scheduled to arrive later this year. Ten more are due over the course of next year. All will be based at Amberley. These are state-of-the-art fighter planes and a step from on the current classic Hornets.All three of the aircraft on their way will be wired with the potential to be converted in the future into Growlers. Growlers would give us the ability to jam the electronics systems of enemy aircraft and land based radars and communications systems. Twelve Super Hornets will be wired in this way and this will provide future governments with the option to add this capability in the future.I can also advise the House that testing is now complete on a new glide missile the Super Hornets will carry called the Joint Standoff Weapon C. It can glide for up to 100 kilometres and destroy targets like concrete walls and bunkers with pinpoint accuracy. Testing over the last two months at the Woomera test range has been successful. This means that the Super Hornets are on track to become operational later this year.A lot of credit for this must go to the former Minister for Defence, Brendan Nelson. The Super Hornets would not be in Australia if not for the decision that he made. Credit should also go to the member for Hunter, the Chief Government Whip, who was the driving force behind the decision to wire 12 of the Super Hornets with the potential to be converted to Growlers in the future, and to the former Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner, and former Minister for Defence Materiel, now the Minister for Climate Change, who have overseen the delivery of the Super Hornets on time and under budget. This project is an important part of delivering the defence capability we need and there are a lot of defence personnel working with industry and the US Navy to make sure it is a success.The arrival of the Super Hornets marks an important transition for the RAAF. The final F111 squadron will be decommissioned later this year after four decades of service. On 2 December, the RAAF will be holding a decommissioning parade at Amberley, and the next day the F111s will do their final fly-past and the last of their signature 'dump-and-burns'. There will be many more people to recognise that week, as we mark the end of one chapter of Australia's military aviation history and start another with the arrival of the Super Hornets.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The answer to the last part of his question is no, we will not be committing to a judicial inquiry. The reason is that we have been totally transparent in the way in which the funding for this program has been used.I was asked the other day a similar question by the member for Fairfax as to whether I was aware of a similar complaint to this. Can I just make this point so that there is no misunderstanding from the other side. There is a process in place in which, if there are complaints, those complaints can be referred, and it is called the Orgill committee. It has open terms of reference that enable all of these issues to be dealt with so that we can not only determine whether there is value for money but address the problems. My point to both of those members and anyone seeking to ask is that I would urge them in future to ask themselves the question: has this complaint been referred to the Orgill committee, and have they pursued it through a process that we have set up to address these issues? Have they referred it? Because, as it turns out, the complaint of the member for Fairfax has not been referred to the Orgill committee.So do not come in here and moralise about committees of inquiry if you are not even prepared to use the process that exists now. Use the process; that is what it is there for. We have been addressing the problems in the past. If all you want to do is come in here and raise points of order or issues that have been raised in the newspaper, you are not servicing your electorates properly. -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fowler for his question and his ongoing interest in these very important matters. In December 2008, a federal government for the very first time decided to ensure that we properly and appropriately recognised serious and organised crime as a matter of national security. In November last year, the government - that is, the Attorney and I - launched and created the Organised Crime Strategic Framework, and in February this year we enacted legislation that went to serious and organised crime, empowering our law enforcement agencies to combat serious organised syndicates.It is estimated that serious and organised crime costs this country anywhere between $10 billion and $15 billion each and every year. It is a great challenge for all governments of this country and indeed all local enforcement and intelligence domestic agencies around the nation. With this in mind, I congratulate the Australian Federal Police and Customs and Border Protection on last week seizing almost half a tonne of cocaine, the third-largest cocaine haul in Australia's history - 464 kilograms of cocaine, with an estimated street value of $160 million. This complex operation required careful planning and coordination between not only the AFP and Customs and Border Protection but also the New South Wales and Queensland police. I would like to take this opportunity to pay special tribute to the agencies in my portfolio for the outstanding role they played in this very significant drug bust. Three men were charged and 12 search warrants were executed across New South Wales and Queensland, uncovering - I am advised - a clandestine drug laboratory at Eden, in New South Wales. This is coupled with the seizure of 240 kilograms of cocaine in June this year. Our law enforcement agencies are working very hard to combat serious and organised crime.The other important element of this operation is that this matter might not have been triggered if it were not for the good cooperation, the very close cooperation, we have with law enforcement agencies in other countries. Indeed, the US Drug Enforcement Administration referred this matter to the Australian Federal Police, which from that point allowed the operation to ensue and which has led to the success to date.Organised criminals and drug traffickers in this country are on notice that our agencies are working very hard to combat serious and organised crime. As I have said before, we know that money is the lifeblood of organised crime. We know that illicit drug trafficking is the primary source of that income, so we need to follow the money. We need to stem the money flow to those organisations. If we do that more effectively, we will manage to land serious blows against organised crime in this country and indeed in countries that we work very closely with. This is a high priority of this government. We will continue to work very closely with other governments of this nation and other governments in the region and around the world to combat this very serious issue.</DOC>

 - My colleagues are assisting me by reminding me how extraordinary it is to get this question from the Leader of the Opposition, given his statements on accuracy and truthfulness during the lead-up to the election campaign. Putting that to one side, the answer to the member's question is this - and it is exactly the same answer as I gave yesterday: the government is working through with its policy transition group. Don Argus, of course, is leading that. The minister is working alongside Don Argus. On the issue that the Leader of the Opposition is referring to, about the treatment of state royalties, the implementation of the arrangements is being worked through in the policy transition group. We will keep working through to deliver the legislation as promised to this parliament.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for that very important question. Members may not be aware, but Australia is entering its 20th continuous year of economic growth. That is not something that can be said about other advanced economies. This is a very substantial achievement. This very substantial achievement has been built on 25 years of economic reform. It has been built on a floating dollar, a deregulated banking sector and the independence of the Reserve Bank when it comes to monetary policy. Of course, it was this framework, along with the government's timely stimulus, that did so much to support growth in this economy and to make sure that Australia, unlike many other developed economies, avoided recession. So this consensus has been very important. It has been very important to domestic confidence. It has been very important to international confidence.In the last week it has been challenged on two occasions. We had the member for Goldstein suggesting that we should be fixing the dollar and today we have had the member for North Sydney arguing for the removal of the Reserve Bank's independence for re-regulating interest rates. These two initiatives from those opposite are a grave challenge to the foundations of that economic model which has delivered 20 years of continuous economic growth. I think even John Howard or Peter Costello, for all their faults, would wince at the statements today from the member for North Sydney, because they risk fracturing that economic consensus that has been so important to confidence domestically and confidence in the international economy. It is an attack upon the very pillars of our prosperity and therefore an attack on prosperity itself.It is the case that we do need an informed debate about these matters, and the government welcomes a debate about all of these matters. The first principle is the independence of the Reserve Bank, no matter how uncomfortable that may be for any of us from time to time. The Reserve Bank has made it very clear that net interest margins are back to their pre-crisis level, and I have indeed made it very clear on a number of occasions. The Reserve Bank observed this in their Financial stability review, and I have remarked publicly about that. It was observed again in the Reserve Bank board minutes. So I say again: there is no justification for any bank to move over and above any rise that is delivered by the Reserve Bank in the cycle, not that I am speculating about their decisions. But what we do know is that the action that has been put forward today by the member for North Sydney is a challenge to the independence of the Reserve Bank. He is turning his back on 20 years of economic reform.What Australians want is concrete action, not populist rhetoric. That is why we on this side of the House have put in place some essential reforms - a very big investment in AAA rated residential mortgage backed securities, for example, to give a flow of funds to the smaller lenders to challenge the bigger banks. That has been very important. Then there are the new credit laws, which will challenge unfair charges from banks when people exit mortgages. These are all very, very important reforms and they are part of responsible economic management - the responsible economic management that saw Australia avoid a recession, that saw Australia generate a very significant -

 - I thank the member for his question. It goes to government advertising. As all members in this place and as people paying attention to this issue will know, government advertising in recent years from the grotesque record of over $250 million worth of advertising to support Work Choices -  - I thank the Speaker. The grotesque levels of spending that were observed by all Australians in 2007 have been wound back substantially by the current government - in fact, more than cut in half. The question goes particularly to television advertising, which the member has seen. I do not believe that it is necessary for all advertising campaigns to be the subject of public announcements by me as the Special Minister of State. They should and do, however, go through due process. It is important that the House note that this particular advertising campaign did go through that process and was duly, properly and appropriately recommended to go forward on the basis that it was a properly constructed public information campaign to provide information at a cost which is a small fraction of the grotesque $250 million Work Choices campaign funded by members opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for that very important question. There has been a range of commentary in recent days about monetary policy and banking regulation. The shadow Treasurer made his views well known this morning: he wants to re-regulate interest rates and wants to take punitive action against banks, and if we will not do so then the parliament should. Those were the words that he used this morning.There has been a range of commentary today. The member for Cook was asked about this. He was asked what action should be taken. He said, 'An infinite number of measures.' But he could not name a single one. That was the member for Cook. The member for Mayo was asked about this, and he said, 'I'll let Joe Hockey talk about what, what, what we'll do.' That was the response of the member for Mayo. But you can always count on the member for Wentworth. He has been out there a lot: the Turnbull wing of the Liberal Party. He was out there today and was asked about this very important commentary. - The member for Wentworth was asked about it this morning and he had this to say about monetary policy: 'Any precedent for the federal parliament regulating interest rates? You really should speak to Joe about that.' The member for North Sydney went out and compounded it. A journalist said, 'You've been a bit unclear about what you're saying should be done.' This is what the member for North Sydney said: 'Well, look, I'm not going to be specific, because I'm not fully aware of exactly what the banks are asking for.' These people have lost the plot. The final word on monetary policy goes to the member for Canning. He was asked about this, and this is what he said about this commentary. - Thank you, Mr Speaker, because the member for Canning was commenting on monetary policy this morning, and he was asked about the member for North Sydney's views on monetary policy. - And this is what he said about those views:_ just another one of their lunatic-fringe type ideas _ -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. It does pain me to say it, but I could not agree more with the member for Canning.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. I know that she is frequently out in her community talking to people about what is on their mind and finding that the response is the pressure of the cost of living, making the family budget add up. These are the things that are talked about by families around the dinner table.The government understands this. Government members understand this. We also know that the best way of assisting families to meet cost-of-living pressures is to ensure that people have the opportunity to get a job - to have a job, to have the benefits and dignity of work. That is why the government was so focused on supporting jobs during the global financial crisis. I note that the Benevolent Society this week released a report about the wellbeing of children. They said:The government's stimulus package helped us avoid significant unemployment, and that can only be terrific for families and children.The same instincts that drove us to do what we could to support jobs during the global financial crisis are driving us now to assist families with cost-of-living pressures, particularly meeting the costs of supporting children. That is why we have reduced taxation so that someone on an income of $80,000 is paying $1,550 less tax than they were in 2007-08. That is an extra $1,550 in the family budget.And of course - and congratulations go to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs - next year sees the start of Australia's first Paid Parental Leave scheme to help families manage the pressures at the time of the birth of a child. Around 148,000 new parents will be eligible to receive 18 weeks paid parental leave paid at the minimum wage, which is currently around $570 a week. We have also increased support for families that have childcare costs, increasing the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, covering out-of-pocket costs of up to $7,500 per child. From 1 July next year, that rebate will be able to be paid fortnightly. We have introduced the education tax refund, now enabling families to claim up to 50 per cent of the costs for primary school kids, up to $390 per year, and for secondary students, up to $779 a year. From 1 July next year, school uniforms will be part of the costs that can be claimed for.We also have our Medicare Teen Dental Plan, which is providing a voucher to help families get eligible teenagers a preventative dental check. Since its implementation on 1 July 2008, the Medicare Teen Dental Plan has provided for over 680,000 teenagers to receive a preventative dental check. Of course, we will be implementing our election promise to increase the family tax benefit part A for teenagers aged 16 to 18 years. This is important because we understand that the costs of children do not go down when children turn 16, and we want to assist families to keep kids in school and associated with learning and education. The government understand the pressures that families face, and we will continue to take responsible action to strengthen our economy and to assist families with those pressures.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his question, which I believe to be his first question. I say to the member for Hasluck that, in terms of supporting families with cost-of-living pressures, I refer to my last answer and to the new measures that the government has taken in the last few years and the new measures that it has committed to during the election to assist families with cost-of-living pressures - measures like the family tax benefit change for teenagers that I referred to, because we do not believe the costs of kids go down when they turn 16; measures like the childcare tax rebate being available fortnightly; measures like school uniforms being eligible for the education tax rebate. We believe these are important in supporting families with cost-of-living pressures. I understand -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I think the member for Hasluck has learnt about taking advice from the member for Sturt. - Coming to the question of a carbon price and electricity prices, which the member asked about, I have obviously addressed questions of assistance with cost-of-living pressures. We understand that it is tough for people. On the question of pricing carbon, of tackling climate change, I believe Australians want the people in this place to try and work together to tackle this issue in good faith, which is exactly what the government is trying to do through the creation of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. Of course, there is the option that, if the Leader of the Opposition diverts from his strategy of wrecking and looks to real reform, the opposition can participate in that committee and make a positive contribution to this nation tackling climate change.I understand that the member for Hasluck, coming from Western Australia, would be genuinely concerned about electricity prices, because I know that there is a very big debate in Western Australia about increasing electricity prices and the pressures on families. As the member for Hasluck would be well aware, that is because of actions of the Liberal state government there in relation to electricity pricing. I want to quote the Western Australian Premier on what has caused him to take this action and what is putting pressure on electricity prices, because I believe the member for Hasluck may be interested in the insights of his Western Australian colleague, who says:These increases have been coming for some time and, at the end of the day, I guess you know, we have to have a situation where the electricity industry pays its own way.And, in relation to the circumstances in WA about which his government made decisions, Premier Barnett goes on to say, 'And all of us for a whole set of reasons, a whole host of factors, are going to cop higher electricity prices.' He says:We also, as a community, tend to use a lot more electricity than we did in previous times, so that is part of it.That is Premier Barnett on electricity price decisions of the Liberal government in Western Australia. I refer the member for Hasluck to those words, which obviously are about the need to reinvest in electricity generation. So, when it comes to cost pressures on working families, I understand that he wants to raise questions in this place; he may also want to raise questions with his WA Liberal colleagues.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. Tonight I am leaving for the G20 finance ministers meeting in Korea which will undertake very important work as a prelude to the G20 leaders summit in Seoul in a few weeks time. This is important because it was through the work of the G20 over the last couple of years that the global economy avoided a global depression. So the G20 did do very important things in putting in place stimulus across the global economy to support jobs, something that is not appreciated by those opposite. But what we and all those finance ministers and leaders who go to the G20 know is that there are difficult times ahead. There are hard and difficult reforms that must be put in place across the global economy to ensure that growth is stronger and more sustainable, so the meeting this weekend will talk about the G20 framework for strong, balanced and sustainable growth.There will be a discussion in that context about, for example, exchange rates - which we have been talking about here - and other things as well. The reform of the International Monetary Fund is very important to make the International Monetary Fund more representative of the global economy, particularly the growing economies in Asia. That will be very important, as will the discussion about a new international framework for financial regulation, which is very important for this country and very important for the global economy.Global engagement in this context is important. It was very important in ensuring that Australia made it through the last couple of years without going into recession, and it will be very important as we go forward because, as the International Monetary Fund has already pointed out, the global outlook is uncertain and the risk is still very much on the downside. We on this side of the House understand the importance of maintaining a credible and consistent macroeconomic policy, even if those opposite do not. Even if those opposite want to rip up the economic consensus that has been so important to this economy, we will move forward with a credible policy for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question, which I understand is her first question in this parliament. I say in answer to her question that there are a number of asserted facts in it which are simply not the case. I understand that the member may not have researched all of those matters herself, but can I say to the member that the government is pursuing dialogue with East Timor on the question of a regional protection framework and regional processing centre. As I have had cause to say in the parliament this week on a number of other occasions, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship was in Dili, in Jakarta and in Kuala Lumpur pursuing discussion as recently as last week.On the question of detention centre capacity, the government has made a series of announcements. We wanted to provide transparency and certainty to Australians and to communities. We were well aware that there were fear campaigns being whipped up in various parts of the country. I certainly do not suggest that was being done by the member who asked the question, but it was being done, and consequently we wanted to clarify the government's long-term intentions in relation to detention centres.We also made what I believe is an important announcement about the treatment of children and families, and it is still not clear to me what the Leader of the Opposition's position is on that announcement. On some occasions, he has said that it is the work of the Howard government and sought to claim credit for it; on other occasions, he has repudiated it, saying that it would somehow exacerbate problems. At some point he will have to pick between the two. -  - The question made assertions about dialogue with East Timor and the regional processing centre, and I have answered them. The question made assertions about the government's detention policies, and I have answered them. The question also made assertions about dealing with unauthorised arrivals, and I say to the member, as I had cause to say in the parliament earlier this year, that this is a complex problem. I do not believe in three-word slogans, I do not believe in boat phone and I do not believe in the Prime Minister of the nation pretending that he or she is in a better position than a patrol boat commander to deal with a situation at sea. What I do believe in is working through dialogue on a regional protection framework and regional processing centre, and the government is doing precisely that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and his ongoing interest in the whole area of infrastructure development but particularly the National Broadband Network. Just this week the broadband quality survey has found that Australia has actually fallen from 18th to 21st in world broadband rankings. We know that innovation in information and communication technology is the single biggest driver of productivity in our economy. Some 78 per cent of gains in services productivity are a direct result of ICT and 85 per cent of improvements in productivity in manufacturing are a direct result of ICT. We know in fact, and should be ashamed of the fact, that of the world's top 100 cities when it comes to broadband speeds there are no Australian cities in that list - not one in the top 100. That is the legacy that this government inherited from the 18 failed plans of the former government.So it has been identified very clearly what the problems are. However, I am asked also whether there is wide recognition of that, and of course the member for Wentworth is one person who argued today on Fran Kelly's program: 'The NBN is an answer to a problem that has not even been identified.' It has not even been identified! It has not been identified by them. We know what all the problems are and we know about the benefits, but the member for Wentworth does not seem to address that. We know about the benefits for productivity. We know about the benefit of 25,000 jobs a year on average. We know about the benefits for consumers - the benefits in education, the benefits in health, the benefits in tackling urban congestion - but this is what we have from the shadow minister. It is a bit like the 'What have the Romans ever done for us?' scene from Monty Python. What are the benefits of national broadband technology? Well, apart from transport benefits, education, health, productivity and jobs, there are none - none whatsoever! That is the attitude of the wreckers opposite. But I wonder whether -  - We on this side of the House have identified - along with the business community, along with people in regional Australia, along with people in our cities - what the benefits of the National Broadband Network are. We are determined to do something about it. It would be interesting to know whether the comments of the shadow minister were actually authorised or whether perhaps they were like the comments of the shadow Treasurer, because we have had no questions from him either. Quite clearly they are just going rogue.</DOC>

 - Well, that is not what I have said, and I have made it very clear. I have made a number of things very clear and I will just very clearly go through them. I have made it very clear that there is no justification on the part of any of the major banks in the current circumstances to go for an out of cycle rate rise, should the Reserve Bank at some future stage take a decision to put up the cash rate. Of course, those over there like to go around pretending that somehow the Reserve Bank is not independent. The Reserve Bank is independent and it will take its decisions separately from the government.What we have done, because we have been concerned about competition in the banking sector, is a couple of very significant things. The first thing that we have done is make a very significant investment in AAA rated residential mortgage backed securities. Why is that important? It is very important because one of the unfortunate consequences of the global financial crisis and the global recession, which those opposite do not think ever happened, was further concentration in our banking sector. That was an unfortunate consequence of the global financial crisis. Of course, when we were dealing with that those opposite were in here opposing the bank guarantee, something that was absolutely fundamental, particularly to the viability and the standing of our smaller lenders. It was absolutely critical to seeing the flow of credit through credit unions and other smaller lenders during the global financial crisis, and they came into this House and opposed us every inch of the way.The member for Wentworth led that charge, and he did it with Godwin Grech. We have got the whole history of their connivance against the bank guarantee revealed to us by Godwin Grech and his relationship with the member for Wentworth. We have put in place additional measures to ensure there is more competition in the sector because of the global financial crisis. Therefore, our investment in residential mortgage backed securities is critical.</DOC>

 - Fairness for workers is important. It is important to their families and it is also important to the economy. So far as families are concerned, it is important to ensure that their rights are protected in the workplace: the right to collectively bargain and the requirement for employers to bargain in good faith. Also, the safety nets that we have introduced are important for their security. As for the importance to the economy, since we changed the previously unfair Work Choices arrangements we have seen productivity increase in the economy, real wages go up, an increase in jobs - 600,000 of them created since we have been in office - a fall in industrial disputes and an assessment by Access Economics that the changes that we made to the unfair Work Choices legislation would reap benefits of $4.8 billion in savings to the Australian economy over the course of the next decade.I am also asked if there are any challenges to this. I have to ask myself, 'Why would you challenge a framework that delivered those sorts of outcomes?' But those on the other side do challenge it. The coalition has basically committed, through statements today and earlier this month, to return this country to Work Choices, were they to get back into office. Remember that during the election campaign the Leader of the Opposition, when questioned about returning to Work Choices, said it was 'dead, buried and cremated'. He even had to put it in writing on the Neil Mitchell program, because he told us that you could not believe a thing he said unless it was included in writing. - I was asked about the challenges, and the challenge comes from the other side of the parliament. Dead, buried and cremated, we have got the exhumation party out - the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister. -  - The challenge to Australia if Work Choices returns is this: a cut to conditions in the workplace, a freeze on pay - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I know this is an issue that he has raised consistently in this parliament and beyond and has campaigned on, and it is one of key concern to the community that he represents in this parliament. I say to the member who has raised this question that I can very much commit to him that the government is committed to duplicating the Pacific Highway by 2016. I would note for the member and for other members of the House who are interested in this question that the government is investing more than twice as much funding in half the time as the previous government. We are investing $3.1 billion over six years -  -  - I am sure the members interjecting would acknowledge that that is the largest investment in a single road. This compares to a track record over 12 years in office of an investment of $1.3 million. So investments and financial allocations are being made and being made quickly.This level of investment is actually showing progress and work. As the member is probably aware, right now today we have more than 1,000 workers on site at various parts of the road working on various bypasses and upgrades to make a difference to people who use the road. We have brought forward $35 million to accelerate planning work between Port Macquarie and Kempsey to get that section shovel ready. We will continue making this work a key priority in the next funding program and we will deliver the Pacific Highway by 2016.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Reid for his question and I acknowledge his strong and continuing commitment to the Catholic Church and of course that of so many other members of the House, including the member for Menzies and the Leader of the Opposition, among others. The canonisation of Mary MacKillop was an occasion of great joy for the entire Australian Catholic community, and Catholic pilgrims gathered in great numbers in St Peter's Square for the canonisation ceremony. In fact, Mary MacKillop must have been a woman of extraordinary virtue and significance given her ability to bring together a unity ticket on the part of myself, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and Barnaby Joyce. For those who doubt the possibility of miracles, I offer that as a piece of evidence to the contrary!The canonisation ceremony in St Peter's Square was cause for enormous celebration for the 10,000 or so Australian pilgrims who were present. In fact we could hear across St Peter's Square that ancient Australian Gregorian chant, 'Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, oi, oi, oi,' which left the entire square bemused except those of us who knew what it meant. The ceremony itself was supported by a bipartisan agreement between opposition and government to provide a $1.5 million support payment to the Sisters of St Joseph and the Mary MacKillop Foundation. In part these funds were drawn upon to provide support for 20 or so young Australians and 20 or so Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians to go to Rome to participate in the events in St Peter's Square.Together the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and I opened the exhibition at the Vatican Museum, entitled 'Rituals of life'. This was an extraordinary exhibition, bringing together artefacts and artworks from across Aboriginal communities sent first to the Vatican in 1928 and not seen since. This was a remarkable exhibition and our thanks go to the Vatican Museum for their assistance. Together the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and I also attended the canonisation ceremony itself and the celebratory mass at St Paul's beyond the walls the following day.Also, it was my great privilege to open the chancery of the first resident Australian mission to the Holy See, led capably by Australia's first resident Ambassador to the Holy See, Tim Fischer. Tim Fischer is doing a first-class job for Australia. He is a first-class ambassador. In fact, his Akubra is now almost as recognised as the helmets of the Swiss Guards as it is the subject of much comment by those who frequent St Peter's Square.Many Australians have asked, 'Why do we have a resident mission to the Holy See?' The first reason is that there are 77 other states that do so as well - most major powers and certainly most middle powers do - and, secondly, we work with the Holy See on a range of important policy areas: religious freedom, interfaith dialogue, food security, disarmament and such matters across the global agenda. But on this occasion we were there to support, as an official delegation, the canonisation of Mary MacKillop. The Sisters of St Joseph led by Sister Anne Derwin deserve particular recognition, as does the leadership of the Catholic church under Cardinal Pell and his archbishops. This was a celebration of an extraordinary Australian woman's life and, whatever people's religious beliefs might be, a cause for celebration for the Australian nation.

 - I thank the member for his question. I have seen the media report about Mr Rice and his medals that the member refers to today. I would like to place on record the nation's thanks for his service. I have also sought advice from Defence on the policy of replacing service medals, but the policy is very clear that this is generally limited to circumstances of loss or theft. That policy is aimed at ensuring we do not debase the value of service medals awarded to Defence Force personnel. I am advised that that policy has wide support in the ex-service community.On the question of Green Loans and the issue involving Mr Rice, I will ask Minister Combet to ensure - through his parliamentary secretary, who has direct oversight of the matter - that any outstanding issue of Mr Rice's involvement with the Green Loans program receives appropriate consideration.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question and his contribution to policy development in this area. This morning the Prime Minister and I and heads of our national security and law enforcement agencies attended the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation to announce the establishment of the Counter Terrorism Control Centre. This morning the Prime Minister made special mention of the work of the staff, their dedication and the fact that on a daily basis they protect the safety and security of Australians. Of course, the very nature of their work is such that they receive little public recognition.In the course of the presentation, the Director General of Security advised of the threat to Australians and Australian interests from a possible terrorist event. It was a reference to the fact that over a hundred Australians have lost their lives during the past decade. As recently as last year, three Australians lost their lives in the Marriott bombing, and we all remember vividly the 2002 Bali bombings where 88 Australians lost their lives. Reference was made to the success that our agencies are having - a number of disruptions, arrests, charges and a number of prosecutions - but the advice was that we cannot rest on our laurels. We need to review processes, we need to learn from Australian experience and we need to learn from overseas experience. In that context, special mention was made of last Christmas Day's attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines flight 253 and how that revealed how crucial it was for agencies to share information, their expertise, their capability and their experience.That is precisely what we are doing with the Counter Terrorism Control Centre. It will play the lead role in strengthening the combined capability of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies. It will set and manage priorities, it will identify intelligence requirements and it will, importantly, harmonise the collection and distribution of that vital intelligence. In that sense, it will play a very important role in supporting the established role of federal, state and territory law enforcement agencies. The centre itself will be hosted at the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, but it will include officers from the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate. Its approach will be one of flexibility but focused. Each of those agencies will be able to draw on their own expertise but bring it back to the table of the partnership created by the Counter Terrorism Control Centre.The creation of the centre will unquestionably improve the ability of our national security and policing agencies to detect and prevent a terrorist event. It will be a significant enhancement of Australia's counterterrorism capability, and I thank the Prime Minister once again for attending to open the centre.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I advise the member that, in terms of the home insulation program she refers to, obviously the government has worked through a set of arrangements to deal with compensation. If she has an individual example she wants to raise with the relevant minister or through his parliamentary secretary then she is obviously able to do that.More broadly, can I say to the member that the government is delivering its election commitments. We will deliver our commitments, as I outlined today, to assist families with the cost of living. We will deliver our education revolution commitments to make sure that after long, long years of neglect every child in every school gets a great education. We will deliver our health policies and plans, the biggest round of health reform, because after long, long years of neglect and the oversight of the Leader of the Opposition we inherited a circumstance where the nation was short of doctors and nurses and hospitals were short of funding, and Australians wanted to see action and change, which we have provided. As a government we have honoured our commitment to get rid of Work Choices, which ripped people off so profoundly. It hit their cost of living and their pay packets. - I am of course directly answering the question that was asked, and if the member for Flinders thinks it was badly drafted then he should take that up with others.To directly answer the question that was asked on trust and delivery of promises, of course we delivered our promises to get rid of Work Choices. And on the question of trust, clearly who cannot be trusted on that area is the Leader of the Opposition. Already - the member may not be involved in this yet - the opposition is cooking up plans to toss overboard its written promises at the election about not introducing Work Choices.We will of course deliver our policy and plans to keep expanding the productive capacity of our economy. We have emerged from the global financial crisis stronger than most, stronger than others in the world, but in order to harness the benefit of that strength we need continuing rounds of reform, including investment in infrastructure. That is why we will continue to deliver on infrastructure and on our promise - the member asked me about the question of trust - to deliver the National Broadband Network. Do we have obstacles in relation to that? Yes, we do: the position of the Leader of the Opposition. But we will deliver the National Broadband Network because of its capacity to transform the economy.Of course, the list of what the government can be trusted to deliver could go on. How can I say very clearly to the member that you can trust the government to deliver these things? It is because during the election campaign, as we made these promises, we carefully costed them. We found offsetting savings. We made sure that our figures added up and we made sure that the budget would come back to surplus in 2012-13.So, if the member is truly concerned about questions of trust, then I hope that within her political party she is trying to find out why she went to the election with a $11 billion black hole and a shadow Treasurer who had not even bothered to look at the costings -  - On questions of trust, there are some very big ones for the member to resolve involving the Leader of the Opposition and his shadow Treasurer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. Together he and I visited an Aboriginal medical centre in his electorate a couple of months ago. I know of his commitment to join with us in ensuring that we close the gap in Indigenous health outcomes. I know it is a view that is supported across the chamber, and I am pleased to announce and reaffirm our commitment to closing the gap in Indigenous health outcomes. That is reflected in the partnership between ourselves and the state governments through the COAG process, where we have jointly committed $1.6 billion for that purpose, $808.5 million of which is from the Commonwealth to address chronic disease.It is worth pointing out that this financial year we are investing $1.2 billion in Indigenous-specific expenditure for 2010-11. This is an 87 per cent increase over what it was in 2007-08. But it is not just about money. We need to make a difference, and clearly that is quite difficult. We need to - and we must - close the gap in life expectancy within a generation and halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five years of age by 2018. I think all members would share the view that closing the gap in life expectancy will not be easy and that it will be some time before we can achieve concrete outcomes. But there are some good signs, and these are in the area of child mortality. The National Indigenous Health Equality Council, chaired by Professor Ian Anderson, of which the new member for Hasluck was formerly a member, has advised us that we are on track in addressing the issue of infant mortality. We believe that we can now halve the gap in Indigenous infant mortality within the decade, and that is a very important outcome for all of us.The implementation of the government's $805.5 million chronic disease package will take time. It is important to understand some of the limitations in improving health outcomes amongst Indigenous Australians. One area that I will concentrate on for just a brief moment is smoking. Amongst Indigenous people, 50 per cent smoke. The figure for the non-Indigenous population in this country is around 18 per cent for people aged over 14. The stark difference means that if we want to change the life expectancy of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people we have to effect changes in smoking. That is why we have invested $115 million in addressing smoking amongst Indigenous Australians.There is a lot to be done, but I am sure that, working with the state governments, working with the private sector and making sure that we continue to work constructively with Aboriginal health organisations throughout the country, together we can make a difference and we can close the gap. - </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I am aware of the changes being contemplated by the Canadian government. In fact, they sought some advice from our very own immigration officials as they put together this suite of changes. If the Leader of the Opposition were to be honest and accurate and detailed with this parliament and went through it change by change, what he would recognise is that the Canadian government have gone for a different mix of measures. For example, in some areas they have taken a different approach. In this country we have mandatory detention, we deal with people's processing to finality, whereas my understanding of the Canadian approach is that they are going to put a one-year time limit on such detention. So there are differences. But we here in Australia need to make the decisions that we believe are in our nation's interest, that are the most effective range of policies, and we need of course to implement solutions for the long term, which is why as a government we are working on the regional protection framework and regional processing centre. It is why we have announced our long-term strategy for detention. It is why we have announced some new arrangements for children.I am yet to understand with any precision or clarity where the opposition stands on those changes. If the Leader of the Opposition was being honest about this, rather than making simplistic comparisons with only one aspect of the new Canadian proposals, what he would actually be saying to the Australian people is that this is a complex problem, there is no one policy measure that provides the solution and there is certainly no three-word slogan that does.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I know that he is deeply interested in health services for his local community and I have had the opportunity in the past to visit with him the GP superclinic that serves his community. For members of the parliament who are interested in meeting the healthcare needs of their local communities, and I do hope that that is all of us, I want at this stage to draw the parliament's attention to the fact that this week parliament will have the opportunity to deal with a piece of legislation which is the foundation stone of our historic health reforms.When we came to government in 2007, we inherited a situation where Australia was short of doctors, it was short of nurses, and the federal government's share of hospital funding had fallen from 45 per cent in 1996 to 38 per cent in 2007. That meant when you look across our health system we were basically short of everything that is needed to run a health system: doctors, nurses and money. A step at a time we have worked to address that situation. We entered into new healthcare agreements which increased by 50 per cent the funding flowing from the federal government to state governments. We have implemented measures to train more doctors, to make sure we are seeing more nurses and health care professionals generally available for our health system. Indeed, this morning I had the opportunity with the Minister for Health and Ageing to visit some young professionals getting clinical experience at the University of Canberra, and it was terrific to see them doing that work and getting that experience.But to ensure that our healthcare system can provide the kind of quality and services that Australians expect for the long term we need to do more. We need to reform health care. We know our society is ageing; we know the burden of chronic disease is becoming increasingly heavy. If we are to meet those future burdens on the healthcare system, we need to have healthcare reform, which is why the legislation coming before the parliament this week is so important. It is pivotal to putting in place a situation where, for the long term, the federal government steps up to being the majority funder of hospitals - meeting 60 per cent of the efficient price of hospital services - and steps up to a similar role in respect of capital. The new legislation is pivotal to achieving a situation where the federal government steps up to 100 per cent of primary care. It is pivotal to achieving a situation where there is transparency about healthcare funding, both what flows from the federal government and from state governments, so we are no longer in a situation where people fear that an increase from the federal government is met with a matching decrease from state government funds. When the Leader of the Opposition was Minister of Health and Ageing, he used to sometimes muse on health reform and say that he was attracted to the Commonwealth taking a bigger share and ensuring transparent standards for Australian hospitals. He never got anything done, but he has the opportunity to do something now and that is not to stand in the way of this piece of legislation.</DOC>

 - I hope I get the opportunity now to explain to the House what I would have thought was a fairly simple concept. People around the globe get on the move for all sorts of reasons. Some of them come from source countries that are within our region; some do not. They transit through our region and people are aware of the common stopping-off points as they move through our region seeking forward transit and ultimately transit to Australia. The aim of the regional processing centre is to take away the incentive to engage in that forward transit to Australia. It is to take away from people smugglers the very product that they sell. It is to take away from people an incentive to keep moving, and it is certainly there to take away an incentive for people to undertake a difficult and dangerous journey at sea. For the opposition to try and create some nonsense campaign that somehow this is about creating a processing centre for everyone who is on the move around the world is obviously laughable and absurd.Anybody who has engaged even in the most cursory examination of this issue would know that people move in an irregular fashion around our globe. They go to Europe; obviously they go to Canada - we have just talked about that; some engage in transit in our region; and a far smaller number engage in forward transit to Australia. The aim of the regional processing centre is to take away the incentive for that continued forward transit and to take away from people smugglers the very product that they sell. I understand that this area of policy is complex and it requires determination, but what I can definitely say to this House is that it will never be solved by a three-word slogan. It will never be solved by the Leader of the Opposition's boat-phone idea, and I doubt it will ever be solved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who stood next to the foreign minister of Nauru, talked about the Nauru detention centre and then said the people of Vanuatu had been very generous in assisting the Australian people. From lessons in geography, let me tell you that Nauru is not a subset of Vanuatu. I would suggest to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition she gets out a map of the region and has a good look.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question. She is a very passionate advocate for services in her electorate, including Blacktown Hospital, for which she has been campaigning for a very long time. For her community, as for many others, the health reforms being proposed by this government give an answer for a long-held problem, which is: how do we get enough funds into our hospitals where they are needed? The bill that the Treasurer will introduce later this week into the House, to reform the federal financial relations of our health system and the way we fund them, will have a fundamental impact on communities across the country so that we are able to say for the first time that the Commonwealth is stepping up to shoulder a 60 per cent share of funding for our hospitals and that we will be paying for services directly to our hospitals without any capacity for states potentially to keep some of that money, without any handing over of block funding and no accountability for where that money will go.The member for Greenway asked how had this proposal been received and what had the response been. Of course we have the agreement from seven states and territories to these proposed changes. We have very high-level support from the AMA, from the nurses, from professionals across the country. We actually have very high-level support from previous health ministers, even including the Leader of the Opposition. When he was the health minister, he used to argue that states should be required to publish detailed information about the specific performance of hospitals. He used to actively argue that in the medium term we needed to see a move towards activity based funding. But there has been an interesting thing since the member opposite, who is now the Leader of the Opposition, has stopped being the health minister: he has been silent on these reforms and whether the Liberal Party will support these reforms in the House. He has been absolutely silent about whether he supports a 60 per cent funding of our hospitals, whether he supports activity based funding and whether he supports doctors and nurses in local areas having more say about how their hospital services are run and, as always, he seems to be adopting the same approach, which is to studiously ignore that this is a vital issue for the community and that the Liberal Party and the opposition will have to come to a view on whether or not they will support these changes. So I wondered whether it was because we had not put this in a way that the Leader of the Opposition found attractive, because I can tell him communities across the country want this changed; they want more support for doctors and nurses; they want their hospital services properly funded. I thought perhaps the Leader of the Opposition might be inclined to support our changes if I put it like this: Leader of the Opposition, we can stop the waste, we can pay more money to our hospitals, we can stop the need for big, new state taxes and we can open more beds, and we hope you will support us.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, and there was a certain elegance in a Western Australian asking a question after acknowledgment of the Western Australian Attorney-General, who is in the gallery. Can I say, in answer to his question, that firstly I suspect he should read the full quote of the relevant Indonesian minister, who, as it is my understanding, then goes on to talk about the major reason why people get on the move, being circumstances in their own country; that is, he is referring to the push factors.On the regional processing centre, I understand that there are going to be a variety of views in our region, in this parliament and in the broader community as we work our way through these issues. That is to be expected on something that is complicated and something that requires a sophisticated public policy response. But the government has made its decision that it will pursue dialogue about the regional protection framework and regional processing centre. On the question of the definition of the region, can I refer the member asking the question to my Hansard 
from last week where I was asked that question and answered it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. While the Prime Minister has said that there is more that we need to do as a national government in mental health - and with the greatest respect, of course, she is right about that - there is much that we are already doing. The current forward estimates include around $1.2 billion of specific funding for mental health initiatives additional to the MBS and the PBS, which is more than double the investment made in mental health during the last four years of the Howard government.This significant increase includes a range of new programs such as the perinatal depression plan, which recognises the critical importance for a person's long-term mental health, their lifetime mental health, of their earliest years of life. We are also rolling out the first 10 of up to 30 new Headspace sites. I have recently written to my state colleagues formally seeking their interest in partnering with the Commonwealth to develop early psychosis prevention and intervention centres in their jurisdictions. This is the first ever Commonwealth investment in the EPPIC model that has been around since the early 1990s. We also expect significant numbers of the 1,300 subacute beds committed at COAG earlier this year to be directed towards mental health. Already, we have heard from the South Australian government that around 80 per cent of their allocation will be used for step-up, step-down mental health facilities.Labor's $277 million suicide prevention plan announced by the Prime Minister in the election campaign will boost frontline services like Lifeline, which will be able to take tens of thousands of additional life-saving telephone calls, as well as connecting mobile phones for the first time toll free. The government will fund infrastructure to prevent suicide at notorious hot spots. Already I have met with the Woollahra local council to talk to them about fast tracking funding and getting work underway as soon as possible to fund infrastructure at the most notorious suicide hot spot in the country, The Gap at Watsons Bay in Sydney. Other elements of the plan will focus on: building resilience in our young children through a huge expansion of the successful KidsMatter program; expanding beyondblue's very successful programs that target men, who still account for three-quarters of the nation's suicides; funding initiatives in hard-to-reach, high-risk communities like Indigenous Australia; and much, much more.After literally decades of underinvestment and vastly different state systems, mental health reform is not easy. It requires action across a range of fronts - building resilience in our young children, supporting young Australians with emerging mental health disorders including psychosis, case managing adults who have severe and persistent mental illness and tackling the tragedy of suicide. It is a reform process that will rely heavily on the government's broader health reform agenda such as things like building a 21st century e-health system and building a much stronger primary healthcare network.The opposition brings to this debate a hollow promise built on the dodgiest election costings in decades of election history, funded with Monopoly money and a willingness to trash some of the most fundamental primary healthcare reforms included in the health reform agenda. Labor, dare I say, brings real action.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship was just pointing out the lack of continuity with the questions that have gone before. Can I say to the shadow minister, who has responsibility for this matter for the opposition, we are going to work through on the regional protection framework and regional processing centre. -  - I understand that the shadow minister is embarrassed to sell a three-word slogan, is still trying to recover from the humiliation of boat phone during the campaign, is wanting to do everything in this parliament to try -  - The shadow minister is trying to do everything in this parliament to cover up their lack of a policy. -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am not sure I want to interrupt your dialogue with the member for Sturt but thank you for the call. - I say to the shadow minister that, obviously, we will work through all elements of the regional protection framework and the regional processing centre. But it seems to me that what is sought to be achieved here is a matter of common sense. At the moment, people believe that it is worth their while to engage in forward transit. Through creating a regional processing centre -  - On the question of the regional framework and the regional processing centre I believe the aim is obvious and clear - that is, to send a message to people who are engaged in irregular migration that there is no incentive to engage in forward transit because they will end up being processed in the same place by the same rules. From their interjections the opposition seem either to not understand this or to be engaged in grand scepticism about it. Can I suggest to them that, if they are so sceptical about this approach, they choose to seek some guidance from a former Liberal prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, who can tell them a bit about irregular people movements, a regional framework and regional processing. I suggest they make that call on the phone.</DOC>

 - I thank the member Dobell for his very important question. This morning I returned from Korea, where we have been having finance ministers meetings to prepare for the G20 leaders summit in three weeks time in Seoul. This meeting has come at a critical stage for the global economy. It was very important that the finance ministers showed a unity of purpose and achieved results, and I do believe that the meeting has achieved results. This is an important time because the global economic recovery is fragile and patchy. Because of that it is important that Australia does engage in these discussions as fully as we have been engaged in them over the last couple of years, so the G20 leaders summit meeting in three weeks time will be particularly important. Australia is not immune from what is going on in the international economy. When you have a patchy and uneven global economy, that does have implications for the Australian economy, so it was important that there was a degree of certainty and an outcome from these finance ministers meetings over the weekend.I can tell the House that the finance ministers did agree on some fundamental reforms. In particular, we agreed on a fundamental reform of the International Monetary Fund which will be the biggest reform in the history of the International Monetary Fund. It is particularly required as we move through a period where there is a degree of uncertainty. Australia can be proud of the role that we have played over the past 18 months in seeking such fundamental reform in the IMF, along with our partners South Africa. We have played a very significant role in the reforms that are coming forward to make sure that the IMF reflects the weight of power in the global economy and that emerging economies and other economies are more represented in the global decision-making bodies, in particular in the IMF. So greater weight has been given to developed and underrepresented economies in the IMF.The IMF has also been given some more fiscal power to deal with crises before they occur, rather than trying to mop up the mess later on. Also, countries around the table agreed to put in place a framework for strong and balanced growth. In particular, we agreed that we should be moving towards more market determined exchange rates, and that is a very important outcome for Australia. We do not want to see the competitive devaluation of currencies that we have seen in recent months. We endorsed some fundamental reforms that have come through the work of the Financial Stability Board and the Basel committee. These are very important to financial regulation of the global banking system and they do have implications for Australia. Australia has worked very hard to ensure that the decisions taken at finance ministers level, and which will be taken at leaders level in three weeks time, reflect the unique circumstances of a country like Australia, which did not suffer from the banking collapses that occurred in many other developed economies. So these are important meetings. It is important that Australia stays engaged in this way. For the first time in our history we have had a seat at the decision-making table when it comes to global economic affairs. When all of these reforms are further signed off by the G20 leaders in three weeks time, let us hope that they will continue to ensure that the global economy remains prosperous.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I did visit his electorate for an important event for emergency services, and particularly some funding that we made available to them from the NBN regional initiative to enable them to have online training of volunteers - something that will be absolutely turbocharged by the NBN. Given that, I would have thought the member might be thinking about his attitudes to the NBN and the attitudes of the opposition to the NBN.On the question of the announcement about the detention centre, that announcement was made the same day the decision was made. The decision was made by cabinet that morning and then announced, obviously in accordance with a proper system of cabinet government. Cabinet made the decision and it was announced. On consultation processes, the consultation processes the government is using are the same consultation processes that have been used for a very long period of time when they relate to the use of Commonwealth land and Commonwealth facilities, which is what is under discussion here - Commonwealth land and Commonwealth facilities. As the department goes about the appropriate consultations - as they have been done for a very long period of time by this government and by other government when it comes to the use of Commonwealth facilities - I understand that community members have raised a set of concerns. Of course, the Commonwealth will be making sure community members get the full information because, clearly, whilst the member might think it is his job to fearmonger, I would actually think it is his job to get accurate information to people. So, on the question of accurate information, of course appropriate security arrangements will be made. On the question of accurate information, of course the federal government will fund and provide the necessary services so that people in the local community do not need to fear that somehow the services they rely on will then be taken away from them. That is not true. The Commonwealth will make the necessary investment to fund the required services. Of course, working with local schools and other community organisations, the Commonwealth will do what it has done in the past - which is meet the costs of education of the children involved.I would say to the member - and it comes back fundamentally to a policy choice for the opposition - at some point the opposition need to make some policy choices about what is a complex question. We have outlined -  -  - Ultimately, members in this parliament face a choice on a policy question that is complex. The government has outlined a long-term strategy. It has outlined a series of arrangements about children. We are still waiting to hear from the opposition whether they endorse those series of changes about children or not. We are working through complex questions relating to a regional protection framework and regional processing centre. I say again: what we will never do is have a three-word slogan and pretend that that is an answer. We will leave that kind of cheap politics to the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. The government is approaching the challenge of climate change by concentrating on three areas in particular: firstly, renewable energy; secondly, the improvement of energy efficiency in businesses and households; and, thirdly, working on the introduction of a carbon price. Of course, the introduction of a carbon price is a vital economic reform for business in this country because, without a carbon price, Australia's businesses and investors will continue to operate in an environment where there is considerable uncertainty when they are analysing alternative investment proposals.Earlier today, nine of Australia's leading superannuation fund and funds management organisations announced plans to form a new industry panel that will be dedicated to pursuing certainty around carbon pricing. The panel consists of CEOs from some very large financial institutions, including AMP Capital Investors, BT Investment Management, AustralianSuper and a number of others. Together these nine organisations are responsible for about $350 billion in funds under management and are extremely significant investors in the Australian equities markets. Earlier today, Mr Mark Lazberger, CEO of Colonial First State Global Asset Management, had this to say about the issue of a carbon price:The current uncertainty surrounding carbon pricing hinders investment decision making across both emissions intensive and low emissions assets. To allow sensible long term investment decisions, the framework for pricing emissions must be resolved.In other words, what Mr Lazberger is referring to, along with his colleagues on this panel, is that investors need to know what the carbon price is and how it will be constructed so that they can properly assess competing investment proposals not only in emissions intensive industries -  - He seems to get quite excited whenever -  - What Mr Lazberger is saying on behalf of this investors group is that the issue of a carbon price needs resolution so that proper analysis of competing investment proposals can be carried out by major investors in our economy. A lack of a carbon price leads to investment in Australia becoming more expensive than it need be because risk has to be factored in. Households, of course, can also benefit significantly from measures the government is taking on climate change and, specifically, in the area of energy efficiency. By improving energy efficiency, families will be able to save money on their bills and achieve an outcome on the environment.Following the release earlier this month of the report of the Prime Minister's task group on energy efficiency, the government will now engage with key stakeholders, including state and territory governments, to discuss how to take the next step forward to drive significant improvements in energy efficiency in our electricity systems, including at the domestic level. The fact is that there is one large obstacle here to making these important reforms and, in particular, on the issue of a carbon price. It is represented by the Leader of the Opposition. We have come to a position where the Leader of the Liberal Party, the Leader of the Opposition, is standing in the way of a critical economic reform that is supported by the business community, supported by major investors, and the Leader of the Opposition -  - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I would refer the member to the statement and information that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and I released at the time that we announced these new detention facilities and also the arrangements for children. These are the government's plans for detention. We wanted to be transparent about a long-term strategy to undercut the fearmongering about other sites that had been going on around Australia. If the member truly wants to inform himself about this, all of the information he requires was publicly available and transparent on the day we made the statement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. He has shown a great deal of interest over his time in this place in improving services and certainty for consumers in the financial sector. Certainty is important because the consequences of getting certainty wrong in banking regulation can have catastrophic consequences for all Australians, as I am sure people opposite understand.The big four banks in Australia - and many of their other colleagues - go overseas to raise a lot of their capital. Members opposite may be interested to know that that is in the order of 40 per cent of all the capital that is raised. What that means is that 40 per cent of an average Australian's mortgage is raised overseas. Of course, if overseas lenders lose confidence in the debate in Australia on banking regulation, that can have catastrophic consequences for Australian mortgage holders. I think the people opposite know where this answer is going. We all understand that, in fact, overseas lenders have been particularly sensitive in recent times following the very difficult set of circumstances which many foreign banks have experienced through the global financial crisis. - I always welcome the interjections of the member for Goldstein because who knows what they are going to be this week. They are very sensitive overseas to our changes in terms of banking regulation and the debate in Australia. Members opposite understand where this is going and they are not happy about it. The problems that can be caused by intemperate remarks from the opposition have a massive impact upon banking regulation. I want to know: what does the opposition have against average mortgage holders that they would jeopardise their interest rates by playing with fire? The reality is that this government, by contrast, understands the importance of banking regulation and it understands the importance of certainty. It was a Labor government who guaranteed the banks; it was a Labor government who, through the global financial crisis, ensured the settings were fair enough that we could get through it in a solid state.Of course, the coalition shadow Treasurer very recently has said that perhaps we should -  -  - It was embarrassing. That is what the member for Wentworth said about his shadow coalition Treasurer colleague privately, and he should say it here. What happens is, when you start to talk about tinkering and regulating bank interest rates through the intervention of government regulation, you send a terrible signal overseas; you send a terrible signal to mortgage holders. The Australian mortgage market is too important to be treated with some sort of populist stunt. By contrast, you will see that the Labor government have cracked down on unfair mortgage exit fees; we have provided a better deal for Australians with credit cards; we have ensured that we will decrease the interest withholding tax. But, as much as the opposition may bicker and moan about the comments of the coalition shadow Treasurer, let us be clear: the comments of the shadow Treasurer put pressure on mortgage rates. If the opposition were ever to form a government, I have no doubt that they would replace the coalition shadow Treasurer with someone who at least understands the markets. The real issue here is that, when you talk about regulating the rates through ham-fisted intervention, you endanger all Australian mortgage holders. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for O'Connor for his first question and congratulate him on his first speech, which he gave earlier today. Anyone who heard that speech would know that this question comes from a very real concern about the plight and the lack of doctors in his electorate. I know that there are many on the other side of this House, and on ours, in whose electorates there is a severe shortage of doctors and that it is causing significant problems across the country. This question comes from the member for O'Connor, who has dedicated a lot of his adult life to volunteering for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, and I am sure we will have a lot of time together to work out ways to solve what is a very serious problem.But I can tell the member for O'Connor some good news. In this financial year, targeted rural health funding - this is for targeted rural health programs - in addition to what is paid under any of your general entitlements programs is now at $795 million. Had the member asked this question of the Leader of the Opposition in his last year as the health minister, he would know that this is a 65 per cent increase on targeted rural health expenditure that is already flowing out into the community. This includes other investments such as the $134 million Rural Health Workforce Strategy that we announced in the 2009 budget, which means that 500 more communities and 2½ thousand doctors are newly eligible for incentives. So, in the very many areas in O'Connor that are classified RA5, new relocation incentives of $120,000 are payable to GPs who move to these communities, and there are retention incentives that have been significantly increased for those who stay in those communities, of $47,000. These are significant changes.The member might also be interested to know - and I know that a number of other members from Western Australia have raised the issue of the number of GPs in Western Australia - that already serving are an additional 30 GPs being trained because of the investments our government made when we were first elected to office. We have since committed that we will increase those places even further, so that over the next decade there are going to be 5,500 extra GPs. I think all of us in this House need to work to ensure that those GPs go to communities where they are needed and go into practices where they are needed.The member might also be interested that just a fortnight ago the Prime Minister and I announced the latest investments in clinical training places. Across O'Connor - in Albany, Denmark, Katanning, Narembeen - there are going to be nearly 700 additional clinical training days for doctors, nurses and allied health professionals working in rural and regional communities in the electorate. Of course, there are many, many other things that need to be done. We do not pretend that this is a problem that is already fully solved. We inherited a very severe workforce shortage and we are just now seeing extra graduates being able to graduate and be attracted to rural and regional Australia.The member mentioned in his first speech the Leader of the Western Australian Nationals, who are in partnership with the Liberal government in Western Australia. There is more than $350 million on the table that this government wishes to spend in Western Australia to help reform the health system. We do not, to date, have an agreement with that Liberal government. We hope we will have one. For someone passionately interested in health coming from Western Australia, that might be a conversation that would be fruitful to have over the coming period as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. He is one of many members of the House who have expressed their support for Tourism Australia's success in attracting the Oprah Winfrey Show to Australia. People in the House should remember that our tourism industry at the moment is very challenged by the strength of the Australian dollar. People must appreciate that tourism is a major employer of Australians - just under one million Australians, directly and indirectly. We should also remind ourselves that tourism represents 8.3 per cent of Australia's total exports. In that context, the Oprah Winfrey Show is very important. Her show is viewed by over 40 million people each week in the United States and is broadcast to 145 countries globally. When she announced her willingness to come to Australia, to Australia's credit and great benefit she said that her Australian visit would represent the ultimate adventure. That is exceptionally important because Oprah has been named by Forbes magazine as the most important celebrity in the world. That represents a major endorsement of the Australian tourism industry. Opposition members - What about Kevin? - At least two episodes will be filmed at the Sydney Opera House. They will go to air in the United States in January. This represents an investment by Tourism Australia of $1.5 million. To assist the Australian tourism industry to promote its product, Tourism Australia has facilitated a pitch by each state and territory for an inclusion of their experience in the filming of the Oprah Winfrey Show. To date there have been expressions of interest from 3,000 product and service offers. Thousands of Australians, including many on the opposition side of the House, have sought tickets to the filming of the Oprah Winfrey Show.Opposition 
members - Name them! - I know that the opposition does not regard tourism as an important industry. This is a major coup and I am pleased to say that, despite the global financial crisis, the North American market has proved to be very resilient for Australia. We saw 5.1 per cent growth for the period to 2009. Also, because it is related to tourism, the Shanghai world expo has been a great opportunity for Australia, with over seven million visitors to our expo site to date.With the approach of Christmas, I remind the House that the tourism industry is doing it tough. Australia continues to have 117 million days of accumulated annual leave at this point, worth $33 billion. I ask all Australian employers to give serious support to encouraging their workforce to have a holiday in Australia and, by doing so, to keep their mates employed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for the question. In 2008 there were a number of referrals for environmental approvals for projects led by Santos and QGC for coal seam gas projects in Queensland. Soon after receiving this portfolio, I travelled to Gladstone to inspect the sites and I also held meetings in Chinchilla with local government representatives and with some of the community groups that were opposed to the development. Last Friday I met the deadline that had been set for a decision under the EPBC Act and approved the projects subject to a large number of conditions. For the Santos proposal there were more than 300 conditions, for QGC there were more than 300 conditions and for the dredging project there were 52 conditions. Those conditions make sure of the essential protections which we must make - we must protect the Great Artesian Basin, we must protect the Great Barrier Reef, we must protect our waterways and our endangered species. - We are talking about areas which include endangered species such as the northern quoll, the water mouse, dugongs, and migratory species going through the area. That explains in part the large number of conditions. Most importantly, there are some very tough conditions on the use of water. I note that the member for Maranoa has taken a strong interest in this issue and has concerns about the use of water.The coal seams involve extraordinary quantities of water. A question came to light very strongly in information provided to me by Geoscience Australia as to whether or not the coal seams and the water contained within them were watertight. If they are watertight, then there is not a knock-on effect on the Great Artesian Basin; if they are porous, then potentially there may be an impact on the Great Artesian Basin. It was recommended that I take a highly precautionary approach. That has been reflected in the conditions which have been imposed. For that reason there will be a scientific committee which will be involved in testing the actual thresholds and pressure levels - repressurisation may be required in instances; full reinjection may be required in some instances - to make sure that in enabling the jobs and the investment to go ahead in Queensland we do not at the same moment ignore the interests of our farmers or ignore the significance of the Great Artesian Basin.There have been a number of public comments, some positive and some negative, but I note the Maranoa Regional Council CEO, Stuart Randle, has said:We are satisfied that the risks on water quality are being properly managed and _ they are actually taking water from completely separate water aquifers.There are a large number of conditions, and I think that is appropriate. In taking into account the environmental values of the area and the various risks, I believe the large number of conditions do get the balance right and will allow the investment to go ahead.</DOC>

The opt-out model will allow the NBN to be rolled out faster and will reduce construction costs. The fact is that the way that we are rolling it out means that every owner has the right to say, 'No, I don't want an NBN connection,' and that is why we have allowed for that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. Just in the past week we have issued a construction contract for the $291 million Seaford to Noarlunga extension, the rail extension into the southern suburbs of Adelaide most campaigned for by the member for Kingston, who now holds a very safe seat in the southern suburbs of Adelaide - something I am quite jealous of. This is a joint venture of Thiess and McConnell Dowell and is a major project for Adelaide. It includes the 1.2 kilometre Onkaparinga Valley bridge, whose span will be longer than the span on the Sydney Harbour Bridge.The construction of the rail line will use enough steel to build 30 Boeing 747s. Construction will commence later this year and will employ some 400 direct jobs during construction. This is consistent with the report that has been released by the Australian Industry Group - I note that we will be attending their dinner here in Parliament House tonight - that found, along with the Australian Construction Association, a positive outlook for Australia's infrastructure sector due to the government's strong public infrastructure investment in road, rail and the National Broadband Network. This will offset what they have found to be a slower commercial and residential building sector as a result of the global financial crisis. This report, released in the past week, predicts construction work will grow by almost six per cent in the current financial year and almost eight per cent in 2011-12. I congratulate the member for Kingston and all those in the community organisations who campaigned so hard to make this rail extension a reality.</DOC>

 - I can answer that question largely in my capacity representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in the other place. I thank the member for Hume for the question and acknowledge his very strong interest in this. Once the good rains started to come, we knew that the good news was likely to come with some very bad news in terms of what the return of good weather means for locusts. The Australian Plague Locust Commission, based within the agriculture portfolio, performs an important function in making sure there are three different ways that plague locusts are dealt with. The first is that there are Commonwealth areas of direct engagement in Commonwealth regions where aerial spraying takes place, there is direct involvement from the state governments and, most importantly, there is an extraordinary level of work done by farmers on the ground.When farmers do this work on the ground we need to understand the nature of a locust plague. The fact that the locusts are hatching in your area does not necessarily mean that is where they will do the damage. The work that farmers do - and there is only a very small window when you can do the spraying, when they are in that nymph stage - is extraordinarily important in managing their own property to some extent but very much so for their neighbours. We are talking, for those who have seen the film footage of locusts or who have been unlucky enough to have seen them face to face, about what looks like just a solid back cloud about four metres above the ground.We are seeing, and expect to continue to see, what the head of the Plague Locust Commission Chris Adriaansen has described as the worst plague in 70 years. Certainly, the good work that has been done by farmers, by state governments and at the Commonwealth leadership level means that that damage is being mitigated to a significant extent. But we should not pretend anything other than that this will be the worst locust plague in 70 years. That is what is expected, even if everybody does everything right. It does also come at a time when that has a real hit on the hopes of many farmers, and the question from the member for Hume alludes to that.Just at the time when many people had been seeing a new moment of hope after years of the challenges, including mental health challenges, that come with long periods of dryness - just at that exact same moment - something of the nature of plague locusts hits. It causes a real level of not just economic devastation but personal devastation for many people. Even in that context, we can still say it is good that the rains have come, even though these sorts of consequences sometimes come with them. We can also say that, through the good work of all involved, whatever damage is borne in the coming weeks - and some of it has occurred already - it is certainly nothing to what would have happened if we had not had, from all levels, the leadership that we have had.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question and acknowledge the hard work she does in her electorate to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I am very pleased to be able to congratulate GenerationOne for their terrific grassroots campaign to bring all Australians together to create equality of opportunity for Indigenous Australians.Last night around six million Australians were able to see the broadcast put out by GenerationOne and to witness 13-year-old Madeleine Madden give a wonderful address to the nation, calling all of us together to close the gap - to do everything each and every one of us can do to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The GenerationOne website had around 1.6 million hits after the broadcast was aired and now has around 58,000 people signed up to support the campaign.What Madeleine said to each and every one of us is that we really need to make our own individual effort and to play our own individual or community part, whether we are in business, in the community or in government. All of us need to work together to make sure that we improve the lives of Indigenous peoples. As governments we have a job to do. Each and every government around Australia has signed up to specific targets to close the gap - to close the life expectancy gap, the literacy and numeracy gap and the employment gap - and to make sure Indigenous people are able to meet their aspirations for themselves and their families.The government has allocated more than $5 billion to make sure we address the much needed work in education, health and employment. There are now specific efforts to help people get a job and to help Indigenous people to set up their own businesses. There are specific employment targets for government contracts that we expect to be met. There remains an enormous amount to be done, but I want to acknowledge Madeleine's efforts, GenerationOne's efforts and the efforts of many Australians who are doing so much to close that gap.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Let us go through it piece by piece. The minerals resource rent tax is being consulted through the Policy Transition Group and the legislation will be brought before the parliament. Then, of course, the opposition will face a fundamental choice - whether they will continue to maintain their opposition to a tax that Australia's biggest miners have agreed to pay and stand in the way of a reduction in company tax to achieve balanced economic growth, stand in the way of tax breaks for small business, stand in the way of better superannuation for Australians and an increase in national savings and stand in the way of $6 billion of productivity-improving infrastructure. That will be a choice for the Leader of the Opposition.On the question of tackling climate change, I do not believe in the Leader of the Opposition's simple slogans. I believe in using the opportunities of this new parliament through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to address the question of pricing carbon. I reiterate to the Leader of the Opposition: if he ever wakes up to the fact that the reform road is not a demolition derby then he will be welcome, if he wants to, to join with the government in real efforts to tackle climate change and pricing carbon, to join the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee and to do something constructive rather than to seek to wreck.On the third point that the Leader of the Opposition raises, what I said to the Australian people before the election, when I spoke to the Lowy Institute, was that this was a complex problem. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I was not going to use simple three-word slogans. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I was going to be truthful about the dimensions of the problem. I would not degenerate to using terminology like 'armada of boats' or 'peaceful invasion'. I would explain factually to the Australian people the dimensions of the problem and the regional protection framework and regional processing centre that I believe is important to the solution. In government, we have worked on that methodically, with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship in the region just before the parliament sat pursuing dialogue on these questions.At some point the Leader of the Opposition needs to think through whether really his political cause is advanced by being someone who is known for wrecking or whether his political cause is advanced by returning to the Liberal Party of old, which was a reform-advocating political institution. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, as I said last night, that for us to seize the benefits of prosperity, coming out as we have as strong from the global financial crisis, we need to keep walking the reform road. Now is not the time to lead the Liberal Party away from the post-1983 consensus on economic reform. Now is not the time to lead the Liberal Party into economic Hansonism. Now is not the time to conclude that the way forward for the Liberal Party is to conduct itself as a demolition derby on the reform road. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and also congratulate him on his new book, which I will be participating in the launch of later today. Congratulations do go to him. He is a member who understands the need for economic reform, as do all government members. This is a key divide in this contemporary parliament, where the government remains committed to continuing economic reform in order to seize the opportunities our nation now has, emerging as strongly as it is from the global financial crisis.The foundation stone of economic reform is fiscal consolidation and that means that we will bring the budget back to surplus in 2012-13, but economic reform requires us to do more. It requires us to lift the speed limits on the economy, to make sure that we are investing in the drivers of productivity and participation. That is why the government is committed to a reform program which includes cutting company tax. We want to see balanced economic growth. We want to see Australian companies strong. Our reforms include special benefits for small business, because we understand that in the modern economy small business people are drivers of economic growth.Our reform program also lifts the speed limits of the economy by investing in infrastructure - that is, traditional infrastructure like roads, like rail, like ports, but in the 21st century it is also the infrastructure of our age: the National Broadband Network. That is why we are committed to delivering the National Broadband Network - so that our nation does not end up exporting jobs to places like Korea and Singapore because they have better economic infrastructure than us.Reform and lifting the speed limits of the economy also requires investments in skills, in human capital, and the government remains committed to its transformational agenda in human capital, ranging from the education of our smallest children through school education, vocational education and training and into universities. We also remain committed to delivering a seamless national economy. Australian business should not be tied up in red tape because of the existence of differential regulation in different parts of the country. This remains a key reform driver for this government, including in the area of occupational health and safety.We intend to take the market based tools of reform into the areas of education and health to drive further reform. It was a great pleasure yesterday, with the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Treasurer, to talk publicly in this place about our health reform agenda, one that now appears to be opposed by the Liberal Party. We will also bring a reform drive to the question of pricing carbon and dealing with water. Our nation deserves leadership on these questions. We cannot afford to see the Liberal Party in this place turn its back on reform. We will continue to drive reform, but we do say to the Liberal Party: now is the time to stay determined on a reform course; do not submit to economic Hansonism; do not submit to the Leader of the Opposition's leadership approach of looking for things to wreck rather than things to build.</DOC>

I am more than happy to talk to the Shire of Northam, as we have done and as I will do in coming weeks. I am also happy to talk to other communities, as I have done in Inverbrackie, for example. As a further example, the House might be interested to know that yesterday I had a very constructive discussion with the mayor of Adelaide Hills, Mr Cooksley. He raised with me the impact on local health services and I reassured him that there would be no impact on local health services. -  - I was saying that yesterday I had a very constructive discussion with the mayor of Adelaide Hills. The mayor of Adelaide Hills asked me to examine, for example, not only making sure that there is no negative impact on health services but also investigating whether there may be positive impacts on health services from the opening of the facility at Adelaide Hills. I told him I was more than happy to explore that with him in consultation with the community. - That is the sort of thing a local leader can achieve when they interact positively with the government instead of undertaking political stunts like the member for Mayo. - Just as I have interacted with Mayor Cooksley, I will continue to interact with Mayor Pollard - just as I have interacted with Premier Rann as late as today, just as I consulted with Premier Barnett before making the announcement about Northam -  - just as I consulted - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. I know she is concerned about the delivery of health services and facilities to her local community. Yesterday, with the Treasurer and the minister for health, both outside the chamber and within it we alerted the parliament to the fact that we were bringing to the parliament the foundation stone of our health reform agenda. Of course we have been driven to seek health reform, first because we inherited a health system that was short of doctors, short of nurses and short of money, and of course the Leader of the Opposition knows all about that, having been the health minister responsible.We also inherited a situation where the system was plagued by cost shifting and blame shifting. There were no real incentives for the federal government to drive activity in prevention and in primary care, to keep people out of hospital. We were seeing an unsustainablity emerge where the biggest burden for hospital funding was increasingly falling on the level of government with the lesser fiscal capacity to deal with that burden, and that level of course was the state governments. That unsustainability had come about because the percentage of the Commonwealth's revenue to hospitals had gone dramatically down under the former government, the Howard government, and under the leadership of the current Leader of the Opposition. At the same time, the system lacked efficient price signals and it lacked national standards.We are determined to change that. We are bringing legislative propositions before this parliament to deliver the foundation stone of health reform, which is of course a change to arrangements between the federal government and state governments. Key to this reform is the federal government stepping up to a 60 per cent share of the costs of hospitals as well as paying 100 per cent of the costs of primary care. This reform agenda comes with the setting of efficient prices for hospital activities. It comes with a focus on transparency and quality. It comes with a focus on removing from the system the kind of cost shifting and blame shifting we have seen in the past.Today I was very pleased to, with the minister for health, not only walk to work - we walked to Parliament House - but also a little earlier today share in an event with leaders of preventative health organisations from around Australia who are urging this parliament to support the creation of a national preventative health agency so we can better drive within the Australian community a focus on preventative health, understanding as we do that so much of the burden of disease that Australians face today is from preventable health conditions like cardiovascular problems and indeed some cancers. We of course will have this focus on reform.I was very disturbed to see in today's newspapers that it appears that despite all of the things he mused about as health minister - the Commonwealth stepping up to a greater share, having transparent national standards - the Leader of the Opposition is positioning to try and wreck this health reform. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, this would be a very poor choice if he cares about health services for Australians.</DOC>

In addition to meeting the foreign ministers of East Timor and of Indonesia on these matters, I have had discussions with the foreign ministers of Afghanistan and Pakistan on these matters as well - as you would expect because, in dealing with the challenge of people smuggling and irregular people movements around the world, you are dealing with global factors and you are dealing with source countries, transit countries and destination countries.On the question of the response by those foreign ministers to the discussions I had with them, they agreed, as the minister for immigration has said subsequently, that these matters will be progressed through the Bali process, because that involves all regional countries. Furthermore, in the participation of the Bali process I will have further meetings with the Indonesian Foreign Minister in Bali in December. That is as it should be.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his very important question. -  - For over 25 years, Australia has had a very proud record of fundamental economic reform. That fundamental economic reform has spanned three governments and it is pretty fair to say that there has been a degree of bipartisanship in that fundamental economic reform - until recently.Let us just go through where Australia is at the moment. It was the underlying resilience of the Australian economy, as well as the timely and powerful stimulus that this government put in place, that meant this developed country avoided a recession. Part of that resilience has been due to economic reform over 25 years. There is perhaps no figure which is more important for Australians to focus on than the fact that there have been something like 360,000 jobs created in Australia in the past year alone - that is, 360,000 additional breadwinners in this economy. When you think of the fact that there have been something like 30 million jobs lost internationally, this is really a stunning record for Australia. What it means is that the Australian economy has been much more resilient in the face of global shocks than many other developed economies.The fundamental reforms that have been put in place over the past 25 years are a very important part of that outcome. Floating the dollar was a very important part of that outcome. Putting in place international competition, deregulating the financial sector, ensuring a flow of credit to the economy and having strong financial institutions have been very important parts of that. Competition policy has also been a very important part of that. There has been bipartisan agreement on those fundamental reforms. National superannuation has been increasing our savings pool and to some extent there has been agreement here about that, although on occasions those opposite have opposed what we have done in superannuation.What lesson this teaches us is that the reforms of today are tomorrow's prosperity. What this government is putting in place through tax reform, through lower corporate rates, investment in infrastructure through the NBN, and what we are doing to introduce a price on carbon is tomorrow's prosperity. Unfortunately we are not seeing the same degree of bipartisanship that we have seen in the past and which is so essential to Australia's prosperity.I know Mr Costello and Mr Howard do not see eye-to-eye much these days, but they can agree on one thing: their economic legacy is at risk from all of the irresponsible people opposite. They can certainly agree on that. For our part, the government will concentrate on fundamental economic reform to support jobs and prosperity for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for his question. The federal government has announced its plans. We have no other plans than the plans we have announced. They are the ones that we will proceed with. We announced those plans and ensured that there was transparency because we were well aware that in many parts of Australia people with no solution to this complex problem were out raising fear in local communities and we believe that to be inappropriate. We have provided clarity about our long-term plans. - The answer I gave to the question yesterday stands. I refer the member to the information we released at the time we announced our plans.The member for Cook then left the chamber. - If the member who asked the question has a very specific local concern that he wants an answer to then, of course, my door is open, as is the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship's, to give him a very specific answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Reid for his question. In a speech last night, the Prime Minister outlined a number of reasons for the increases in the price of electricity over the last few years which have impacted of course on households. Principal amongst those reasons has been the need for significant investment in our network infrastructure - that being the more 850,000 kilometres of poles and wires which deliver electricity across the country. The House will be interested to learn that it is now estimated that $42 billion of network investment will be required over the next five years just to maintain reliable electricity supply and to meet growing demand for electricity. This is the main driver of the higher electricity prices that households are now facing. - He's reaching for the standing orders, so that is encouraging. - However, with the pressures that are already in the system putting pressure on electricity prices, the uncertainty over carbon pricing is creating a new pressure in itself. That is because the uncertainty over the pricing of carbon is causing investment decisions, particularly in the generation sector, to be put off. It means that investment in low-pollution baseload power is being put off in favour of suboptimal forms of generation investment that are cheaper to build but less efficient and incapable of providing baseload power generation over the longer term.The CEO of the Energy Supply Association of Australia, Mr Brad Page, has indicated this in some recent figures. For example, in 2009 the estimated capital expenditure for existing and new electricity generation plant over the next five years was $18 billion. However, in 2010 that figure for planned investments fell to $8.2 billion, and Mr Page cited the uncertainty over carbon pricing as one of the reasons that had occurred.Simply put, the delay in investment due to the lack of a carbon price threatens to put up electricity prices in the future because suboptimal investment decisions will be made. The fact of the matter is this: a carbon price will provide certainty to investors, allowing them to make the most efficient long-term investments in baseload generation capacity in our energy sector, and that investment, based upon certainty in the sector with a carbon price, will in fact reduce the impact of price increases that need to be made in the energy generation sector.So, to be clear about it: without a price on carbon, investment in low-emissions baseload generation will be put off and prices will rise because less efficient investments will be made. For that reason, the responsible economic position for the opposition to take is to support this important economic reform, because in fact one of the greatest economic risks we have now is the negative, carping, opportunistic policy slogans that are put forward by the opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I would say, in answer to his question, firstly that the Australian curriculum will actually help students learn about the Anzac tradition, including Gallipoli, Anzac Day and other important events and symbols in Australian history.The matter that he refers to is actually the draft of the years 11 and 12 history curriculum and, as the shadow minister ought to know, there are already in place curriculum drafts, including those that deal with these matters for years 1 to 10. In fact, coming into the House I had a look at them and saw that the K-10 curriculum proposes that students consider the historical significance of an Australian war memorial, in year 2; Anzac Day, in year 3; and involvement in Gallipoli and the Anzac legend, in year 9.The fact is that this is a draft curriculum that will go out for significant comment and consultation. It will come back to the ministers who consider these matters as a referral from the independent authority, ACARA - as you know - which is charged with doing this job. I would say to the shadow minister -  - I am pointing out to those opposite that the shadow minister has a fundamental misunderstanding of the process for the development of the national curriculum, and it is quite evident in the question that you have asked. In relation to the first part of your question -  - In relation to the first part of the shadow minister's question, the fact is that all Australian governments are committed to the development and implementation of an Australian curriculum that runs all the way through from kindergarten to year 12, and it begins with English, maths, science and history. We will develop that curriculum on the basis of expert advice that is received by ministers to determine what should constitute that curriculum. In particular, as I said before I was interrupted by the shadow minister, students will learn about the contribution of Australian defence forces, about the Anzac tradition, about Anzac Day - about those important parts of our military history. That is an absolute given, from the point of view of the development of the national curriculum.In relation to the time line: as I have said before in this House, ministers have agreed a time line for the introduction of the national curriculum and that is what we commit to.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for this very important question because I do think it is important to update the House on the steps which are set out under Australian law for transactions of this type which involve the ASX. The regulatory process ensures that decisions are always taken in Australia's national interest and that the market integrity of the ASX will be preserved. A proposal of this type is subject to extensive regulatory consideration under both Australia's foreign investment policy and the Corporations Act. Australia rigorously applies a national interest test to all proposals for foreign government investment and significant private sector investment. This particularly applies to a proposal of this scale and a proposal of this importance.The screening process to consider this proposal will be undertaken by the Foreign Investment Review Board in the normal way. FIRB will seek advice from other government agencies, including ASIC and the RBA, as to whether this proposal is contrary to the national interest. The government always has taken - and always will take - these decisions in Australia's national interest. This is the overriding consideration for foreign investment proposals.The ASX Ltd is also subject to a 15 per cent ownership limitation under the Corporations Act. An increase beyond this threshold can only occur if a regulation is made allowing this to take place. Any such regulation would be subject to disallowance by this parliament. The transaction also requires regulatory approval from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission as well as an Australian court. As members would be aware, on 1 August 2010 the government transferred supervision of Australia's financial markets to ASIC. This reform will enhance the integrity of Australia's financial markets and help promote Australia as a financial services hub in the region.Australia's financial regulators put their world-class reputation beyond any doubt during the global financial crisis. Our financial system came through all of that with strength. Australia's financial system has performed better than any other during the global financial crisis and, of course, the ASX is an important part of our financial systems architecture. So we will continue to consider all transactions with the objective of carefully and methodically building Australia's reputation as a financial services hub and, as always, we will do this in the national interest. I ask all members in this parliament to do the same.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the member for Wentworth for his question. I am pleased that, having opposed the formation of Infrastructure Australia and opposed the government's infrastructure agenda, there now appears to be - contrary to some other issues - some bipartisan support for the existence of Infrastructure Australia, for the moment anyway. The fact is that Infrastructure Australia did hand down its first infrastructure priority list. We tasked it - a body made up of representatives of the three levels of government and the private sector - to ascertain what the infrastructure priorities were for Australia.Do you know what Infrastructure Australia had to say in their first report about the National Broadband Network and about its importance to the economy? I will quote for the benefit of the member for Wentworth where it was identified. You did not have to go through the document very far because the No. 1 priority Infrastructure Australia identified was this:The importance of an accessible and fast broadband network to Australia's international competitiveness is almost impossible to overstate.They get it. The Australian people get it. All the business people I spoke to at the AiG dinner last night get it. It appears that you simply do not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Shortland for this question. She has always had an active interest in health issues and health promotion within her community. As the Prime Minister mentioned earlier today in question time, the Prime Minister and I joined with a number of members of the Heart Foundation's walking group, both the Queanbeyan group and the Groovy Grannies, who walk through the ACT to keep themselves fit and healthy. They are one of a number of national organisations that have been funded through our preventative health investments.There is not just the Heart Foundation. I know there will be many members of this House who are passionate about cycling who would be pleased to know that Cycling Australia with the Amy Gillett Foundation is also being supported with this initiative. Fitness Australia, the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute with their Lift for Life program, the Macarthur Division of General Practice - a couple of members opposite would be particularly interested in that - and Diabetes Australia are all involved in getting the message out across the country that we can do more to manage our own health to keep ourselves fitter, to make sure that we live longer and happier lives and to take some pressure off our health system by making sure that by living healthier lives we do not come down with a number of preventable diseases which put such an enormous burden on our health system.Today we will be debating again in the House the establishment of the preventative health agency. This agency ought to have been up and running by 1 January this year. Unfortunately, in the last parliament the opposition delayed and opposed this measure, and we hear that despite the calls of public health organisations across the country arguing that this investment should be made the opposition are again positioning themselves to vote against this measure.Today we met with organisations that covered the whole spectrum: the Heart Foundation, the Cancer Council, the Public Health Association of Australia, VicHealth and Quit - organisations that have committed all of their energy to trying to introduce public health campaigns, better living conditions, better information and desperately see the need for a national agency that can test the best evidence, can better target campaigns and allow us at last to make sure that we invest properly in preventative health.I call on the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition to reconsider their position on this bill. I know and I must say I have some respect for the fact that the Leader of the Opposition is a bit of a fitness freak himself. He leads and sets a very good example, but not everyone across the country has that same sort of commitment and governments can help others to play a more active role in managing their own health. I will be very disappointed and I know many thousands of Australians will be very disappointed if the Leader of the Opposition allows his party to oppose this measure in the House, when instead what we could do is invest in important health reform that will save lives for many decades to come.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Following our commitment about wholesale prices being the same for regional Australia as they are for urban Australia, the government has instructed NBN Co. to take that approach to wholesale pricing. What I can guarantee to the member is that the National Broadband Network will be delivered with wholesale prices the same for users of the National Broadband Network whether they are in Tamworth or whether they are in Tarneit in my electorate or anywhere else in the country. We are determined to make that happen.I would also say to the member, who represents a regional area in this place, that for him and his constituents this availability of the National Broadband Network at the same wholesale price will enable a transformation of local economies and local service delivery. Consequently I would ask the member, as he moves around and talks to others on his side of politics, to be making that point about the benefits for his local community.There appear to be three positions about the National Broadband Network in this parliament - the Leader of the Opposition's, who wants to demolish it; the member for Wentworth's, who wants to delay it; and that of those on this side of the House joined by regional independents, who want to build it because of the benefits for Australia, particularly regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for his question because he has been a tireless advocate for the importance of broadband to his regional constituency. For regional Australia this is a compelling case. Failure to address access to fast-speed broadband will see regions held back. The Local Government Association conducted a very extensive survey about this some four or five years ago and found that those regions that had broadband access were the ones that grew faster and created jobs. In fact it concluded that the failure to provide fast-speed broadband was costing the regions close to $3 billion in lost product and up to 30,000 jobs.That is why we on this side of the House are committed to ending the digital divide. We know that the capital cities have more access to it than the regions. We want the regions to grow, but they are not going to be able to do it unless they have access to the infrastructure that enables them to do it. That is why we are embarking on the National Broadband Network rollout, a rollout that will increase the capacity of the network but also deliver it, in the way we have constructed it, at a uniform wholesale price. In other words, we are addressing both availability and affordability.High-speed broadband is essential for businesses who are looking to establish in regional Australia because it is fundamental to them accessing global supply chains. As a former trade minister I understand the importance of nations accessing global supply chains, but unless we are enabling the regions to do it they will be left behind. Beyond the e-commerce opportunities there are huge opportunities with our broadband rollout for e-health and e-education, both areas in which this government has committed substantial resources to build the physical infrastructure. What we want to do is build the telecommunications and broadband infrastructure so that the applications, insofar as those institutions are concerned, are affected. This is not just about improving voice access over the internet; it is the data access. So this is essential to regional development.Now I am asked: are there any obstacles to this? Too right there are. There is the delay by those sitting on the other side of this chamber as to every attempt that we have made to roll this out. That delay, that procrastination, on that side of the House will hold regional Australia back. I urge all of those that argue that they have got an interest in regional economic development to understand the fundamental importance of this, as to enforcing it and encouraging it, and to get behind our initiatives and support them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for the question. One of the things that the Murray-Darling Basin guide does, which has not received much attention at all but is actually very important, is that it starts to look at a whole new way of counting all the water. There have been complaints from farmers, for example, for many years about forestry interception not being counted. There have been complaints about many different forms of interception not being counted, with irrigation pumps actually being the only sort of diversion that is taken account of.One of the very good things within the guide which is now starting a new part of the discussion is to start to look at all forms of interception. It is quite a leap forward from where these arguments have been previously. It has not really taken off in the public discussion yet but it will be something that comes through in the consultation, and I think it is something that we certainly support. I appreciate the comments made by the member for New England in terms of New South Wales coal seam gas extraction. - And it is marked 'confidential' so I do not have to table it. With respect to the similarities between some of the issues raised on the Liverpool Plains and the comments I made yesterday, the member for New England is right, and the advice that I receive from Geoscience Australia backs this up, that the science on coal seams is limited. That is why there will be some coal seams which are watertight and some which are porous. The conditions that I imposed on the Queensland projects I referred to yesterday demanded that individual testing will have to take place seam-by-seam. If the individual seams turn out to be watertight, then in those situations there is not connectivity, but where there is connectivity there needs to be either repressurisation or water actually being reinjected into the seam.The reason for this is you want to avoid a situation where - with your water table issues on the Liverpool Plains or with the Queensland example, the Great Artesian Basin - you do not create a void of water which, because it is porous, causes water to actually backfill and therefore you lose the water you otherwise would have had access to. It is a genuine concern. Geoscience Australia was saying there will be seams where this may apply and there will be seams where it may not. My view and what is reflected in those conditions is that that needs to be precautionary and you need to test every seam.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Honourable members of this place may be aware that this year marks the 70th anniversary of the Australia-United States diplomatic relationship. Also, next year is the 60th anniversary of ANZUS and very soon, when AUSMIN gathers in Melbourne, it will be the 25th anniversary of that meeting of Australian foreign and defence ministers and their American counterparts. It is a season therefore of significant anniversaries in the Australia-United States relationship.Of course our engagement with the United States goes back way before the initiation of diplomatic relations to the earliest days of Federation, the Great White Fleet, working together and fighting together in World War I. But we did not establish an embassy in Washington until 1940. That was the year we also saw the birth of the Australian foreign service in its modern formation with embassies in Tokyo, in Washington and in China that year. Things may have changed since then in terms of what has occurred in China and Japan but what has been constant has been our relationship with the United States since the darkest days of World War II.Our important relationship with the United States is built on some core values and interests which we share. When we are looking at important anniversaries, it is worthwhile, for the benefit of the House and for the country at large, to reflect for a moment on those core values and interests: common democracies, the fact that we both support open economies and we both represent free societies, the fact that we, as founding members of the United Nations, support the continuation of a stable international order and, on top of that, that we have risen together in the past to defend any threat to that order wherever that threat has arisen. America remains the world's remaining continuing superpower. It is also overwhelmingly a force for good in the world.Our relationship with the United States overwhelmingly reflects Australia's values and Australia's interests: our common interests in maintaining the strategic stability of East Asia and the West Pacific, our common interests in maintaining an open global economy through our continued cooperation and in the G20, and of course our common interest in widening our security and intelligence cooperation in dealing with the threat of terrorism at home and abroad and other emerging security threats as well. The 25th meeting of AUSMIN will occur in Melbourne. I am advised that this is the first time that Melbourne has hosted AUSMIN, and it will be a great opportunity for the city to showcase Australia to our distinguished American visitors. The Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, the Secretary of Defence, Bob Gates, together with the defence minister and I, will be attending the meeting and the Prime Minister will be meeting separately with our distinguished American visitors.Our agenda will be focusing on Afghanistan; the subject of debate in this House during the last week and in the Senate this week and, of course, developments in the wider Middle East including the continuing threat to security in our region represented by the Iranian nuclear program. Also we will be discussing the future of strategic stability in the Asia-Pacific region. That, of course, relates to the emerging new architecture of our region, the East Asia Summit, which, for the first time, includes the United States and Russia, which is a good development from the Australian national interest perspective.AUSMIN also provides an opportunity for deep and substantive engagement on the bilateral defence relationship where the defence minister, of course, will take the lead. Secretary Clinton and Secretary Gates will be welcome guests in Australia, welcome guests on this 25th anniversary of AUSMIN and welcome on this 70th anniversary of the Australia-United States diplomatic relationship.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for what is, I think, his first question in this place and welcome him to this place. Certainly, it is a fact that the rollout and take-up of the NBN in Tasmania is up to 11 per cent. That, indeed, is within the first three months.If those opposite understood the NBN rollout, they would know that NBN Co. is a wholesaler. It builds the equivalent, if you would like, of the railway track. Then we have the railway track of the 21st century and then we have retailers offering services on top of that. There are four retail service providers in Tasmania offering a range of services. The take-up rate is above expectations because it is normal practice that people will take up the new retail service providers once their existing internet contract with a service provider has expired.In spite of all the negativity of those opposite the take-up rates are above that which were anticipated. This is a good program; it is on track; it is successful; and it has been welcomed by people in Tasmania. It is extraordinary that those opposite are intent on playing a wrecking game when it comes to the National Broadband Network.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. In general terms, of course, the unauthorised release of any classified military documentation is a matter of most serious concern. In the example that the member has referred to, not just Australia but the United States, the United Kingdom, NATO and ISAF have all condemned the unauthorised release of such materials. That is for the very obvious reason that the release of such materials can put security operations at risk. That means it can put Australian lives at risk. It can also put at risk the lives, safety and wellbeing of individuals who assist, in general terms, in theatre either in Afghanistan or previously in Iraq.As the member has referred to, in July of this year, WikiLeaks released some 90,000 documents in respect of NATO and ISAF military efforts in Afghanistan. My predecessor minister for defence, Senator Faulkner, established a Defence task force to painstakingly examine those 90,000 documents to see whether any prejudice arose to Australia's interest, to see whether any adverse implications arose for the security of our operations and whether any adverse interest arose so far as individuals were concerned.As I indicated over the weekend I am very pleased to advise that that task force has now completed its deliberations. It provided me with its report on Friday and later this afternoon Defence will formally release the findings of that review. In general terms, there has been no adverse implications for our national security interests. Over the weekend members would have also seen a subsequent release by WikiLeaks of some 400,000 documents relating to Iraq dating back from 2004 to 2009. With the benefit of the experience we have had over the Afghanistan documents, that task force will now continue its work in respect of those documents for precisely the same reason.There has been a lot of publicity arising from the release of these documents so far as detainee management is concerned. Can I say as a general proposition, Australia takes its responsibility, so far as detainee management is concerned, very seriously. At all times we want to ensure that not just our domestic legal obligations but our international legal obligations are catered for and met.In the case of Iraq, of course, we were not responsible for any detainee or detention facilities at all. When, in the past, questions of detainee management have been raised in respect of Iraq, Defence effected a review, and in June 2004 that review was reported to the Senate, which drew to attention that there were no adverse implications so far as Australia or Australian personnel were concerned with respect to detainee management matters in Iraq.Of course, if any matters of concern arise in this context, they will be exhaustively investigated in the usual way. In due course - and it will take some time given the volume of documents - a similar public announcement will be made on any implications in respect of the recent documents for Australia's national security interests.</DOC>

When that issue was first raised with me by Mike Taylor in a meeting which I think was held here in Parliament House, I asked the department to consider whether that was also their view. It was not. - It was not their view and they spoke to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, advancing their opinion. There was a difference in opinion between my department and the authority, and I took the view at that point that the right thing to do was to get independent legal advice and to announce that, whatever it said, I would be releasing that advice publicly, which is what I did yesterday.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. This government recognises that investment in research and innovation is absolutely crucial to our future - to building prosperity, to lifting Australia's living standards, to responding to environmental challenges. Yesterday my colleague the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Kim Carr, announced National Competitive Research Grants to support 1,126 new research projects. These grants are recommended by the Australian Research Council and the government will provide a total of some $376 million to make the projects possible. There are some 931 projects through a commitment to the Discovery Projects scheme, with some $318 million provided there, supporting fundamental research by individuals and teams which is judged to be of an excellent quality.There are a further 186 projects funded through the Linkage Projects scheme. Here we invite collaboration between higher education researchers and partners outside the sector, including from industry. It was very pleasing to see some nine projects put forward by talented Indigenous Australian researchers, which will be funded through our $2 million Discovery Indigenous Researchers Development scheme. Also pleasing is that, in the Discovery Projects, the success rate for women matches that of men for the first time in five years. This is an achievement that this government is determined to entrench as business as usual.I do want to especially congratulate researchers at the University of New South Wales, in the electorate of Kingsford Smith - an outstanding institution that I know well - who received some $34 million to fund about 115 innovative research projects, including approximately $430,000 for a child development study to identify risk factors to improving children's health and educational achievements. Other investments and support include some $680,000 to the University of Western Australia to develop better tools for imaging cancer and guiding related surgical procedures.I could not help noticing a $163,000 grant to RMIT to develop clothing that can generate energy - a matter quite close to our hearts in this House. The research team expects that we will soon be seeing sports gear and defence uniforms that can power low-energy portable devices. Through the mists of time, I think Dick Tracy would be pleased.I want to stress that this government has increased Commonwealth spending on research and innovation by some 34 per cent, compared with the previous coalition government. We know that supporting world-class research is absolutely essential to our nation's future and we will continue our commitment to ensuring that the best and brightest provide the research that we need to meet the challenges of the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Of course, it points to the debate that we have been having, in this parliament and beyond, over the last few days about economic reform, about pursuing economic reform or about seeking to wreck economic reform. I would refer the Leader of the Opposition to my speech to the Australian Industry Group dinner in Parliament House earlier this week. He, unfortunately, was not able to be in attendance, but a number of members of his political party were in attendance so they would be able to advise him of those words.What I pointed to in that speech is the fact that electricity prices have been rising as a reflection of underinvestment in electricity generation capacity. When we look at that underinvestment and look at the legacy and the pressure that it is bringing into the electricity system now, our thoughts immediately run to the future. I said during that speech that I do not want the next 10 years to be like the last 10 years when we continued to see underinvestment.The reality is - and the Leader of the Opposition, if he talked to representatives from the electricity industry, would soon find this out - that investment is being held up now because of lack of certainty about a carbon price. To the extent that investment is being made, it is running to short-term stock-gap capacity rather than to the long-term baseload power that the system needs. If the Leader of the Opposition is as concerned about electricity prices as he claims to be, then the rational course would be for him to get on board with an agenda of working through and discussing the pricing of carbon. And the door, of course, is open to him to participate in those discussions, accepting the need for a carbon price and participating in the multiparty climate change committee.I understand that cost-of-living pressures are there for Australian families. Because I understand that, we are taking steps about working through questions of pricing carbon. I do not want to see continued underinvestment in electricity generation and supply putting upwards pressure on prices. I also want to continue to deliver those things to working families which will help with cost-of-living pressures. We have implemented tax cuts to make a real difference. We have created the education tax rebate to help with the cost of getting kids get back to school and we will extend that to school uniforms, as promised. We increased the child care tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent and will move to the payment of that fortnightly. We will deliver our promised changes to family tax benefits to assist with the costs of teenagers, understanding that the costs of kids do not go down when kids turn 16. To the Leader of the Opposition, who continues his slogan driven fear campaign, I say: get to grips with the underlying complex issues. If the Leader of the Opposition really wants to make a difference to working families the door is open to him to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. I know that she is concerned about a strong Australian economy and continuing prosperity. I am tempted to say that the answer to her question about the need for bipartisanship in economic reform is that it stops the asking of silly questions. The reasons for bipartisanship for economic reform are far deeper than that. First and foremost is that economic reform matters to the future prosperity of our nation. It matters to our productivity, which is so much a driver of future wealth. Economic reform is necessary to ensure that Australians have the skills and capacities they need in the workforce of today to drive innovation, to take the burden of red tape off the shoulders of business so that more effort can go into productive work rather than unproductive work. Economic reform is necessary to increasing labour force participation, because we know that, amongst the many contemporary challenges we face, one of them is the ageing of our society and the changing of the dependency ratio. Consequently, we cannot afford in the long term working-age adults of capacity being sidelined from the labour market because they lack the skills and capacity to participate in it.Economic reform matters to the design and efficiency of markets. It matters to the competitive advantage for this country as we compete in the world. Of course, vital to that competitive advantage is to have the infrastructure of the 21st century - to have world-class infrastructure in roads, rail and ports but also to have world-class infrastructure through the National Broadband Network. Economic reform takes deep policy thinking. It takes leadership and it takes persistence. Inevitably, there will be setbacks along the way. But persistence pays, and we are a government that intends to be persistent.I am asked about the importance of bipartisanship to economic reform. Given that economic reform is not easy, there is a choice for oppositions: choose to facilitate that reform or choose to stymie that reform. One way of stymieing reform is to come up with cheap, populist slogans to try to distract from the real debate. We have seen that from the shadow Treasurer over recent days whereby he has basically spruiked re-regulation of interest rates in a way that would hurt young couples and working families by ensuring that they would be unable to get a mortgage. That is what re-regulation of interest rates would mean.I did this morning think for a brief moment that maybe the Leader of the Opposition was turning away from the foolish course of following the shadow Treasurer down the track of these kinds of economic adventurous policies, because on three occasions the Leader of the Opposition was asked whether he backed the shadow Treasurer's nine-point plan and on three occasions he determined not to do so. But later he rang in to a radio station to explain that he had not backed the nine-point plan because, 'You know what it's like in these doorstops, you've got a lot on your mind.' - In conclusion, the Leader of the Opposition apparently has a lot on his mind. I am not sure what is on his mind but it certainly is not a plan for economic reform. In the absence of his own plan I say to the Leader of the Opposition: stop trying to wreck the government's reform. Facilitate reform in the interests of this nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Can I perhaps ask him in return why he is determined to see continued underinvestment in electricity generation that will put upwards pressure on prices. I say to the member who asked the question that, when he looks around the nation at increasing electricity prices, whether it is in Western Australia or in other states and territories, he will find that the explanation is underinvestment in electricity generation. If he is in any doubt about that, I suggest that he get on the phone to the Premier of Western Australia, who could quickly explain the concept to him.When we look forward and say, 'Well, how are we going to get this investment in electricity generation?' what we hit absolutely is the uncertainty from the electricity industry that they will not invest until they know what the economic settings are with a carbon price. We are talking, of course, about investments worth billions of dollars, and people rightly want certainty in the making of those investments. That is why it is important to work through the question of pricing carbon. Yes, it is not an easy reform. It will take work and thought. It will take the generation of consensus, which is why the government, with the opportunities of this new parliament, have been prepared to say that we will work in that way through the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. I say again, as I said to the Leader of the Opposition earlier, if the member asking the question is seriously concerned about increasing electricity prices then there is a way of constructively joining this debate, and the way of doing that would be to acknowledge that this is a nation that needs to work through the question of pricing carbon and to join the mechanism to do that. In the absence of the preparedness to work constructively, what we see from the opposition is that they are full of complaint but have absolutely no idea about any solutions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Greenway for her question and note her passion, enthusiasm and expertise when it comes to the question of the National Broadband Network. I think the member for Greenway is going to be a bit surprised, as will others in this House, when I quote the following statement made this morning by the Leader of the Opposition. He said:Let me just make these very important points. The National Broadband Network is not an economic reform _ - The Leader of the Opposition is full of compliments for his own work! On this side of the House and, to be fair to the crossbenchers, I believe far more broadly it is understood that the National Broadband Network and restructuring of telecommunications in this country is a classic piece of microeconomic reform. It is about better competition. Of course, in this country, we have pursued competition policy - and much of this used to be bipartisan politics before the Leader of the Opposition - as a microeconomic reform, and restructuring telecommunications is about competition. It is about creating a transparent regulatory framework that delivers quality, choice and competitiveness - a classic piece of microeconomic reform. It is about creating a marketplace where entrants do not face prohibitive barriers so that you can have more people coming in, offering more diversified products and putting downwards pressure on prices. This is what the government is committed to. We understand that it is a microeconomic reform. But, on the other side, there appears to be emerging a variety of views. We have the Leader of the Opposition saying, 'This isn't a piece of economic reform.' The opposition went to the last election actually saying that. Its policy document said:The Coalition will cancel Labor's reckless and expensive National Broadband Network.Then the Leader of the Opposition tasked the member for Wentworth with demolishing the National Broadband Network. But the member for Wentworth, when he was asked about these things, said on the question of whether or not he was going to demolish the NBN, 'Look, my interest is not in bringing down the NBN or in demolishing the NBN.' It appears that the member for Wentworth is leading the opposition into a new position where it is not going to oppose the structural separation of Telstra, even though that has been coalition policy for some time. Unfortunately, whilst that move to support structural separation is welcome news, it is not joined with an understanding about how structural separation relates to the National Broadband Network. Apparently, the new coalition policy - I think it is their 19th or their 20th - on broadband is to create a new wholesale company codenamed Can Co. Actually I think it should be 'Slow Co.' because the only thing it is going to do is deliver less speed, less competition, less choice and less innovation to Australians. We are determined to deliver the National Broadband Network and, once again, we say to the Leader of the Opposition, 'Support this economic reform.'

 - I do thank the member for his question about today's CPI data, because it is very important. I think it is important because it shows that inflation is moderating. Underlying inflation at 2.4 per cent in the figures today is now at its lowest level in five years. I would have thought those opposite might have had something positive to say about that. CPI inflation for the quarter was 0.7 per cent and over the year it was 2.8 per cent, and this is down from 3.1 per cent.The government is not complacent about these figures. We are not complacent about them at all. We do have a strong economy and, as I was explaining to the House yesterday, very strong job creation. We are now in mining boom mark 2 and that does put a very big obligation on the government to invest in extra capacity in the economy, and no area could be more important here than superfast broadband to lift our productivity, to lift our economic capacity. But it is not just that - it is the investment in the roads and the rail and the ports. It is that investment in capacity which is the best way to secure growth with lower inflation. That is very, very important. We do acknowledge that utility prices have risen substantially in recent times. That has been something that the Prime Minister has addressed at length, firstly in her speech to the Australian Industry Group the other night and again today in the House.As the Prime Minister has explained, that is why we have put in place three tranches of tax cuts over three years, recognising that families are under financial pressure. It is why we put substantial increases into the education childcare cash rebate. It is why we are putting in place the education tax refund. It is why we are supplying additional family payments to families with teenage children. We are doing all of those things. But what we must do over time if we are to achieve sustainable growth with lower inflation is get the economic fundamentals right. There is simply no other alternative and that is why it is so disappointing to see that the economic consensus that we have had in this country has been fractured by those opposite. - Yes, Mr Speaker, I was explaining that fundamental economic reform is, of course, tomorrow's prosperity. It is the key to sustainable growth; it is the key to lower inflation. A price on carbon is part of the fundamental reforms that we require such as the investment in superfast broadband. So fundamental reform is the key to sustainable growth and it is the key to achieving inflation outcomes that are consistent with our objectives. Today, we have seen some commentary from the former Prime Minister Mr Howard. We have also seen some commentary from the former Treasurer Mr Costello. There is one thing that they agree on: that the populism of those opposite is a trashing of their economic reform record.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for that question because, as we were saying in the House the other day, the global financial crisis did have a fundamental impact on competition in our banking sector and it did hit the smaller lenders very hard. Of course, there is no silver bullet solution to this challenge. These are problems that will not be solved overnight. There are a variety of reforms occurring in the international banking sector which have ramifications here. The government has been working very hard to make sure that those reforms are appropriate for Australia because those reforms are very important when it comes to certainty in our financial sector.The government is also committed to reform here domestically when it does come to banking competition. It is the best way to put downward pressure on rates and certainly the best way to assist small business and homeowners. The government has put forward a package of measures to help smaller lenders to compete with the big banks and we have put in place tough new consumer laws to crack down on unfair mortgage exit fees. There is our investment of $16 billion in AAA-rated RMBS. That is important to provide funding support to the smaller lenders. It has been the strength of our system that avoided the destruction that occurred in so many other financial systems around the world.The one thing we know we cannot do is fracture that consensus I was talking about before. Last week we had the shadow Treasurer come out spinning out hot air about how he was going to reregulate the banks and threaten the very independence of the Reserve Bank. So we had this brain implosion last week from the shadow Treasurer and he has spent the last four or five days trying to mop it up. - I was asked for any commentary on recent views about banking regulation and the financial system. I was talking about the fracturing of the bipartisan consensus we have had in this House when it comes to the independence of the Reserve Bank. That has now been fractured by some of the statements that have been made by the shadow Treasurer. There is now a fracturing of consensus within the Liberal Party on the banking system. - This morning the opposition leader was asked three times whether he supported the plan put forward by the shadow Treasurer last Thursday and three times in a row he refused to answer that question. As the Prime Minister said, he had to go out and mop it up later on radio. - This nine-point plan that was put out by the shadow Treasurer last week has now been rejected by a number of frontbenchers. At its core it only really has one proposition - that is, he wants to have an inquiry into the financial system, which simply ignores the fact that we have got this fundamental reformation of the international financial system with all of its implications for Australia and the need for certainty. There is nothing else in any of those nine points but populism. There is no substance. There is about as much meat in the shadow Treasurer's plan as there is in a pack of chicken nuggets.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. It follows the answer that I was giving before, because the government is absolutely committed to making our banking system - and, indeed, our economy - as competitive as possible. I do think there has been a degree of sense in some of the suggestions that have been made by the Chairman of the ACCC. -  - I am sorry, but it was not. It was not a suggestion or an original thought of those opposite at all. This is something that the Chairman of the ACCC has talked about on a number of occasions, and the government has been talking to him about it, as any responsible government would do. What we have put in place so far is a range of very significant reforms, particularly the consumer reforms I was talking about before and, of course, the investment in the AAA rated residential mortgage backed securities, which are securing funding to banks. I have made it very, very clear that there is no justification for very profitable banks moving above any change in the cash rate that should come from the Reserve Bank - no justification at all. The figures from the NAB today proved that yet again. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. She has a number of health services in her electorate and I know, like many on this side of the House, would be concerned about the sheer scale of problems that occur in our hospitals and in our health system. It is extraordinary that today, when the government is making efforts to tackle what is such a serious problem, those opposite have stooped to a new low, putting many thousands of Australian lives at risk.Let me take the parliament through some of these numbers. One in 10 patients in our hospitals across the country experiences an adverse event or has a near miss. One in 30 adult patients contract an infection, which means - for those opposite who are hollering - that two million extra bed days are needed every year because of incidents that occur in our hospitals. And 12,000 Australians every year acquire bloodstream infections. Of those 12,000 people, a quarter - nearly twice the national road toll - die every year because of infections which are acquired in our hospitals.Those opposite are misguided in their view about this legislation, if they want to holler that we should just blame the states. This is a piece of legislation to hold the states accountable, and those opposite have actually voted against it. I would like to highlight - because this is the first piece of health reform legislation that this parliament has voted on - that every National Party member and every Liberal Party member has voted against this measure. I thank those on the crossbenches for supporting this important measure. They obviously are concerned that we do something about these shameful statistics. In fact, those opposite who are still yelling may like to be reminded that the first person who introduced this body as a temporary body was the Leader of the Opposition. But now, extraordinarily, when we seek to make this permanent - so that this body can have some teeth, so that we can actually hold the states, the hospitals and others in the system to account - the Leader of the Opposition and his party are against it.How is this possibly consistent? I think it is clear that the coalition is indicating that when it comes to health reform it is going to block us every step of the way, even if it means that thousands of Australian lives which could be saved will not benefit from these sorts of reforms. It is a great shame that the Leader of the Opposition, who has the decency to smile when he knows he introduced this first step, is now being completely inconsistent. Then you have the member for Dickson, the shadow minister for health, who has shown in two years that he opposes a lot of things but does not stand for anything. He did not want to support a tax on alcopops. He has been anti nurse, he has been anti prevention, he has been anti reform, he has been pro millionaire, he was anti apology when the parliament apologised to Indigenous Australians and now he is even anti safety when thousands of Australians die in our hospitals every year. Shame!</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question. He asks about the bank switching package that we did put in place - something that those opposite could not find the wit to do in 12 years. - The introduction of that package was then followed by the global financial crisis and of course the global recession. It was also followed by a marked reduction in rates. It is true to say that in those circumstances it was not utilised strongly, for commonsense reasons. As I said before, there is no silver bullet when it comes to competition. -  - The bank switching package was part of a range of measures which have been introduced by this government over time, including the ones I was talking about before, such as tough new laws to crack down on unfair mortgage exit fees. That is a very important reform, as are the strong reforms we are putting forward for credit cards and our $16 billion investment in AAA-rated RMBS. There are a number of other reforms, such as strengthening deposit funding for smaller lenders - that is a 50 per cent discount being phased up to $1,000 worth of interest income - and, of course, all of the bank guarantees. I think it is a comprehensive package which is going to help a lot of Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. Today the government has announced the appointment of six people of particularly pertinent expertise who will form the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee. This committee has the task of assessing the proposed methods for developing and selling carbon credits. It is the first step in the implementation of the government's Carbon Farming Initiative. When the Carbon Farming Initiative is up and running it will enable farmers, foresters and landholders to receive offset credits for actions that reduce or store carbon pollution. These credits can be sold and thus provide opportunities to generate income. This is an initiative that is good for rural and regional Australia.The Carbon Farming Initiative will cover a wide range of practices in the land and agricultural sector. It has the capacity and the potential to provide significant benefits. Farmers and landholders can use the income stream that is generated from their carbon abatement to reinvest in their businesses, their farms and their communities. Activities such as reforestation, capturing emissions from existing landfills, better livestock management, improved soil practices and savannah fire management are just some of the many methods that may generate carbon credits.It is encouraging to see that businesses in the carbon markets are already getting ready for this initiative. Only recently, a company known as Carbon Conscious has undertaken to trade 10,000 of these credits. It has the potential to be quite a significant market and one of significant benefit to the rural sector of the economy.The role of the committee, the members of which have been announced today, will be to ensure that the carbon credits that are generated under the Carbon Farming Initiative will have market integrity and will lead to sound environmental outcomes. Stakeholders will be engaged on the detail of the Carbon Farming Initiative and formal public consultation will take place during this year and early next year.This is one very tangible and constructive way for members of the House, particularly those who are representing rural and regional communities, to engage with the government's action to deal with the challenge of climate change. I encourage those members of the House, particularly those representing rural and regional communities, to do so. Of course, members of the House such as the member for New England and the member for Lyne have already been engaged in some conversation with the government about this issue. I think it is an important issue and I encourage other members of the House to similarly take a constructive rather than obstructionist approach.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. There has been very substantial reform already in the area of ATM fees and I think that has made that sector much more competitive. So, no, I do not accept the policy that is being put forward, but I do accept that over time there has been a need for much more competition in this area. We are seeing the substantial results of that now and I am happy to send that to the member for him to have a look at. We are discussing what I regard as very important issues about the competitiveness of our banking system and what we can do to make it more competitive over time. The government has been focused on those issues.The government is extremely focused on the reforms coming through the new Basel 3 proposals, which are being processed by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Indeed, when the Prime Minister and I go to the G20 conference in Seoul those proposals will be a central part of our discussions. Our regulators have been involved in all of those discussions about how those reforms will apply in this country. We have put forward the view that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to the Basel 3 framework. That is all very important for competition and stability in the Australian banking system, and that is one of the reasons I reject the call by the shadow Treasurer for an inquiry.What our sector needs at the moment is certainty as we bed down the fundamental reforms in our banking system that go to the very core of the flow of credit in our economy. We all saw two years ago what can happen when international financial markets seize - our local system is threatened. So this is a very important reform that the government is bedding down. As I have said in previous answers today, we believe that we must always be alert to putting more competition into our banking system domestically, and I have run through some of the very important measures that we have put in place.I do believe we will see the benefits of the new consumer laws that we have put through this parliament and in particular our proposals which will enable people to do something about unfair mortgage exit fees. This is a proposal that was put forward by the former Minister for Financial Services and is a very important reform. But there are many others. I went through all of those before. I welcome discussion and debate about this important question because it goes to the very core not only of our prosperity and the flow of credit in our economy but also of the living standards of all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. The events off the west coast of Sumatra yesterday, Australian time, are a stark reminder to the House of the impact of natural disasters on our region, the frequency of those disasters, the possibility of them resulting in huge losses of life and the necessary arrangements which we have to have in place to help our friends and partners in the region in dealing with these challenges. In recent years, after the tsunami of 2004, we have had the major earthquake in Yogyakarta in 2006, followed by major earthquakes in West Java and West Sumatra in 2009.For the information of honourable members, the most recent quake struck at 1.40 am yesterday, Australian Eastern Standard Time, 78 kilometres off the west of South Pagai, one of Indonesia's remote Mentawai Islands, west of Sumatra. According to Indonesian authorities, the resulting tsunami wave was some three metres tall. So far, we know it has affected 10 isolated villages and we have seen reports that up to 100 villagers have lost their lives. We are still seeking to ascertain the final death toll and injury toll. The Australian Embassy in Jakarta is working with our friends in Indonesia to ascertain the degree of damage and loss of life, and we have instructed our ambassador in Jakarta to offer the Indonesian government all forms of appropriate assistance.On the question of the safety of Australians, which goes to the other part of the honourable member's question, as the Prime Minister indicated in her statement earlier today in question time we have been apprised that no Australians died or have been injured as a result of this earthquake and tsunami. However, we have positioned a consular official on the ground at Padang who is liaising with local authorities to make absolutely certain that is the case. The Prime Minister indicated before what occurred in relation to the vessel Southern Cross, and we are pleased that those young men have been located safe and sound. I thank our consular emergency centre for the good work that they have done.I should also alert the House to what happened with other Australians when this tsunami hit. I am advised the wave tore two charter boats, with Australian surfers on board, from their anchorages at the Macaronis break on Pagai. The boats then collided with a vessel, the motor cruiser MV Midas. It burst into flames, forcing eight Australian surfers from the Gold Coast and a New Zealander to leap into the water. Some of the men were reportedly swept some hundreds of metres into the jungle by the tsunami and they were forced to cling to trees until the surge subsided. Consular officials are now assisting with the provision of emergency travel documents for these Australians.This is a stark reminder for Australians travelling in the region about the impact of these disasters and how that can affect them, and the importance of maintaining a proper system of registration with Australian embassies abroad for Australians travelling.The honourable member also asks about our broader cooperation with Indonesia. I would remind honourable members of what we have been doing through the Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction. Between 2008 and 2013 we will be investing $67 million to enhance Indonesia's overall capacity to respond to natural disasters of this type. We also support a program called Build Back Better to assist villagers and other centres to recover from natural disasters. We believe this is the right thing to do with our friends and partners in Indonesia. The Prime Minister will visit there soon. This is an important relationship for Australia, and helping on these occasions is important as well.</DOC>

 - As I have said to this House before and elsewhere beyond the House, the reason the government - including the Prime Minister, the immigration minister and me - support a proposal for a regional processing centre in the context of a regional protection framework is that (1) it is compatible with the UN convention on refugees, (2) it is capable of attaining the support of the UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration and (3) it has the support of regional countries. The honourable member raises that latter point in terms of the reaction from regional countries. I would draw her attention to the response by the President of East Timor to statements made by both the Prime Minister and the immigration minister concerning the East Timorese government's reception to the Australian government's proposal as a basis for further consultation, discussion and negotiation, including through the Bali process.It is natural that in any country dealing with questions of asylum seekers democratic debates will occur. I would have thought that is natural and normal in this place - it is natural and normal in East Timor; it is natural and normal in Indonesia; it is natural and normal in any other country.The government proceeds to support this policy because it is consistent with the three principles I enunciated before. I draw to the attention of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition the reason, for example, that Nauru fails this test and why the previous government ignored the convention. Nauru was not a signatory to the refugees convention. The UNHCR ceased to process asylum seekers on Nauru because of its concerns about the then government's processing arrangements on Nauru. Therefore, the government's approach then failed all basic humanitarian and international legal tests - tests which this government takes seriously and which form the basis of the government's current approach to this challenge which faces not only us but other countries around the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for the question. Members might be aware that the 2010 census that was conducted by the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency showed that just 8.4 per cent of board directorships in Australia's top 200 companies are held by women. To put this in context, we can compare that figure with New Zealand, the UK, Canada, the US and South Africa and we find that Australia has the lowest percentages of women in our most senior corporate positions.These figures are dreadful but they are not just bad news for women; they are bad news for business and they are bad news for our global competitiveness. It does not make good business sense not to be tapping into all of the skills, all of the expertise and all of the education that we possess, which is a fact that the Male Champions of Change group, who are working with our Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Liz Broderick, recognise as they work to spread the word within corporate Australia that in fact gender diversity is good news for business.It is something that is also clearly demonstrated in the 2009 McKinsey report, which found that companies with three or more women in top management outperformed companies with no women executives on every single organisational and financial indicator. Apart from all these facts, it is also just plain wrong. We should not be supporting structures and cultures which block out women from our corporate boardrooms.We are determined to see positive change when it comes to increased representation of women on both public sector boards and private sector boards. We made an election commitment to ensuring that by 2015 all government boards would have a minimum of 40 per cent representation of women and 40 per cent representation of men. I am pleased today to announce that this week we honoured another election commitment to the status of women when applications opened for the Board Diversity Scholarship Program under which 70 women will be provided with a scholarship to undertake key courses such as the Australian Institute of Company Directors company director course. In partnership with the AICD, this program is aimed at getting Australian women who have the skills, expertise and education a seat at the boardroom table. I encourage members opposite, whose commitment to women's representation was shown when in fact their party went backwards in women's representation in the parliament at the most recent election, to encourage women within their own electorates to apply for these scholarships, which can be found at www.company directors.com.au, and then go to diversity scholarships.As we work in partnership, sadly I am of the understanding it is in fact the first time since 1979 that the status of women is not represented in the shadow ministry as well as it is in the ministry. But we will continue to work with the private sector to ensure that women are not shut out of positions and that our corporate boardrooms show that the sorts of statistics we are seeing now are consigned to the past, which is where they belong.</DOC>

 - I did have a discussion with the Premier of South Australia yesterday. It was a very constructive discussion which he did report to the House in South Australia. He reported to the House, for example, that the federal government was dealing with the issue of education. The Premier of South Australia made it clear to the South Australian parliament, for example, that we had said very clearly that any school which does not have capacity to take extra students would not be asked to take extra students; that the federal government would work with the state government to explore all opportunities.I am sorry to disappoint the member for Mayo but I am more than happy to go to Inverbrackie and I will be going to Inverbrackie to discuss these issues. What I will be doing there is engaging with community leaders who want to engage with the federal government to get a good result for their community. I will be engaging with people like Mayor Cooksley, just as I will be engaging with Mayor Pollard of Northam and the member for Pearce and the state member for Central Wheatbelt in Western Australia - two members, the member for Pearce and the member for Central Wheatbelt, who have very vigorously represented the views of their constituents, very vigorously stood up for their constituents, but have done so in a very constructive way, unlike the member for Mayo, who seems intent on engaging in Young Liberal stunts instead of representing his community.What I will be saying to the people is also a continuation of the conversations I have had with both mayors, with the member for Pearce and with other community representatives - that is, on the matter of health, there will be no negative impacts on health services at either site whatsoever. The federal government has been very clear about that. In relation to education, we will work with the independent schools who have asked to take extra students from the facility at Inverbrackie. We will, if necessary, bring teachers into the facilities so there is no impact on local schools. I am confident that when that consultation is complete the people of Inverbrackie and the people of Northam may have a similar reaction to the people of Weipa. As I said yesterday on ABC Far North Coast -  - Yesterday, on my favourite radio station, ABC Far North Queensland, Peter Miller, the acting chair of the Weipa Town Authority, said of our consultation in relation to the Scherger site, 'I believe that the concerns of the committee have been addressed or are being addressed. Generally it is only positive things now for Weipa.' That is what you can achieve when you engage positively. This government has engaged in far more discussion with the local community than the member for Berowra ever did when he opened detention centres at Baxter, Woomera, Curtin and elsewhere. This government is actually talking to local communities, something the previous government never did when they engaged in opening detention centres across the country. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question and her advocacy for freedom of information. This is a very important reform. When Labor came to government in 2007, it undertook to overhaul Australia's freedom of information laws. It did this to restore transparent government following a decade of secrecy and concealment. We abolished conclusive certificates and, in doing so, abolished the power of a minister to lock up information because it did not suit the government's interests. Indeed Labor is continuing to restore openness and transparency and trust and integrity, with further reforms to our freedom of information laws to take effect from 1 November 2010. Next week marks the commencement of those laws and also marks the commencement of the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. The former Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor John McMillan AO, will take up the role and will work with public sector agencies to improve community access to government-held information. Professor McMillan and the new Freedom of Information Commissioner will be independent advocates for FOI and will encourage the spread of pro-disclosure information and a pro-disclosure culture right across the government, which is a very good thing.We recognise that these are important reforms. We also recognise that there has been a deterrent to having access to such information as a result of the fees that currently stand. As a result of that, we are looking to change the fees and charges - that is, to remove fees and charges, especially for people who seek personal information. Previously a person seeking access to their own information could be liable for fees and charges of up to $100. From next week there will be no charge for a person seeking access to personal information. For all applicants for general information the government has abolished the $30 application fee for FOI requests and also will abolish the $40 fee -  - As I said, we are abolishing fees - firstly, a $30 fee for FOI applications and also a $40 fee for applications to review FOI decisions. These are important reforms which will make it easier for people to access information. In addition, the government has decided to make the first five hours of decision making free, not only to journalists and non-government organisations but to the public at large - a significant reform as well. From 1 November there will be a single public interest test in dealing with exemptions, which will favour disclosure of a document unless the public interest lies in non-disclosure. From May next year, as a key part of the pro-disclosure reforms there will be a requirement for public sector agencies to publish any information disclosed in response to an FOI request within 10 days of that disclosure. That will provide information to everybody, not just to the applicant who sought that information.During the Howard years the coalition practised secrecy and concealment. This government believes in openness and transparency and for that reason these reforms are very important and we are very happy to introduce them.

 - The way the Water Act has been described of late you would think it was a recent Labor invention. The water reform process had bipartisan support and the legislation was brought in under the previous government. In advance of the formal consultative process that comes under the Water Act, the authority has made its own decision to release an advanced document called The Guide. They have made that decision independently and it is for them to make that decision.A large number of issues have caused concern for various communities. Regardless of the level of argument that is contained within the question, I do take in good faith the motivation of the questioner. He on many occasions - as long as I have known him - has spoken of the many mental health challenges that are faced by his community in particular. The irrigation drought was felt more deeply in Mildura than in many other parts of Australia. The work that he has done there with the community has always been constructive and I do take him at face value on that.On the question about visiting communities, those who listened to the adjournment debate last night would know I was in Griffith last Friday with the member for Riverina. It was a very constructive meeting with community leaders and irrigators. During the week before that I was in Trangie with the Trangie-Neverfail irrigation authority -  - Nevertire. I apologise; you are right. Mildura obviously is going to be one of the key places which I will be visiting as well. Similar to how it went with the member for Riverina, I do believe the goodwill of the member will lead to our having a constructive visit together. There are three things that I have been saying the whole way through this process that we need to get through water reform. We need to get healthy rivers - we absolutely need to have a healthy river system; we need to have strong communities; and we need to have strong food production. I have argued those three principles the whole way through, long before The Guide ever came out.There was doubt as to whether or not under the Water Act we would be able to deliver those things, so I sought independent legal advice. In advance of that advice coming out, the minister with responsibility for the Water Act at the time - the member for Wentworth - had been saying that the act did allow you to optimise your environmental, economic and social consequences. That view was consistent with the view I had been putting about where we needed to get with a healthy river, with strong communities, with strong food production. The legal advice confirmed that the view that had been put publicly by the member for Wentworth was in fact reflected in the legislation and was in fact reflected in the international instruments that underpinned the legislation. But the Water Act says we need to get to the end of the process before we get final numbers. That does mean that there is a level of uncertainty for communities and we all wish that we could go through a process without having levels of uncertainty for communities on the way through.The reality is that the uncertainty is only there to the extent that the consultation is real, and the consultation on these issues is absolutely real. Let us not forget: no-one is going to be able to walk away from this. Ultimately, the instruments that are signed need to be able to survive a vote in each house of the parliament. That is where this ends up. But no-one will be pleased with us if we allow further uncertainty and we fail in the basic task of reform of the Murray-Darling Basin.</DOC>

 - I will briefly take this opportunity to welcome Mr Oakeshott Sr and to point out that Mr Oakeshott Sr and the mum of the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency were the tennis captains at Lismore High some little time ago.Obviously trade is fundamental to Australia's future prosperity and to the generation of high-skill, high-wage jobs. I was asked about the region - I will be visiting a number of countries in the region. On Monday I will be visiting Korea; on Tuesday, China; on Wednesday, Hong Kong; and on Thursday, Singapore. So it will be a whirlwind tour, but one that will be very important in furthering Australia's trade objectives.This visit will be ahead of the APEC ministerial meeting, which I will be involved in. What is fundamentally important about APEC is that this was an organisation to promote free trade in the region. It was an initiative of the Hawke Labor government, furthered by the Keating Labor government - a very important and shining example of economic reform. We will be delivering a report on the Bogor Declaration, the goal of which was free and open trade by 2010. That report will be delivered on the back of the pledges that were made back in 1994 and it will be great when Australia can report that we have substantially achieved free and open trade. Why? Because we have embraced economic reform.This country, under the leadership of Hawke and Keating and in places furthered by the Howard government, has embraced economic reform, but unfortunately we are now going through a period in which the Liberal Party is moving to the far right to the position occupied by Pauline Hanson and Lyndon La Rouche. - The problem with this is that it is antireform. This leader is antireform and the one person who could unite John Howard and Peter Costello is Tony Abbott, because they said that this man has no interest in economics whatsoever. We will continue to embrace economic reform in this country, but we will -  - The relevance is that we need to lock in our trade competitiveness. We will only do that through ongoing economic reform under the Labor government led by Prime Minister Julia Gillard. We will not cop the cheapjack populism of the man opposite, the cheapjack populism of the Liberal Party embracing Hanson economics. We are not going to cop it. We are going to continue with reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. We have been able to achieve it due to a number of factors. First of all, we got rid of Work Choices, something welcomed by the whole of the Australian community. Second, we restored rights and fairness in the workplace system, because all good workplace systems should be based around fairness. Third, we simplified the industrial relations system - we reduced 3,000 awards to 122 modern awards and Access Economics has estimated that this alone will benefit the economy by almost $5 billion over the decade.In addition to that, we have invested in skills and in infrastructure, because we understand that the opportunity to participate more effectively in a marketplace, in a changing workplace, is dependent on those investments. The end result has been an incredible increase in jobs in this country - over the three years we have been in office 600,000 jobs have been created. We have also seen an increase in productivity, because fairness does of itself produce the productivity dividend. Through that increase in productivity we have also been able to see an increase in real wages, because it has to be understood that you can effectively only sustain real wage growth if you do lift productivity. So ours is a dual approach based on fairness but also driving productivity.I have been asked if there is any critical commentary as to this success that the government have achieved over the last three years. There has been, indeed today. I was interested to read in the Australian newspaper today that Peter Reith is back in town. People might remember Peter Reith; he was the original architect of Work Choices. There he was in the paper today, and he has said that the Australian workplace has been degraded. As I said, he was the original architect of Work Choices, now it is another Lazarus rising from the grave in terms of that thing that they said was buried - like the Rottweiler returning to its mess, that is what it reminds us of.I will tell this House what degraded the industrial relations system in the workplace. It was decisions that Peter Reith was responsible for that saw a government conspiring to sack workers, a government legislating to strip them of their entitlements and at the same time urging other employers to follow suit. That is not the Australian way. It is why we opposed it, why we will continue to oppose it and why the Australian people will continue to support us in that endeavour.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question, I understand, and the government understands, that Australian families are struggling with cost-of-living pressures. We do understand that and we understand that a contributor to those cost-of living-pressures is electricity prices. When the Leader of the Opposition asked me a similar question yesterday, I did explain to him and to the House that pressure on electricity prices arises in part from underinvestment in electricity generation capacity and that, in order to get certainty into the market to facilitate investment, particularly in long-term baseload power, businesses and the electricity sector are asking us for certainty about carbon pricing.On the general cost-of-living issues I reiterate the points that I made yesterday. I understand that it is a struggle for families. The government understands that and that is why we have done things like introduce the Fair Work Act so that people have security as to their pay packets and living standards - something they did not enjoy under Work Choices when, on any day, they could have had an Australian workplace agreement shoved into their hand and had their pay and conditions reduced.We have acted to assist families with cost-of-living pressures when it comes to education. We understand that there are costs involved in getting the kids back to school, which is why we introduced the education tax rebate and will add to it by enabling the deductibility of costs related to school uniforms. We understand that for families with young children, particularly in circumstances where the partner providing the care - usually the mother - wants to return to work, that occasions childcare costs. Consequently, we increased the child care tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent and we will move to fortnightly payments.We also understand that families with teenagers have particular pressures. Teenagers are not cheaper to support than younger children, and that is why we will move in this parliament to increase the family tax benefit arrangements for families with teenagers. For families on the maximum range, that will be a benefit of more than $4,000 a year. Indeed, to assist families with cost-of-living pressures, that is why we have also been pleased and proud to provide tax cuts for three years in a row to assist families with those pressures. As I said to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, and I am happy to repeat it today, we want to make sure we are working with families for their long-term security. Doing that does require us to work through the difficult question of carbon pricing to give certainty to the electricity generation sector to facilitate long-term investments.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. She represents in this place a region that has gone through a fundamental economic transformation and she knows that, as hard as it is, economic reform needs to be dealt with if people are going to have a prosperous future. As I have already said to the parliament during this question time, the debate of the last week has been a debate about who has the courage and conviction to deliver economic reform and who will shirk that task even though it is so important for the nation's future. It is apparent that the government's economic reform agenda will be resisted at all costs by the opposition, and that is to be deeply regretted because our nation needs to keep reforming if it is to be prosperous for the future. We need to keep reforming if we are going to give Australians the benefit of opportunity. We need to keep reforming if we are going to ensure that our nation can hold its competitive place in the world.Central to that reform is ensuring that we have the infrastructure of the future - roads, rail and ports, as well as the National Broadband Network. Central to that reform is our human capital agenda to make sure that Australians have the skills and capacities they need to compete in the world. Central to that reform are participation reforms to ensure that we have Australians of working age with the capacity to be in the labour market and assisting us, particularly as our society is ageing and we will see an increase in the dependency ratio. Stumping up to reform in health care is also pivotal to the future of Australians and making sure that they will have the healthcare system they need there sustainably for the long term. Of course, for our environment and our economic future we need to address the difficult reforms of pricing carbon and dealing with water.I am not someone who has over the course of my political life much agreed with John Howard, but I did agree with him yesterday when he told an anecdote that stood out for me. He said:_ in 1995 when the last Budget of the Keating Government was brought down on the afternoon of Budget day, Kim Beazley rang me, he was Finance Minister. He rang me and said 'John, you still in favour of the privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank?' Because that had been our policy for years I said 'Yes'. 'We're going to propose it in the Budget' and I said 'We'll vote for it'. We'd have been total hypocrites to have voted against that _Those words are, I think, wise words, because in the parliament this week it has become apparent that the Leader of the Opposition is shaping up to vote against healthcare reform that when he was health minister he would have advocated. So I would refer him to the words of John Howard and to, most particularly, that last sentence referring to 'total hypocrites'.But there does seem to be a bit of a fightback on in the opposition against things like the shadow Treasurer's plan to reregulate interest rates. I note that the members for Wentworth and Goldstein, amongst others, are being painted as the ones responsible for the leak, part of their fightback presumably against this economic Hansonism. I also note today's newspapers say the shadow cabinet has concluded, as has also been suggested, that policy approaches be fully thought out next time before they are flagged. We can have bipartisanship on that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I can absolutely assure him I take the concerns of Australians seriously, I take the concerns of Australians who want to leave a decent environment for their children and their grandchildren seriously and I take seriously the concerns of Australians who look at the household bills and then look at their pay packets and wonder how it is all going to add up. Because we take these things seriously, we have done a series of things to assist those families. I know it can still be tough, but let us imagine how much tougher it would be for those families if the laws in workplace relations that the member asking the question supports were still the laws of this country and next week's pay packet was cut from the one of the week before. Of course, we have stepped up to assist working families with the cost of education, with child care, with tax cuts and we have promises to implement -  -  - As I was saying in answering the question that was put to me, we do take the concerns of Australians seriously and that is why we have moved and will continue to move to implement measures to assist families with costs. That is why we will deliver things like the increase in the family tax benefit to assist families with the cost of teenagers. I would say to the member who asked the question that I understand that families are concerned about electricity prices. I would refer him to experts in the industry and I would refer him particularly to the quote that I took the Leader of the Opposition to before. I think it makes a real point. The TRUenergy managing director said:We all would like a price on carbon._            _            _If it's not done _ then you will have power shortages and insufficient capacity.This joins a chorus of other voices and analyses from the sector about the consequences of underinvestment, underinvestment which will not be rectified, and generating the kind of long-term baseload power we need until we have got the certainty of a price on carbon. I am also a little bit amazed that the member comes into the parliament apparently so in high dudgeon and het up about these questions, because I would refer him to another important quote:I also think that if you want to put a price on carbon why not just do it with a simple tax? Why not ask motorists to pay more? Why not ask electricity consumers to pay more? It would be burdensome, all taxes are burdensome, but it would certainly change the price of carbon, raise the price of carbon, without increasing in any way the overall tax burden.There we have it. Whose words are they? They are the Leader of the Opposition's words. So we have seen this Leader of the Opposition and the members behind him looking for seams of political advantage here. We will continue looking at the national interest and be driven by that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question because overnight we have seen the release of the Access Economics Investment Monitor, which puts the total project pipeline underway or in planning at around $770 billion. That is an increase of over $85 billion on the previous year and there is something like $270 billion in projects already underway or committed. There is something like $100 billion of mining projects either under construction or committed and a further $200 billion in mining projects under consideration. By any measure by any country in the world, this is a very substantial pipeline of investment.And it is not just in mining; the good news is that it is broader than that. There are upgrades in manufacturing, transport and other industries. So we have strong fundamentals in our economy and they are underpinned by a remarkable pipeline in investment. So the economy is making that transition from stimulus, which was necessary during the global financial crisis and the global recession, and moving over to private investment which is producing and supporting very substantial job creation in our economy.Of course, it also brings with it the challenges of mining boom mark 2, ones which the government is preparing the country for. We know we need to invest in infrastructure, particularly in our mining regions. We know we have to build the capacity of our economy. We know that over 25 years important reforms have been put in place, starting with the Hawke and Keating governments. We know that we have put in place fundamental pillars of reform from the floating of the dollar, to the bringing down of the tariff wall, to the introduction of national superannuation policy, competition policy and the reform of our financial sector. All of these things have been very important in making our economy so strong.We know that it is the reform of today that builds the prosperity of tomorrow. We know that over the past week those fundamental pillars have been questioned by those opposite. We have had the shadow finance minister threatening to intervene, saying the country needs to intervene in the float of the dollar. We have had the shadow Treasurer who wants to undermine decades of consensus about the independence of the Reserve Bank and somehow intervene there. We have had the shadow communications minister -  - We have had the shadow communications minister wanting to undermine the shadow finance minister and the shadow Treasurer because they have been undermining these essential pillars of our future prosperity. We have had that. For our part, we will go on with building a stronger economy with the essential reform which is required to create jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and presume he is referring to some documents associated with modelling the effects of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Can I say to the member who has asked the question: in this parliament we are working in good faith through a Multi-Party Climate Change Committee to look at the question of pricing carbon. I know that the member who asked the question has devoted a considerable portion of his life to studying and analysing these questions and writing a thesis on them, so I presume he is someone who probably believes that you need to price carbon and he probably has a view about the mechanisms for doing it. Of course, the purpose of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee is to bring together people of goodwill who are -  - I indicated that obviously modelling associated with the CPRS was being quoted, of course. Then for the future - and I presume the opposition has some passing interest in the future, though by their conduct that is hard to pick - the question of carbon pricing will be dealt with by the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee that will work through it, in good faith, to look at various options. Obviously, the government will then make decisions in relation to the question.I say to the member who asked the question - who I believe knows that we do as a nation have to face up to the question of pricing carbon - that we do as a nation have to work through the best ways of doing that. I think the member probably does believe that. It is a pity that he is hostage to an anti-reform opposition that would prefer to come into this parliament and play politics rather than make a positive and constructive contribution to a major debate in this nation.I say to the member who has asked the question: we will continue to build the nation; we will continue to work through the economic reform questions the nation needs addressed. It will not be easy. There will be some difficult moments along the way, but we will do it because that is in the best interests of the Australian people. Those opposite are indicating by their conduct, day by day, that they would prefer to look for political advantage, they would prefer to be known as the wreckers of reform and, if that leaves us a poorer nation, then they are prepared to make Australian families pay that price. It is a despicable way of approaching politics.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It is one of the government's highest priorities to ensure that we do everything possible to protect our troops in the field in Afghanistan. This is also one of the highest priorities of the Chief of the Defence Force and the service chiefs generally.The member asked me about measures which are being implemented. Members might recall that in the May budget of this year the government announced, after a review requested by my predecessor, Minister Faulkner, the adoption of a $1.1 billion program to implement enhanced new force protection measures for our troops in Afghanistan. This added to about half a billion dollars of existing measures. In the budget this year, we saw over the financial period 2009-10 to 2012-13 $1.6 billion of enhanced measures for force protection. Of the 48 measures announced or effected in the budget, the department and the CDF implemented a very tight timetable, a rigorous schedule and a rigorous system of monitoring to ensure that these measures were introduced as soon as practically possible.There is some interest in the implementation today because, yesterday, as a result of a number of media outlets requesting the incoming government brief from the Department of Defence, a redacted version - in other words, with national security and sensitive matter eliminated - was supplied to media outlets which contains a schedule of the implementation of these measures. Of course, some time has elapsed since the presentation of the incoming government brief. The advice I have from Defence yesterday and today is that, of the 48 measures that were announced effectively in that budget, 36 of the 48 have either been completed or are on track. There are 12 about which our monitoring program has issues of concern, a couple of which go to timing. So far as timing is concerned, there are concerns about the delayed implementation for additional protection measures for buildings that our troops occupy or live in and some highly technical measures for the electronic triggering of improvised devices.Mr Speaker, as you would expect, it would not be appropriate to deal with some areas of these matters in public. That is also reflected in the redacted nature of the decision made by the freedom of information decision-maker. All of these matters particularly go to enhanced anti-improvised explosive device measures - the roadside bombs that our troops and patrols encounter, overhead surveillance, mine clearance, improved helmets and armour, and the like.As I said at the outset, the government and the service have no higher priority than ensuring that every practical measure we can reasonably take is in place for the protection of our troops. The Chief of the Defence Force has consistently made it clear, most recently at estimates, and the government has made it clear, that these matters are under continual review because circumstances always change. The threat is ever there; the threat is ever present. We continue to experience both difficult and dangerous circumstances in Afghanistan, and the techniques used by the Taliban change. So these matters continue to be under constant review.</DOC>

 - I genuinely thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question because what it obviously enables me to advise the House and to remind the Leader of the Opposition - I am surprised he has forgotten - is that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme did not become the law of this country because, despite a bipartisan commitment to it, negotiated when the member for Wentworth was the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Groom was conducting the negotiations -  -  - The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme did not become the law of this country because, despite negotiating its provisions to ensure bipartisan support, when the member for Warringah became Leader of the Opposition he crashed the deal, a hand had been shaken, an agreement -  - I am answering the question. The Leader of the Opposition appears to be interested in the history of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and I would refer him to the words that I think are the best summation of the history of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and what happened to it. They are to be found in the blog of the member for Wentworth. The words say - it references 'Tony' but of course he is referring to the Leader of the Opposition - the Leader of the Opposition - _ himself has, in just four or five months, publicly advocated the blocking of the ETS, the passing of the ETS, the amending of the ETS and, if the amendments were satisfactory, passing - Opposition members - Hear, hear! - I am asked about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and its history, and the words I am reading are the most accurate rendition of the history of this matter. The member for Wentworth goes on, after recording these five positions of the Leader of the Opposition:His - the Leader of the Opposition's - only redeeming virtue in this remarkable lack of conviction is that every time he announced a new position to me he would preface it with 'Mate, mate, I know I am a bit of a weather vane on this _'For those interested in the history of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, that is it. -  - I only need a few more seconds to say thank you for your summation of what the question was about - the changing circumstances of this policy. The words I have read from the member for Wentworth are the most accurate summation of those changing circumstances and they go to the remarkable lack of conviction of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chifley and would like to congratulate him on his first speech, which he delivered earlier today. I extend to him, certainly, my warm welcome. We were colleagues in our former working lives and I am very pleased that he is a colleague in the parliament with us now.The issue of climate change presents very serious public policy questions, and they are not going to be answered by the sort of opportunistic rubbish we have been hearing again from the opposition in question time. A carbon price is a significant and necessary economic reform. It is a reform that will create an incentive to cut pollution; it is a reform that will drive investment in low-emissions technologies and clean energy and create new jobs; and it is a reform that will ensure our long-term economic competitiveness. A market mechanism is the most efficient and cost-effective way of establishing a carbon price, and that is a very widely held view.It was a point that was made again yesterday by former Prime Minister John Howard in the Press Club - that is, that a market mechanism is the most efficient way of reducing carbon pollution and introducing a price on carbon into our economy. Of course, Mr Howard made the point that he continued to support an emissions trading scheme as the best policy response to climate change. We also know that that is the advice the former Prime Minister gave to the shadow Treasurer during the time of the leadership upheaval in the Liberal Party towards the end of last year.In contrast, the so-called direct action policy now championed by the opposition, using taxpayers' funds to try to pick winners, is more akin to a Soviet style command -  - I was being relevant to the question in that I was asked about market mechanisms and, of course, this is something that under the opposition leader has been abandoned as a policy position. In fact, the opposition is losing its way on economic policy.Earlier in question time, reference was made to Mr Grant King, the head of Origin Energy, and to some comments he made several months ago - in April this year - remarking upon the potentiality for a threefold increase in electricity prices by the end of this decade. It was represented, I think by the member for Menzies, that that threefold increase was somehow related to the introduction of a carbon price. Over the ensuing six months there has been considerable opportunity to discuss with Mr King exactly the intent of his comments. Far from reflecting upon the impact of a market mechanism for a carbon price, he was making the point that the transmission network costs were going to increase and that in the absence of a carbon price we would face increases of that nature. Mr King knows well, as the head of Origin Energy, how important it is to have a carbon price mechanism in our economy. The type of policy opportunism that we hear from the opposition, the inconsistency in policy positions, generates further uncertainty for the business community.The House could consider for a moment the circumstances for the business community should the opposition adopt an economically responsible and coherent position. It would be in the national interest for there to be a community of view about the appropriateness and necessity for a market mechanism, a carbon price to be introduced into the economy.

 - I thank the member for his question. What I would say to the member is that Professor Garnaut is very expert in questions of carbon pricing, which is why he is one of the experts who will advise the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. I would also say to the member, who obviously wants to engage in the fear campaign of the opposition, that it is not appropriate for the member to try to create in the minds of the Australian community that there is somehow a mechanism to deal with carbon pricing to deal with reducing carbon emissions which means no change and no costs. Indeed, the member went to the election advocating a policy which would have had costs. If the member who asked the question had become the Deputy Prime Minister after this election -  - he would have received the Treasury incoming brief, or would have been advised of it - I doubt he would have been Treasurer -  - and he would have been told:Direct Action measures - that is, the direct action measures that the member asking the question went to the election with - alone cannot do the job without imposing significant economic and budget costs _ Moreover, many of the direct action measures cannot be scaled up to achieve significant levels of abatement -  - I ask the member to accept one simple proposition which is, if we are to tackle climate change, if we are to meet the targets we have set ourselves on a bipartisan basis as a nation, if we are to transform our economy in the way we need to then, yes, there will be some costs and, yes, there is a question of how you work through costs - absolutely. What the member simply cannot do is come into this place and pretend that he stands for a policy that somehow has no costs. - If he is of the view that his policy has no costs, he would have been quickly corrected by the incoming brief to the government which would have pointed out the considerable costs arising from his policy.On the question of electricity pricing, about which I was asked, I refer the member - </DOC>

 - I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question and acknowledge the fact that his predecessor, the former member for Chifley, was here in the House today. When we took our places in the 43rd Parliament, there was some concern about how well the new parliament would function. It has certainly exceeded expectations in terms of its effectiveness and in terms of appropriate debates on legislation before this House. Indeed, in just this fortnight 29 pieces of legislation have passed this House and today we saw a historic event. Today we saw the first morning of votes on private members' business before this parliament.The first item of private members' business that was voted upon was the private member's bill by the member for Denison, the Evidence Amendment (Journalists' Privilege) Bill 2010. I congratulate the member for Denison for putting forward that piece of legislation and for securing the support of everyone in the House. The bill passed this parliament at 9.15 and 41 seconds this morning. As a new member, the member for Denison might not be aware that his bill was the first piece of private members' legislation to pass the House this century. For that I think he should be congratulated.Then we went to the second bill before the House, the Commission of Inquiry into the Building the Education Revolution Program Bill 2010. We have heard a lot of squawking from the member for Sturt about the BER bill and the need for a royal commission into the BER, but when it came to the crunch he could not even come into this parliament and call for a division on it. - We provide opportunities for private members to move bills before this House. We do that in the expectation they will actually follow them through, but the member for Sturt could not get through to have a vote. But we will offer recommittal. We support recommittal of votes, as we did in the debate on the standing orders, but the member for Sturt moved a change making it more difficult. But I indicate on behalf of the government that we would be prepared to support a suspension of standing orders in order for him to vote on that legislation, because he has pretended after the event that he never actually wanted a vote on the legislation. You would not compare him with Rocky Balboa, but it is a bit like a heavyweight championship fight where you challenge your opponent; you go on about it day after day, week after week, month after month; and then you do not turn up when the fight is on.It was an unbelievable performance, backed up by the member for Sturt's attempt to move that the Prime Minister be no longer heard. That was never done to former Prime Minister Howard - never. We would not even think of treating the parliament like that. But the member for Sturt has not even got the ticker to own up, to fess up to it. He should fess up. He should take Mr Costello's advice. Mr Costello has been out there again saying that his parents always told him, 'If you have done nothing wrong; you have nothing to fear by telling the truth.' The member for Sturt should tell the truth, say he stuffed up this morning, say he was not fair dinkum about the BER and say that it was all a stunt.

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. I certainly do welcome an informed discussion about our financial system and about the relative strength of the various components of our financial system. I welcome a discussion about the need for greater competitive forces in our financial system and the need for there to be greater competition against our four major banks. Those four major banks are large, well capitalised and of course very profitable.This involves a couple of essential elements of policy that need to be understood very clearly. Our four major banks have done well because in this country we have regulated our financial system much better than many other countries, but our major banks have done better because of the bank guarantees put in place at the height of the financial crisis by this government and opposed by those opposite. - We would not have profitable banks if it had not been for the action of this side of the House in putting in place a bank guarantee opposed by those opposite every inch of the way. - Because we have come through the global financial crisis in such good shape, we do need greater competitive forces in our banking system. That is why the government has been putting in place some very substantial reforms in our banking system. They are substantial reforms which have policy credibility. They are not the fudges which have been put forward by those opposite. What are those reforms. The fudges put forward by the shadow Treasurer. We are having a crackdown on unfair mortgage exit fees. The member opposite was the financial services minister in this House for three years. He could not find the wit at any time in those three years to put in place a reform like that. - Mr Speaker, I am relating them to the question. The question was about competition, keeping the big banks honest, putting in place the competitive forces that are required but were never attended to by those opposite when they were in power. We propose putting in place a single national consumer law, something that could not be done by those opposite in 12 years. We talk about investing in AAA rated residential mortgage backed securities to get greater competitive forces in our system. But we know what the answer is not. We know the answer is not to abolish the independence of the Reserve Bank, as has been put forward by those opposite. That is not the answer to this challenge. I say there is no justification whatsoever for the major banks moving interest rates over and above any movement by the Reserve Bank. This government, as always, will put in place the proper competitive policies to keep the banks honest</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question and her outstanding advocacy over a long time to make sure that the Moreton Bay rail link becomes a reality. This is a great project that will open up public transport travel for the people of the Redcliffe Peninsula. It will also benefit those communities further up the Bruce Highway, because it will alleviate urban congestion. It will make a difference to climate change. We need to transfer more people out of private cars and onto public transport as part of dealing with climate change.The rail link will cut travel time from Kippa-Ring to the Brisbane CBD to just 45 minutes, so it is not surprising that this project has a great deal of support in the local community. That is why, on 26 August, the Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland, with the Mayor of Moreton Shire and the local member, announced support for the rail link - that a Gillard Labor government would turn this into a reality. The planning and preconstruction work will be done now, with construction to commence in 2012 and be completed in 2016.I am asked how the project has been received, and of course there has been a great deal of support for it, with one exception - the LNP candidate for Petrie, Dean Teasdale. He said on the day, 'Now is not the time' to build this rail link. This is a project that has been talked about since 1895 - but now is not the time, according to the LNP, to move ahead with it. That opposition lasted about as long as one of the member for Sturt's excuses - not very long at all. By the afternoon the Leader of the Opposition undermined the local candidate by saying he would support it and he would match the commitment. So first they are against it, then they are for it.I am asked which levels of government are responsible for delivering the project. There is the Gillard Labor government, there is the Bligh Labor government and there is the local council. But there is some confusion out there. Election ads have started in Petrie already, and in this week's local paper there is an ad by Dean Teasdale referring to 'supporting regional action in Petrie; delivering the Moreton Bay rail link'. The LNP are paying for it! Not the government - the LNP! They are doing so well out of their tobacco donations that they are able to build rail lines. It is an unbelievable performance. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot say now is not the time to build the rail link and then try to claim credit for it. -  - Federal investment in public transport infrastructure has gone from zero dollars to $7 billion. We now have major rail infrastructure projects in urban public transport in every capital city on the mainland including this Moreton Bay rail link, including the Parramatta to Epping rail link project, including the Northbridge rail project, including the regional rail link in Victoria, including the Noarlunga to Seaford rail line in South Australia, where we signed the contracts last week, and including also the Gold Coast light rail project.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I think it is his first question, so I congratulate him on that. Unfortunately, what I am going to have to say to the member is that I am not in a position to endorse the shadow Treasurer's four-point plan. I know the shadow Treasurer has made a series of statements since, but the original statements of the shadow Treasurer which defined this debate were in four points. Point 1 was that he was going to reregulate interest rates. I am not able to agree with that. In point 2 he somewhat bizarrely suggested we should remove our $16 billion investment in AAA rated residential mortgage backed securities. We were not in a position to agree with that. Thirdly, he somewhat oddly suggested we remove the deposit guarantee. No, we were not in a position to deal with that. And, finally, he said we should effectively go to the G20 and get a worse deal for Australia through global reform.I know since the original four-point plan the shadow Treasurer has been in full backflip, retreat, backdown mode and he keeps snatching other people's ideas, like those of Graeme Samuel from the ACCC, to try to cover his embarrassment -  - I was asked about the opposition's banking plan. Its foundation stone as originally articulated by the shadow Treasurer was reregulating interest rates. No, I regret to say to the new member for Bennelong, we will not be doing that, because to do that would mean we were turning our backs on 30 years of economic reform. To do that would mean we would be accepting a situation where young couples and small businesses could not get loans. That was the legacy of regulated interest rates, which is why this nation took a step into the modern world and started building the modern economy that we have today - a modern economy that can be secured in the future only by further economic reform. I regret to say to the new member for Bennelong that, unfortunately, the shadow Treasurer is going back 30 years in time. We will not be joining him in a strategy destined to impoverish this nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and congratulate her on being a local member who stands up for her electorate. Of course the Parramatta to Epping rail link is an important project. It now ensures that this government is committed to an urban rail project in every capital city on the mainland. It is an important project that will open up opportunities for people in Western Sydney to get access to Macquarie University and to get access to the high-tech jobs that are located around the North Ryde sector. It will also help build Parramatta as Sydney's second CBD. If we are serious about tackling issues such as urban congestion and the quality of life in our cities, we have to make sure that we back up that commitment with real dollars - and we have done that through our announcement during the election campaign.I must also mention how this has been received. The people of Western Sydney know that people on this link directly benefit from this project and that it facilitates the Western Express line - meaning, whether you live in the Blue Mountains in Western Sydney or whether you live -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. This is a project -  -  - You'd really want to observe their tactics meetings, wouldn't you. - I certainly will. This is a project, like the Moreton Bay regional rail project, that has been a long time in the making. Indeed, it was announced by Bruce Baird, the former member for Cook, when he was transport minister in the New South Wales Liberal government. But we are making sure that it becomes a reality. Since then, there has been a big fight to make it happen.During the election campaign, on a pamphlet 'I'm fighting to get things done', the current member for Bennelong said that he was fighting for the Parramatta to Epping rail line. Indeed, he said that to everyone in the electorate, and the pamphlet arrived the day we announced it - a great piece of timing. But when we announced it he then said that he was against it. So he was for it and then he was against it - until it was happening. So he was for the theory, for the ghost train, but not for the people's train. But, of course, it has changed again, because this week we have someone saying, 'The construction of the Epping-Parramatta rail link is set to proceed, which is welcome news for the people of Bennelong.' Yes, indeed it is. I hope that you vote consistently, as the member for Bennelong, and look after your electorate, unlike what occurred in the campaign when you walked away from that commitment, because there is a consistency here in that inconsistency when it comes to infrastructure -  - It has indeed been received well. The member for Parramatta knows that her electorate wants this vital project to proceed. It will be proceeding because this is a government that is prepared to lead on nation-building infrastructure. We will continue to do it, particularly when it comes to urban public transport.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for the question in my role of representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in the other place. The member for Kennedy has for a long time been raising concerns about the import versus the export of food. I have a copy of the media release that he refers to from the Australian Food and Grocery Council, which came from Kate Carnell, the chief executive. I should raise, notwithstanding the genuine concerns of the member for Kennedy, some of the issues with that media release. First of all, it refers to all groceries, not just food. So it actually includes toothpaste and nappies; it includes in its figures a whole lot of other items as well as food. As the member for Kennedy acknowledged in his question, it does not include bulk exports such as wheat exports, meat exports or live exports. When you take those issues out and deal with food going in each direction, you have a $14 billion trade surplus.We export $24 billion worth of food products; we import $10 billion dollars worth of food products. That does not change the importance of the issues raised by the member for Kennedy. That does not change the fact that there are major issues that exporters and all export dependent industries are facing right now because of the strength of the dollar and also because, where there has been for many decades in Australia a high focus on what happens inside the farm gate, there probably has not been the same level of focus on what happens in food manufacturing.With all that in mind, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is doing work across government at the moment on the development of the food strategy that was announced during the election campaign. Similarly, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, also from the other place, is working on the research and development and industry issues in food manufacturing. As is always the case, I am sure each of those ministers is readily available to talk through those issues as requested.I would also add that I am in very strong agreement with what the member for Kennedy said about how unfair many of the tariff barriers are when it comes to the competition that we face from other nations. The role that Australia has held for a long time, now held by the new Minister for Trade, as chair of the Cairns Group, is a very important role in taking us through the various international negotiations and making sure that our farmers are in fact on a more level playing field when it comes to trade.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. You have to give the Leader of the Opposition this: once he is told a slogan by a focus group, he never deviates from it - not once, not ever. He is driven by focus groups every day of the week, with his three-word slogans. When he is not driven by focus groups, with his three-word slogans, he is trying to work out how to put the Liberal Party's political interests in front of the national interest. He is trying to find out what he can wreck next. Since the election he has shown all of the political maturity of a two-year-old. It is about time he got over it and actually started contributing to national debates in a responsible way.Whilst the Leader of the Opposition's tantrum continues, on this side of the House we will continue to deliver responsible government. The Leader of the Opposition asked me what that is about, clearly having no idea himself what responsible government could possibly be about, having never acted in a responsible way when he was in government. Let me take this opportunity to explain it to him. It is about a strong economy. It is about giving Australians the benefits and dignity of work. I was very proud last week to see the unemployment statistics and to see that we have created 375,000 jobs. That is something that we celebrate on this side of the House. It is something that we on this side of the House contributed to with our timely economic stimulus package, while the Leader of the Opposition was content to see Australians thrown out of work and thrown out of their homes. We will bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13. We did not follow the Leader of the Opposition down the path of an $11 billion black hole - not for us that irresponsibility. We had our promises properly costed and we will bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13.We are working on measures that will lift the productivity of our economy. Our economy has emerged strong from the global financial crisis but we need continuing reform, investment in skills, investment in infrastructure and moves to increase the participation rate so that we can absolutely maximise this opportunity we have now, coming so strongly out of the global financial crisis. We are readying our economy for the challenges of the future: building the National Broadband Network, dealing with pricing carbon and tackling climate change. At the same time, we are governing for all Australians. We do not want Australians left behind because they lack a quality education or quality health services. The reality is that we inherited from the Leader of the Opposition a health system groaning under the weight of his cuts, and we are now preparing it for the future. We inherited an education system presided over by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition where no-one cared about disadvantage and no-one cared about children being left behind, and we are systematically fixing that. At the same time, we continue to make sure that Australia's voice is heard in the councils of the world. We continue to make sure that our nation is safe and strong, and there is no more important engagement in that than the successful prosecution of our mission in Afghanistan. The Leader of the Opposition asked me: 'What does this government stand for?' We stand for all of that. He stands for wrecking and three-word slogans.</DOC>

 - I am sure that, generally, members of the House are interested in the prospects of the global economy and actually understand that what happens in the global economy matters to Australians and matters to their jobs. It would seem to me a great pity indeed that there are members in this parliament who do not care less about that.I have, of course, just returned from the meeting of the G20 in Korea and the meeting of APEC in Japan. These were important events globally and in our region for the future prospects of the Australian economy and for the jobs of Australians. At both meetings, the G20 and APEC, important steps were taken which will matter for Australians as the global economy recovers, even though that recovery is fragile. I was very pleased to see that at the G20, leaders yet again indicated that they would resist a slide into protectionism in what is a difficult period in the global economy - a difficult period for many economies that are experiencing high unemployment rates and sluggish growth and that are going through the painful work of fiscal consolidation. Even in these pressing and difficult circumstances for many economies, leaders were prepared to say that they would hold out against protectionism. Indeed, they went further and said that they wanted to inject a level of ambition into the Doha Round of trade talks and wanted 2011 to be the endgame and to have the Doha Round concluded. I believe this is an important statement from the G20, one that is very much in Australia's national interest.I was also pleased to see that the G20 did deliver on the stronger global financial system through the Basel III rules and stronger international financial institutions, most particularly the long-sought reform of the IMF - something that Australia played a big role in designing through co-chairing the working group with South Africa. Leaders also authorised a framework to consolidate global growth - to lift growth in all economies. We understood at the meeting that that would require the hard work of structural reform and it would require the world to address the imbalances in the current global system with some countries saving too much and some countries spending too much.I was also pleased that this spirit of progress was there in the APEC meeting and in particular that leaders agreed on a free-trade area of the Asia-Pacific - once again a long sought after goal - and that practical work was done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership and that President Obama, who will chair APEC next year in America, indicated that he wanted to see real progress on the Trans-Pacific Partnership by the time of that meeting. That is once again a very good development for Australia. We are a great trading nation.This is quintessentially multilateralism that is part of Labor's heritage and Labor's work as we go about our business in the world. We are proud to have been one of the founding nations of APEC. It was a great move by former Prime Minister Bob Hawke. It was a great move by former Prime Minister Keating to lift the meeting to leader level. I was pleased to see that within our region the spirit of free trade and economic liberalism is still very strongly alive and well. This is in Australia's national interest. Trade means jobs.</DOC>

 - They must have forgotten to have the tactics meeting today. - I am being in a more generous spirit than the Treasurer. The Treasurer is probably right - they did have the tactics meeting today, and this is the product of it. Let me explain to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the government is committed to working on a comprehensive plan to address unauthorised arrivals. That is why we are working on a regional protection framework and a regional processing centre. I understand that the opposition thinks that it is smart to wander around with three-word slogans, no policy content, no idea about how these things would come to light and crazy statements like the Leader of the Opposition's statement about boat phones - sitting in Kirribilli issuing orders to patrol boat commanders on the front line about what they should do the next when they see an unauthorised boat. This kind of puerile nonsense we will leave to the opposition, and whilst we leave it to the opposition we will be getting on with the hard work of dealing with these questions of unauthorised arrivals.The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship is doing that. He has already made comprehensive statements about the circumstances of children in detention. As I am aware, the opposition still cannot work out, given its internal divisions, whether it is in favour of that or against it, whether what the member for Cook says is going to be the same as what the member for Pearce says or whether they will continue to be absolutely different. They still are not able to put any content around what they would do if they were in government on the question of dealing with detention and unauthorised arrivals. They are full of statements but no details. We are getting on with the hard work. We will continue to do that. The minister has dealt with the question of children in detention; he has dealt with the question of our long-term detention strategy. We are in dialogue with our region about the regional protection framework and regional processing centre. We understand as we go about this hard work that the opposition will play cheap politics. That is what they do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and thank him for his keen interest in jobs for Australians. As I was attending the G20 and APEC, what was at the forefront of my mind was the question of jobs for Australians. When I was there at those international meetings, the talk between leaders was about the circumstances of employment around the world. Here in Australia, of course, we have proudly created 375,000 jobs. Our unemployment rate is at 5.4 per cent. Our participation rate is going up as more people are seeking to move into our workforce so they too can experience the benefits and dignity of work.When we look around the world, economies are in a very different circumstance. If we look at America, for example, unemployment is at more than nine per cent, pressing on so many Americans, pressing on them with the loss of dignity and independence that comes with the loss of work, pressing on them in a really practical way as mortgage foreclosures hit rates like eight per cent as Americans who lose jobs lose their homes. At the same time, governments in many of these economies with high unemployment and sluggish growth are needing to engage in fiscal consolidation. That means many cutbacks to services that citizens in those countries have come to rely on, and that is also creating a great deal of pressure for those economies and for the citizens within those economies.At the global meetings, we talked frankly about the pressures on leaders in some of these economies - the pressures for protectionism. Once again I am pleased that those protectionist measures will be resisted. Here in Australia, through economic stimulus, we have worked hard to support Australian jobs and I am proud that we have done so. We have created 375,000 jobs and we look forward to creating more jobs. In order to do that, we do need to be involved with dialogue with our regional partners and more broadly about what needs to be done to keep lifting global growth. I am very pleased indeed that we have agreed on further measures that will facilitate trade. We are a great trading nation and trade equals jobs - jobs for Australians in so many sectors and so many parts of our country. So I thank the member for his question and I also thank the leaders with whom I met at both the G20 and APEC for their determination to keep focusing on global growth, keep focusing on freer trade and keep focusing therefore on jobs here and jobs around the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, and it really does have a very simple answer. As a government, we tell people the truth; as an opposition, you engage in spin and slogans. In the spirit of telling people the truth, when I first spoke about this matter as Prime Minister at the Lowy Institute I made it abundantly clear that achieving my vision of a regional protection framework and regional processing centre would take some time. I was very frank with Australians about the sources of unauthorised arrivals. I was very frank with Australians about the number of arrivals. I was very frank with Australians about sharing and understanding their concerns. But I also said to Australians at the time, very clearly, very frankly, that there was no slogan that would fix this problem, that there was no one-word policy that would fix this problem, that it would take patient and methodical work, and we are engaged in that patient and methodical work as a government now, with the work that has been done by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.I understand that the opposition believes it has profited off the cheap politics it has played around the asylum seeker question, just as it sought to profit off this cheap politics when it was in government, causing fundamental divisions amongst its backbench because members like the former member for Kooyong stood up against it. I wait to see members on the back bench today who shared those concerns under the Howard government once again stand up against this cheap politics. Despite current signs, I am actually very confident that they will, because the complete inability of the opposition to deal comprehensively with the question of children in detention -  - In conclusion, I will say that the opposition, divided on these questions, divided about the question of children in detention, will continue to try to profit off its cheap politics. What we will do is we will continue to patiently work through it, we will continue to deploy more assets to patrol our borders than have ever been deployed before and we will continue to tell Australians the truth about the issue of unauthorised arrivals and about how we are dealing with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his very important question, because the G20 endorsed the most comprehensive reforms to the global financial system in decades. These are very important reforms, because we have seen what a global financial crisis can do. It can produce a global recession, and nobody is immune from that. So reforming the international financial system is absolutely essential to prosperity, not just globally but in countries like Australia.What we saw at the height of the global financial crisis was a dramatic impact on our financial system. But fortunately we were able to avoid the worst impacts of that global financial crisis and global recession. What the global financial crisis indicated was the importance of having a stable financial system globally, and the overriding objective of having that globally is so that we can secure jobs so that we avoid the destruction of capital and the destruction of lives that flowed from the global financial crisis and global recession.The G20 endorsed the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision - very important reforms when it comes to capital adequacy for our banks nationally and for banks internationally - and endorsed the work of the Financial Stability Board. Of course, our banks will comply in full with these new international standards, but they will do it in a way which takes into account our unique circumstances, because we did not have the excesses in our banking system that we saw in the United States or that we have seen in Europe. We have certainly had a much more stable system and we have certainly had a better supervisory system in this country. So we did not see the risky behaviours that we have seen overseas.But of course we were not immune and that is why we moved comprehensively and swiftly to put in place our bank guarantees for depositors and the guarantees for wholesale funding. And those guarantees for wholesale funding will bring to the Australian taxpayer $5 billion in revenue over time. The banks have paid for that wholesale funding guarantee, which was so important to the supply of credit to the Australian economy.Of course, there will be some differences in the way in which these rules are implemented in Australia, and this is particularly the case when it comes to liquidity standards. In this country we simply do not have enough government debt to comply with those standards in the way in which they will be implemented in other countries, and the G20 has recognised that and will work with the Australian authorities to ensure that we do comply in a way which does not push up domestic costs. Why do I make that point? Because there will be absolutely no excuse for any Australian bank to force up its costs as a result of these important international rules.So what our work to the G20 has done is bring further stability to our banking system, so important to the prosperity of our country and so important to the peace of mind of anyone in this country who has their money in a bank and is a depositor in a major financial institution. These reforms are absolutely critical to our future prosperity and they have been put in place with the very strong support of the Australian government.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because it enables me to advise him that the member for Dunkley has, in the newspaper today, indicated his grand scepticism about the impact of the shadow Treasurer's plans. So I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that perhaps the first thing he needs to do is call together the motley crew he refers to as his shadow ministry and see if they are able to articulate one position. Because there we have it on the pages of today's 
Financial Review,and they are all over the place.Now, whilst the Leader of the Opposition spends his time trying to herd his shadow ministerial cats into one position, what we will do is continue to get on with the business of reforming banking to facilitate competition. What the Leader of the Opposition may not know, because we all know he is bored by economics - ask John Hewson, ask Peter Costello; I think it is very unlikely that he has followed any of these developments - is that the government has already acted to support competition in the banking sector. We acted as the global financial crisis hit to provide financial support in the billions of dollars to residential mortgage backed securities in order to support particularly second-tier lenders and to facilitate competition in the banking market.We have acted as a government to crack down on unfair mortgage exit fees. These are the fees that stop people going to shop around. When people cannot shop around because the exit fee from their current product is so high, that obviously reduces competition. We are seeing, I believe, a change in the policy settings of some banks about mortgage exit fees because of this government action.The government is committed to continuing to act to facilitate competition in banking. We are doing that in a methodical way. The Treasurer has been crystal clear about his intentions to do just that, including in his public statements in early October. What we have seen on the opposition side is the shadow Treasurer run out and call for a reregulation of interest rates, and every day since we have seen the shadow Treasurer trying to recover from that statement with increasingly desperate failing around about policy settings, which has drawn sharp criticism in his own shadow cabinet about his economic competence and ability - and actually the Leader of the Opposition on radio refused to back him in when asked. Well, we will leave that disarray for the opposition benches as we get on with the job of facilitating competition in banking.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. The midyear update showed that the Australian economy continues to be well ahead of the pack. When many of our peers are suffering double-digit unemployment, job creation is strong. We have strong economic growth, forecast to be 3¼ per cent in 2010-11 and 3¾ per cent in 2011-12, but it is the job figures that are particularly important here. Australia has created since November 2007 over 650,000 jobs and in the next 18 months we are looking to the creation of something like 380,000 jobs - almost one million jobs. That is a stunning achievement for the Australian economy, a stunning achievement of the Australian people, and I would have thought that it is something that those on the other side of the House should be applauding. We have falling unemployment - down to 4½ per cent by mid-2012. The other thing we have is a very strong pipeline of investment. Private investment in major projects around this country continues to be strong and grows stronger almost by the week. Of course, the budget is coming back to surplus in three years - in 2012-13. As the Prime Minister was saying before, not only is that strong but we are delivering the fastest fiscal consolidation seen in this country since the 1960s - 4½ per cent of GDP, a much quicker return to surplus because of the policies that this government is putting in place to return the budget to surplus. It is returning it to surplus because we have strict spending rules. We are holding real spending growth to two per cent and we are ensuring that every new dollar that is spent is offset. This is disciplined economic management which is producing results.You can see this applauded in the OECD survey today, which points to the fact that the Australian economy is one of the strongest in the developed world. It says that the policies that were put in place during the global crisis in Australia were the most effective in the entire OECD. It goes on to talk about our disciplined fiscal exit strategy. I quote:_ limiting government spending rises to 2% per annum over an extended period is a relatively bold objective, especially as spending has grown on average by over 4% per annum since the early 1970s.That includes during the period that those opposite were in government for 11 years. We are doing something that they could not dare contemplate. We are putting in place strict spending discipline and a range of policies to deal with mining boom mark 2, which are also applauded by the OECD today. What we see from the OECD is a resounding endorsement of the government's economic strategy. What we see from the other side is continual carping, talking the economy down, refusing to recognise what the Australian economy is doing relative to our peers and refusing to recognise the successes of the Australian economy and the Australian workforce and business people. - We will continue to get on with the job of building a stronger economy and putting in place positive policies for the future to support jobs and future prosperity.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for North Sydney for his question. Presumably, at some point he will be explaining to the Australian people what he did or, rather, did not do when he was a minister in the Howard government with responsibility for financial services and consumer affairs. What he did not do would be a good explanation for the Australian people to hear, because it is only since he sat on the opposition front bench that he has cared for one minute about these matters. I use the terminology 'cared for one minute' deliberately, because it was only one minute's consideration he gave until he ran out and blurted out his plan to reregulate interest rates and he has been back-pedalling to cover-up that brain explosion ever since. - In contrast, the government is facilitating competition in the banking sector. The member for North Sydney says he is not aware of what the government's banking reforms to date have been. Let me go through them. The government acted to support small lenders by investing $16 billion in the residential mortgage backed securities market. That was done to help small lenders access more affordable funding at a very difficult time, as the world moved into a global economic shock with the global financial crisis. I know that before the member for North Sydney had his nine-point plan he had his four-point plan and he was calling for the abolition of this, but this is and has been very important to support small lenders. Then there has been the government's financial claims scheme to protect the deposits of ordinary Australians. - The member for North Sydney could not do it in 12 years; that is true. -  
A government member - What's it for? - Continuing to respond to the question I was asked about the government's earlier wave of reforms, that wave of reforms also included the government's financial claims scheme to protect the deposits of ordinary Australians, something that the Howard government failed to do over 12 long years. That earlier wave of reforms included the account-switching package that the government introduced in 2008 to help customers transfer their financial arrangements across banks. The government has also taken steps to develop a deeper and more liquid corporate bond market. That is going to help businesses to borrow from retail investors and reduce their reliance on borrowing from banks. The RBA introduced reforms in 2009 to make ATM fees more competitive and transparent, and fees such as those for using foreign ATMs have fallen significantly. Then of course there is the government's work on unfair mortgage fees that keep people tied in to financial products that they no longer want when they decide to shop around. The government, having delivered these earlier reforms, will build on these reforms in a thoughtful way. I am not surprised that the member for North Sydney does not understand the government's approach, because being thoughtful has never been his strong suit. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Last Thursday the High Court delivered its decision on the challenge to refugee processing of offshore arrivals. It is very important to be clear about what this decision did and did not do. The court has found that the refugee status assessments and independent merits review is subject to judicial review in some circumstances relating to procedural fairness. Importantly, this decision has no impact on the government's capacity to establish a regional processing centre which would be operated as part of an international framework. However, there are doubts and serious questions about whether decisions made by Australian government officials in third country processing would be subject to judicial review where they are not part of an international agreement and where they are not partnered with international organisations.I note that the opposition have sought legal advice on the issue of whether the Nauru solution would be made impractical by the High Court's decision. They got it from their preferred independent and impartial legal adviser, Senator Brandis. I am sure the House will be relieved to know that, after deep consideration in his chambers, Senator Brandis has given the opposition policy a big tick and cleared it on legal advice. But you do not always have to get legal advice from somebody who happens to be the shadow Attorney-General. There are other lawyers in Australia. For example, Julian Burnside QC was asked about this last Thursday. He was asked whether the opposition's policy would stand up. He said, 'I think there is a respectable -  -  - Mr Burnside QC said this -  -  - It is funny how Mr Burnside is apparently less impartial than Lord Brandis of Brisbane, according to those opposite! - Mr Burnside said, 'I think there is a respectable argument that if officers of the Australian Commonwealth operating in Nauru make a life and death decision they also would be subject in the same way to review that the High Court has said today.'It is important when considering implications of the High Court case that we base our policy responses on the consideration of the facts. I noticed on Lateline 
on Thursday night the member for Cook was asked to respond to my suggestion that the so-called Nauru solution might be caught up in the High Court case. The member for Cook said this:Well, if Chris Bowen's right, then that means the 47,000 applications that were made offshore for protections visas in Australian missions and with Australian officials around the world or the thousands of other applications that are made for skilled visas and others would all be reviewable by the High Court.That is what the member for Cook said: 'If Chris Bowen's right, this would need to be true.' Guess what? It is true. The honourable member for Cook appears to be unaware that those applications are subject to judicial review by Australian courts. It just goes to show that when it comes to policy it is important to be good at more than sound grabs. It is also important to be good at sound policy, which the honourable member for Cook and his colleagues appear not able to be. The government will continue to work through the implications of the High Court decision in a calm and methodical manner, and the opposition might care to do the same in relation to the High Court implications for their own policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. As he would be aware if he had followed the commentary in the United States, President Obama has been in favour of a cap-and-trade scheme to price carbon in the American economy and, following the mid-term elections, has accepted that the reality of the congress that he faces is that he will not be able to legislate for it. He is experiencing obstruction in the congress for a proposal that he supports and consequently understands that he will not be able to get a scheme through. One should not interpret President Obama's statement as him changing his mind about an emissions trading scheme. That is simply not true. He is accepting the domestic political realities that he faces.As I said when I met with President Obama over the weekend, Australia and America are great mates. We are great mates and we will continue to be. - But Australia is not an American state. We will make our own decisions in our national interest. The mid-term elections in America did not determine policy for us. We are Australians; we will make our own decisions. We will make our own decisions in this parliament, where the government has seized the opportunity presented by this parliament to see if we can work through for a parliamentary and community consensus on the most efficient way of dealing with carbon, and that is to put a price on it. The most efficient way of reducing carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon pollution. I am of that view; economists are of that view; President Obama is of that view. Right around the world nations are working through how best to deal with carbon, including pricing carbon.If the member does want to slavishly follow American examples - and I believe we are Australians and we will make our own decisions - then perhaps he would want to look to the example of California. As he would well know, if California were a nation it would be sitting at the table of the G20. It has moved to price carbon in its economy. In this public policy challenge of pricing carbon, my invitation remains to those on the opposition benches to turn away from their strategy of wrecking and looking for popular slogans, and to work with the government to get a measure done in the nation's interest. That is the approach we are taking, because I do not believe that it is in the interests of this nation to not deal with the challenge of pricing carbon, or to not deal with the transformation of our economy to a low-pollution economy. We are determined to deal with this challenge and to work our way through.Members opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, have had every position possible on this, the Leader of the Opposition changing his mind every 24 hours - famously called a weather vane by the member for Wentworth. Now is the time to put those politics aside and to work with the government on something so clearly in our national interest. National interest before political interest: try it just once.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for her question. In its latest economic survey of Australia, as has been reported today, the OECD had some very important things to say about climate change policy and how it should be applied within Australia. The OECD's main message was that setting a carbon price sooner rather than later was the best option for cutting carbon pollution within our economy. The OECD went on to say that the investment uncertainty in the electricity sector in particular should be removed 'by the adoption of market mechanisms to set a price on carbon, thereby reducing emissions in an effective way'.The OECD, which is one of the premier international economic organisations, is clearly indicating what we already know - that is, that the best way of reducing carbon pollution and addressing the challenge of climate change is to set a carbon price via a market mechanism, and doing it sooner rather than later. The reality is that many countries around the world, including the United States and China, are already taking a comprehensive set of steps to reduce carbon pollution within their own economies and to tackle climate change. I am sure the House would be interested to learn that 85 countries that have committed themselves to the Copenhagen Accord, representing approximately 80 per cent of global emissions, have pledged targets and other actions to reduce pollution and to tackle climate change.Also, and pursuant to the previous question to the Prime Minister, countries are doing this through a range of different measures. They may include carbon taxes, they may include emissions trading schemes, they are including renewable energy targets and they are including subsidies for low-emission technologies. Each one of these policy approaches puts an effective price on carbon, even if that carbon price is not as overtly stated as it is through some particular mechanisms.With that in mind the government has asked the Productivity Commission to determine the carbon price that is already adopted or planned by a number of other nations with which we have important trading relationships, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, New Zealand, China, India, Japan and South Korea. The purpose of the Productivity Commission's study will be to identify the effective carbon price in those important economies with which we have substantial trading relationships. This is extremely important, not only to understand the action that is being taken by our trading partners but also to properly assess the competitive arguments relating to the establishment of a carbon price in our own economy. The Productivity Commission will be due to report with that study by May of next year. It is a piece of work that was commissioned at the initial suggestion of the member for New England, and I thank him for that contribution.The Prime Minister mentioned a moment ago the progress of the government's multiparty climate change committee. There have been very constructive discussions which stand in total contrast with the approach taken by the Leader of the Opposition and those behind him on the opposition benches; it is also a position totally in contrast with the advice of the OECD.</DOC>

 - Every factual assertion in that question is not right. The government will continue with the national curriculum. -  - As I just said, every factual assertion in that question is not right. The government will continue with the national curriculum. It really amazes me - though I do understand that the member asking this question is still relatively new to the parliament - that this question would be asked by the opposition, when over 12 long years, despite persistent calls for a national curriculum, absolutely nothing got done. Absolutely nothing, to the great disadvantage of the 80,000 school children who move interstate each year and to the great disadvantage of Defence Force families, who frequently move during their child's education, and to the great disadvantage of a nation that rightly wants to be assured that a quality, modern, relevant curriculum is being taught in every school in the country to give every child a great education. So whilst the Howard government slept through 12 years doing nothing profound on education reform - including, instead, trying to tweak the politics of education to get sector fighting with sector and to try to periodically get a run in the newspaper by criticising others in education - we have got on with the job of reform in the interests of Australian students. And the thing that has been on our mind is not the politics of education; it is every child in every school, what they are learning and what opportunity that gives them in life. In pursuit of that vision of a great quality education for every child in every school we will continue with the national curriculum, which is part of a broad suite of education reform that is there to lift standards in every school, particularly to make a difference for those children most at risk of falling behind. I would have thought the member, and the members opposite, could at least try to share that vision of a great quality education for every child. - But clearly the politics of wrecking even extends to that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for his question. Certainly, as he would be aware, it is the case that services are already live in Tasmania. Services will go live in five first-release sites on the mainland early next year: Willunga, Brunswick, Townsville, Minnamurra/Kiama Downs and Armidale. At the same time we will begin construction on 19 second-release sites on the mainland. Some eight months ago we began work laying 6,000 kilometres of optical fibre backbone in six priority areas that had been identified by the ACCC as having the least competitive backhaul across Australia: between Perth and Geraldton, in south-west Gippsland, between Victor Harbour and the Adelaide Hills, between Broken Hill and Mildura and between Darwin, Longreach, Emerald and Toowoomba. And of course the member for Kennedy would be conscious that it began going both ways from Mount Isa. Some 60 per cent of this fibre infrastructure rollout is now complete and the first links will be ready on time and on budget in March of next year.We know that the opposition have had an alternative plan. They have had in fact 20 failed broadband plans. Under their 19th plan, they promised that funding would also occur for some regional back-haul infrastructure, with 100 per cent of it - just about - starting after June 2013. So, whilst we are getting on with the job of rolling out the National Broadband Network, creating some 25,000 direct jobs, delivering for regional Australia, those opposite simply want to delay. Those on this side of the House, and the Independents, understand that Australia simply cannot afford to delay universal high-speed and affordable broadband, particularly in regional Australia.We will have a bit of a test this afternoon over whether those opposite stand for the national interest or for their own political interest, because the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010 
will be debated and determined in the parliament this afternoon. It supports a wholesale-only open-access NBN that will fundamentally transform competition in the sector. It is supported by industry, including Telstra, so it will be a real test this afternoon whether those opposite will vote for this legislation. They should support this legislation, as they should support what is the most important infrastructure project that we could possibly be proceeding with to bring Australia into the 21st century and to build productivity in this nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Denison for his question and know that he, like many other Australians, is concerned about mental health questions and ensuring services are available and funded. Like the member for Denison, I am a big admirer of the work of Pat McGorry. He is actually a fair old legend in the part of the world that I come from, Melbourne's west, where many of the services that he has become most famous for were first instigated and trialled. I am therefore well aware of the very good work done at EPPICs and the fact that the most critical burden of disease for the most profound mental illnesses impacts on our young people and that, if you are going to have one of these profound conditions, it is very likely to manifest when you are still in your teenage years or a young adult. So intervention at that stage does pay itself back over a lifetime. I am well aware of that, and the government is committed, with our new Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, to building on work done in the previous period of government to improve mental health services.I agree that Australians are asking us to look again at this area and look at what more can be done. I want to say to the member that, as a government, we have almost tripled funding for mental health programs, to $1.4 billion over the next four years. That includes a $450 million new investment announced by the government over the course of this year. As part of our National Health and Hospitals Network package, the government has committed $25.5 million to expand the EPPIC model outside Victoria. We have also funded up to an additional 30 headspace youth-friendly services to support a further 20,000 young people. During the recent election campaign, we also promised an extra $274 million to redouble our efforts on suicide prevention. As the member may well be aware, we lose more Australians each year to suicide than we do through our road toll, so suicide prevention is a critical problem for Australia. But I do understand the member's concern is genuine and, as a government, we do understand that in mental health we have got more work to do. Whilst I am not in a position to say to the member now that we are able to provide more funding at this stage for EPPICs, I can assure him that the minister for mental health is working on building on our earlier reforms and we are very open to ideas from the member for Denison as we do that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. She has a keen interest, like many in this House, in news of the new 28 superclinics that were committed to during the election campaign. But I would like to give the House first an update, as I was asked to, on the first 36 superclinics. We are just over the halfway mark since the introduction of that program, a five-year program. We have seven operational superclinics across the country, we have eight that are operating early services, we have 17 that are under construction and we have more than a quarter of a million services that have been provided through the superclinics.I will give you a couple of short examples. I recently visited the Geelong superclinic, which services the electorates of Corangamite and Corio. The Prime Minister also visited that superclinic, just before its formal opening on 30 August. That service now has seven GPs. It has practice nurses, a physiotherapist, an exercise physiologist and a podiatrist. It has students commencing next year who will be trained in the superclinic, as part of the academic year. I know that the new member for Solomon has been to the Palmerston superclinic. It opened on 4 October and has been providing after-hours services since December 2008. It now has GP services, practice nurses, physiotherapy, dietetics and a clinical psychologist. The member for Blair, I understand, visited his GP superclinic in Ipswich. Its first stage has been opened and has had a very good reaction from patients, staff and the community.As well as talking about our existing program, I want to update the House on the process that has started for the new 28 clinics that are part of our $7.4 billion health reform plan. Many MPs in this House will know that I wrote to them some weeks ago seeking some further information, given that the opposition has opposed superclinics -  - I gave members the courtesy of writing them a letter asking for their view. Contrary to the member for Dickson's view, many of his colleagues answered those letters. Many of those colleagues will be pleased to know that we have paid attention to their views. Eleven of the clinics have gone straight to an invitation to apply process, including the ones in Blacktown, Port Macquarie, Coffs Harbour and Nowra. I am sure that the members for Cowper and Gilmore will be pleased that those are going ahead.But, following requests for further consultations in their electorates from a number of members, 13 clinics will have a consultation process begun before they go to the invitation to apply stage. This includes, for example, the electorate of Adelaide and the electorate of Bonner, where the Wyndham superclinic will have further consultations. Four further clinics for which the operators have already been identified, like in Jindabyne and Rockingham, will proceed immediately to negotiations with those identified operators.This program is already delivering services to the community. More services are coming. More training is being provided. We are determined to make sure that if the community wants to see a GP they can access to one closer to their home and that students will be trained in their electorates. That is what this program is delivering.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I agree with the member to this extent: there is a lot of misinformation out there about the NBN. A lot of misinformation is being used in fearmongering from the opposition. It happened before the election. Indeed, on the last day of the election campaign there was fearmongering about charges in relation to the NBN. The factual position is a very simple one: the government is working its way, through NBN Co., to rolling out around the country super fast broadband so that people can have the services that they need in the future. The Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has today taken the House through some of the details of that. It is also true that, as a result of the agreement that the government entered into with Telstra, we are looking forward to migrating customers from the old copper -  - I was talking about the agreement that we have entered into with Telstra to migrate customers from the current copper network to the NBN. That gives rise to the answer to the member's question. He asked about telephone costs. On telephone costs, I refer him to statements made by the NBN Co. on this matter. They have said that the assertion that he has made in his question and other assertions that have been made in the public media about costs are not right and that they would not be recommending to shareholder ministers - obviously, the shareholder ministers are the ministers in the government with line responsibility and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation - a cost structure that would increase retail costs or costs paid by consumers for a telephone line. The NBN Co. has dealt with this matter. The member is responding to the fearmongering that is around. There is no need for him or any of his constituents to fear increased costs for having a telephone line in their home. It is simply not right. Look at what the NBN Co. has said. If you want to tell your constituents the truth, distribute that statement to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calwell for her question and for her commitment to Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme. On 1 January next year, in just over six weeks, Australia will finally catch up with the rest of the developed world and see the implementation of our national Paid Parental Leave scheme. This will be such a significant day for thousands of mums and dads around the country who will be able to get that extra assistance that they need to help their newborn babies. After waiting for decades, Australia will finally get a national Paid Parental Leave scheme, and it is this federal Labor government that is delivering it. We know how important it is. That is why have taken the advice and are delivering up to 18 weeks of paid parental leave paid at the federal minimum wage, which is around $570 a week before tax.We estimate that around 148,000 parents will be eligible for paid parental leave. I can inform the House that parents are now ringing the Family Assistance Office or going online and registering for paid parental leave. They are getting their applications in for babies who are expected to be born in January and February next year. So far, more than 1,500 parents have registered for paid parental leave. Parents can now register up to three months in advance of the expected date of their baby's birth. That of course means that they can get all that paperwork done before their baby comes along.I am also very pleased to be able to inform the House that we have a number of employers who are also already registered to deliver paid parental leave on behalf of the government. We have more than 450 employers already registered to play their part in the government's scheme to deliver paid parental leave to their long-term employees. We are very pleased with the way in which employers are responding. They understand just how important it is for women to stay connected to the workforce, and we expect that this will improve the participation of women in the workforce. It demonstrates that these employers understand that paid parental leave is both good for their employees and good for their businesses. - We are starting to hear interjections from those opposite, who for 12 years refused to deliver paid parental leave. We know that the Leader of the Opposition famously said that paid parental leave would be introduced over his dead body. It is this government that is delivering paid parental leave, and on 1 January it will start.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question about the cleaner car rebate. I refer the member to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which makes it clear that the start date of the program has been moved to 1 July next year and that it is in a consultation phase with industry. We want to make sure that we get the design of it right. As members would be aware, our transport system - the use of cars - is a very considerable contributor to greenhouse gases. We want to make a difference to that. The cleaner car rebate is one way of making a difference. Our mandatory standards for light vehicles are another way of making a difference. - I know, of course, that the member for Indi does not believe in climate change, does not believe in acting on it, is very keen to wreck everything in this area and certainly played a role in making the Leader of the Opposition the leader so he could -  - In conclusion, this is one way of tackling climate change. We will get on with the job of doing it. - The opposition will continue with its wrecking strategy and with trying to paper over its current divisions on the question.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to advise the House that the work of the Policy Transition Group, which is jointly chaired by Don Argus and me, is progressing well. Face-to-face consultations have been held in five states to date, namely Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales. We have also ensured that industry representatives from other states and territories have had ample opportunity to express their views to the Policy Transition Group. The last face-to-face consultation will be held in Melbourne this Friday and will be totally focused on the all important issue of exploration.I also note that there have been detailed submissions from a range of interested parties and they will, in due course, be given proper consideration by the Policy Transition Group. In this context, I note that the OECD economic survey of Australia, which was released yesterday, also supported the concept of a resources rent tax. In fact, the report emphasises the importance of getting the detail right, as we are seeking to do through the Policy Transition Group. The report states:As proposed by the government, a tax on resources rents is in principle highly efficient, since it has no impact on investment and production decisions if properly designed and administered.Clearly, that is the objective of the Policy Transition Group and it is intended that we present our report to the Treasurer prior to Christmas. I also inform the House that, following our report to the Treasurer, the government will release an exposure draft in the new year, which will give industry yet a further opportunity to actually comment on the government's intention with respect to where we go on this particular tax. Perhaps more importantly, the House should be advised that since our announcements on 2 July there have been a series of major announcements with respect to a pipeline of ongoing investment decisions in Australia. I can refer to, for example, the announcement by British Gas, of 1 November this year, of a $15 billion investment in a new industry in Australia: the coal seam methane export opportunity out of Gladstone in Queensland. Interestingly, there have also been a range of similar announcements - for example, Rio Tinto Iron Ore in Western Australia, an upgrade of their Cape Lambert export opportunities, with an investment of US$3.1 billion; BHP Billiton, with its coal opportunities at Mount Arthur in New South Wales, an investment of $784 million; and Xstrata with respect to its Ulan coal opportunities, an investment of US$1.1 billion. There have been many other announcements going to the issue of certainty of investment in terms of our announcements of 2 July.In conclusion, I simply say that, from the government's point of view, the Policy Transition Group process is actually going well. Industry understands the nature of the taxation arrangements which we announced on 2 July. I can also assure the House there is no intention by the government to change those announcements from what was agreed with industry. That, in turn, has created certainty which has enabled investment to continue since 2 July this year. The government will put in place a new tax system which will ensure that the Australian community gets a fair return for the development of its national resources, based on the principles of equity, efficiency and investment neutrality.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, and I think anybody hearing the Leader of the Opposition's question can no doubt sympathise with him that he is obviously looking forward to a Christmas break. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition, who appears to have brought question 11 from yesterday's question time pack, that the government is of course getting on with the job of methodically delivering reforms in this country because we want this nation to build for the opportunities of the future. I know that the Leader of the Opposition finds this quite hard to intellectualise. He finds it quite hard to accept.Famously there was a supermodel who said that she did not get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day. Well, the Leader of the Opposition does not get out of bed without a focus group report for the day. He puts the alarm clock off, gets out of bed, grabs for the focus group report, sees what three-line slogan he has for that day and then, like a ventriloquist's doll, he goes and repeats it mechanically time after time. And is it only me who wonders why every one of the Leader of the Opposition's three-word slogans always starts with stopping something or ending something? This is a man who is always keen to tell you what he is opposed to but can never tell you what he would do or support. He is completely unable to define a vision for the future for this country. Well, the government has a vision for the future for this country. We understand that it requires a strong economy. We understand that it requires being ready for the challenges of the future. We understand that it requires governing for all Australians. We understand that that means investments in things like education and health to make a difference for the opportunities of Australians right around the country and irrespective of the circumstances of their birth. We understand that it requires keeping Australia safe and secure in the world. So we will leave the Leader of the Opposition with his bitterness and negativity and we will get on with the job.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for her question. She is a woman who lives in and represents in this place a region where people understand that climate change is real, that our society needs to take steps to address it and that we need to work through these difficult steps in consultation with the community.When I was in Adelaide last week, I talked about my vision and this government's vision for the future of this country. I want to make sure that we have a strong economy, ready for the challenges of the future, which gives Australians the best opportunities for the future, for their own personal prosperity and for their own ability to succeed. But to get there, to have a strong economy that meets the challenges of the future, we need to engage in continuing rounds of reform.There is no more important reform than making sure that our economy is ready for the challenge flowing from climate change. That is, we need to make sure that we are a prosperous nation but that, as we generate that prosperity, we generate fewer carbon emissions. I am an optimist. I know the Leader of the Opposition always looks on the negative side for what you can wreck and who you can criticise. I am an optimist and I believe that our nation is up to meeting this challenge. We can get this job done and we can get it done together.In order to get this job done together, we do need to work through pricing carbon. We need to do that to drive a fuel switch into investment in cleaner energy. That is a key to the future and we need to make sure that we are the custodians of that key - that we price carbon and drive investment in cleaner energy. The experts in the energy industry tell us that we need to do just that. For example, Richard McIndoe, managing director of energy supplier TRUenergy, has said:We want to see this - that is, pricing carbon - on the agenda before 2013 and we really need to start to have a dialogue with the government about the best way to attract investment in low emissions technology now. There is no time to waste.He goes on to say that:_ if this uncertainty continues, not for two to three years but four to five years, and nobody is building, then you will have power shortages and insufficient capacity.That is the vision of the future the Leader of the Opposition would embrace - power shortages and insufficient capacity.Then of course there is the incoming Treasury brief that made it absolutely clear that, if we are to hit our carbon emissions targets, we need to price carbon. To go down any other route is, to use their words, 'to impose a significant economic and budget impact'. That is the vision of the Leader of the Opposition - increased taxes or savage cuts into health, pensions, defence and education in order to pay for trying to deal with climate change another way. We stand for the efficiency of pricing carbon, and we will get on with that job.</DOC>

 - I can only imagine what the shadow Treasurer must have thought of his performance in government given what interest rates were then. - I can only imagine how he must have hung his head in shame every morning for being such an incompetent minister in such an incompetent government. If he wants to go down this track, well let us do comparisons of track records - I am very happy to. -  -  -  - I was asked about interest rate pressure. What I can say to the shadow Treasurer about interest rate pressure is I understand that families are under pressure from interest rates and paying the mortgage. I understand that in the past, under the former government, they struggled with higher interest rates than now. But interest rate movements do cause pressure on working families - absolutely right - which is why of course we want to make sure that there is competition in banking so that people have the ability to shop around and get a better deal. That is why the government has already acted to introduce competition reforms, and we will act to introduce further competition reforms. Even today, if you check the products and prices that are on offer, my attention has been drawn to the fact that a good bank, Adelaide Bank, from my old home town, is offering a mortgage rate of 6.59 per cent compared with, for example, today's Westpac mortgage rate of 7.86 per cent. It does make a big difference to families if they go and get a better priced product. The difference in cost between Westpac and the Adelaide Bank is $245 a month. I give that as an example because it shows that if you can facilitate competition in banking, if you can enable people to move from one product to another, then they can look around, look for better deals and use their purchasing power effectively as consumers to drive different conduct in our banking sector. That is why the government has delivered competition reforms in the past and that is why we will deliver further competition reforms.In terms of the macroeconomy and supply-side constraints, we as a government understand and we have understood for a long period of time that we need to lift the productive capacity of our economy by investing in human capital. That is why we have a transformational education agenda after 12 long years of neglect, why we are nation building with the infrastructure projects, overseen by the government generally and particularly by the minister for infrastructure. That is why we are so committed to the delivery of the National Broadband Network, because of its ability to drive new ways of doing business, new productivity enhancements, new ways of expanding economic capacity. - Perhaps at some point someone could explain to the opposition about the question of supply-side constraints, explain to the opposition about economic capacity, explain to them about the role of infrastructure and explain why I am being directly relevant to the question that is asked. Really, nothing could tell you more about the economic incompetency and illiteracy of the Liberal Party in the modern age than that point of order.We will deliver the further competition reforms. We have already delivered competition reforms. I will say again, as I have said previously, people should use their power as consumers to put pressure on banks. The banks have behaved badly. They deserve to feel the pressure of competitive powers. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I am critical of the banks' conduct. He wanders around saying: 'I don't blame the banks. I believe they bear their fair share of responsibility.'</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question and I know he is very concerned about this country's future, about environmental questions and about the question of pricing carbon. He is also a man who is in touch with his constituents and would understand the pressures that families feel when utility prices rise and that they are asking for explanations as to how this works and what will happen next. I believe that it is important to be honest with the Australian people and thoughtful in your responses. Not for me the three-word slogans of others. When we look at our electricity generation sector, and when we look at the question of investment in electricity, we find that we have had a track record of underinvestment and we need to transform electricity generation for the future so that we are able to meet demand and not face power shortages and power outages and that we are generating our electricity in a cleaner way.To give some statistics in this regard: in terms of electricity used, around 82 per cent of power in the national electricity market is generated by coal with 10 per cent from natural gas and eight per cent from renewables, but in terms of capacity coal only makes up around 58 per cent of capacity with gas around 20 per cent. That is telling you that despite rising energy demand we still have natural gas fired generation capacity which is underutilised and we need to change that picture. To put it at its most simple, we need to generate power from coal in a cleaner way, we need to reduce the emissions of generating power from coal and we need to increase the competitiveness of energy that is generated from gas and from renewable energy sources like solar to make them a greater part of our energy mix. In order to drive that innovation and that competitiveness, we need to price carbon.I can see the member for Wentworth concentrating on this. The member for Wentworth is a man who has always understood this and has, over time, advocated pricing carbon because he understands its effects on electricity generation and in the marketplace. Of course, it does mean, as we work through these issues, that we need to make sure we are telling Australians the truth. Often in this debate there is a position painted, particularly by the opposition, that if you price carbon then electricity prices go up but if you do nothing then somehow that does not happen. Can I say to the opposition that at least there is one truth teller on their front bench and that is the member for Groom, who admitted the day before the election when you looked at power prices: 'Power prices are set to double over the next five to seven years irrespective of who is in government. Lack of planning has led to an investment drought.' He is a truthful man. As we work our way through investing in energy and increasing supply, we also need to work our way through pricing carbon so that that new investment is directed to the cleanest possible power generation for our nation's future.</DOC>

 - I am very happy to respond directly. What I would say to the member is that perhaps, instead of trying to summarise what I have said, he should actually read what I have said. I refer him to recent speeches I have given on the subject of electricity. I refer him to the last answer I gave where I said very clearly that we need to have a truthful and full debate about what is happening in electricity generation. If he is under any doubt about what is happening in electricity generation, then I suggest that he has a discussion with the member for Groom because, as I have indicated, the member for Groom, from his statements the day before the election, is actually onto it - he actually understands it. He understands that, in trying to create an image in people's minds that there are somehow policy settings of no price rises versus pricing carbon, that is a figment of people's imagination and that we are dealing with rising energy prices. We have had underinvestment. In the words of the member for Groom - and I quote them again: 'Power prices are set to double over the next five to seven years irrespective of who is in government.' These are his words, not mine, dealing with the reality of electricity generation and the need to expand capacity to make up for underinvestment. - So the policy question that genuinely confronts us is that, as we need to see investment in electricity, we know that investment is now being held up because of current uncertainty. Long-term investment is not going to be made until we answer the question about pricing carbon. As we release that new investment, do we want to release it in a way which helps us tackle the problem of climate change and carbon emissions or do we just want to go on as we are now? Well, I am for reform. I am for dealing with the question of pricing carbon. I am for telling people the truth. The Leader of the Opposition, with his three-word slogans and his denial of climate change, wants to hide the truth from people. But, of course, his ability to hide that truth ran out of rope when we had the Treasury books for the incoming government released under freedom of information, because they made it absolutely clear that this nation needs to price carbon in order to meet its targets for reducing carbon emissions and that the only other way to do it is to put huge costs on the budget. The member who asked me the question asks about costs. I say to him if he wants to talk about costs let us have an honest debate. How much would you hack out of education to deal with it your way? How much would you hack out of health? How much would you hack out of defence? How much would you put taxes up by? - We know the Leader of the Opposition loves a good tax: he took one to the last election. He loves increased taxes: he ran for the last election on the basis of them. So when the opposition actually wants to front up and put a full position about those questions we will have the debate. In the meantime I would say to the opposition and to the member who has asked the question that the Australian community deserves better than this endeavour to hide the truth from the Australian community and just drive fear. We will work our way through this debate. The Australian nation is up to it, the government is going to do it and the only people being left behind are sitting over there on the opposition side.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for this very important question, because the central challenge for Australia on the road of reform is to provide business with the certainty to invest in the low-pollution economy of the future. Other economies are doing it but we are not doing nearly enough. What we have to do is to give business the certainty that they can make the necessary investments in power generation, for example, so we can not only be certain of supply but we can also be certain that we may just be getting value for money.The road of reform is sometimes hard and what we have to find is the most economically efficient way of doing this. Of course, the most economically efficient way of doing this is a market based mechanism that those opposite will not contemplate because when it comes to essential reforms which will benefit this country all we see from them is the politics of the stop sign. They will not go down the road of reform which is going to deliver the prosperity this country needs. And what this country needs is a price on carbon. Why do we need it? We need it to stay competitive. We need it to drive the investment in the alternative technologies. We need it to be contemporary. We need it for our future prosperity but they will not contemplate it because they are more interested in playing the politics of the issue. They are not interested in the national interest.What they say is they want to do it by regulation. But, of course, regulation is not the most cost effective. There has been a lot of debate in this House in the past day or two about the OECD. The OECD has had this to say about the importance of a price on carbon and doing it in the most efficient way and not going down the road of regulation that the member for Flinders wants to go down. That is not the cost-effective way. That is the way that will impose very big costs on our budget and very big costs on our industries - and when you do that you make them uncompetitive. This is what the OECD had to say about the solution that has been put forward by those opposite:_ attempting to reduce emissions through regulatory and subsidy arrangements would also be costly for the economy. The cost of regulatory approaches to reduce emissions can be more than twice as high as the cost of market based approaches.That is what the OECD had to say in their recent report, and they are backed up by the Treasury. The Treasury has made this point:A carbon pricing regime would achieve the necessary abatement at a cost per tonne of emissions significantly lower than other announced alternative policies _That is where the economics stand and that is where the national interest stands but the member for Flinders over there wants to sit back and decide where the subsidies are going to go and how much Australians are going to pay to pick winners. I would not trust him to wash my car and I most certainly would not trust him to pick the winners. I most certainly would not trust him to do that. - On this side of the House we are going down the reform road. In the national interest we are going down the reform road, but what do we get over there? The politics of the stop sign from those that are only interested in their immediate political interest and not interested in the national interest.</DOC>

 - I very much thank the member for Wentworth for this question. What we know about the member for Wentworth's suggestion is that it is yet another delay from a political party that is now on its 20th version of a policy, each one as ineffective as the one before. The fact that this is all about delay is best indicated by the inability of the opposition to say that it would agree with broadband under any circumstances. - The fact that this is all about delay - not about rigour, not about looking at things, not about study, not about analysis - has been admitted by the opposition. They have said - the Leader of the Opposition has been very clear - that, no matter what happens, their mission is another three-word slogan: demolish the NBN. That is what they stand for: demolish the NBN. The actual facts, the figures and the case for reform do not matter to them at all. They are not interested in that. - I suggest to the member for Sturt that if he stepped back and tried to disengage himself from his positions on some of these answers, he would understand that, in this case, it may not be the answer that his side of politics is seeking but it is an answer that could be considered directly relevant to the question. I am not in a position, as Speaker, to dictate how a minister or the Prime Minister answers the questions. I think that the member for Sturt should learn to sit there quietly. If he really wants to make changes that will get the result that he wants, he should engage with the Procedure Committee as they review the success or not of the newly implemented standing orders. The Prime Minister has the call. The Prime Minister knows that she must be directly relevant in responding to the question. - I am asked about the opposition's proposition that the NBN go to the Productivity Commission. I am answering that question, and I am answering that question on the basis that it is very clear from the opposition's statements that it is not serious about absorbing any work that comes out of the Productivity Commission. I will use the member for Wentworth's own words. On 24 September this year he was asked by a journalist: 'If the cost-benefit analysis did come back with an unequivocal 'Yes, go ahead and do it,' would the coalition at that point support it?' Surely that was a question that begged yes as an answer but, no, the member for Wentworth said: 'Well, that would depend. A good cost-benefit analysis will be very transparent, set out all its assumptions, will enable people to play with those assumptions, to change them. But no-one's going to give it a tick in advance.' So the opposition is not at all serious about this, not at all serious about the work coming from the Productivity Commission. The only reason it is advocating a Productivity Commission approach is as another delaying tactic, because the opposition's actual strategy is the one set by the Leader of the Opposition, another three words: demolish the NBN.I understand that, when it comes to the Productivity Commission, the member for Wentworth does sometimes value their opinion. He was asked on radio this morning about the Productivity Commission and carbon pricing, and he said:_ the Government believes that the Productivity Commission will say that a market-based approach to reducing emissions is the most cost effective _Now there've been plenty of other studies that have come to that conclusion, they can be highly confident I would think of getting that outcome from the Productivity Commission.If the member for Wentworth is that serious about carbon pricing, he had better have a chat to this bloke sitting in the chair.</DOC>

 - I thank my colleague the member for Newcastle for that question. We both come from the Hunter region, where electricity generation is a very important issue and electricity prices are just as important for consumers there as those elsewhere in the country. Mr Rod Sims, who is an independent expert adviser to the government's multiparty climate change committee and also a person of extensive experience in energy markets in this country and currently the chairperson of the New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal, recently gave a presentation to the government's multiparty committee about what is driving increases in electricity prices. The committee has made that presentation public. Mr Sims' main point in his presentation was this: a carbon price is the most efficient method of tackling climate change. He clearly states: 'The introduction of a carbon price will allow the currently lowest cost measures to be chosen while technological change drives the best longer-term solutions.' That is the fact of the matter: a market mechanism to establish a carbon price is the most economically efficient way of driving reductions in carbon pollution in our economy.Mr Sims in his presentation also clearly outlined that electricity prices are currently increasing in the absence of a carbon price mainly because of increases in network costs - the 850,000 kilometres of poles and wires in the transmission and distribution network around the country which delivers electricity to consumers. The fact of the matter is that there have been steep rises in electricity prices over the last three years - by as much as 40 per cent - and they have been driven, as Mr Sims indicated in his presentation, by infrastructure investments that were long overdue and that are now starting to be made. We can be clear about one thing: these price rises are not being driven by a carbon price; there isn't one. They are driven by the long overdue infrastructure spending that is occurring.Mr Sims went on to make a further point that is extremely important. The point he made was that it is the absence of a carbon price that is a further risk to increases in electricity prices. That is due, as the Prime Minister has indicated in earlier answers, to the fact that the lack of a carbon price is creating investment uncertainty in the energy market, having the effect of seeing the postponement of important investment decisions about the future generation capacity of this country. Investment decisions into combined cycle gas turbine generation, for example, are being forestalled by the lack of a carbon price. There will be more emissions intensive generation infrastructure because of this.The OECD in a report released yesterday supports the government's view about carbon pricing being necessary to provide certainty to investors in the energy sector. That will help mitigate the impact of price increases on consumers in the future. These are facts that the Leader of the Opposition will not respect. The opposition with its scare campaign tactics and through its fear mongering about electricity prices is acting against the national interest. - The simple fact of the matter is that the biggest risk to electricity prices in this country sits there in the chair of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I believe that spending every dollar carefully is important - absolutely. - That is one of the reasons that I opposed the tax increase that the Leader of the Opposition wanted to put on everything that families buy at the last election. I thought that that was wrong. I do not know if the member thought it was right or wrong for the Leader of the Opposition to take a big tax on everything to the last election - a tax that would have flowed through to prices in Coles and Woolworths. I thought that that was the wrong thing to do, but she might want to express her own view about that, given her concern about the cost of living and families.On the National Broadband Network, what I would say to the member who asked the question is that you do not want to fall for the spin coming from your frontbench about the National Broadband Network. I refer the member to the studies that have already been released - the McKinsey Implementation Study, for example - about the National Broadband Network. I refer her to the many business and academic studies that show the productivity, service delivery and innovation advantages of the NBN and the projected growth in our GDP and the increased prosperity for Australians as a result of this new technology.I say to the member who asked the question that if she is really concerned about prices and families, she would be vitally concerned about the question of whether or not mum or dad has a job. The issue with the National Broadband Network is this: if we allow the technology of this country to continue to fall behind, then what will effectively happen is that we will export jobs to countries with better technology, such as Singapore and Korea. We would export jobs that would have supported working families and enabled them to pay their bills. - I was directly responding to the issue the member raised about cost of living and families, and I was directly responding on the productivity and competition advantages we need from this technology. I am not content to see this country export jobs to other countries. On the question of cost of living and the NBN, the member may be interested to know that, if we look at the costs of broadband among OECD countries, Australia is the fifth most expensive. That is happening now: real money coming out of families' pockets, out of their pay packets, to pay for the fifth most expensive broadband. I want to see Australia get the advantages of cheaper broadband. I want to see Australians get the productivity advantages of that, the GDP advantages of that, the health service delivery advantages of that and the education delivery advantages of that. That is why the government is determined to build the National Broadband Network and not settle for the 20th plan coming from the opposition - every one of those plans a weeping failure.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Reid for the question. In answering it, I remind the House that one of the cornerstones of the strength of the Australian economy has been the reliability of our electricity system. It is regarded as one of the most efficient national energy markets in the OECD world. For those reasons, we as a community are going through a series of significant increases in the cost of electricity, largely born out of decisions at a state and territory level. These decisions, as recognised by the Premier of Western Australia, are absolutely required to maintain reliability for the strength of the Australian economy. Currently in the pipeline are investments of about $100 billion over the next 10 years, of which $40 billion has currently been committed. Those investments are about maintaining the reliability of the system, going to fundamental issues such as network assets - the poles and the wires - and our generation assets.That is not just the view of the government. I remind the House that this issue was actually recognised by the member for Groom. I refer to his statement of 20 August this year when he said:If you look at where the investment has to go, there is massive investment to be made out there. You can't dally around.No, you cannot dally around on the investments in the current pipeline, and you cannot dally around on the question of our absolute need for new investment in generation capacity. We have a strong economy. Hence, the demand for energy is increasing. Our problem in recent years has been an inadequate amount of investment in new generation capacity in Australia. That is because there is no-one interested at this point in time in investing in new coal fired generation capacity in Australia.The House supported a renewable energy target. That will see an immediate growth in wind energy in Australia. We would all appreciate that that gives the energy system some challenges as to reliability. What is now required is some fundamental investment in baseload capacity, and the transitional fuel is going to be gas. To bring on these immediate investments in relation to the transition, we require a price on carbon so that the industry has the certainty it needs for the purposes of investing in Australia.For those reasons, this government is absolutely committed to building consensus on these issues, just as we built consensus in the 1980s and 1990s on fundamental restructuring of the Australian economy. This is equal to the changes we made on issues of globalisation, a reduction in tariffs and changes in the nature of workplace relations in Australia, which well positioned Australia for the 21st century. We now confront the same challenges on the issue of electricity and the reliability of our system, which is the key to our economic future from both an industry and a household point of view.In conclusion, I simply say that the sooner we resolve the issue of a price on carbon the sooner we can make these baseload decisions which guarantee our economic future, guarantee that when we go to work there are no brownouts and there is no shedding so we can actually put in a hard day's work for a fair day's pay and guarantee that when we go home we can turn on the lights and cook a meal without questioning the reliability of the electricity system in Australia. A price on carbon is fundamental to our economic future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. On the reference to the Productivity Commission delay tactic of the member for Wentworth: no, we will not be doing that. Clearly, when you have an opposition that is on its 20th plan - all of them failures - what it knows about is delay. It absolutely knows about delay - 12 long years in government, delay, delay, delay; in opposition, the generation of plan after plan, each of them a failure. And then of course it has already presignalled that, as an opposition, it is not at all interested in what the Productivity Commission has to say. All of this is just fitting in with its approach to politics - three words: demolish the NBN - in line with what the Leader of the Opposition stands for: three words on everything, and all of them about stopping this, ending that and demolishing something else, because his entire approach to politics is negative.Can I refer the member to the OECD report, because I think it makes some interesting reading. I would refer him to its contents. The OECD said:NBN is a far-reaching reform project to fill the gaps in the broadband internet sector.They said:NBN will improve internet services for the entire population and promote a fairer competition between private firms on retail services.They went on to say:Due to Australia's size and relatively low population density it will be difficult for more than one competing fixed telecommunications network to exist.And further:The NBN will avoid the risk of a geographic digital divide as it will cover the entire population, whereas if it were done by the private sector it would be done more gradually and only to the most densely populated areas.Of course, this was a factor recognised by the country Independents in this House because they did not want their communities left behind. They understood that the NBN would be a transformative difference for their communities and they did not want their communities to be left behind metropolitan Australia. Well, neither does the government. We want to govern for all Australia and the NBN is part of that. Then the OECD went on to find:The use of the new network can bring large savings, 0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent of GDP - they are large savings - to the cost of public services over a 10-year period in four areas: health care, education, transport and electricity, which on their own would warrant construction.So I ask the member for Cowan: why is it that he wants Australians to settle for health services, education services, transport services and electricity services which are not at the standard that we could have with the NBN? Why does he not want this nation to realise the savings identified by the OECD? We understand that the opposition will, at every step of the way, resist this nation-building project and this transformative technology, because that is what the opposition is: a bunch of wreckers. We will get on with building the nation and realising the new economic capacity and the new service delivery modes for all Australians that the NBN will give.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question. At the last election the Prime Minister made it clear that the government was determined to build consensus to support an important economic reform - that is, to introduce a carbon price into our economy. To achieve that aim, the government has taken a number of steps. The first one has been to establish the multiparty climate change committee. That comprises representatives of the government, the Greens, and the members for Lyne and New England. That committee is advised by four independent experts, and I have referred in my earlier answer in question time to the role of Mr Rod Sims. At the last meeting the committee released a number of papers covering areas such as the science of climate change, the action being taken in a number of other countries around carbon pricing and information on energy markets and electricity prices.I am sure the House will be interested to know that in Professor Will Steffen's presentation to the committee, advising the committee on climate science, Professor Steffen reported that there is now 100 per cent certainty that the earth is warming and 95 per cent certainty that human-induced emissions are the main cause of the warming observed over the last century. - I thought that statement may cause some mirth for the member for Tangney, who is currently auditioning to replace -  - The second initiative relates to the work that will be carried out by Professor Ross Garnaut, to update his 2008 climate change review. Professor Garnaut's update will be extremely important. It is due to be completed by the end of May next year and will, of course, be released publicly in progressive stages. Eight papers will be produced. The third initiative is what was announced yesterday - that is, a study by the Productivity Commission into the effective carbon prices that exist in the economies of our major trading partners. That will be another important contribution that is due to be finalised by May next year.The fourth initiative is the setting up of two roundtables by the government to engage with members of the business community and members of various non-government organisations, including environmental groups and unions, about the issue of carbon pricing.Finally, the other principal initiative that the government is currently working on and is well advanced in its preparations is the implementation of a new Climate Change Commission - another commitment that was made by the Prime Minister in the election campaign. The commission will play an extremely important role in engaging the public about the climate science, about the economics and about the importance and role of carbon pricing in driving reductions in carbon pollution.All of these initiatives and the debate that they will inform, and the papers that are being produced, will help build consensus in the community and deepen the level of understanding about the important public policy challenge that climate change represents in this country. All that we hear in this context from the opposition, in this crucial public policy issue for our national long-term interest and for economic reform in this country, is negativity. They say: 'Stop this, stop that. End this. Don't do that.' They wreck this, oppose this, run scare and fearmongering campaigns. They do not have one iota of an idea about a constructive contribution to one of the most important challenges we face in this country.

 - I thank the member for his question and his interest in this very important subject. I first became acquainted with the horrors of petrol sniffing when I was working in and out of the Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands of Central Australia in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Over the period, many things have been tried to address what is really a dreadful problem for many individuals and communities - something which has split families - and, obviously, young people, who are dying very much earlier than they should.Many strategies have been tried. One which was introduced by the now Leader of the Opposition as Minister for Health and Ageing was the rolling out of Opal fuel, which is a BP product, starting in 2005. In 2008, the government did an evaluation of the program of rolling out Opal fuel and discovered that we were able to reduce petrol sniffing in the communities which were surveyed by 90 per cent over the period. As a result of that, the government further took a decision to roll out Opal elsewhere.You are right: in March of this year we took a decision, and Minister Roxon, Minister Macklin and I announced the rollout of Opal fuel into the Kalgoorlie region, a $2.3 million project to roll this out, working with BP, who would supply the fuel. We would pay for the storage and they would then distribute it. Unfortunately, as you have noted, it has not come to pass, mainly through technical difficulties confronted by BP in getting the facilities in place in Kalgoorlie. However, I am assured by BP that they are looking at providing alternative strategies to supply Opal into the communities by the end of the year, subsequent to the completion of the fuel storage facility, which will be in the middle of next year, we believe. So we are hopeful that we can get Opal into the communities in a far more sustainable and reliable way by the end of this year or early next year, thus providing the opportunity for people in those communities who retail fuel to substitute Opal for their regular unleaded fuels.You asked me about what we can do to prevent regular unleaded fuels being introduced into these communities. Frankly, not a lot. What we have done is look at the possibility of mandating the supply of Opal fuel, but we have taken the decision that it is better in the first instance to provide voluntary compliance. However, we do have in our back pocket the possibility at some future point, if we are not successful in rolling out Opal in those communities that need it, to look at a legislative option.I should say that in the last budget we announced $38.5 million of new expenditure to roll out Opal into 39 additional communities across the Top End of Australia, starting in the western Arnhem Land region around Jabiru and Gunbalanya. That is happening as of December. As with the rollout of the fuel in Ngaanyatjarra communities, we will obviously have a public communications exercise to assure consumers that Opal will not affect their motors either in their vehicles or, in the case of Gunbalanya, in the small boat motors of fisherfolk.It is very important that we adhere to this strategy of rolling out Opal fuel into these communities. It is an extraordinarily successful project which, as I said earlier, was initiated in the first instance by the current Leader of the Opposition. But I am hopeful that we will be able to satisfy the needs of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands in the not too distant future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. For many of the most vulnerable countries around the world, climate change represents an existential threat -  -  - countries like Kiribati, countries like Tuvalu and countries like the Maldives. I find it remarkable that members would find this a matter of humour in this place. If you were to speak with the presidents of Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Maldives, they would have a different reaction. Furthermore, for many of the poorest countries in the world, climate change represents a fundamental challenge to economic development in terms of coastal inundation, water scarcity and the forced migration of populations. Again, those opposite, including the honourable member who interjects most volubly with his laughter: the President of Bangladesh has said to us in recent meetings that 40 million of her country's population lie potentially vulnerable to the inundation of the southern part of Bangladesh should climate change continue unabated. Those opposite may find this to be amusing. We on this side of the House find it not to be amusing but instead to be the basis of intelligent international public policy.When the countries of the world gathered at Copenhagen, they decided through a Copenhagen accord on four courses of action. One was an agreement for the first time that temperature increases across the world should be kept within two degrees Centigrade. Secondly, they agreed that, when it comes to the burden to be shouldered to keep temperature increases within that range, it should be undertaken by both developed and developing countries, for the first time. Thirdly, there should be a global system of measurement, reporting and verification so that states which commit to courses of action are held accountable for their commitments. And, fourthly, for the most vulnerable states, the countries of the world agreed on a $30 billion allocation by the year 2012 to assist them with the immediate tasks of adaptation.Since then, for the information of the House, 140 states around the world have now acceded to the Copenhagen accord. Australia is playing its part in this respect. We have allocated some $599 million out to the year 2012 to assist in a number of specific areas. Twenty-five per cent of that funding is to go to those countries which are small island states and most vulnerable states, and I have listed some of them already, and 25 per cent will go to those who are dealing with the problems of avoided rainforest degradation. These are practical courses of action which assist with adaptation and mitigation for climate change purposes. For example, in the island republic of Tuvalu we have used this allocation of funds to assist with the provision of some 576 additional water tanks to provide for water storage on that highly exposed island in the Pacific. We are allocating $70 million to work with Indonesia on avoided degradation of rainforest across an area of some 120,000 hectares of the Indonesian republic.We see actions undertaken by developed and developing countries around the world. In China we see actions to reduce energy intensity. In India we see actions to reduce energy intensity. In New Zealand a decision has agreed on a reduction in carbon by introducing a price on carbon through an emissions trading scheme. These are the actions of responsible governments around the world, developed and developing, and Australia is also rising to the global challenge.

 - If I could give a new member of the House a tip: don't take cast-offs from the shadow ministers of questions they are too embarrassed to ask. It normally gets you into trouble. I am not surprised that they would be too embarrassed to ask this one, because obviously it is a completely unnamed, unidentified source, and whoever it is and wherever the words are from they are completely wrong. As a government we have more assets patrolling our borders than ever before. We have a stringent mandatory detention policy. We have made some moves in relation to the circumstances of children. If the member is opposed to them, if the Leader of the Opposition is opposed to those changes in the interests of children, then stand up and say so. We are still waiting for a policy response from the opposition because of their internal divisions on this question.Whilst the opposition continues to play cheap politics - three-word slogans, stop this, end that, wreck, demolish - we will get on with the job of delivering in the national interest while the opposition stews in its own juices of bitterness, looking to impose that bitterness on the Australian people, putting their political interest in front of the national interest each and every time. The Australian people deserve better than this.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for the question. As a Queenslander, the member for Petrie has a strong understanding of the economic benefits of the Great Barrier Reef, but today I want to talk about both the environmental importance of the Great Barrier Reef and also the environmental threats from climate change.When we can easily lose the context of just how unusual the system that we have in the Great Barrier Reef is by international standards, we could look at a place like the Caribbean, where the reefs have 60 different species of coral compared to our own Great Barrier Reef, with 560 different species of coral. The reef is under threat very directly through climate change in a few ways: first of all, through significant increases in ocean temperatures; secondly, through increased acidification of the ocean; and, thirdly, through the impact of more major weather events. The impact of those major weather events is clear: as cyclones go through, the health of the reef is compromised immediately, both through the destruction of coral and also through the increased run-off of floodwaters, as they often bring nutrients and agricultural chemicals down to the Great Barrier Reef. Added to that you have the impact of bleaching, which occurs through the increased ocean temperatures which are being seen in the area.There is also increased acidification of the ocean. We often talk about the role that trees and forests have as carbon sinks. We forget the extent to which the ocean also plays that role. As it does, though, carbonic acid is formed and the pH of the ocean has fallen by 0.1 - towards a higher level of acidification. That has an impact. It does not kill the coral, but it means the coral grows more slowly. When you add the impacts together - the impact of major weather events and bleaching events - there is a need for the reef to recover, and with increased acidification that recovery happens more slowly. It means there are some really significant challenges to the reef by virtue of climate change.In dealing with that, as well as the government dealing with the causes of climate change, it is also important that we do what we can to improve the health of the reef so that recovery, even as these events occur, can at least happen in a more resilient ecosystem. That is why the government, ever since 2007, has been involved in the Reef Rescue program, working with $200 million under Caring for our Country and working directly with the graziers and the cane growers up and down the Queensland coast to change their systems. We have situations now where cane growers have managed to plot each square metre of their cane fields and connect that to a GPS, and they are able to locate very precisely where chemical and fertiliser is added so that no more than is required is used. When the rains then come, the run-off is reduced. Similar work is being done with beef producers to try to improve the ground cover so that run-off is diminished. This provides a greater opportunity for the reef to be a healthier system. - The member for Dawson, of all people, should understand this, because so much of the economy of his seat is reliant on there being a healthy reef system, a healthy Great Barrier Reef, to preserve the ecology of what is - at least members on this side of the House understand, Member for Dawson - one of the most precious systems in the world.</DOC>

 - Paul Howes and many people have views on the climate change debate. I have my views. I have my views about the operation of the electricity market. I have my views about the need to ensure that we price carbon to drive a fuel switch. I have my views about how we best enable innovation in the sector and the competitiveness of renewable energy. If the Leader of the Opposition had been paying any attention in question time yesterday then he would know that I actually answered a question directly on this point and I refer him to that answer. I also refer him to my speeches on the topic so that he can get more detail.What I can say to the Leader of the Opposition about how people form their views about carbon pricing is that people work through this issue and think about it. I think there is only one person in this debate who has ever been described as a weather vane on climate change. Of course, that description was by the member for Wentworth of the Leader of the Opposition when he recorded that:Tony himself has, in just four or five months, publicly advocated the blocking of the ETS, the passing of the ETS, the amending of the ETS and, if the amendments were satisfactory, passing it, and now the blocking of it.His only redeeming virtue in this remarkable lack of conviction is that every time he announced a new position to me he would preface it with 'Mate, mate, I know I am a bit of a weather vane on this, but _'There is only one person in this debate who is a weather vane, and that is the man who asked the question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He came to this parliament after a proud track record in education, having been a school teacher and a school principal, and in this place he has pursued education issues because of his passion and enthusiasm to make sure that every child gets a great education. As I have said, my vision, the government's vision, for the future of this country is that we have a strong economy that is ready for the challenges of the future and that we have the benefit of opportunities for all Australians - that every Australian gets the opportunity to succeed and prosper. But the truth is that in our nation today there are children who do not get a fair opportunity to succeed and prosper because there are children who do not get a great quality education. As a government we have set about, reform by reform, piece by piece, transforming that. We have understood that in order to make sure every child gets a great opportunity you need to start with early childhood education. We have invested in making sure that children in the year before formal school get the benefits of preschool and early education that are vital to ensuring that kids get a good opportunity in life. - A great quality school education is a foundation stone for opportunities in life. That is why this government has delivered a transformational reform agenda on school education and matched it with new resources. We have almost doubled the amount of money going into school education. We are working on teacher quality, national curriculum, transparency, trade training centres, reform to empower principals and reforms to reward teachers. We have also embarked on huge capital improvements to schools such as Building the Education Revolution, trade training centres and computers in schools. We are proud of that agenda.We care passionately about every child in every school and the retort of the opposition to this after the election campaign was 'Cut school funding' because that is what they stood for in the election campaign. We too understand that, in order to give people opportunities in life, we need a vocational education and training sector that is ready for modern challenges and is a truly national system. That requires reform and it requires resources and we have been driving reform and providing new resources to vocational education and training. The opposition slogan in this regard in the last election was 'Cuts to apprenticeships'. That is what they stood for.We too have been driving a reform agenda in universities so that they can be properly resourced and properly structured for the modern age. We know that the opposition stands for neglect of universities. We believe in opportunity for all. We understand education is the critical foundation stone to that and we are getting on with the job of delivering the education revolution as a result.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for education for his question. It does seem somewhat remarkable to me that on the day when the government has advised the Australian community of the new information that will be available on the My School website - a website that is transforming the way we think about national education and a website the opposition is now cat-calling about - it never had the guts or the courage or the reform drive when in government to get anything done on school transparency. It never cared once over 12 years about disadvantaged kids and it did not even have a list of the most disadvantaged schools. That is how little it cared, and on a day like today we have this kind of question. -  -  - As I was saying, on the question of education policy and disadvantaged children, if you care about disadvantaged children then as a government you go out of your way to identify disadvantaged schools. This government has and the Howard government never did. -  - To the shadow minister for education -  - In reply to the question from the shadow minister for education, the government of course is getting on with the job of building a stronger economy ready for the challenges of the future. We are getting on with the job of making sure we are governing for all Australians and providing opportunity for all. There is nothing more important to that than providing a great quality education, and the government has taken another step forward on that today. I would have thought that was of some interest to the shadow minister for education.But it is clear from the question that he has asked that these questions of school reform are not of any interest to him. I would say to him on the question that he has asked that the government will of course provide the funding for the construction of the Epping to Parramatta rail line as promised. The opposition might be completely unconcerned about infrastructure needs for the people of Sydney, but we are of course concerned about those infrastructure needs and we are concerned about driving community consensus and acting on pricing carbon, and if the shadow minister for education is in any doubt about that I refer him to my answers in this House yesterday.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for her question and know that she is very concerned to ensure that schools in her area benefit from the government's reform agenda and that we are offering every child in every school a great education. The principles that are driving our reform agenda are of course transparency: we want to make sure that parents and community members that care about education have more information than they have ever had before. We want to drive national consistency. That is what endeavours like the national curriculum are about. And we want to make sure that we are focused on improving results for kids. That means that you have got to invest in teacher quality, that means that you have got to invest in literacy and numeracy, that means that you have got to invest in the most disadvantaged schools in the country and that means that you have got to invest in school capital, because school capital matters. You need to keep building on those reforms, and this government will.We will be providing greater empowerment for school principals, having already during the life of this government, since 2007, taken more steps to empower school principals than any government before in the history of this nation at the national level. We will build on our rewards for schools and teachers to keep investing in the quality journey, to keep saying to every teacher, to every school, 'No matter how good you are today, we want you to be better tomorrow.' If you are going to drive this agenda then you have to have the information, which is why the announcement I made a little bit earlier today with the minister for school education about the new form of the My School website, My School 2.0, is so important. This is making sure that parents have more information than they have ever had before.Significantly, compared with the earlier version of the website, we will now have information on the financial resources available to schools from the federal government, from state governments and the amount collected from parents. We have improved the index which enables you to look at the disadvantage of schools. Until such an index was created under this government's leadership, there was not one. Over the 12 years of the Howard government there was no way of listing which were the most disadvantaged schools in the country because the Howard government had not bothered to collect or analyse the information. If you care about disadvantage then you need to know where disadvantage lies. We have ensured that we know where disadvantage lies through the construction of this special index, which has now been improved in this version of the My School website. And of course we can compare schools with schools that serve similar students because of this special index, and that reveals where best practice is and also where underperformance is, so we can share the best practice and we can remedy the underperformance.This version of the website, My School 2.0, for the first time can give you data over time. This is the first time that we have had kids sit tests so we can compare their learning journey over two years. I know Australian parents will be excited about this new information. They were excited about My School - 2½ million parents visited the website. We look forward to being able to launch the website in December and feed the community's thirst for this information in order to keep improving education.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. He is a man that I find I am in a lot of agreement with. I was in a lot of agreement with him when before the election he so fulsomely talked about how electricity prices were going to rise because of underinvestment. He talked about that before the election. He was very honest then, and he is a shadow minister who has obviously not signed up to the Leader of the Opposition's fear and scare campaign, trying to create the impression that if you price carbon then that is the sole issue. Somehow, the Leader of the Opposition is trying to create a fear campaign, pretending to the world that he is in a position to keep electricity prices down, when of course the member asking the question was very clear -  - I was going to the honesty of the member for Groom on electricity price questions, and I refer the House to his words before the election, where he talked about the enormous investment needed in electricity generation. He talked about the impact that would have on power prices. He is on exactly the same page on these questions as Premier Colin Barnett, who has talked about the need for power increases to feed investment. So if we are going to have this debate -  - I was asked about carbon pricing and electricity prices, and I am of course going to the question of what is driving electricity prices and drawing the House's attention yet again to the wise words of the member for Groom. What I would say to the member for Groom as well is that he is someone who in the past has understood the need to price carbon in this country if we are to tackle climate change. Indeed, he devoted many hours of his life to endeavouring, across the political divide, to find a constructive solution, a bipartisan solution, to the question of pricing carbon. I regret that people like the member for Groom, who have that kind of goodwill, are no longer allowed to reach out across the political divide because the Leader of the Opposition has defined his role in politics as three-word slogans and wrecking things - always putting the political interest in front of the national interest. I can say to the member for Groom in respect of the question that he has asked: we as a government will continue to work on the issues of pricing carbon. He may well at some point find himself in a position to work constructively with us, because I know that is what he would prefer to do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calwell for her question. I know that she has a strong interest in education, and represents her constituents in her electorate very well. Today, I was pleased to join the Prime Minister as we previewed the new My School website - My School 2.0. -  - The opposition's comments continue to indicate that they do not fully understand the website's importance. So, Mr Speaker, I take this opportunity through you to point out to the opposition that it is important that parents and the teaching community have access to transparent information about schooling in order to enable them to make decisions in relation to education generally. It seems to me that that is one of the most important things about the My School website, and it is something that the Australian community fully recognises, given that this website has had over four million visits in its current form since it was first launched in January of this year.This comes on top of an unprecedented reform agenda and the significant resourcing for education that has been a feature of this government. It is the case that under the new and updated My School website we will have the opportunity, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, to assess the progress that students are making in their schools in those literacy and numeracy subjects they are tested for under NAPLAN. That is how we learn - from the best performers. That is how we know to address any poor performers who have been left behind. The fact is that the My School website was a world first, and it is incredibly important for Australia that we have a website that is improved, a website that is updated and a website that has rich information that can assist students, parents and the broader school community.When the site goes live in December, for the very first time we will provide information on school finances across schooling sectors at the national level - something that has never happened before. This information will enable parents and teachers to follow a cohort of students as they move through school levels and see how they are progressing in literacy and numeracy. That is really important for parents and really important for students too.My School has nothing to do with naming and shaming. It is all about lifting education standards; about ensuring that we have transparency in education. It is an issue that is of great importance to all Australians. This government fervently believes that a great education is something which every child in this country deserves and needs, and we will deliver that to them. A quality education contributes to our national economy and it also enables all students, regardless of where they live, regardless of which school they go to, to fulfil their true potential. Education is not something those opposite took very seriously when they were in government. They were the flagpole fetishists who never, ever focused on the real deliveries that were needed. - The opposition leader says he liked his flagpole. They delivered flagpoles; we are delivering specific and additional investment on schooling to benefit students right around Australia. Look at the contribution and the commitment that this government has made through the national partnerships program - $1.5 billion for low socioeconomic schools, over $500 million in improving teacher quality, over $500 million for numeracy and literacy -

 - I thank the member for his question, and I thank him for asking a question which proves the point that the government and I have been making over the last few weeks, which is that we are seeing rising electricity prices - yes, we are. We are seeing rising electricity prices in a context where there is no price for carbon. The member knows that. The fact that we were going to see rising electricity prices was honestly spoken about by the member for Groom the day before the last election. We are seeing rising electricity prices because we have had underinvestment in supply capacity, and the best advice from industry is that continuing uncertainty about pricing carbon means that industry is anxious about how it is going to make its investments in the future.So, having just had a decade or more of underinvestment, would it not be completely negligent and not in the national interest to allow another decade of underinvestment to roll out because we did not give the industry the certainty it needed to know where it could invest, what sort of investments it should have been making, the technology it should have been using - all of the things that go with investment decisions worth billions and billions and billions of dollars? In giving the industry certainty we would be avoiding that underinvestment which puts real pressure on prices; avoiding that underinvestment which puts real pressure on supply. When the member for Groom said when we were last talking about pricing carbon that he was satisfied with the outcome of those discussions and that as a result of those discussions we had avoided electricity outages in Victoria, he was making an important point.The member who asked me the question is basically saying that he is content to fearmonger in this debate; he is content to be in denial of the needs of the future; he is content to see another decade of underinvestment in electricity. That means he is content to see upwards pressure on prices and insufficient supply, risking outages for Australian households and businesses because electricity is simply not there for them when they need it to run their business or when they need it to cook their dinner at home. I will leave the opposition to go out and argue to Australians why it wants energy uncertainty for them for the future. We will work our way through the issue of pricing carbon. If the opposition ever divert from their current course of three-word slogans, of wrecking, of negativity and bitterness, they can feel free to give us a call because we are prepared to have the opposition work through this important national reform with us.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hunter for his question and for his strong commitment to the importance of education in the development of this country. As the Prime Minister and the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth have indicated, this government has a very strong commitment to investing in developing the educational opportunity in this country. We have committed to increasing the year 12 retention rate to 90 per cent of the school-age population by 2015. We have also doubled the amount of money spent on schools in our first term of government. To put that into perspective, it took the Howard government three terms to achieve that same landmark. In other words, the difference between our commitment to expenditure on education and that of those who sit on the other side is enormous. And it matters for the country, because as strong education empowers the individual it also drives a more productive economy. That is what the nation should be investing in.I was asked about the infrastructure that has been undertaken. As part of the stimulus spend, the bulk of the money that we spent on physical infrastructure was invested in school infrastructure around the country. It was not just for the purpose of keeping people in jobs - and we have the best employment record of all the developed countries in the world as a consequence of that action - but also about investing in our future. It was not just a short-term measure; it was about the future. Every schoolchild in the country is benefiting from this investment, despite the carping criticism that you will get from the other side. There has been investment in better classrooms, in better libraries, in multipurpose halls, in science labs and in language labs.I was also asked about the impact in the regions. It is true that 40 per cent of the total expenditure that has been undertaken on infrastructure has gone to the regions. We understand the importance of bridging that gap between educational attainment in the regions versus that in the cities. I had the opportunity in the non-sitting fortnight to visit 10 regional centres around the country. A total of 375 projects under the Building the Education Revolution program are in these 10 centres, all of them commenced and 70 per cent of them completed.The point that I would make in conclusion is this: while we have been making that commitment - and we will continue to make that commitment - had those on the other side been elected this expenditure would have stopped. They went to the last election promising to cut the trade training centres and promising to end the expenditure on the school infrastructure scheme. Those on that side of the parliament have no commitment to the future of this country by sensibly investing in education. They come in here and criticise and carp; we get on with the task of investing in the nation's future.The member for Sturt then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. As he went through those statistics, what was going through my mind was, 'Thank goodness we saved Australia from the great big new tax on everything he was planning to support their paid parental leave scheme.' Thank goodness we saved Australians from that big new tax, which would have flowed through to Woolworths and Coles and put prices up. Thank goodness for that. Thank goodness that, as a government who understands that working families are under real price pressure, we saved those working families from Work Choices mark 2. Your cost of living is defined not just by what you go and buy and pay for but what you are getting in the door. - The shadow Treasurer was the prime advocate of Work Choices and the prime defender of the pay cuts and loss of conditions that it imposed on working Australians. Thank goodness we do not face the reintroduction of Work Choices.We as a government are providing support to families under cost-of-living pressures. We understand that they press on people. For example, we have provided tax cuts for three years in a row to assist working families. We have provided the education tax rebate to assist with the costs of getting kids to school, something that did not exist before this government. We will, as promised, add to it so that it includes school uniforms. We increased the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. Under this government, unlike under the Howard government, families with children in child care can get more assistance with their out-of-pocket costs for child care. We will move through and deliver the additional measures that we have promised. We will move through and deliver the new family tax benefit arrangements for families with teenagers, because we understand that teenagers are not cheaper to look after than children at an earlier age. We are also proud that we were able to deliver a major pension rise for Australians. It is often Australians with fixed incomes who suffer the most when prices rise. So we are taking a series of steps to assist with cost of living.I would say to the shadow Treasurer, who, I presume, is joining in the fear campaign of the opposition that, if he were being honest, he would be saying to his colleagues that it is in the best interests of this nation for us to be harnessing our strong economy, coming out of the global financial crisis so strong, by getting ready for the challenges of the future. That of course does require us to work through the debate about pricing carbon, it does require us to have the infrastructure of the future, such as the NBN, and it does require us to address human capital reforms, the reform agenda of this government. We will leave the three-word slogans and fearmongering to the other side. Remarkably, the shadow Treasurer has been out in the public domain in the last 24 hours or so, saying that it is difficult to get debates going in Australia about substantive issues and complaining about the media cycle. I can share some of those concerns with the shadow Treasurer and I do hope for a deeper debate in this country, because it will expose to the Australian people just how shallow he is.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question, because this government believes that education and training is not only the engine room of a strong economy but the essential foundation of a prosperous and fairer society. That is why, from day one, Labor have pursued a deep commitment to improvement in education and training not just as a matter of economic necessity but as a matter of social progress. We know that we have to do better when it comes to skills training. This is particularly important given the investment pipeline that we are seeing in the years ahead - a very big task ahead in terms of skills training.But we also need to make sure that the quality of our education can match all of the requirements of the jobs for the future. We see education and training at the very foundation of not only a prosperous society but also a prosperous economy, because it is also the key to productivity improvement. What we have seen over the past three years is a 40 per cent increase in training dollars. That has been essential. It will be essential to meet, in particular, the emerging needs and demand for further skilled labour and the apprenticeships that must come with that. That is why in the budget we extended the Apprenticeship Kickstart program and we established the Critical Skills Investment Fund. That is why in MYEFO last week we funded the trades apprentice income bonus in that important document.We also understand how important schools education is as well, and the government's efforts in this regard were commended in the OECD report this week. We have moved and made further commitments during the election campaign to provide new support for parents, students and teachers through high-quality online materials. We have, of course, provided incentives to improve school attendance and student performance, with rewards of up to $75,000 for primary schools and up to $100,000 for secondary schools. So much is being done and it is being done because we recognise that, in the economy of the future, knowledge and human capital are the key to future employment opportunities. Of course, the educational success of our children will determine how productive we as a nation are into the future.Ultimately, education is the key to opportunity, as well as to prosperity. These are the very big issues that have the attention of the government. Of course, we have the shadow Treasurer over there who is more focused on lawnmowers and leaf blowers, but we on this side of the House are focused on the very big questions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Goldstein for his question. I would say to the member for Goldstein that, if he is seriously concerned about debt and deficit questions, I can only imagine how anxious he was when he created the $11 billion black hole in the opposition's costings. After the election campaign, after the complete refusal by the opposition to get its programs properly costed, the shadow minister would come in here -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. On the question of prudent government financing, an $11 billion black hole is a very substantial problem and the member for Goldstein can answer to the Australian community for that. On the question of debt and deficit questions and prudent government financing, the member for Goldstein may also like to answer to the Australian community for why he and members of the coalition are preventing the passing in the Senate of a piece of legislation worth $1.9 billion in savings. How is it that the opposition can come into this place and actually claim any fiscal credibility, when that is their voting conduct? If you want to talk the talk then you really have to engage in the action that goes with it, and supporting a savings bill is part of that action. - I was asked specifically about stimulus payments. I was asked specifically about stimulus payments that have gone to supporting jobs. This government is proud of having supported jobs during the global financial crisis. When the world moved into the global financial crisis and accompanying global recession, it was the right thing to do to provide economic stimulus to support jobs - absolutely the right thing to do. I am proud that as a government we chose, as one of the single biggest targets for that stimulus, Australian schools. That was the right thing to do as well.Whilst the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government was answering his question, members of the opposition, particularly the shadow Treasurer, were saying, 'What have school halls got to do with productivity?' Well, I suggest he goes and visits a school that has a new classroom, new flexible learning areas that enable teaching in a different way -  - And of course the expenditure into Australian schools, the transformation of learning spaces which enables teaching to be done in a different way, is going to be part of tomorrow's productivity because productivity is very largely defined by the skills and capacities of the Australian people, and there is nothing more important to those future skills and capacities than what is happening in Australian schools today. So it was the right thing to provide economic stimulus to support jobs. The member for Goldstein may have preferred to see more people unemployed. That was not our way. We believe in the benefits and dignity of work.And now, of course, it is the right thing to engage in the biggest fiscal consolidation process since the 1960s to bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13 as promised. We promised it during the election campaign. We had our promises properly costed. We provided matching savings. What that showed is that we would keep the bottom line and bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13, and we will.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She is a person who has had a long-term commitment to education and training. In that context, coming from a resource-rich region, she understands the importance of government investing in a practical way in apprenticeship training. She therefore has been a long-time supporter of the government's apprenticeships in schools program related to the development of our trade in schools initiative. But the House is also well aware that we as a nation are under a lot of pressure at the moment because of a huge pipeline investment in our resources sector in Australia. Since May alone, $24 billion has been invested in new projects in Australia. One of those key projects is, for example, the British Gas coal seam methane project in Central Queensland, a single investment of $15 billion.For us as a nation, the real priorities there are how we lift productivity. Central to lifting productivity is investment in key initiatives such as infrastructure - but also apprenticeships and education. I am therefore delighted to indicate to the House that the government, having opened in October this year stage 1 of the Biloela apprenticeships centre, at a cost of $1.5 million, is now in a position to work with the Gladstone Area Group Apprentices company to secure the completion of this very important local apprenticeships centre with the commitment of an additional million dollars.In terms of this area, I indicate that, with respect to the British Gas project alone, we are talking about 5,000 jobs during construction and around 1,000 permanent jobs in the region with the operation of the LNG processing plant at Gladstone. But, from the point of view of local parents - and I spoke to some of these parents and the young apprentices when I visited Biloela not that long ago - this apprenticeship centre is so important to them. It means that they are keeping their children in the local region, in local high-skill apprenticeship training. It also overcomes some of the fears of those parents with respect to what has been a long-term issue of travelling long distances to areas such as Gladstone, Brisbane, Mackay or Rockhampton for apprenticeship training. Doing it locally is important to parents; it is also important to the young men and women whom I visited and discussed these issues with during my recent discussions at Biloela.So I simply say that the Banana Engineering Skills Training Centre, which will now go forward at Biloela with the support of the Gladstone Area Group Apprentices Ltd company, is a very important local initiative. It shows the benefit of government investing in education and training. It shows how these investments can add to Australia's productivity and, in doing so, ensure that we maintain our competitiveness and attract more investment to Australia. It is good for industry and it is good for young men and women wanting to explore high-skilled apprenticeship and trade opportunities in Central Queensland.</DOC>

 - I thank the member very much for his question. He raises the very important question of tourism. Of course, he would know that in his own electorate - because he comes from a very beautiful part of Australia - and right around the country tourism is a very major employer. In fact, almost one in every 12 working Australians is engaged in the tourism sector or connected to the sector, and it is our largest export services industry, worth $23 billion.He is also right that this is an industry under some pressure at the moment. The strength of the Australian dollar is making it difficult for local tourism operators and we do want to make sure that we are getting the message to Australians that they can go and look at very beautiful parts of Australia on holidays and spend their tourism dollars here. That is why the government launched in March last year the campaign from Tourism Australia that is called No Leave, No Life. I suspect there would be a number of members of this parliament, and indeed of the parliamentary press gallery, that could understand the resonance of those words: no leave, no life. We do want to see Australians using their leave. The campaign is already delivering results. Since its launch the total accumulated annual leave balance has fallen from 123 million days to 117 million days, so people are starting to use their leave, which is a good thing.Each morning and afternoon this month as people are starting to turn their mind to what we will do at Christmas - will we work through; will we take some leave? - they will hear on radio in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth about the No Leave, No Life campaign. They will have the opportunity to win a $2,000 voucher for an Aussie holiday as part of that promotion. On 4 December the second No Leave, No Life reality TV series will run on the Seven network, showing hardworking Australians taking a holiday, so that is another promotion venture to get people out and about. I am advised that the last time there was such a reality TV program it attracted 1.1 million viewers.Apart from getting Australians to holiday at home, we do want to get people from overseas coming here to our country, and that is why excitement is being generated around Oprah Winfrey coming to broadcast her very successful TV show from Australia, which is making a difference. The simple fact is that we made an investment of $1.5 million in this visit and it has already generated over $17 million worth of free advertising in Australia to talk to people about Australia.These are the promotional endeavours we are engaged in, but of course every member of parliament can play their part by picking up on the No Leave, No Life campaign and talking to their constituents about the importance of a holiday and the wonderful ways of having a holiday here in Australia. - I was referring to a confidential document, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The connection between skills and a more productive economy is a direct and clear one, unarguable, and it is one that this government understands very well. That is why we are investing in Australia's schools and universities to ensure that all Australian students have the skills they need to build a successful career and for us to have a successful economy. It is a pretty challenging time for students around Australia at the moment. Senior students have been sitting their final exams in the last few weeks and I would like to congratulate those who have finished. They will be feeling a sense of relief. Best of luck to those who are still going. Of course, many students are still thinking about what they will do next year, and this government is about supporting schools to prepare young people for successful careers. That is why we are investing in the Trades Training Centres in Schools program, an investment of some $2.5 billion over 10 years to enable all secondary students across the nation to access vocational education through trade training centres.On 4 November this year I was pleased to announce another 58 projects receiving funding under round 3 of the program with in-principle funding of some $219 million - 58 projects benefiting 195 schools, boosting the skills of thousands of students. These centres are being built all around the country. There has been great feedback from teachers, students and school communities. Amongst those I visited is the Southern Cross Catholic Vocational College in Sydney, where I went with my colleague the member for Reid and there are hairdressing and hospitality classes in action. I went to Broadford Secondary College with the member for McEwen to see the site for the new Central Ranges Trade Training Centre. Students there will be training for hospitality and tourism. These centres are making a real difference to students because they can get hands-on experience in the trade while they are still at school.I notice they are pretty popular with the opposition as well. The member for Gilmore was commenting on how 'delighted' she was that Vincentia High in her electorate was funded in round 3. The member for Dunkley said he was 'thrilled' with the funding to establish a trades training centre. But the opposition were pledging to cut $230 million from trades training centres at the last election, and now the shadow minister for education has been kicked out of the parliament. So there you go.As well as that, the government wants to support students to make sure that they have a tertiary education opportunity in their lives. We have committed $2.1 billion over five years from 2010 for the government to fund a place for all Australians accepted into eligible undergraduate degrees. This is a significant commitment by the Gillard government. What it means is that we are supporting high-quality teaching and learning, we are building new links between universities and disadvantaged schools, we are rewarding institutions that meet the quality outcomes and we are making absolutely sure that every student that comes through school gets the opportunity to either go to tertiary learning if it suits them or to take vocational skills training, which of course contributes significantly to our economy. This is something that those opposite do not understand. A trades training centre in a community brings together the whole of the community to encourage these students to build their capacities and skills so that they can actually contribute to our economy. This is something that we on this side of the House, the government of this country, take with absolute seriousness.</DOC>

 - Can I say to the young people in the gallery that the member refers to: of course I am concerned about their personal circumstances. Of course, as Prime Minister, I am concerned about their circumstances. I am concerned about the circumstances of any Australian, particularly any young Australian, who is battling illness and disease. I am very concerned about that. The government, through what it does - funding health - wants to be able to assist people in the best way possible. I also say to the young people in the gallery, and to the member, that there is a longstanding bipartisan process for dealing with the listing of pharmaceuticals. That longstanding process is that we do not have politicians pick which medicines should go on the list. We have medical experts work through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. When they make a positive recommendation -  -  - Perhaps I could say the next sentence. When they make a positive recommendation - and this was true under the Howard government too, so settle back down - the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee deals with the medical issues and makes a recommendation. Then the question of price is worked through by a pricing authority. It happened every time under the Howard government as well - to those members who are so excited about the question. Then government makes decisions on the basis of that. The Leader of the Opposition well knows this. He would well recall that when he was minister for health there were some celebrated examples of long-term delay in funding medicines. I just want to point that out to members opposite, because I think that is something they should contemplate - that this has been an issue in the past. Obviously, for the three young people in the gallery, I am very happy to receive any material from them that they would like me to see -  -  - I am very, very happy to receive any material from them. I am very happy to hear from them personally. I say to them that the government does have a proper process here. It is a process that has been gone through by governments in the past. These young people have our personal best wishes, compassion and support. What we do not want to see in this parliament - and what I think members of goodwill would hold themselves out against - is the politicising of questions like this one.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question. He understands that the National Broadband Network, which is being first rolled out in Tasmania, his home state, will transform education. Whether you are in Sydney, Tasmania, Mount Isa or Broken Hill, it will make a massive difference. It will change the link between educational opportunity and location. It is the most significant step we could take to change the spatial dimension of educational disadvantage in this country.Labor's plan will be an enabler of opportunity right across the country. New teaching applications, whether in our schools, our TAFEs or our universities, will flourish, using 3-D and interactive videoconferencing, specialist training and other measures. Together with our Computers in Schools program, broadband will give students full access to the opportunities of the 21st century. Universal high-speed broadband will also transform tertiary education. A specialty course taught in one university could be available right across the country. Regional centres like Port Macquarie will be able to keep their best and brightest rather than lose them to the city universities.When I was growing up, my cousins used to come down to Sydney from Coffs Harbour and Grafton because, once they finished school, they needed to come to the city to get educational opportunities. That will change. There are other advantages as well, and I will use one particular example. As part of the economic stimulus package, through the infrastructure employment program, we have funded $13 million to transform the Museum of Contemporary Art in Sydney. That will make a big difference to this iconic institution in the inner city of Sydney. But it will make a difference to the whole nation, because, as part of that project, the National Centre for Creative Learning digital classroom - there in the heartland, right on Sydney Harbour - will provide cutting edge visual arts infrastructure and education in regional and remote Australia, including teacher training and development, programs for children with special needs, online galleries, films and historical research. The Director of the MCA, Liz Ann Macgregor, has said that that would simply not be possible without the National Broadband Network. This is a transformative educational program and, indeed, the National Broadband Network will make it possible.But, of course, you cannot be part of the solution if you do not even get the problem. The shadow minister has said that the NBN is an answer to a problem that has not even been identified. If they do not know what the problem is with access and the difference that a transformative national broadband network will be able to achieve, then it is no wonder that they have a policy of just wrecking the NBN.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Obviously the government budgets, as governments in the past have budgeted, for the detention of unauthorised arrivals. For example, the Howard government spent, on the construction of Christmas Island, hundreds of millions of dollars in order to build that facility. So, detention arrangements do have to be paid for, and the government has made appropriate provision to pay for those detention arrangements.I would also say to the member that he would have heard me in this House in the past describe the opposition's slogan in relation to unauthorised arrivals - its three-word slogan, a three-word slogan that it went to the election with. Now I am in a position -  - The general policy area was asked about in the last few words of the question, so I am making my answer directly relevant to that. On the general policy area of unauthorised arrivals, the member who asked the question would have in the past heard me talk about the opposition's three-word slogan. Well, actually, there has been an overnight development. They used to have a three-word slogan of 'Stop the boats.' Overnight, as a result of statements by the shadow minister for immigration, their new slogan is: 'Lay out the welcome mat for 3,750 asylum seekers.' That is what the opposition now stands for in this debate. That is what they want to send as a message to people smugglers. The first 3,750 are fine. Well, on this side of the House we are not laying out the welcome mat the way the shadow minister wants to with his new policy -  -  - his new policy of 'Let's put out the welcome mat for 3,750 asylum seekers - ' -  - Instead, what we are going to do is the work required in our region for a regional protection framework and regional processing centre, because what we want to do with people smugglers is send them a very clear message that they no longer have a product to sell. - </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. In answer to it I would say that the government at an earlier stage, well earlier, released the implementation study. We have had the parliament considering the question of structural separation. The government's intentions to build a National Broadband Network to transform our nation's infrastructure, to make sure that we do not export jobs to countries like Korea, are well known. The National Broadband Network business case has been supplied to the government. It is more than 400 pages long and the government, as prudent and responsible managers, are now analysing the case in detail, running the fine-toothed comb through it, and that is absolutely appropriate when we are dealing with an infrastructure project of this size and this significance to the nation.The business case will be released publicly in December, as the minister for communications has indicated. What I say to the Leader of the Opposition, though, is that he really should come clean about all of this and indicate that he is not at all interested in the business case. No matter how good the business case is, no matter whatever it says, he wants to demolish the NBN. - I was asked about the role of the parliament and the NBN business case and I am answering that, Mr Speaker. I am making the simple point that in respect of the parliamentarians who are members of the coalition the business case is absolutely irrelevant to their decision-making because they are already determined to demolish the NBN. It does not matter how good it is for the nation, it does not matter what the business case says, they are all about a three-word slogan yet again: demolish the NBN. That is all that they are committed to. We are committed to delivering this transformative technology to the country. Meanwhile we see in the opposition that they are up to their 17th, 18th, 19th or 20th failed broadband policy. It is very interesting that on 27 October the member for Wentworth dropped to the Sydney Morning Herald as a story his new plan for CANco. Well, CANco has turned into CAN'Tco, because the opposition has not even bothered further releasing the policy. This is obviously speaking to a division in the opposition. The member for Wentworth believes in broadband, he wants to CANCo. The Leader of the Opposition wants to demolish the NBN, he wants to CAN'TCo. - As they just go through these very silly broadband policy iterations and sit divided on their front bench, we will be getting on with the job.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for her question. I know that she is deeply concerned about health services in her community, not only today but for tomorrow. As she would be aware each and every year health costs continue to rise. I refer the House to some Treasury analysis: the Treasury projects that health spending alone will absorb more than the entire revenue collected by all states in around three decades. I think people should think about the force of that number and that if we do not act - if we continue to say to state governments that they should have the disproportionate responsibility for funding hospital costs - then, looking at the next 30 years, what we are saying is that it would take more revenue than the states actually collect. This is not a sustainable position.We want Australians to have great health services today, decent health services, health services that meet their needs, and we want that to be the case in 10, 20 and 30 years time. In order to achieve that we need to deliver fundamental health reform, including the federal government stepping up to being the dominant funder of health. That is what our health reforms are all about. Those health reforms are about making sure that the federal government has the majority share for funding hospitals and that we fund primary care 100 per cent. Obviously, how well primary care, the first instance care that people need, is going determines the later burden on our hospitals, because too many people end up in hospital because they have not had the appropriate primary care at the right time.To deliver this health reform, we have entered into an agreement with states and territories around the nation - we are still in discussion with Western Australia - and we need to legislate in this parliament. -  - And the agreement that we reached with the states was that we would on average take one-third of their GST, but there would be variation from state to state, and that has always been clear. -  - It has always been clear in the government's own budgets. I would refer people to the fact that estimates of the amounts of the states' total revenue that would be dedicated to health were fully reported in the budget and the most recent estimates were included on page 114 of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. This information has been there for members of parliament and interested members of the public to digest.Now, apparently, the Leader of the Opposition is going to pretend he did not know about this in order to try to clutch for an excuse to wreck health reform. Members of this House should recognise that, if the Leader of the Opposition gets his way and wrecks health reform, he is then wrecking plans to do things like deliver $7 billion in funding to improve our health system, starting from 1 July this year - that is, wrecking things like an additional $15.6 billion in funding to address increased demand from 2014, and wrecking things like our ability to provide more doctors, more nurses and more hospital beds. There will be 6,000 more doctors, 1,300 new hospital beds and 2,500 new aged care beds. - Australians want improved health services. They do not want the wrecking of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question and I welcome very much his interest in equity in Australian society. It surprised me a little bit, but I very much welcome his interest in equity in Australian society. If he has such an interest in equity in Australian society and if he wants to pursue that interest I look forward to his support for the government's policies and plans, which of course are about fairness and opportunity and making sure we do not leave any Australian behind, and certainly not any Australian child. But now, through the prism of his new-found interest in equity, the member for Wentworth is right. Of course ABS and other statistics show that there is a differential use of broadband between income classes. I do not need that explained to me. I can walk the streets of my electorate to see that very visibly on display. And what is that about? Well, it is about education levels. It is about people who missed out on opportunities and great quality schooling early in life. It is about people who missed out on the transformative power of early childhood education. It is about people who came out of school education and often did not get the first step into the workforce - they did not get that apprenticeship, they did not get that start in life. It is about people who have been dependent on welfare over the long term - people whose skills and self-esteem have corroded as a result. Consequently, these people do not have in many ways the skill set they need to manage our ever-changing world. Of the things we are doing as a government, apart from our transformative agenda in early childhood education, school education, vocational education and training and university education, is committing to a transformation in welfare, in participation and in giving people the skills they need to intersect with the world that that live in and the skills they need for a job.Questions of price do matter to people on fixed incomes, which is why it is a national disgrace that our broadband is so expensive by OECD standards. From the simple principles of economics and market design that this side of the House understands, to reduce price and increase innovation you need to increase competition. That is why we will provide the National Broadband Network - a wholesale network on which there will be competition and innovation in products at the retail end to drive new service offerings. The price points will obviously vary depending on the service offering that people want, but, because of the competition, we will see better price points at which people can get their broadband.This is the vision of the future that the National Broadband Network promises for this country. In the meantime, the member for Wentworth is stuck with his CANCo plan, announced to the Sydney Morning Herald. He is so unpersuasive that he has not persuaded his frontbench colleagues of the plan. CANCo has turned into CAN'TCo, which has turned into Never-Will-Do Co. When it comes to understanding the needs of the modern society in Australia for national broadband, the opposition just gets further and further behind.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I very much enjoyed spending time with him at his GP superclinic and talking to him about the healthcare needs of his community.The member asks about risks to health reform. I am sitting across the table from the principal risk: the Leader of the Opposition, with his plans to wreck health reform in this nation. This is not a fever that has infected the whole of the Liberal Party, wrecking reforms that are in the national interest. Of course, Premier Barnett, in Western Australia, and I are not on the same page on health reform. That is well known. But I will give the Premier of Western Australia this - and it is certainly verified in the articles I have here: unlike the Leader of the Opposition, he does not seek to wreck health reform. He is very clear that he will do what he needs to do to facilitate health reform for those states that have agreed to it. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: have a look at this example.Then, of course, we have signatures from premiers and chief ministers around the country, other than the Premier of Western Australia. They are signed up to health reform and they want health reform. We have signature after signature, page after page. Yet the Leader of the Opposition, despite this agreement, wants to rip it up and end health reform. In doing that he would be ripping up this health reform plan, leaving it in tatters so that we cannot deliver a better system of services, more doctors, more nurses, more hospital beds and more aged care beds to Australians who want them. He just wants to rip this up and throw it in the bin.He is doing all of this because somehow, he says, he was taken by surprise by the fact that the GST arrangements that had been made between the federal government and the states meant that, depending on GST and health expenditure in each state, the percentage of GST subject to the new arrangements could vary from state to state. He was surprised by that. Why was he surprised? I am holding in my hand the COAG health agreement, which says on page 29 that 'from 2014-15, when the proportion of dedicated GST is fixed, each state or territory share will be determined by the actual amounts in each state or territory'. Why would he have been surprised?  -  
 - I thank the member for Hasluck for his acknowledgement that the coalition is a risk to health reform, but I say to him: do not pick up the Leader of the Opposition's burden. I think it is the Leader of the Opposition who is the risk to health reform. The excuse he is trying to use is that he did not understand the GST arrangements. Well, here is the bill that actually specifies those GST arrangements - that has made sure that people have understood it. It has been in the parliament a couple of times, and the Leader of the Opposition has never bothered to read it or come to grips with it. I am holding in my hand another federal government publication that makes clear the GST arrangements and also makes clear the benefits of health reform. Australians around the nation would be asking themselves why the Leader of the Opposition does not want them to have more doctors, more hospital beds and more aged care beds. The truth is that it is because he has never seen a cutback to health or a reduction in health services that he did not want to support. He has a track record as a minister for health, and he is trying to continue that track record as the Leader of the Opposition. Do not wreck health reform. This health reform is important for the nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I am prepared to send to the member some information about the track record of our National Broadband Network policy from 2007 to 2010, when the government determined, after advice and study, that it would move to a fibre-to-the-home model. I will also make sure that we send him the information that shows, from the Tasmanian example, what prices can be achieved through the National Broadband Network. The government has moved to this model because we did not want this country to end up with inferior technology to that of other countries around the world. We did not want this country in five or 10 years time to be exporting jobs that Australian families need to countries overseas because they have got better technology. And we did not want Australian consumers of broadband services in this country, whether they be businesses or households, to pay such high prices in world terms. We have very high broadband prices. Look at the OECD data and it will tell you Australians are paying top dollar for broadband. We can make a difference to that through the construction of the National Broadband Network and price competition.I understand that the member who asked the question was not here for all of this history, but I would put to him some very simple propositions. Do you want families in your electorate to have jobs? If you do, tick the National Broadband Network. Do you want families in your electorate to have the benefit of more competition, better broadband products and lower prices? Then tick the National Broadband Network. Do you want to see services like health and education delivered to constituents in your electorate - services, for example, like the ones we will support through Medicare so that people can have consultations online using the power of the National Broadband Network? Give it a tick. Do you want the GDP advantages that have been modelled and stated by organisations like the OECD? Well, give the National Broadband Network a tick.It is about competition. It is about competitiveness. It is about productivity. It is about the services of the future. It is about jobs. That is the vision of the National Broadband Network. That is why we are doing it. I would say to the member who asked the question: please do not quickly succumb to the Leader of the Opposition's counsel to you to be a wrecker and demolisher of every positive proposition you see. I am sure you came to this place wanting to make a contribution in the national interest. I look forward to seeing you do so by supporting the National Broadband Network.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chifley for her question. She of course has a keen interest in this. I know she is excited that -  
Opposition members - Greeenway! - Greenway. The member for Chifley and the member for Greenway are excited about these reforms! The member for Greenway has a GP superclinic in Blacktown that is now open for invitations to apply. She has 18 new beds that are due to open at the hospital in Blacktown. I know that, amongst other members in this House, she is very concerned to make sure that the health reforms do go ahead, because they are delivering to her community and have the potential to deliver even more to her community. We are giving hospitals the resources that they need to open more beds. Thirteen hundred extra beds are part of the commitment to the COAG agreement -  - I will take the interjection from the member for Dickson, because he misguidedly wants to refer to the AMA's reports that there are an extra 11 hospital beds. - If the member for Dickson, instead of calling out, actually read the report, he would know that that report is based on data from June 2009 - 10 months before the COAG agreement was even reached. Now what we know is that the member for Dickson and the Leader of the Opposition want to rip 448 extra beds out of New South Wales hospitals. They want to rip 300-odd beds out of Victorian hospitals. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition took on the mantle he had as the health minister, going down to Victoria and standing next to Mr Baillieu and saying that together they would rip up health reforms that are delivering hundreds of millions of dollars to the Victorian health system. They have said they will cut 334 beds in Victoria - 30 beds at Werribee hospital, 30 beds at Casey Hospital and 24 beds at Frankston Hospital. They will cut funding to upgrade seven new emergency departments. They will cut funding to upgrade new elective surgery facilities. And they will cut funding for medical equipment. This is just the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Opposition returning to form. When Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, was the health minister, he ripped $1 billion out of our hospitals, and now he is lining up to rip even more out of our hospitals, just when these reforms are starting to deliver beds and services to our community.In New South Wales 42 beds are going to Liverpool Hospital. I wonder whether the Leader of the Opposition wanted to talk to his backbench about ripping 42 beds out of Liverpool Hospital. Blacktown Hospital, in the member for Greenway's seat, as I mentioned, is getting 18 beds. There will be 16 new beds at Gosford Hospital. I do not think our two members whose electorates are serviced by Gosford Hospital on the Central Coast will be very pleased to find out that the Leader of the Opposition intends to rip out those beds and beds that are starting to service people in communities across the country. Our health reforms are providing the funding that hospitals need to be sustainable now and into the future, and Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, has said that the opposition are determined to rip those beds out of our hospitals.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Can I say to the member that what we know from international studies, including the work of the OECD, is that Australia has very high broadband prices. We know that. Then we ask ourselves, 'What is the solution?', particularly when we know people's demand for broadband, for the services that broadband can bring, is growing over time. You do not need to be an expert in telecommunications to work that out. Just think about your own home use or business use of broadband services 10 years ago compared with what you use today and imagine where we will be in 10 or 15 or 20 years time. Then think about the service adaptation that we are seeing, like the service adaptation in health, where you can have a consultation with a doctor through video conferencing in real-time with the diagnostics on the page so that if you are in a rural community and the doctor is in a metropolitan centre you can converse with each other as if you were in the same place. Obviously requirements for data transfer are growing.In these circumstances the solution the nation needs is the National Broadband Network bringing fibre with its capacity and bringing competition on price. This is pivotal to an understanding of the National Broadband Network - that retail providers will be competing on price, on the quality and innovation of their products. If you believe that competition is a good thing, if you believe that markets work best when there is competition, if you believe, having looked at other areas of human experience in our market economy, that competition has brought benefits, then you would support competition in the retail service provision in the national broadband area, and that is what the National Broadband Network will bring.So can I say to the member opposite who asked the question: I am sure that your constituents ask you, as a new member, 'When will I get better broadband services?' I know that members get these questions all the time. I do, members of the government do and clearly members of the opposition do. We know that, because many members of the opposition have been out spruiking about delivery of broadband to their constituents even though they then come to this parliament and oppose it. We have got the member for Dickson, who has been out there saying that he is working hard to ensure residents in Pine Rivers have access to broadband. We have got the member for Dawson, who is urging broadband equity. - What I am pointing to is the communication to constituents about price questions and the benefits of retail competition - the question I was asked. To the member for Dawson, who raises the point of order, I note that he was running on the ABC news saying that he urged broadband equity, so I thank him for his support for the National Broadband Network. It is much appreciated. Thank you very much. - Now the shadow Treasurer is yelling out, 'It's our policy.' Is that 'CANCo.', 'CAN'TCo.', 'Won't Co.', 'Slow Co.'? Which policy is that? Is it No. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20? -  - Which policy is the shadow Treasurer shouting about? As the opposition sits there in denial of the future, as the opposition sits there weltering in its bitterness and its divisions, as it sits there privileging its political interests over the national interest every day, we will get on with the job of building the National Broadband Network.

 - I thank the member for Robertson for that very important question, because three weeks ago I introduced into the House the most significant reforms of federal-state relations relating to health in decades. These health reforms and the changes to federal-state financial relations are not just about delivering better value for every health dollar -  - they are also about improving the quality of health care into the future. This is particularly important given the challenges of an ageing population. These reforms are absolutely essential so that future generations can have access to affordable health care. As the Prime Minister indicated before, without substantial action, without substantial reform, healthcare costs will consume the entirety of state government budgets when it comes to their own source revenue in 2045-46.This is an enormous challenge for Australia. It is not one where we can stick our head in the sand and say it will go away, like those opposite. It is a challenge that this government intend to meet. We have a passion and we have a commitment to deal with the long-term challenges facing this country, and in the area of health care they are great. But of course those opposite have decided that they want to wreck this package. They would rather see the government fail than the country succeed. They would rather wreck any reform in the name of short-term political advantage, because they are not interested in the long-term national interest. That is why they are currently misleading the Australian people about the nature of this package. The Prime Minister went through all of those misleads before.They are claiming that nobody knew there would be different amounts of GST. That has been there in all of the statements. They are out there actively misleading the Australian people and they are doing it because they are embarrassed by their opposition to this essential reform. The states signed up to this package at COAG. Western Australia said they would not sign but they were prepared to cooperate. Premier Barnett is on the record as having said that because even he understands that there needs to be very substantial reform.At the same time as they are threatening this package in the Senate they are also opposing vital savings that we are putting in place, vital savings that are necessary to get value for money. The opposition, the Liberals, are now opposing $3.9 billion worth of savings in the Senate - more wrecking; this time trying to wreck the budget.They come into this House and say they are very concerned about the budget deficit. They go up into the Senate and say, 'How can we make it bigger?' They are up there opposing essential savings - $3.9 billion more - and for that they should be condemned. This government is absolutely determined to put in place the long-term reforms which will deliver quality health care and do it in a way that is sustainable and affordable for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question. First and foremost, I will get the transcript checked because from dint of long experience I know that claims made by the opposition do need to be checked and checked extensively. Second, I would say to the member who asked the question that anybody who has seen the minister for communications talk about the National Broadband Network - talk about it in detail at length; talk about its technical capabilities, sometimes at extraordinary length - would know that he is a man who is fully conversant with the National Broadband Network, how it is being delivered and what it can do.But I would also say to the member: this is the Parliament of Australia, where we are supposed to be focusing on the issues that most matter to the nation's future. When a transcript about an individual interview is a thing of the past, what will matter to this nation's future is the power and capacity of the infrastructure that we are proposing in the National Broadband Network. Once again my challenge to the opposition is to stop dancing around the substance of the debate and actually get up and justify why you want Australia to have a fourth-, fifth-, sixth- or seventh-rate solution to our National Broadband Network needs. Why do you want to export jobs to Korea and Singapore so that they will be done by people there, rather than by Australians? Why do you want to deny Australians the service innovation in health and education that will come from the National Broadband Network? Why do you want to deny Australians the benefits of the GDP growth that will come from the National Broadband Network? Why do you want to deny Australians the price advantages of having competition in the retail network? Why do you want to take all of these things away? Now the reality of this debate when we strip it all down -  - Being relevant to the question I was asked about the National Broadband Network, about this government's degree of confidence in the network, in the Minister and in our program for change, let me say I believe Australians deserve to have a broadband network that is equal to the challenges of today and tomorrow. I believe Australians deserve to have the jobs of the future rather than to see them exported. I believe Australians deserve to have the benefits of price competition on the network. I believe Australians deserve to have the services innovation we will see from the network.I would say to the member: I understand that in the lead-up to the election the opposition was politically mispositioned on broadband. It had a policy it was so ashamed of that the Leader of the Opposition would not even bother going to the launch and now it has got its 'CANCo., CAN'TCo.' policy. But it is time to rise above this political interest, their humiliation in moving policy and just acknowledge they are wrong and it is time to act in the national interest. Acting in the national interest is facilitating the delivery of the National Broadband Network.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Shortland. New members may not know that she has campaigned long and hard on making sure that drugs are affordable for the many pensioners and low-income earners in her electorate. So I am sure that she is amongst many on this side of the House who were interested when the government earlier this year was able to reach an agreement with Medicines Australia that was good for business, was good for taxpayers and, all importantly, was good for patients. But unfortunately, despite the fact that this agreement reached by the government with Medicines Australia meets all of those tests, it does not meet the tests that the Leader of the Opposition and the Liberal Party apply in deciding whether or not they will vote for measures in the House or in the Senate. This is a measure which will deliver $1.9 billion of savings, and this comes in the context of a PBS which funds thousands of drugs every year to millions of Australians at a cost of billions of dollars, which both sides of the House have supported for many, many years. But unfortunately, when an agreement is reached to try to keep that extraordinarily beneficial scheme sustainable into the future - to allow us room to put new drugs onto the PBS, to make sure that it is affordable so that low-income earners can get the assistance of concession payments and, when they reach their threshold for the PBS of 52 prescriptions, they can get their drugs at a lower price - the Liberal Party puts all of that at risk by opposing this agreement reached between Medicines Australia and the government.It is based on a theory of improving competition, making sure that the taxpayer pays the price for a drug which is currently being paid through a discounting arrangement so that the taxpayer does not have to pay an extra amount to pharmacists or others that are somehow in the supply chain. We want to improve that competition, but the new Liberal Party does not seem to even believe in competition anymore. They certainly do not believe in fiscal responsibility, because if they vote against this measure in the Senate they are shooting a $1.9 billion hole in the budget, on top of a $10 billion mistake to their costings during the election campaign. I might just also add, for people who remember this dispute during the campaign, the Liberal Party supported these measures at that time. Not only did they support them; they thought an extra $1 billion of savings could somehow be eked out of this arrangement. Now they do a backflip. They come into the parliament, they oppose our sensible measure that has been agreed with Medicines Australia and they run away from their extra $1 billion worth of savings. It is a shame to have the opposition in this House oppose a measure that is agreed to by business, oppose a measure that benefits taxpayers and, most importantly, oppose a measure which is of benefit to patients.</DOC>

 - To the Leader of the Opposition I would say: just because you make something up does not make it true. Your contention about pricing is wrong. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition: I understand, coming from across the political divide, he may not want to take advice from us, but perhaps at some point he should talk to people with expertise in this industry. I refer him, for example, to Paul O'Sullivan, the Optus CEO, who says - and it goes directly to the question of price:Optus is supportive of the government's bold plans to create a single wholesale network which will bring high-speed broadband, cheaper pricing and choice to all 22 million Australians.The Optus CEO - would he know something about pricing in telecommunications? He goes on:I would urge all sides in this debate now to rise above politics and do what it takes to ensure that all Australian consumers and businesses can benefit from real competition in fixed line for the first time.The Leader of the Opposition may have been misadvised. He may have got these erroneous facts into his head. It is time for him now to actually do some patient work and to look at the National Broadband Network, to look at what experts are saying about it, to look at the fact that Australians pay high prices for broadband and to look at the fact that the industry is telling us - and the Tasmanian example bears it out - that by creating a model with retail price competition you get cheaper prices, because that is what competition is all about. Surely the man who is the CEO of Optus would know something about price competition, and that is what he has said. Of course, I could refer the Leader of the Opposition to many others in the industry who have made comparable statements about the National Broadband Network.The premise of the Leader of the Opposition's question is wrong. Consequently, the conclusion he is seeking to found on that premise is wrong. He is acting to deny the benefits of competition in telecommunications. I always thought -  - When I am asked a question the premise of which is wrong, I will correct that premise because the House should not be left under any misapprehension. The Leader of the Opposition is not telling the House factual information. I would have thought that it was axiomatic that people who join the Liberal Party believe in competition and the benefits of competition. It would truly turn the founders of the Liberal Party in their graves to see what an ideological shambles the Liberal Party is in the modern age and how determined it is to wreck rather than serve the national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question, because in his electorate, where he has both urban and rural constituents, they will benefit significantly from the broadband network, being able to access e-health services into the future. This investment in the National Broadband Network will actually mean that we are capable of things in the health system that have not been delivered before. The infrastructure that is being built is going to provide universal, reliable and superfast broadband to homes, schools and hospitals. This is going to make the system capable of developing nationwide e-health services like telemedicine, online consultations, electronic health records, coordinated care and online health education. In the member for Blair's seat the potential for being able to link, for example, Ipswich Hospital with far flung services and communities to the west of Ipswich is going to change the way health care can be delivered into the future. It will allow, for example, in-home monitoring and care for the elderly. It will allow long-distance emergency intervention and remote care using video communications.You do not need to just take the government's word for this. Have a look at other commentators and their views about what the National Broadband Network will do for the health system. Access Economics reports that telehealth in Australia will deliver between $2 billion and $4 billion of benefits each and every year, especially for the elderly and rural and remote communities. We can look at the member for Bradfield in The Wired Brown Land. He says -  - It is unusual to interject when you are actually being quoted from and the member for Bradfield probably will want to hear this. He said in his book:Equally importantly, there would be a continuing ferment of innovation. With multiple service providers able to deliver services over the new network, there would be new ideas emerging all the time, including many attractive choices which are not available today.You can look at the National Information and Communications Technology report, where they say that the NBN will provide a unique opportunity to catalyse change in the way that health care is provided. In fact, they go so far as to say that we have the opportunity to use the NBN as a catalyst to jump-start Australia into a leading position in telehealth care. Why would you stand in the way of that? Listen to Steven Love, a pharmacist who is an NBN customer in Tasmania. He says:The NBN will provide huge potential for lots of new applications, especially in health, which are of an interest to me being a pharmacist.It is time for the opposition to listen to the community instead of continuing to campaign, as they did in the election, to scrap e-health, to close GP superclinics and to not support GP after-hours services. The benefits and potential of health care being delivered through the National Broadband Network are enormous and it is about time the opposition started to listen to the community. - </DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. As the Leader of the Opposition probably should be aware, the government has said consistently that there would be an inquiry on privatisation. At the stage that we thought circumstances were right for privatisation, we would need to fully inquire into the matter. In order to deal with these questions in the Senate, we have been happy to agree that there will be parliamentary oversight as well. The Leader of the Opposition has had many different positions on questions of parliamentary oversight. Some days he is in favour; some days he has not. But we have been happy to agree on the question of parliamentary oversight in this case.I also say to the Leader of the Opposition that, on the question of the bill before the Senate, there remains a critical decision for him to make. He needs to decide whether or not to stand in the way of this profound microeconomic reform and structural separation in our telecommunications industry. He needs to decide whether he will agree with that profound microeconomic reform or once again play the role of wrecker. In the modern age, the Liberal Party takes pride in the fact that, when in opposition during the Hawke and Keating governments, they did not resist from the opposition benches waves of important reforms brought to this country by the Hawke and Keating governments in order to open up our economy. The Leader of the Opposition might do well to reflect on the heritage of the Liberal Party on these questions and get out of the way of this profoundly important microeconomic reform.</DOC>

 - As members of the House would be aware, I travelled to Lisbon on the weekend and attended there the meeting of the 48 countries who participate in the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. This was a NATO-ISAF summit. The summit was attended by President Karzai of Afghanistan, President Obama, Chancellor Merkel, Prime Minister Cameron and the President of France, Mr Sarkozy, among others. The purpose of this important meeting was to bring together ISAF partners to discuss and determine the future strategy in Afghanistan. Importantly, the meeting heard a report from General Petraeus, the supreme commander of the operations in Afghanistan. The message he very clearly gave to the meeting was that the momentum of the insurgency has been checked, that progress is being made and that we can now move to the process of transition where, place by place, security leadership will move from ISAF forces to local Afghan forces. Transition will happen place by place, depending on conditions on the ground, district by district, province by province. It will be a rigorous process and it will only occur when Afghan forces are able to take security leadership. As I have said to this House before, a condition of taking security leadership needs to be irreversibility - that is, we should not transition out only to transition back in.The Lisbon meeting decided that transition should start in early 2011, with a target completion date across Afghanistan of 2014. That fits with President Karzai's goal to have Afghan forces in security leadership in his country in 2014. The outcomes of the summit are welcome and the move into transition in early 2011 is a welcome step. But, as General Petraeus said, nothing in Afghanistan is easy. No transition date has been set for where we work in Oruzgan province. The best advice to us remains that we will be engaged in training there for two to four years to train the Afghan National Army. I echo President Obama's words that training is the ticket to transition, and that is what we are doing in Oruzgan province. I have consistently said in this place, and I said it at the NATO-ISAF summit in Lisbon, we need to be realistic. We will stay engaged in Afghanistan in some form to the end of this decade at least. Building democracy is the work of a generation of Afghan people. The summit reemphasised the importance of supporting Afghanistan in an enduring way. I welcome the NATO enduring partnership with Afghanistan. Once again, to echo the words of President Obama, the people of Afghanistan need to stand up and take control of their country in the provision of security, but we will be standing alongside them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It is not clear to me whether he slept through the parliamentary term 2007 to 2010 or he has simply forgotten it, but if he remembered that parliamentary term he would recall that the question of pricing carbon was probably one of the biggest single debates we had in this parliament. Obviously, our overwhelming Work Choices was also a very big debate. As we worked through our way through the question of pricing carbon, those on the opposition benches had every potential position known to humankind. They believed in climate change, they did not believe in climate change; they believed in pricing carbon, they did not believe in pricing carbon; they believed in a market based mechanism, they preferred a tax - and on and on it went. Courtesy of the member for Wentworth, we finally found out what was driving all of this division within the opposition. - I am responding to the question by indicating the process that led to where we are now with the creation of the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. In understanding that, it is important to understand the twists and turns of the opposition on this. We finally worked out, courtesy of the member for Wentworth and his description of the Leader of the Opposition as a 'weathervane', that the Leader of the Opposition's version of dealing with climate change is that you go outside, you stick your finger up in the wind and you see which way the political winds are blowing and then you decide what you are going to do about climate change.We do not agree that weathervane focus-group-driven politics is appropriate - the kind subscribed to by the Leader of the Opposition - so we are seizing the opportunity of this new parliament to bring together people of goodwill, who believe climate change is real, who believe that human activity is causing climate change and who believe in the need to price carbon in order to deal with climate change and in order to meet the carbon emissions reduction targets that are actually bipartisan politics in this parliament.We will keep doing that, and I say to the member who asked the question: if he has a serious interest in tackling climate change he should converse with his leader about putting his finger back outside, testing the political winds and finding that the Australian people are actually looking to us to do something responsible in this place. You would have the opportunity to then participate in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. In front of the Senate at the moment is an incredibly important piece of legislation, which is the competition and consumer bill, that structurally separates Telstra's retail arm from the rest of the company. This is a profoundly important piece of microeconomic reform. It will create a transparent regulatory framework that delivers quality, choice and competitiveness so that consumers benefit and so that market entrants, who would provide retail competition, do not face barriers to that entry.This is a profound test for the opposition as to whether or not they believe in this kind of competition reform, this kind of microeconomic reform. This legislation is necessary to overwhelm one of the mistakes of the past which was the failure of the Howard government, of which the Leader of the Opposition was a part, to deal with regulatory settings when they privatised Telstra.What the government is seeking to achieve in this legislation is not just paving the way for the NBN. We are fixing a major market failure left to us by those opposite. Of course, this just equals simple common sense. We would not allow one petrol company to own all of the oil refining in this country. We would not allow that to happen. We would not allow one supermarket to own all of the farms. When we are looking at telecommunications we need to achieve structural separation so that we can have proper price competition in the retail market.Interest groups, experts and even the member for Bradfield in an earlier iteration all supported this step to increase competition. Now when we are looking at this legislation we find that it is an important microeconomic reform. It is also vital to enabling there to be one wholesale price around the country. If you care about microeconomic reform you will support this bill. If you care about regional Australia and its ability to have the same wholesale price - whether it is in voice, or whether it is in television or whether it is in broadband - then you will support this bill.Then, of course, you will support this bill if you actually accept the advice of Telstra about what it now believes should happen. I direct people's attention to the statement last Friday of Telstra's chairman at the shareholder meeting when he said:We remain focused on ensuring that we turn the non-binding Financial Heads of Agreement into Definitive Agreements with NBN Co._            _            _We believe that the terms we have negotiated are in the best interests of shareholders _We are calling on the opposition to support this bill. Whilst we call for that support I note that the member for Wentworth has publicly supported structural separation. I also note that the member for Wentworth now has 10 million reasons to support the NBN as well. - I was simply making statements about the bill in the Senate and motivations in relation to that bill. The member for Wentworth has 10 million reasons to be supportive of the NBN. Most politicians get asked to put their money where their mouth is; we simply ask the member for Wentworth to put his mouth where his money is.</DOC>

I am sure he would be aware that the breakfast was well attended by members from both sides of the House and from the crossbenches and senators who have taken a close interest in this good work that the Cancer Council has been doing in raising awareness about bowel cancer screening. I can advise the House that we are very conscious of the request to expand and extend this program. The member would probably be aware that, in 2008, our government made a decision to not only provide for the continuation of the program - something that had not been provided for in the forward estimates by the previous government - but also extend the program to include 50-year-olds, the date at which screening for bowel cancer should commence. As the program currently stands, it is available to 50-year-olds, 55-year-olds and 65-year-olds. The government has received advice that the absolute rolled gold clinical standard would be to commence screening at 50 and to do that every two years thereafter. We will be considering those proposals in the budget context next year.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for his very important question, because the NBN is absolutely critical to driving productivity and innovation in our economy and to providing basic services to all parts of the country at an affordable price. As I travel around this vast country and around the regional areas in particular, I find that they understand the importance of the National Broadband Network. When you go to Mackay, to Rockhampton, to Tasmania and to Western Australia, you find that regional Australians understand the importance of the National Broadband Network to their capacity, in particular, to do business and to be joined up to the national economy and the international economy. The NBN is a very important way of driving economic prosperity. It is a wholesale network and that is why, as the Prime Minister said before, it will drive competition amongst retailers and, because it will do that, it will drive prices down over time. That is recognised quite generally. For example, it is recognised by the Chairman of the ACCC, who has described the NBN as 'the most significant pro-competitive stance we have ever taken in this area of telecommunications'.It has been a dream of economic reformers to achieve structural separation and it is incredible that, in this House, the Liberal Party could now be opposing structural separation. That is why the member for Wentworth is such a hypocrite: he is prepared to make a quid out of it but he is also prepared to come into this House and oppose the structural separation of Telstra. Nothing demonstrates more the hypocrisy of those opposite on this question than the position of the member for Wentworth, who absolutely understands the importance of the NBN to economic growth, to competition and to people living in regional Australia. Of course he has been given his instructions to come into this House and demolish it, but he is still happy to make a quid out of it. Nothing demonstrates more the fact that those opposite are on about short-term political advantage, not long-term advantage. They would rather see the government fail than see the country succeed. They would rather tear the economy down than build it up. We on this side of the House are nation builders and we understand the importance of this vital enabling technology. We have had an extensive examination of the NBN. We had a committee of experts who said there was no private-sector proposal that delivered value for money. We have had a detailed implementation study, and now we are preparing a business case that those opposite say they will not accept in the first place, because they are concerned with politics not the long-term national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and, first and foremost, the assertions in it are wholly untrue; second, this is the government that delivered a historic increase in pensions to Australian pensioners, and we are proud we did. The member who asked the question might want to reflect on why he is a supporter of a political party that was in office for almost 12 years and never delivered a pension increase of that magnitude. We will be very, very happy to receive his congratulations for having provided that increase to pensioners. We thought it was the right thing to do, and we did it.On the National Broadband Network, we also believe this is the right thing to do. Yes, we are being careful and methodical and diligent and prudent every step of the way as befits a government that is governing in the national interest. That is why the National Broadband Network has been the subject of reports and studies commissioned by the government and is also the subject of investigations by various parliamentary committees at various stages, including particularly in the Senate. So I would say to the member opposite that at some point he needs to think for himself and work this out: is he going to follow the Leader of the Opposition down a path of political destruction and demolish the NBN, or is he going to come into this parliament and stand up for his constituents, stand up for their ability to have superfast broadband, stand up for their ability to be participants in an economy that will have the additional productivity and prosperity that broadband will bring and stand up for their ability to get the healthcare and education services of the future because of the existence of the National Broadband Network? I understand he is a new member and obviously would still be thinking about these questions, but I am confident that, if he thinks about them seriously, he will come to one conclusion, which is that he should support the National Broadband Network.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. Indeed, there are many signs of confidence out there in the National Broadband Network. This is no surprise because the studies show that innovation from ICT is the biggest, single driver of business productivity. The Centre for International Economics has found that high-speed broadband could lift national economic output by 1.4 per cent. NBN does have the confidence of key players in business as well as in parliament. Peter Strong, the Chief Executive of the Council of Small Business Organisations, said: 'We want it, we need it.' The CEO of Primus Telecom, Ravi Bhatia, said of the NBN: 'Consumers want it, businesses want it, and the industry wants it.'I am also asked about parliamentarians and their response and whether they have shown confidence in the NBN. On day one, Senator Barnaby Joyce said: 'This delivers a strategic infrastructure outcome.' He was straight out of the blocks in support of the government's plan for the National Broadband Network. The member for Bradfield in a previous life said: 'I believe the possibilities are extremely exciting.' But of course there is an even greater sign of confidence in the National Broadband Network, and that is the member for Wentworth's 5.4 million reasons - 5.4 million shares in a company, Melbourne IT, which stands to benefit from the National Broadband Network. There is a great Australian saying: 'Put your money where your mouth is.' Well, the member for Wentworth's money is heading towards the NBN but his mouth is heading in the opposite -  - The Managing Director and CEO of Melbourne IT, Mr Theo Hnarakis, has said in the 2009 annual report - All imputations of improper motives to a Member and all personal reflections on other Members shall be considered highly disorderly.I put it to you that suggesting improper motives on behalf of the member for Wentworth is highly disorderly. He is continuing to do so, and I ask you to rule it out of order. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The CEO of Melbourne IT says this in their annual report with the headline 'A bright future':_ with government investments in next generation high speed networks occurring around the world - including Australia with the NB - I believe we are about to witness another wave of online growth in the coming years which will create new services, new business models, enhance productivity, and deliver new wealth.That is a stunning endorsement from the CEO of Melbourne IT, one which I concur with completely, and clearly so does the member for Wentworth. I am reminded of the scene from All the President's Men where Deep Throat is talking to Robert Redford playing Bob Woodward. They are talking about what happens if there is not quite a ring of truth. Deep Throat gives some good advice, and we take this good advice when people are assessing how fair dinkum people are about the NBN. He says this: 'Follow the money, always follow the money.' -  -  - To assist the House, if there is any offence taken by the member for Wentworth, I withdraw. - </DOC>

 - The National Broadband Network is going to give every school in Australia access to high-speed broadband. The fact is that a national broadband network delivering decent speeds will be terrific for students and for teachers. It will be terrific for students because they will get the opportunity to learn and cooperate with each other and to access resources from around Australia and, indeed, from around the world. For example, students in regional and remote Australia can use the NBN to get access to specialist teachers that they might not otherwise be able to access - music teachers, vocational education teachers and language teachers. They will also have the opportunity to get immediate feedback from those teachers with live, interactive videoconferencing. This kind of learning is just not possible without the type of high-speed access that the National Broadband Network will provide. Imagine a class in Alice Springs being able to interact in real time with a class in Hobart - broadening their horizons and learning from one another. Students will also be able to link up with other resources, such as from the collection of the Australian War Memorial or NASA. All of these possibilities will deepen the learning experiences that students will have and will be available to students no matter where they live.Faster, more reliable broadband will also naturally be of great benefit to our teachers, supporting this government's agenda of improving teacher quality, by enabling them to understand the professional issues that are in front of them and to get the additional learning that they need through virtual workshops and virtual seminars. Sharing the best in teacher resources will greatly help our teachers as well.Access to a computer is critical with the National Broadband Network. That is why the government is investing over $2 billion over seven years to achieve a one-to-one computer to student ratio for years 9 to 12 by the end of 2011, with a delivery, importantly, of over 345,000 computers to secondary schools and approved funding for over 740,000 computers. Computers are changing the way that kids learn. Imagine how much more impact this will have once students are hooked up to the NBN. As well, we will make sure that Australia's first-ever national curriculum is fully online. Again, teachers will have the opportunity to use the NBN to access all kinds of teaching resources to support them in teaching the national curriculum.Finally, we are investing some $40 million in a digital strategy for teachers and for school leaders. This is providing teachers with the ICT skills that they will need so that they can better set up learning in their classrooms. Incidentally, for country teachers and principals, in particular, the NBN will be of huge benefit. That is something I know members of this House agree with and understand. The fact is that, with a computer in the classroom and the NBN at the front door, schools will be well prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century and we will give every school the opportunity through this resourcing to be a great school.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Of course all Australians will have access to the National Broadband Network business plan, save for those parts that are truly commercial in confidence.The member for Canning then left the chamber. - I say to the member that he will have access to the National Broadband Network business plan to inform a national debate. But I believe that debate should be based on facts. I believe that debate should be based on goodwill. I believe that that debate should be conducted with the national interest rather than an individual's political party's political interest paramount.The member who asked the question comes to this parliament with some expertise in telecommunications. On the National Broadband Network, and some of his earlier writings, I would simply pose to him the following questions. Does he believe that the structural separation of Telstra is in the national interest? Of course it is. Does he believe that Australians having access to superfast national broadband is in the national interest? Of course it is. Has he absorbed all of the information already in the public domain about the National Broadband Network? The image he tries to paint that somehow there is not information in the public domain is entirely untrue. There have been detailed assessments undertaken by expert panels. We published the implementation study from McKinsey and KPMG - over 500 pages of analysis. We will publish the NBN business case. There is a live trial underway in Tasmania. There is a great deal of information to inform this national debate. And yet, with that great deal of information informing the national debate, and with more to come, what the opposition are really saying, when you strip it all down, is, 'It does not matter what the information is, it does not matter what the facts are, it does not matter what the benefits are, we will demolish the NBN - full stop.' - I was actually asked about informed national debates. Let me conclude by saying this: informed national debates need people interested in the facts; that is, people who have not locked in to negativity, wrecking, bitterness and putting political interest before the national interest. It requires people who are prepared to absorb the facts and think about the nation's future. Unfortunately, the opposition - bitter, negative and determined to wreck - has locked in behind the slogan 'demolish the NBN' so the facts are entirely irrelevant to members of the opposition.</DOC>

 - The National Broadband Network Co. has been working through it with members of parliament who are interested in the facts, briefing them on the facts. Given that there is commercial sensitivity about information that is in the National Broadband Network business case, it stands to very simple common-sense reasoning that some of this information is market sensitive. So the National Broadband Network Co. has been working with members of this parliament who are prepared to judge on the basis of the facts on the possibility of getting them briefings.Of course, facts that the member who asked the question may be interested in have also been put into the public domain. In that regard I refer to a letter of 19 November signed by Mike Quigley, an expert in telecommunications, who is the CEO of the National Broadband Network Co. If the member asking the question is in any way interested in the facts, then she may be interested to know that the National Broadband Network Co., in its business case, will verify that the NBN can be built in a way which provides an internal rate of return higher than the current long-term government bond rate. What that means, of course, is that on its own, looking at the return of the NBN, it is a viable project. That is before you get to all of the economic benefits and all of the service delivery benefits. That means that in terms of the use of taxpayers' money there will be a greater return than the long-term bond rate. That is, it is a better use of taxpayers' money than investments that secure the long-term bond rate. So: viable - tick. The peak equity requirement of the project approximates that in the implementation study - and of course the implementation study is there in the public domain should the member want to read it.The National Broadband Network Co. has verified that the total capital requirements are substantially below that predicted by the implementation study. That is good news. Of course, NBN Co. has verified that they have assumed a uniform national wholesale price. That is good news for responsible members of the parliament who represent regional constituencies and care about their access to voice services and internet services on the same basis wholesale-wise as the rest of the nation. And, NBN Co. has verified that the business plan projects that prices will be reduced over time. So to the member who asked the question, I would say to her that if she is truly interested she should have a look at the wealth of information in the public domain, absorb the facts from NBN Co. about what is in the national business model for NBN Co. and actually draw some conclusions based on those facts. But unfortunately I fear that the member who asked the question will not do any of that because she will follow the leader of the opposition down the road of wrecking, down the road of privileging his political interest over the national interest and down the road of being driven by the three-word slogan of 'demolish the NBN'. Well, we will get on with the job, the patient work required to deliver this transforming infrastructure project for the nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for this question because he has had a keen interest in e-health initiatives for GP partners in his electorate and in northern Brisbane, one of the lead sites trying to make sure that they are well positioned and GPs are well positioned to take advantage of not just health reform but also the powers of the NBN.I notice up in the gallery some of our GP friends from Geelong. Similarly, they are hoping to be able to be well positioned to make the most of the government's investment in health reform but also to unleash the potential of the Broadband Network. Of course, our aim in combining these two important priorities for the government is that we do improve the access to health services in regional areas, that we reduce medical errors, and that we are able to train more doctors and nurses. The combined investments in the Broadband Network and health reform can have real results. In particular, regional patients will be able to get better access to specialists, particularly as the tele-health items come online for the Medicare Benefits Schedule on 1 July. Families will be able to see and talk to a GP at 3 am if that is the time when their child is sick in the middle of the night. In the future we will be able to use the technology and the changes to our health system to allow this. If you are from Perth and your doctor is in Perth but you have an MRI scan when you are on holiday in Cairns, you will be able to ask for that scan to be sent to your doctor in Perth so that you can follow up with the proper treatment into the future.The new medical school opening in Darwin next year will enable Flinders University to train new students online, using the Broadband Network to get proper access. These sorts of investments are vital. I know he has already been mentioned but I suspect that Minister Grylls, a minister interested in regional development, will also be looking at the potential of the Broadband Network to deliver health services to a bigger part of our community in regional areas. In fact, pretty much everyone in this House, except those opposite, believes there is benefit to be had from linking health reforms with the National Broadband Network so that we can improve services provided to communities across the country. We are at a point in time when we have a choice as to whether we unleash the potential of technology to improve health services or whether we want to stand in the way of any change. On this side of the House we want to use the potential; unfortunately, on the other side of the House they simply want to stand in the way and block both of them.</DOC>

 - Obviously, the government is working through its internal processes, including cabinet processes, about this matter. I am not intending to comment on them publicly. - If that means the opposition is going to scream and shout like a pack of schoolchildren, I will allow them to do that because any member of the opposition who has served as a cabinet minister understands what cabinet-in-confidence means. If they are so dismissive of cabinet-in-confidence, I would welcome the Leader of the Opposition saying, for example, 'We could release every cabinet-in-confidence document of the Howard government.' What a tale we would see about things like Work Choices. The shadow minister asked me about confidentiality. I assume he is genuinely interested, that this was not just an excuse to scream and shout and act like a child. Let me take him through it. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am being directly relevant to that section of the question which goes to the release of the NBN Co. business case. I will directly answer that question by explaining the process of release and the confidential matters that are within it. The government will release the business plan in December after the government has considered a key ACCC recommendation on how many retail companies will be able to plug into the network. Of course, we need to work through this decision which is the subject of an NBN Co. and ACCC public consultation process, which does not conclude until 30 November. The points that interconnect that decision, which that process relates to, will be made after the ACCC has delivered its advice to government on 1 December. - The Leader of the Opposition is asking: how is this about the business plan? Of course, this decision relates to the business plan. The points of interconnection decision will mainly impact on backhaul providers, on how and where they connect into the NBN, how the infrastructure they have already built will be affected and how deep into the network companies will be able to build their own infrastructure. Consequently, that is market-sensitive information. The member asked me: why do you not simply release the NBN Co. business plan? Because there are market-sensitive sections of it. I have just spelt out a section of market sensitivity.We can tell from the reaction of those opposite on the opposition front bench that to them this is all just a game. Actually, they have no interest at all in receiving the business case. We will put it out. They will never really read it. They will go through it and look for one word they can put in a press release in order to justify their argument and demolish the NBN. - We thank the member for Wentworth for being so forthright in earlier interviews. It does not matter what the facts are, it does not matter what anybody finds, it does not matter how positive the National Broadband Network is; the Leader of the Opposition will always be opposed to it because he is pursuing a political game and not the national interest. You could not have a clearer display than you can see today in the kind of cheap political game this opposition is obsessed by.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question because I know that she campaigned strenuously on this issue before she won the seat. The development of the National Broadband Network is critical for the regions. We have heard in this parliament before how it will lift the national productivity. In no place is this more apparent than in the case of the regions because it will give them greater economic diversity and obviously the ability to obtain better services. The transformative nature of this is enormous. This is not just about improved text, voice and video in the download sense. This is also about the capacity to upload material, in particular important data which is crucial to future applications. We have heard in this parliament already from the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth what it can do for e-education. That can only be the case if the opportunity is there to make those applications. With the Minister for Health and Ageing in e-health, and with commerce the ability to obtain and access the global supply chains, the opportunities for e-commerce in regional Australia are enormous. In my other portfolio, the opportunity for e-arts and e-creative industries is also enormous.I had the opportunity in the fortnight that the parliament was up to visit a number of regions. I went with the member for Lyne to Port Macquarie and it was very interesting there when we had discussions with Country Energy about the opportunities that they were looking for with smart grids so that they could get energy efficiency into homes connected to the national grid. I also had the opportunity to visit some five of the evocities that are involved in a program that we are supporting. There it was apparent that not only do these cities have in common their involvement through evocities but also that Charles Sturt University has a campus in every one of those cities. They are looking in the space of e-education and e-health and creatively combining those. The opportunity to do that effectively will not exist if this National Broadband Network does not proceed.The truth is that, in all of the visits that I have had and in those of my colleagues, people out there get it. They understand why it is important to get this infrastructure down. The question that we have to ask ourselves - and I have been asked in the question, 'What are the threats to this?' - is: we just do not get why the other side do not get it. Here they are talking about the emphasis being still on wireless services - sufficient being sufficient for regional communities. That is nonsense. Go and talk to them and they will explain to you why it is not sufficient.Those on the other side have also opposed the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill, which is integral to the structural separation. It is a recipe for higher prices. This is the policy view of the opposition and its spokesman. But when it comes to the spokesman's investment he is the Jerry Maguire of the opposition. We know where he has put the money that he has been shown and it is in backing the NBN. We just want him to put his mouth where his money is and get behind the backing of this proposal. - </DOC>

 - I say hello to the Woodside Community Action Group members in the gallery. -  - I presume they would actually like to hear my answer to the question, rather than having members of the opposition scream over my answer -  - I am sorry that members of the Woodside Community Action Group had to witness that conduct and how much it exhibits that what the opposition is interested in is playing question time games about this rather than addressing community concerns. We as a government, in contrast, are very interested in working through, with the Woodside community, the issues that concern them. In that regard, they have met today with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. The immigration minister, with the local member, will travel to a community based meeting on Wednesday night to talk through questions relating to the government's decision and measures that can be put in place to work with the local community. The meeting will discuss questions such as employment in the detention centre and services that can also be of benefit to the community.I also say to the member who asked the question: he well knows that the statements I made in the election campaign and earlier, and the statements I have made since, about a regional protection framework and regional processing centre are statements in which I have been very frank and very honest with the Australian community. On each and every occasion, I have said to the Australian community that we will need to work through those issues in dialogue with countries in our region. That dialogue is underway now.The ultimate aim of that approach is to take out of the hands of people smugglers the very product that they sell. That is in sharp contrast to an opposition that campaigned on 'stop the boats' but is now putting out a welcome mat to 3,750 asylum seekers under its new policy as announced by its shadow minister. - I was seeking to correct factual errors in the question. We have a clear process to work through with the community, with the representatives in the gallery today, and we will continue with that clear process.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I note that he has taken a great interest both in the business of the National Broadband Network and, importantly, the interests of his constituents. The National Broadband Network is a great way of delivering internet services. It will allow Australians, particularly those living in rural, regional and outer metropolitan areas, to engage with government services faster and more reliably and in the way they want to - via the internet.I will just go through some statistics on the way Australians are currently accessing government services via the internet. These statistics come from AGIMO and are current as at last year. Access to government services via the internet has doubled since 2004. It is currently the channel most used by Australians to contact the government. In 2009, 38 per cent of Australians used the internet for their last contact with the government. In comparison, 32 per cent of contacts were in person and 30 per cent by telephone. Only nine per cent of Australians contact the Australian government via old-fashioned traditional mail.Just under 31 per cent of Australians used the internet for all or most of their contacts with the Australian government in 2009. Use of the internet to contact government has doubled from 19 per cent in 2004-05 to 38 per cent in 2009. Overall, people strongly prefer the internet and telephone to all other channels because the internet and telephone take less time and can be used at a time that suits the user. This is important: Australians want to access government services via the internet because it takes less time and can be done with ease at work or at home and at a time that suits the user. Australians are now using the internet to find out about services from government and to seek information from government more than they are using any other option available to them.Broadband black spots plagued the country through most of the past decade as a consequence of the former government's underinvestment, lack of knowledge of the potential, lack of knowledge of how to fix these problems, and lack of care and consideration for service delivery to our regional centres and outer metropolitan areas. This characterised a government that not only just did not get it but just did not care.What we now see, as governments increasingly provide information to people via internet broadband services, is that people want to take up those options. People increasingly want to take up those options in order to better inform themselves and in order to seek better personal service from the government. This is a more efficient and effective way for people to find out about their entitlements and about government services. Most importantly, it is a very important way for government to understand what services we need to provide to better serve the interests of all Australians. As the National Broadband Network is invested in around the country and develops the capacity for people in regional and rural centres to better obtain information about government services, I think all of us in this place would do well to understand its principal mission in serving the interests of regional Australians and the value of this investment to our community.</DOC>

 - I am wondering why I did not get that question from Joe-come-lately, Mr Speaker. - The shadow Treasurer has had a lot to say about this, and I welcome the opportunity to correct the record. This government has a proud record of reform in the banking system and most particularly a proud record of reform in making that system more competitive. Those opposite do have a very selective memory. We put in place the financial claims scheme, and those opposite had not had the wit to do that over 12 long years. A financial claims scheme, now the deposits guarantee, was the very foundation of our surviving the global recession. Of course that was of greatest benefit to people who were involved with smaller financial institutions, the smaller banks and the credit unions. - On six occasions over 12 years those opposite were advised to introduce a financial claims scheme by our regulators and they refused. Why did they do that? Because the big banks would not let them do it. It fell to our government to put a financial claims scheme in place to protect the Australian banking system and the deposits of 16 million people. We did that. We have put in place a raft of competition reforms, and most importantly we have put in place the investment in residential mortgage-backed securities that has been absolutely essential for those smaller lenders who have been so badly affected by the global financial crisis. And we have taken action on unfair mortgage exit fees. This is the background, and now we get to the here and now.Those opposite pretend to be interested in the banks because they see a political opportunity. They took to the last election not one policy on banking - not one. That is how interested they were then. And they were not talking about price signalling. The shadow Treasurer went to the Press Club in May and talked about reform of the Trade Practices Act, and he did not mention price signalling. The first we heard about price signalling was that they had read about it in the paper because the government had been talking to the ACCC about it. So they came up with a thought bubble, pretending they had a plan for competition in the banking system. Of course that had its conclusion in the House today when they presented a bill on price signalling, but it is a bill which will create great uncertainty. They have not been working with the regulators to get it right. - Yes, I have looked at it and there is a real problem with it. It demonstrates what happens when those opposite have a thought bubble and decide they want to play with the Australian banking system. Nothing could be more precious, nothing could be more valuable, than stability in the Australian financial system. - But those opposite came into the House today with a bill that has not been thoroughly tested, has not been run by our regulators and simply will create uncertainty. - For our part, we will behave in a professional manner. We will work methodically with our regulators, as we should do and as we have done for three years, to enhance competition in the Australian banking system and to protect the deposits of Australians who have their money in the bank.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Reid for his question. Quite recently I was privileged to be involved in a demonstration of how important and how productive the NBN can be for the long-distance diagnosis of health issues. I was at the Royal Darwin Hospital and we had a demonstration of the internal examination of an ear from a distance. We saw how, with the NBN and the quality of the network and the amount of information we can put across the broadband system, we can improve dramatically the way in which ailments can be diagnosed at long distance, throwing digital information along a highway which currently does not exist in many remote communities. -  - The important thing to understand is that, as the Leader of the Opposition ought to know, many people in remote Australia will not get access to the sorts of services that we can provide with the NBN through any proposal they are putting forward. - The people of the bush understand absolutely the importance of having the NBN in place to assist not only with health but also with education and other services. In the context of delivering improved health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, especially those who live in remote communities, the NBN will be of great importance and do a great deal of work for us. The important thing to understand is that it will not happen if the opposition get their way and wreck the NBN proposal.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. He refers to the minerals resource rent tax. The government is determined to deliver this tax because the Australian economy is in a phase of development where we are seeing huge growth in our resources sector, mining and profiting from assets that, by definition, can be exploited only once. While we are in that stage of this country's development, it makes absolute sense for Australians to share in the wealth that is generated and for our taxation and national savings settings to be ones that benefit the rest of the economy and help balance growth for the long term. That is why the proceeds of the minerals resource rent tax will be used to cut company taxation generally, to particularly lift the tax burdens off small businesses, to grow our pool of national savings through superannuation, to provide a better retirement income for Australians in their old age and to have a better pool of national savings for our economy to draw on and, of course, to invest in infrastructure. - The member for Sturt is helpfully chanting about higher taxes being the Labor way. Perhaps he should get out a book of economic statistics and remind himself that he was a member of the highest taxing, highest spending government in Australia's history. When he feels ready to come to the dispatch box and apologise for that, we will be all ears. When we had the highest taxing, highest spending government in the nation's history, what we were doing was drifting through a phase of Australia's economic expansion, putting the proceeds of that economic expansion into recurrent expenditure, instead of doing the things that were necessary to drive long-term prosperity. We are determined not to make that mistake again, which is why with the minerals resource rent tax we will have a taxation system that enables Australians to better share in the proceeds that come from the mineral wealth in our ground and better balance economic activity.On the question of electricity prices, I say again to the Leader of the Opposition: he may be content to just sit with his fear campaigns and he may be content to see the next decade being another decade of underinvestment in electricity with all of the consequences for price and undersupply that would have for Australians, but the government is not content to see Australians face that burden. That is why we are dealing with questions of energy security and energy supply in the context of pricing carbon and beyond.Can I say to the member who asked the question: we know that he is long on complaint and short on solution. We are still waiting for him to deliver a policy that counts; and, yet again, here we are as the parliament works its way through the final week and the three-word slogans, the fear campaigns, the negativity and the wrecking continue day after day, after day.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Page for that very important question, because events in recent days in Ireland do tell us that the world is still living with the impacts of the global financial crisis. After a period of calm, what we do see is renewed volatility in Europe. This is driven by concerns about the Irish banking sector, which continues to feel the impacts of the global financial crisis. The Irish government is dealing with this. It has now asked for assistance from the European Union, and there is a formal process of negotiation going on. Australia does welcome these assistance efforts from the European Union and it does welcome the determination of the Irish government to deal with these questions, because these events absolutely underscore how patchy the global economic recovery is and they particularly underscore how different the position is in this country compared to so many other developed economies around the world.The position here could not have been more different. One of the reasons it is more different in Australia is that the Australian government took decisive action, which was opposed by those across the aisle. If they would have had their way, Australia would have been in recession. But the Labor government got the big economic call right for this country - absolutely right. This has been confirmed by the OECD in their report of last week. I know those opposite do not like to hear it because it underscores the fact that, they are so weak when it comes to the economy, they have no alternative and that, if they would have had their way, Australia would have been in recession. This is what the OECD had to say: 'The stimulus package was among the most effective in the OECD.' -  - They think this is funny because they do not understand the scale of the challenge that Australia faced in the past two years and they do not understand the future. Job recovery and job creation in this economy has been strong - unemployment at 5.4 per cent compared to 13.6 per cent in Ireland. The 650,000 jobs created in Australia in the past year demonstrate the strength of the Australian economy. There is also the fact that we are bringing our budget back to surplus in three years. The Australian economy is performing strongly, and it is performing strongly because of the strong economic management of the Gillard Labor government. It is the strong economic management of this government. We are in a stronger position than just about any other developed economy in the world. That is not accepted by those opposite, but we cannot be complacent about the future. We know this economy requires sound economic management to bring the budget back to surplus, unlike those opposite who had an $11 billion hole in their net savings in the campaign. We are committed to strong economic management.

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question, though it always seems to me a little odd that the shadow Treasurer would evidence any interest in the cost of living, given he was the principal spokesperson for slashing wages under Work Choices under the Howard government. I well remember the days when he would walk into this parliament and defend rip-off after rip-off after rip-off as hardworking Australians had their penalty rates ripped off them -  - their overtime rates ripped off them and their hours of work changed. He did not care one bit then what it meant for them in meeting their family's cost of living, what it meant for them in paying their mortgage or rent, what it meant for them in keeping food on the table for their children. So, honestly, I do find it somewhat strange that the shadow Treasurer - having made the journey from the frontbench of the Howard government to being the shadow Treasurer of the opposition - has somehow found out that there are cost-of-living pressures for Australian working families.What is the record of the government and what are our future plans on the cost of living? We abolished Work Choices. That was very important for people's pay packets and people's ability to meet their cost-of-living challenges. Then we provided tax cuts three years in a row. So someone on $50,000 a year is paying $1,750 less tax than they were in 2007-08. That is 18 per cent less tax. Then, of course, because of the hard work particularly of the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, we provided a historically large increase in the pension, understanding that people on fixed incomes are often those that bear the principal brunt of the cost of living. We increased the pension by around $115 a fortnight for single pensioners and around $97 a fortnight for pensioner couples.Then we created the education tax refund. Across the long years of the Howard government, no-one ever turned their mind to how to assist families with the costs of getting kids to school. We created the education tax refund to do that, and we will extend it to school uniforms. Then we increased support for child care. When we came to office, the Howard government was providing a rebate of 30 per cent. We lifted it to 50 per cent.We have also provided the Teen Dental Plan, because we know dental bills do press on people. More than 200,000 teenagers have received more than one dental check under the scheme and almost a million have received preventative dental checks in total. But we want to do more and we will. We will increase the family tax rebate for parents of teenage children because we understand teenagers do not reduce costs for families - if anything they increase costs. We are moving to pay the childcare rebate fortnightly. We are providing paid parental leave - something not thought of across the long years of the Howard government other than to be opposed. We understand that Australian families do face cost-of-living pressures. That is why we are providing these measures of relief. I wait to hear just one idea from the opposition - just one idea. They are long on complaints, short on solutions, know everything they are opposed to. They have no ideas for change - not one policy that they can come into this place and put forward as their own.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I know that he is concerned about cost-of-living pressures, about jobs, about the economic circumstances of working families and he understands that his constituents need a strong economy whereby they can have a job so that they can prosper. Yesterday in this House I explained the work that had happened in Afghanistan whilst I was at the Lisbon summit. But being at the Lisbon summit also provided me with an opportunity to talk to a number of world leaders including leaders of European countries - and that builds on the opportunities I had at G20 and APEC particularly. When I had those discussions, let me assure you, one of the first things that were said in those discussions was: how has the Australian economy come through the GFC, the global financial crisis, in such strong shape? How is it that you have created 650,000 jobs in circumstances where around the world the world has gone into recession and many economies are struggling with high unemployment rates that look like they will persist, recession and large amounts of budget debt and deficit which will lead to budget cutbacks, putting burdens on the same families who are struggling with unemployment? And they look at the Australian economy and they want to know how we have done it.We did it because as a nation we worked together. Employers played their part, unions played their part and the government played their part by their quick and decisive action to keep our economy growing and particularly to ensure that people had the benefits and the dignity of work. During the global financial crisis we acted to keep people in work, we acted to keep apprenticeships being created, we acted to help those who were made redundant get the best-quality employment services to maximise their ability to get another opportunity. We acted to support families with household assistance, we acted to keep credit flowing so businesses could have the opportunity to keep their businesses going and to have that credit. We acted to protect customers of banks and guarantee their deposits. But all of that work now means that, whilst our economy is coming out of the global financial crisis strong, we cannot sit on our laurels; we need to build the next waves of reform. Not for us the lazy ideas-free path of those opposite, not for us the lazy indulgence of the Howard years whereby the economy grew and the money generated was not invested in long-term growth. We will be investing in long-term growth - in skills, in productivity, in participation, in infrastructure. We have a reform agenda for our taxation system. We need to make sure that these reforms are delivered so that prosperity is sustained for the long term. It takes ideas, it takes policy innovation, it takes method, it takes patience and I would recommend to those opposite trying to exhibit some of those traits in their desperate and relentless search for at least one policy idea. We have not seen any of them yet.</DOC>

 - I think it is because they both start with 'b'. I think that was the connection that was on the shadow minister's mind. I say to the shadow minister who has asked the question that, of course, the government does not comment on intelligence matters. But I would say to the opposition the following: they are making big assumptions on one sentence in one document. That is a very big call indeed. I would advise the shadow minister that the document released under FOI and referred to in today's media was not a detailed analysis on people smuggling, or its causes or Nauru; it was about detention operations on Christmas Island. So now let's look at the question of Nauru, and I can say to the shadow minister the advice to government in December 2007 was that people smugglers remained very active throughout the region, more displaced Iraqis and Sri Lankan nationals were seeking the services of people smugglers to come to Australia, illegal movements of asylum seekers were being caused by conflicts in Sri Lanka and in the Middle East, and that there is always chatter amongst people smugglers about a range of factors and of course they do deliberately misrepresent the policies of Australian governments - and that is not just our government - in order to induce customers for their evil trade.What I would also say to the shadow minister about Nauru - and I had the opportunity to travel to Nauru when it was in operation as a detention centre - is that what it should have had at the entry to the detention centre was a very big sign saying 'Camp Detour'. That is what should have been up at the front of the detention centre because the truth is that 96 per cent of the people processed on Nauru and resettled came to Australia or New Zealand - overwhelmingly to Australia. So despite lots of talking tough by the Howard government about the people on the Tampa and the people afterwards, the reality is that offshore processing being done as a one-off by the Howard government meant people were processed and then overwhelmingly came to Australia. We are working on a regional protection framework and regional processing centre which will involve more nations than Australia looking to deal with people who are found to be genuine refugees so that offshore processing is not the simple detour that the shadow minister desires.I would also say that the shadow minister should be very honest with the Australian people. He has moved his slogan from 'stop the boats' to 'lay out the welcome mat for more than 3,000' with his new statements about the number of asylum seekers the opposition looks forward to welcoming should its policies ever be policies of a government, that is, should the opposition ever be elected. The shadow minister should be honest about that. He should also be honest about the nature of the document in his hand.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. It gives me the opportunity to clear up some misapprehensions which I believe have been created in recent newspaper reports. There have been newspaper reports on this matter which are simply wrong. The government entered into an arrangement with the Australian Services Union before the last election on pay equity for workers in the social and community services sector. We were able to enter into that agreement because we had introduced the Fair Work Act to get rid of Work Choices. When we introduced the Fair Work Act to get rid of the Work Choices of the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer - which did so much damage to the pay packets of working families, particularly working women - we deliberately chose to make sure that the equal pay principle in the Fair Work Act was a broader principle than had ever been in federal legislation before. That is, it did not simply provide equal pay for equal work but it provided equal pay for work of equal value.It is the existence of that broader principle that has enabled the Australian Services Union to bring the pay equity case which is now before Fair Work Australia. And the government has been very clear. Under our agreement and in the submission that we filed with Fair Work Australia, we support pay equity and we support this case. What we have also done, entirely in accordance with our understandings with the Australian Services Union, is provide Fair Work Australia, the industrial umpire, with the full range of facts. Our heads of agreement and our discussions with the Australian Services Union before the election were certainly about the need for pay equity but they were also about the need for properly and appropriately dealing with the increased costs that governments and the not-for-profit sector would end up sustaining if this case was concluded in favour of the union's application. In recognition of that, the union agreed that there would be a five-year phase-in period for pay changes flowing from the pay equity case, if that is what Fair Work Australia awarded.So in providing Fair Work Australia with details of the amount of money that this could cost, we are acting in accordance with our agreement, that is, providing information to Fair Work Australia that it needs to have and information that the union in its discussions with us recognised was important. They too were obviously concerned about the cost burden that could potentially flow from the case and that is why the agreement specifically deals with a five-year phase-in period. So there should be no misapprehension about this matter. I support and the government supports pay equity. I always have; I always will. My conduct and the government's conduct in this matter is entirely consistent with that deeply held belief that I have had all of my adult life, and our conduct in this matter is entirely consistent with the heads of agreement that we entered into with the Australian Services Union.</DOC>

 - The honourable member's question goes to the significance of the Japanese economy to Australia's future economic wellbeing. From Australia's point of view, with Japan all the figures are big figures. This is our second-largest trading relationship and our second-largest export market. It delivers to Australia the largest merchandise trade export of any country. Japan is also our third-largest source of foreign direct investment, an accumulated stock of something like $102 billion. There are some 10,000 Japanese students in Australia. There are 650 sister school relationships. And Australia hosts 355,000 Japanese tourists each year. These are big figures for Australia's economic future.We welcome Japan's recent expression of interest in joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership. We also look forward to being able to develop with Japan a comprehensive bilateral free trade agreement in the future to further underpin economic growth. That is why the government has today welcomed the visit to Australia by the Japanese Foreign Minister. The Minister for Trade, Craig Emerson, spent the better part of the morning with Minister Maehara on the details of our FTA negotiations. The minister advises me that these were very good and substantive negotiations. From Australia's point of view, their successful conclusion is important. The minister will also be calling on the Prime Minister later in the day and I will be continuing my own discussions with him as well.When it comes to the future of the Japanese economy, we have a big interest in the economy of Japan continuing a program of fundamental economic reform. The current government of Japan, of which Minister Maehara is a leading member, has in recent days adopted new and significant reforms to underpin long-term productivity growth in Japan, including a new basic policy on agricultural reform and a new basic FTA policy as well. These are unprecedented and we believe that they point in a very positive direction in terms of this country's interests in Japan.Beyond the economic, investment and trade relationship, our partnership with Japan also enters into the political and security space. Australia and Japan share a strong commitment to nuclear nonproliferation, arms control and disarmament. Minister Maehara and I have recently formed a cross-regional grouping within the United Nations committed to implementing the recommendations of the nuclear nonproliferation review conference convened earlier this year. Furthermore, this work builds on excellent work done by two former Japanese and Australian foreign ministers, including foreign minister Evans, in the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament, which concluded its work at the end of last year. This represents the best available global blueprint on the future of the arms control, disarmament and nonproliferation agendas.Minister Maehara and I have also discussed the recent troubling developments on the Korean Peninsula. Australia and Japan share a profound concern about the new evidence concerning North Korea's uranium enrichment program. Australia and Japan are continuing to work closely with the United States and the ROK to develop appropriate responses to these latest revelations. Australia and Japan enjoy a close and cooperative relationship. From the point of view of Australia's long-term security and economic wellbeing and interests, this is a first-class relationship of deep significance.</DOC>

The answer that I am going to give him is not going to be different to any of my earlier answers on the question. I have acknowledged in this place - indeed, I believe that I acknowledged it on the very first day that I was Prime Minister - that the Home Insulation Program had become a mess and that the government needed to act to address the consequences of that program. And we have.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for his question. As a regional member, he understands how important national broadband will be for driving productivity in regional Australia. The NBN will turbocharge productivity. It will create some 25,000 jobs a year on average. Innovation from ICT is the single biggest driver of business productivity. And the NBN is already being rolled out on time and on budget. Services in Tasmania are being rolled out. More than 60 per cent of the regional fibre-optic infrastructure has been built, spanning more than 3,000 kilometres across the continent.Today I announced that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications will conduct a wide-ranging inquiry on the social and economic benefits of the National Broadband Network. That is as it should be. It will be chaired by Sharon Bird, the member for Cunningham, and ably deputy chaired by the member for Hinkler. This is a committee that has a proud record in this parliament and the previous parliament through its shipping policy inquiry and other inquiries and of working in a bipartisan way to get good outcomes in the national interest. I am sure that will occur in this case as well. It will complement the smart infrastructure inquiry that began in the last parliament. A forum was held here at Parliament House. That forum was addressed by people such as Glen Boreham from IBM. That forum talked about the great benefit of information technology and the revolution that is occurring for business productivity and economic growth. This inquiry will be able to meet in Canberra but will also get out there and research the benefits.But there have been previous inquiries by parliamentary committees of course. My attention has been drawn to the November 2002 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts. It is not surprising there were reports, because those opposite had, of course, 18 separate policies. One of the inputs to those policies, no doubt, was this report of November 2002. In the executive summary, it says:No wireless broadband technology is able to handle the data rates of the best wire-line technologies.Game, set and match. Eight years ago, they knew what the future was; eight years ago, they knew what should be done. I looked at who the chair of the committee was and it was that perennial backbencher of the Howard government, the member for Sturt. The member for Sturt, Christopher Pyne, was the chair of this inquiry - that perennial backbencher sitting up there. They would not let him sit at the front, but they let him chair these inquiries which fed into the 18 failed policies we saw from those opposite.Those of us on this side of the House are going to deliver world's best practice, 21st-century technology, just like - I am reminded by the foreign minister's last answer - in Japan. Japan is going to roll out high-speed broadband to every home by March next year. We need to keep up to the mark and not accept second best, and that is exactly what this government's NBN plan is doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. I do hope the opposition, at some point, comes to the realisation that just because you come in into question time and make things up, that does not make them true. I refer the shadow minister to the various reports and inquiries into the Building the Education Revolution program, many of which he called for. These include the Auditor-General's report and the work done by Brad Orgill. The contentions and assertions in the shadow minister's question are simply inaccurate.The best way of actually assessing what the opposition thinks about the Building the Education program is to watch the conduct of local members. You would not want to risk your life and limb by getting between an opposition member and a BER school opening. You would not want to risk your life and limb, particularly when there are scissors and a ribbon involved. It is just too dangerous to try to get between them and their desperate desire to be as closely associated with the program as is humanly possible.It seems a little bit remarkable to me that the member for Goldstein would be shouting out about this matter. I remember many colour shots of him in the safety vest and the hard hat inspecting Building the Education Revolution projects in his electorate. He could not have got closer to them if he tried. - He was trying to give his electorate the impression he was constructing them himself; that is how keen he was to be associated with this program. So I say to the shadow minister -  - In conclusion, I say to the shadow minister who asked this question and who has made up the contentions in the question: perhaps he should talk to some of the members on his backbench who have been, and want to be, associated with Building the Education Revolution projects in their electorate. Perhaps on this matter it would be better to judge the opposition not by its puffed up confections in this parliament but by the actual conduct of its members in their electorates.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for that very important question, because it is indeed important to support smaller lenders for competition in the banking sector. In the decade and a half before the global financial crisis, the residential mortgage-backed securities market was a key driver of competition in the banking system and a key driver of cheaper rates in the banking system. But, when the global financial crisis hit, it destroyed investor appetite for residential mortgage-backed securities and it destroyed an important source of funding for our smaller lenders. This was despite the fact that RMBS in Australia were quite safe; they were a good investment. But the market was simply destroyed.It therefore became very important for the government to take action to support the smaller lenders and, particularly, to give them a hand to make sure that they were still competitive in the face of this destruction and carnage going on in global financial markets. That is why the government, first in October 2008 and again in November 2009, made two very substantial investments - up to $16 billion - in residential mortgage-backed securities. The government did this so we could get a source of cheaper funding to these lenders to keep the superstructure of the industry alive. It was very important.Not one single dollar of this investment of $16 billion went to the major banks. Every cent was invested in our regional banks, in our credit unions, in our building societies and in our wholesale funders - small lenders like the Bank of Queensland, Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Suncorp, ING, Liberty Financial and the Australian Central Credit Union. Of course, this has been acknowledged by a number of the smaller lenders. Just take Mr Dunn from AMP. This is what he has had to say:_ there is little doubt that without the government's support of the RMBS program AMP would not have been able to continue to offer competitive mortgage and deposit products.And so improve the level of competition in banking. Or we could go to another smaller wholesale lender like Liberty. They said:The RMBS purchase program _ played a key role in stabilising _ securitisation markets. As a result, Liberty Financial has been able to provide much needed competition in the bank-dominated mortgage market _It has not just been about the mortgage market. It has also been about funding for small business. This is what RESIMAC has had to say about this program:It has been vital to committing a continual flow of finance to the small business community.They go on to say:Without such support there would be literally thousands of Australian small business owners who would have been deprived of access to finance.So this government has acted and it has acted to strengthen competition, particularly in these vital sectors. These actions stand in stark contrast to the shallow populism of those opposite. We are interested in the long term. We are passionate about our commitment to a strong and prosperous economy and a strong and competitive banking system to go with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Unfortunately, the assertions in the question are wrong. Education ministers, including the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, are working through the national curriculum. We have determined to deliver the national curriculum -  - and the shadow Treasurer is bellowing. Of course, he never knew anything about this matter or the time frames for delivery, so I suggest he actually checks some of those time frames. I suggest to him, too, that he reflect on his 12 years of failure, being a member of a government that never did anything profound in school reform but was content to see disadvantaged kids in disadvantaged schools get a subquality education. They could not even be bothered getting a list of the most disadvantaged schools.To the member who has asked the question, the national curriculum is a policy which we are delivering, working with state education ministers. Inevitably, when you are engaged in a national reform of this nature individual states engage in a bit of pushback. States say that their system is the best. We have seen that played out in Australian politics before. I suspect we will see it played out to the end of time, and what that means is that you need fortitude, determination and patient work to deliver these reforms. That is exactly what the government has done and the minister for school education continues to do. We are determined to deliver the national curriculum because we want every child in every school to study a great quality curriculum and we particularly want to make a difference for those around 80,000 children who change school systems each year in the sense that they move interstate. It is hard enough to move interstate, hard enough to get used to a new school without walking into a classroom and not even recognising the curriculum.There are great efficiency benefits, too, as we move to a national curriculum. I have remarked before that we probably have more curriculum agencies and curriculum writers per head of population than any other nation on earth. It obviously makes sense to have a national curriculum, which means then that tools to teach the national curriculum and professional development programs can be shared. I also say to the member who asked the question that I am always in the market for listening to good ideas about education. If the opposition ever has one, feel free to give me a call, but I can confidently say that from 2007 to 2010 we did not see one from the opposition, and we certainly have not seen one since the election.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for his question, as he appreciates that energy reform has been regarded since the eighties as a key aspect of microeconomic reform in Australia. It has been about productivity and strengthening the overall performance of the Australian economy, because we all understand that an efficient and reliable energy sector is the cornerstone of productive activity in Australia. In that context I also remind the House that historically there has been a bipartisan approach to energy market reform. That is because our energy sector has been central to our capacity to attract investment. It also guarantees our ability to employ Australians. We are all very pleased with the level of unemployment in Australia at the moment, which is just over five per cent, and it is the envy of the OECD world.That is the view not just of the Australian community; I am also pleased to say it is reflected in a recent commentary from the International Energy Agency, which said in addressing the Australian energy market that Australia has 'one of the most transparent and competitive electricity markets in the world and could well serve as a model for other countries'. The reason for that is that since we started this process of reform in the 1980s and 1990s the reform process has not only delivered for Australia lower energy costs for industry and households but also added $6 billion to Australia's GDP. The reform has been driven by the Ministerial Council on Energy, with the support of the private sector. From time to time we focus on key deliverables which are about strengthening microeconomic reform and the performance of our energy market. A recent achievement is the agreement by the Ministerial Council on Energy to establish a long sought after framework for the retail supply of energy going to both gas and electricity. The use of gas is going to grow in Australia and the need for a national gas market is central to moving to a low-emission economy in the future.We then go to energy consumer framework considerations. Legislation is currently before the South Australian parliament to deliver this key deliverable. This will enhance productivity by allowing companies operating in multiple states to operate on one platform to ensure that different customer systems operating across different states have a key opportunity to move to a uniform approach. We have also been working on the movement of workers across state and territory boundaries. That is very important in emergency situations such as bushfires or floods. Historically this movement has been very difficult because of the different regulatory requirements. We are making good progress with those outcomes.The Energy Efficiency Opportunities program is also central to energy market reform. To the end of 2009 this program had identified savings equivalent to 2.9 per cent of Australia's energy use. That reduces the need to invest in new generational capacity. Productivity is about ongoing reform and energy is a prime example. I only wish the coalition would front up to the debate on a price on carbon because that is just as important for energy security and market reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. I was momentarily distracted by Right here in Goldstein. 
 - Having had the opportunity to study that yet again at length, let me respond to the shadow minister's question - there is a bit of a theme here - by pointing out the amazing hypocrisy of it. That would be the theme of the day. - Of course the amazing hypocrisy of the shadow minister's question is that he has been carrying on in this parliament day after day suggesting that the government was not doing enough due diligence on the NBN and now he is in here today criticising me for doing too much due diligence on the NBN. I know that most members of the opposition change their convictions as frequently as they change their ties about everything other than Work Choices, but this has to be a land speed record. Between yesterday and today the approach and the analysis of the opposition has flipped 180 degrees. To the shadow minister I would say this: he might wake up every morning asking himself what he believes in on that day, but here on the government benches we know, and here on the government benches we are pursuing a long-term vision. In pursuing that long-term vision, we are engaged in patient and methodical work to bring that vision to life. In bringing that vision to life for the National Broadband Network, just like with major projects in the past we have engaged an independent expert firm to provide the government with some advice - just like was done in the various privatisation stages of Telstra, just like has been done by the NBN Co. board itself. It has engaged Goldman Sachs to provide advice. I do not know whether the member for Wentworth in his next question is going to suggest that engaging Goldman Sachs to provide advice is an inappropriate move, but I would find it quite odd if he did. So, as to the shadow minister's question, yes we are ensuring through patient work, through careful work, that we do have a further stream of advice - and that is entirely appropriate.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to report that the Gillard Labor government has an optimistic vision and a realistic plan to increase retirement savings through real reform. Of course, the House understands what real reform is: the minerals resource rent tax. That tax will allow the real reform of lowering the corporate tax rate. Under a Labor government we will put a two in front of the corporate tax rate in Australia - something unimaginable under the coalition. This tax will not only ensure a better deal for small and big business but also, most importantly, ensure adequate retirement for millions of Australians.This country needs to move the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent. We are a great country and one of the gifts of the 20th century bestowed by the generations who came before us is the gift of longer life, which will mean four and a half thousand centenarians by next year. -  - As I was saying, one of the gifts of the 20th century to the 21st century is that Australians are living longer than ever before. -  - The coalition would know that. We have tree changes and sea changes. We have grey nomads. We have the frontbench of the coalition. But in order for this country to gain the benefits of longer life we need to make sure that our Australian citizens are not retiring into poverty when they finish work.The member for Bradfield then left the chamber. - All of the baby boomers of Australia will start to turn 65 from next year. There are four and a half million baby boomers and it is important that they do not retire into poverty. So we have a plan to increase people's superannuation from nine to 12 per cent. It is because of Labor that we have $1.2 trillion in retirement income available today and we have a superannuation system in Australia.Indeed, these proposals have been well received not only by senior Australians, Choice and the trade union movement but also by the Financial Services Council of Australia. I will inform you of the views of the CEO of the Financial Services Council of Australia:The research shows the longer we delay the move to 12 per cent superannuation, the greater the cost for working Australians.Mr Speaker, you are probably aware that the CEO of the Financial Services Council of Australia is none other than John Brogden, the former Liberal leader in New South Wales. He gets it. The people get it. We understand that we need to move from nine to 12 per cent. Labor has a plan for our superannuation. I invite the coalition: it is not too late to come on board. You should get behind increasing superannuation from nine to 12 per cent and doing something for the retirement incomes of all Australians, just as the Gillard Labor government is doing.</DOC>

 - Was that a Dutton special? - I think I said on radio this morning that I have had my head in the middle of the NBN for the past three years. This government has done all of the due diligence that would be required of a great nation-building project. Those opposite are so bereft of economic vision or any alternative policy that they can do nothing but come into this House and deride a great nation building project which will do good things for the thousands of small businesses on the Gold Coast, in North Queensland and in Far North Queensland. We have put forward a comprehensive program and we have put forward comprehensive analyses. We have had an expert committee, we have had a study by McKinsey and KPMG, and now we have the business case. - We are developing that business case and we are working with the ACCC. But all that those opposite can do, because they are so short sighted, bitter and intent on demolishing the NBN, is carry on with their negative approach. The people of Australia want more than that from an opposition. They want a government that will address the long-term challenges and this government is addressing those challenges. - We will do all of the work and all of the due diligence that is required to make this a fantastic success for Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. He represents one of the oldest electorates in the country, so he would be acutely aware of any changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the impact those changes might have on patients, particularly pensioners. The good news for the member for Hindmarsh, the parliament and the community is that, thanks to the support of the Independents and the Greens, in both the House and the Senate, the government's PBS reforms have been passed by this parliament.What that means is that the price taxpayers pay to pharmacies will now more accurately reflect the market price instead of the current listed price, which is often much higher. This sounds technical but it is a very, very important measure. It means that we will save nearly $2 billion worth of expenditure and that means we will be able to invest in new drugs when they become available and need to be listed on the PBS. It means we can invest in training more doctors and nurses that are needed in our health system and, most importantly, it is an important fiscal reform in that the government is actually using the market price rather than an arbitrary price to benefit consumers.I was asked by the member for Hindmarsh whether there has been any response to these reforms. I think it is important for the House to be aware that - despite the support from Medicines Australia, the Consumer Health Forum, pensioner organisations and the Greens and the Independents - two voices in the community opposed these reforms. One of those voices, not surprisingly, has been the Liberal Party, who argued that we should not go ahead with these reforms, that we should look at other proposals being put forward and that we should find other ways of making these savings. Interestingly, the second voice has been the Generic Medicines Industry Association. The Liberal Party, particularly the member for Dickson and the Leader of the Opposition, said we should go back and look closely at their proposals. We have done that. We have looked at their proposals. The reason we did not accept those proposals is that they were going to require pensioners to pay an extra $5 per script for their medications. I can tell you what: this government did not increase the age pension so that the member for Dickson and the Leader of the Opposition could put their hands into pensioners' pockets and take the money back via increased prices for medicines. We were not going to allow that to happen, and the Liberal Party stand condemned for opposing sensible reforms that give the benefit of market competition to the taxpayers and allow us to protect consumers and invest more in health reform.</DOC>

 - I have just been checking, Mr Speaker, that we have the new paradigm of peace, light and sweetness. I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. Australia has always been a great trading nation. It is a great trading nation now and will always be a great trading nation. It is terrific to receive a question from the member for Fremantle, who is a member of parliament from a great trading state. Western Australia, along with Queensland and other states, have been enormous beneficiaries of trade liberalising policies overwhelmingly implemented by previous Labor governments. The House might remember that the Whitlam government provided the first reductions in tariffs with the 25 per cent across-the-board tariff reduction. Then it was the Hawke and Keating governments that refashioned the Australian economy from an inward looking economy - inefficient, with very high protective barriers that supplied a narrow domestic market - to an outward looking economy engaged with the world. It has been estimated that the refashioning of the Australian economy by previous Labor governments generated $3,900 worth of increased income for the average household in Australia. There have been great gains from trade. I am following in the footsteps of the former Minister for Trade, the member for Hotham. I know that he applied great energy to his task. If I can replicate that energy then we are in for a very good future over the next couple of years in terms to trade liberalisation.I thank the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for their efforts in inviting to Australia, Seiji Maehara, Japan's Minister for Foreign Affairs - who also has responsibility for trade. Just recently, Japan released a very important document, its comprehensive economic partnership agreement, whereby the Japanese government, very sensibly and with great foresight, outline a new approach to trade liberalisation which will involve domestic reform of agriculture in that country. We were pleased to host Minister Maehara for lunch today.We encourage, very strongly, the minister and Prime Minister Kan's government in their efforts to open up the Japanese economy, including their agricultural industries, to more foreign trade. These are very encouraging times in terms of our increased investment and engagement with Japan. I want to make sure that the minister and the Japanese government know that we are right behind them in these reforms because they are also embracing the sort of trade liberalisation that Labor governments in this country adopted. All power, all strength to the Kan government for making these important decisions. We have agreed to re-energise the FTA negotiations with the next round in January. I am glad to get a little bit of support from the opposition. We will take any support we can get because they have done nothing but be negative for the last couple of weeks - in fact, since the election. Negative three-word slogans are no substitute for trade policy reform and economic policy reform. That is why we welcome the visit of Minister Maehara today. It has been a great day, and I am sure we are going to do a lot more good work this afternoon when he meets the Prime Minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. I have had the opportunity to make some remarks publicly about this matter but believe it is appropriate to also make some remarks in this parliament. The government is deeply concerned by yesterday's artillery attack on the Republic of Korea, a country we consider to be a very close partner and friend in our region. As members will be aware, yesterday two South Korean soldiers were killed as a result of the shelling by North Korea of South Korean territory, and a number of military personnel and civilians were injured. The government condemns this act of provocation, an act which breaches all international norms and obligations and is in violation of the 1953 agreement. The government also offers its condolences on behalf of the Australian people to the people and the nation of the Republic of Korea for the loss of life and injuries that they have sustained.Yesterday's events follow the March attack by a North Korean submarine on a South Korean navy vessel. We should remind ourselves that 46 South Koreans lost their lives in that attack. This also follows recent reports that North Korea is developing a sophisticated uranium enrichment program, in complete defiance of UN Security Council resolutions. This series of events is deeply troubling. It threatens stability on the Korean peninsula and in North Asia, and in the face of these provocations it should be noted by this parliament that the Republic of Korea has acted responsibly and in a restrained way. We commend President Lee for his calm and capable leadership. But this is a tense situation. Both sides are heavily armed. Of course, there is a real risk that a miscalculation could arise and lead to further actions or that there could be an escalation, and the consequences of either a miscalculation or such escalation could be enormous. As a nation deeply engaged economically, politically and strategically in North Asia, Australia has much at stake in these events. The government calls on North Korea to abide by international norms of behaviour and to cease its hostile acts. We call on North Korea to abide by its 1953 agreement.The government is, of course, monitoring these events closely. Members of the National Security Committee of cabinet met this morning and considered latest developments, including our engagement with international partners. We are in close consultation with our South Korean friends, Japanese friends and of course with the United States of America. We also believe it is important that China use its influence, bring its influence to bear, on North Korea in the wake of these events. The United Nations Secretary-General has described yesterday's events as 'one of the gravest incidents on the Korean peninsula since the end of the Korean War', and so all nations must stand in condemnation of North Korea's aggression and urge it to cease hostile acts.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question and believe she must be suffering some form of short-term amnesia, because of course the thing that wrecked the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme was the action of the Leader of the Opposition. The thing that prevented the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme going through this parliament was the Leader of the Opposition, as a weathervane without any convictions on the question, going outside, putting his finger up in the political wind and saying, 'Which way is it blowing today?' and then deciding, having done that, that the time was right for him to unseat the then Leader of the Opposition on the basis that he would run a scare campaign about climate change. Now to the extent that you can diagnose any underlying beliefs of the Leader of the Opposition in this coming and going, this set of inconsistent statements, this weathervane conduct of the Leader of the Opposition - and weathervane is not my term; it is the term of one of his most senior frontbench colleagues, the member for Wentworth - they appear to be that climate change is not real. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I could not have been asked a more broadly based question than the one I was asked and, as a result of the assertions in the question, the answer I am giving is entirely relevant. Of course the truth is that this nation would have a carbon pollution reduction scheme if the Liberal Party had honoured its agreements. But it is a political party without honour and that was proved in the last parliamentary term. It enters agreements and then it walks away from those agreements. -  - So because of this dishonourable conduct by the Liberal Party withdrawing its agreement after it was made, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in agreed form did not pass the parliament. That is the history. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is searching for who is responsible for that, she could try looking in the mirror, she could try talking to the Leader of the Opposition, she could try turning to her colleagues and talking to those who determined that they wanted to wreck the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and engage in fearmongering. That is, they wanted to serve their political interest instead of the national interest. -  - Against that history - and the member for Indi is making a contribution of the quality she is known for in this parliament; that is, none - in this new parliament we are seizing the opportunities of this new parliament to build a consensus within the parliament to price carbon. For those who are concerned about the national interest, which lies in ensuring that our economy is a low-pollution economy that can be a prosperous economy in a carbon constrained future - so for those who are concerned about that question - there is an opportunity for them to express their views and to help this nation maximise its future economic prosperity by getting on board with the discussions happening in the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. But we know, of course, the Leader of the Opposition will not elect to do that, because, to the increasing dismay of his own backbench, his own political strategy is wreck, destroy, spread fear and his own backbenchers - like the member for Higgins - are calling him out on it.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I know that she is one of the feistiest advocates we have in this parliament for the National Broadband Network and one of the most informed, and I thank her for her contribution. Major microeconomic reform is not easy. It is not easy but it is necessary for the country's future. Today's prosperity has been built on earlier waves of microeconomic reform like having the courage to float the dollar, like having the courage to reduce the tariff barriers which were making our economy inefficient and not competitive - microeconomic reforms that have worked to make us a more productive and a more prosperous nation, reforms that include superannuation and building up our pool of national savings, reforms that include competition policy to bear down on regulatory settings and to make sure that we had a leaner regulatory scope so that the economy could thrive and prosper.These have been the tough reforms of the past, and now we need to engage in another major microeconomic reform. The reality is there are only so many times in a nation's history when it gets the opportunity to structure its telecommunications system for the future. Our nation has basically had two opportunities in the modern age to get our telecommunications right, and each time the nation has not got the job done. Those two opportunities began when we saw the merger of Telecom and OTC and, of course, the most recent of those two opportunities was the privatisation of Telstra. The merger of Telecom and OTC in 1992 created a market giant which severely compromised competition and then, after the privatisation of Telstra, we saw that market giant out there without structural reform.This is the day, this is the parliament and this is the time to deliver that structural reform to get the reform job done that has been left undone for 30 years, and we can get it done today, Mr Speaker. We can get it done today by seeing the passage in the Senate of the telecommunications legislation that would structurally separate Telstra.We have been prepared to work with the crossbenchers in this House and with the Independent senators in the other place in order to secure passage of this legislation. We would, of course, have been prepared to work with the opposition but they made it painfully clear that what they wanted to do was demolish the NBN. They are not interested in reform, not interested in microeconomic reform, not interested in the future prosperity of the country or in the service delivery innovations we can see in health and education. None of that interests them. They are on, once again, a completely negative wrecking path.Once they made it clear that their only objective was to wreck then it fell to us to work with the crossbenchers and the Independent senators to secure this major microeconomic reform. In pursuit of that we have released more information today: a summary of the National Broadband Network business case. I commend it to those members of the House that are seriously interested in understanding matters about the National Broadband Network, not those who simply seek to wreck. Of course, there is no point in them wasting their time reading it because they will not care what it says.</DOC>

 - I did not realise when I came to the parliament today that the opposition had been replaced by a history club. Some of us are interested in the nation's future and we will get on with debating that future and designing that future and delivering a vision for Australia whilst the opposition takes itself back in time - back in time to the days of former glory, back in time to the days of Work Choices when they could click their champagne glasses as another worker lost their penalty rates. This is the kind of nostalgia we are seeing from the opposition.In its current mode of wreck, destroy, worry about the past, pay no regard to the nation's future, what I can say to the member who asked the question -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Of course, I am asked by a political party of the past about the history of the minerals resource rent tax. Let me just remind the political party of the past about that history. Of course, that history is that this government was motivated to step up to the plate to manage our current economic circumstances where we are seeing extraordinary growth in the resources sector and, of course, the generation of wealth of assets that can only be exploited once. By definition you can only bring minerals out of the ground and sell them once. In that economic circumstance we determined that it was appropriate for the nation to get a better share of that mineral wealth which we all collectively own.In pursuit of that the government initially announced the resource super profits tax. Obviously we had some work to do with the mining industry and as Prime Minister I did that work with the mining industry, working with the Treasurer, and we delivered the agreement that is the foundation stone of the minerals resource rent tax. We will pursue in this parliament the legislation of the minerals resource rent tax. It is necessary to help us balance economic growth so that, across the country, we can provide a company tax reduction, most particularly a tax reduction for small businesses to help us balance economic growth across our nation. It will be there to support a growth in the pool of national savings, good for our macro economy, and good for the individuals who will benefit from an increased stream of retirement incomes.We will use those proceeds to deliver infrastructure projects, particularly to communities that are feeling the pressures of growth arising from the resources sector. For people who are familiar with the pressures that come on cities like Perth, pressures that come on regional areas, they are manifest and more infrastructure is required.When the legislation comes to this parliament the opposition will have to make a big call - a big call about whether they want businesses in this country to pay more tax, a big call about whether they want workers in this country to have less superannuation and a big call about whether they want communities in this country to have less infrastructure. - I am told by the shadow Treasurer they have made the call, and I thank him for his confirmation that the Liberal Party in the modern age stands for more tax, less super and less infrastructure. Thank you very much! - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for that very important question. As a Queenslander and someone who has been associated with the sugar industry for much of my life I had a very good visit to North Queensland about a month ago. I went to Townsville, first of all, to talk to resource companies about the copper string project, about a transmission line between Mount Isa and Townsville of vital importance to energy supply in the north-west and also of very great potential in terms of renewable energy. We then proceeded further north to the Victoria mill, one of the largest mills in Australia. The thing I can say is that I am an optimist about the future of the sugar industry in this country. I do believe it has a bright future and that it is a very good example of what we can do if we get all the policy settings right. I believe there is more that we can do for our great sugar industry to make sure that it continues to prosper. It is such a vital source of employment, particularly in Far North Queensland but also along the Queensland coast further south and, of course, into northern New South Wales. The member asked me about the particular case of the South Johnstone mill. I can assure him that I will follow up with the responsible regulator to ensure that everything is done that can be done to ensure that the law has been properly observed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for that very important question. The NBN is a fundamental microeconomic reform, probably one of the most important microeconomic reforms in Australia in the past 30 years. It has tremendous potential to lift the productivity performance of the Australian economy across the board. It has tremendous potential to drive new competition and innovation, and nowhere is this more important than in regional Australia. If you go to Townsville or Mackay or Western Australia - if you go to any regional area in this country - you find that small businesses are crying out for superfast broadband because they understand how important it is to the future, particularly, of small business in those communities.They understand this particularly in the electorate of Dawson. There, small business organisations are very public in calling for the NBN. It is urgent that we deliver this fundamental microeconomic reform because it has been in the too-hard basket for far too long. One of the difficulties was that, when those opposite privatised Telstra, they put in place a vertical structure in the industry that made the sort of competition that the NBN will drive almost impossible. So it has fallen yet again to a Labor government to put in place a fundamental reform by putting in place a wholesale network in which you can then have vigorous retail competition, one which will go to the great regional areas of this country which have been starved of this sort of investment for far too long and which, in particular, were starved of this investment by the National Party who sit opposite and who are now trying to crush this vital microeconomic reform because they do not understand what must be done in this country to drive prosperity. But it is not just prosperity in city areas; it is prosperity in regional areas. That is why this is so important. The chairman of the ACCC had this to say about the NBN:Structural separation will mean the NBN operator has a clear incentive to treat access seekers on an equivalent basis. Therefore, the government's announcement provides an opportunity to deal head-on with the difficulties arising from the vertical integration of the current incumbent.It has fallen to this government to deal with those issues. Of course, those are the issues that go to the very heart of the bill that is in the Senate, because its passage can produce in this country a new era of microeconomic reform. It is not just about superfast internet; it is about increasing GDP growth. It is about increasing the innovative capacities of our small businesses. It is about making markets more competitive. It is about doing all of those things but, above all, it is about joining up regional Australia to the national economy and to the international economy. That is understood by all of those in this House who have the interests of regional Australia very much in their hearts.But what we find is that the opposition, for base political reasons, want to demolish the NBN. This negative approach of the opposition simply sells our country short. They would rather see the NBN fail than the country succeed and regional Australia grow. That is the problem. They have become so bitter and they have become so myopic that they cannot stand for the national interest. On this side of the House we will vigorously pursue the national interest. It is not only right for the economy but right for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for his somewhat predictable question. Can I say to the Manager of Opposition Business that I know he is still trying to recover from the embarrassment of failing to call a division on the legislative proposition about a judicial inquiry into Building the Education Revolution that he had been spruiking everywhere, so I understand that there is some embarrassment catch-up in the asking of this. But let me give to the Manager of Opposition Business effectively the answer I gave in the parliament yesterday, which is that the hypocrisy of the opposition on this question is rank, it is manifest, it is everywhere. Just as they come into this parliament during parliamentary days and rail against Building the Education Revolution, the moment they get back to their electorates they cannot wait to stand next to a Building the Education Revolution project and get their photos taken. They cannot wait to get their newsletters out and pretend that somehow it was their strident advocacy for their electorate that brought these projects to their electorate. I am proud, and every member of the government is proud -  - Let me say again that I am proud, and every member of the government is proud, that through Building the Education Revolution we supported Australian jobs. There is nothing more important to the welfare of Australian families than having parents in work - nothing more important. If we look around our world and look at the circumstances of other economies as they have been hit by the global financial crisis, we see where we could have been. We see where we could have been with an unemployment rate with an 8 in front of the figure or maybe a 9 in front of the figure, with that meaning hundreds of thousands of people unemployed, hundreds of thousands of people at risk of not being able to pay their mortgages or pay their rent, families having their homes repossessed, their mortgages no longer being able to be paid, with everything that means about the future for those families. We were not going to stand by and see that. We understand that the opposition was prepared to stand by and see that but we were not. That is why we provided economic stimulus, why it was targeted and timely, why it was provided to areas of national need like schools to give them the facilities that they will need for the future. Of course these major projects require oversight and as the relevant minister, apart from the oversight built into the program, I also commissioned Brad Orgill to bring his commercial skills to dealing with oversight of the program.Let us contrast that positive program of action in the nation's interest and in the interests of Australian families against the alternative advocated by those opposite: don't provide economic stimulus, let people become unemployed, leave schools without vitally needed infrastructure. All those opposite have ever had their eyes on is the political strategy: call for an Auditor-General report and then when it does not find what they want dismiss it; call for further action and then when the Brad Orgill report does not find what they want dismiss it; try and advocate for a judicial inquiry and then not even bother to come in and call a division and have a vote. We will leave them with their failed political strategy while we get on with the national interest. It is about supporting jobs, it is about supporting families - it is a pity the member for Sturt does not understand that.</DOC>

 - The National Broadband Network is, of course, the most significant single piece of nation-building infrastructure that we could possibly embark upon in order to prepare us for the needs of the 21st century. It will boost economic growth. Fact: the UN estimates that, for every 10 per cent increase in broadband penetration, we can expect a 1.3 per cent additional growth in gross domestic product. For businesses it will mean lower telephone bills and enhanced business services like high-definition video conferencing, particularly in regional Australia. Consumers will also benefit with increased competition. The OECD found that high-speed broadband provides consumers with benefits by giving them more information about pricing and more access to competition, enabling greater choice as well as putting downward pressure on prices.It will also drive employment - 25,000 jobs on average created each year because of the NBN. It will ensure that innovation stays on our shore rather than be exported overseas. It will increase workforce participation by enabling more employees to telework. More employees participating in telework puts downward pressure on urban congestion and reduces carbon emissions because people can work from home.So right across the board this has massive benefits. The structural separation of Telstra - the way that we have designed it - will have particular benefit. Paul Budde has said of Telstra's decision to separate:The fact that Telstra has made this major step forward is vindication that this industry structure is not only advantageous to the social and economic benefits of our country, but that it also represents sound economics.Those opposite took a very different approach. They took a public monopoly, turned it into a private monopoly and called it reform. They know that structural separation is absolutely vital, and that is why we are creating the NBN, a wholesale network with retail competition on top of that so that we can deliver the nation-building infrastructure that we need. Those opposite determine to wreck this nation-building reform at the same time as they say, 'We are not really opposed to it.' But every time they have an opportunity to vote they vote against the National Broadband Network, like they vote against all the other important infrastructure reforms of this government. I am pleased that this reform is able to proceed. The National Broadband Network is absolutely vital to Australia's economic and social future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. I understand that the member for Wentworth is disappointed that Independent senators - including Senator Xenophon, whom he refers to - are taking a constructive approach of thinking through information, receiving information, studying the question and endeavouring to make a decision in the national interest. They are taking a thorough and proper approach to assessing a piece of legislation before them. I understand that he is disappointed by that because it is a stark contrast to what he was advocating to them, which was wreck at all costs - in order to fit in with the opposition's strategy, wreck at all costs.We know that in this parliament, when it has come to considering the profound micro-economic reform of structural separation of Telstra, there have been three approaches. The government came determined to deliver this major micro-economic reform to conclude 30 years of reform work; the crossbenchers came into this parliament anxious to absorb information, think deeply about the issue and exercise votes in the national interest; and the opposition came in determined to wreck. The information has always been irrelevant to them.The reason we never agreed with the member for Wentworth's call for a referral to the Productivity Commission is that, just as the words came out of his mouth, he indicated that whatever the findings - whatever the Productivity Commission said - the opposition was determined to wreck. He made it absolutely apparent that, even if the Productivity Commission gave this project gold stars all over the page, the opposition would not absorb that information, that it was determined to wreck. I understand that the determination to wreck is increasingly controversial within the opposition. I understand that when the member for Wentworth sits there with a melancholy face that is because this question of just having negative approaches to everything is increasingly controversial within the opposition. I refer members of the House to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald - 'Abbott assures colleagues new policies will emerge next year'. We would like to see that. - Thank you, Mr Speaker; I am responding to a question that asked why I did not agree with the opposition about a particular proposition and my answer is that there would have been no point. They have made it clear that they will adhere to their position, despite internal difficulties with some members, like the member for Moncrieff, advocating positive policies and plans from within the progressive faction of the Liberal Party. - My colleague is unkindly saying there is only one. I think there maybe three. I think that member may be joined by the member for Higgins and the member for Bradfield, who are actually saying, 'Let us get something positive done.' - Only in the Liberal Party would saying someone has got an idea be considered an insult. But there we have it - look how far they have fallen. The member for Wentworth is able to see further details about the capital expenditure of the NBN and the rate of return in the information that has been publicly released. If he was really interested in the facts then I would refer him to a study of that document, but we know he is not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question. I know the strong commitment he has to the important rollout of the National Broadband Network and that he has been engaging with his community to ensure that they get the full benefits. But that cannot happen until we get the legislation through the parliament. It is pleasing today to see a major breakthrough whereby parliament will no longer be standing in the way of the passage of this legislation. Nor should it, because this is a major structural reform. This is the sort of reform that will benefit the nation and the sort of reform that recognises the diversity and distance that this country encompasses. Through this reform we will enhance that economic diversity and we will shrink the distance, and we will deliver better services, particularly to people in regional and remote communities. This is productivity with a purpose - to improve people's lives and their economic opportunities.Today's breakthrough is important and we congratulate those senators who have been prepared to engage constructively with us to try to find the way through - unlike those who sit on the other side and simply carp, whinge and complain while blocking at every point they can. That is an opposition with no agenda and no understanding of what the benefits are for regional Australia. I suggest some of them actually get out there and visit parts of regional Australia. If they did, they would understand why regional Australia is clamouring for the rollout of the National Broadband Network. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. As I said, they only carp, whinge and complain and never get on with the serious issues. Whether I get an invitation from the member for Fadden or not, I can assure the House that I will be getting an invitation from their regional development body. Like the other 55 bodies around the county, that body is saying, 'We want access to the National Broadband Network because we understand what it can do to enhance our opportunities for economic diversity, our opportunities to get better services and our opportunities to value-add to the health and education infrastructure all around the country.'This is a historic reform and it is only through a Labor government that it has been delivered. It is fortunate that those who sit on the crossbenches understand the importance of this and have been prepared to join with us to deliver the outcomes. I ought to say to those members who sit here and oppose so negatively, go and meet with your regional development bodies around the country and see what they have to say about connecting the nation. Do something to advance opportunity rather come into this place to simply oppose by being negative and stopping at every point. Get on the bus and come along with us.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. I am not sure that the shadow Treasurer is in a position to be lecturing people about fiscal consolidation given the $11 billion black hole the Liberal Party was responsible for in its election costings. What was most remarkable about that $11 billion black hole is that the shadow Treasurer thought it was okay for him, as shadow Treasurer, to say, 'I never really had a look at the costings.' That was his excuse - as revealed in the newspaper. It should have been a story on page 1 that a journalist should have won a Walkley award for. It is the revelation of this year that the man who wanted to be Treasurer of this country did not even study his party's costings during the election campaign and allowed an $11 billion black hole to be produced under his very nose. So we will not be lectured on fiscal consolidation from an $11 billion black hole man.Secondly, amnesia has broken out in a truly worrying way in the opposition today. It reminds me of a section of the book One hundred years of solitude and the curse of collective amnesia. Those opposite are forgetting everything. The shadow Treasurer has apparently forgotten that under the Howard government of which he was a member we saw interest rate rise after interest rate rise. What was most worrying about that of course was that it was the complete reverse of what the Liberal Party had taken to the election and promised Australians. They stood next to slogans that said, 'Keeping interest rates at record lows,' and then they got into government and Australians felt the pressure of interest rate rise after interest rate rise. What is amazing about the shadow Treasurer's approach to economic management is that at each critical decision-making point over the last three years he has misread the situation. He misread the global financial crisis. He misread the need for economic stimulus. Now he is misreading what the government is doing on fiscal consolidation.As we go about the task of fiscal consolidation, which is not easy - and building on the fact that we have delivered $80 billion in savings over the budgets that the government have produced - we are thwarted every step of the way by the opposition, who consistently stop savings measures without any regard to the costings in the budget. That is the history of the shadow Treasurer's performance. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was asked about the government's budget strategy. Our budget strategy is abiding by our rules, undertaking the biggest fiscal consolidation since the 1960s and bringing the budget to surplus in 2012-13. We are obviously confronted by obstacles. One of those obstacles is the opposition's inability to embrace a savings measure in this parliament because of their cheap populism and lack of strategy. Despite that obstacle, we will deliver the fiscal consolidation we have promised and we will bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13 as promised. And, of course, we will not take any advice from the creators of $11 billion black holes as we go about that work.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, particularly because I know he is interested in how services in his region can be improved. You do not have to look too far back - three years ago - to see that when we were elected we inherited, courtesy of the work of the Leader of the Opposition, a health system that was under extreme pressure. A billion dollars had been ripped out of our public health system, GP training places had been capped and nursing shortages were not being properly addressed. But we took action immediately to start to turn these things around.We have made it easier to see a GP when you need one. We have removed the cap on GP training places. Already 175 extra GPs are being trained in our communities across the country, but that number is growing by 5,500 in the next decade. We have expanded the rural incentive programs for GPs. We have increased nurse university places by 1,000 a year and we have given nurse practitioners and midwives the right to Medicare. Nearly one million services have been provided under the teen dental program. Three years into our five-year GP superclinic program, 15 clinics have provided over a quarter of a million services. All of these things have been done in face of an opposition who have opposed each and every step along the way.But we are only part way through the delivery of these important services. There are 37 emergency department projects underway across the country. There are new elective surgery theatres being built in, and new equipment going into, more than 125 hospitals across the country. Very shortly I will be making the first announcement for the small primary care infrastructure grants that have been requested by hundreds of GP practices across the country. And of course we have committed now, in the budget, to the establishment of after-hours GP services - all of this as we get on with the job the Leader of the Opposition has opposed.I think the Leader of the Opposition might have been particularly interested to see the Menzies-Nous health survey report released today, which shows that 76 per cent of Australians support our health reforms and only nine per cent oppose them. Of course, that nine per cent includes the Leader of the Opposition and those sitting on the opposition benches - a new low, I think, for the Leader of the Opposition to be with just nine per cent of the community.We are proud of what we are delivering in the health system. We are only able to deliver it because of the good work that has been done by the government to make sure we have a strong economy. We have saved thousands of jobs and we are supporting many more of them within the health system. We are delivering in health and we are delivering in education. We want to use the Broadband Network to deliver even better health services into the future.It is not that often that I agree with the member for Moncrieff but I think he is right to say that it is not worthy of a leader of a major party with the history of the Liberal Party simply to want to oppose, to want to wreck, to want to end, to want to stop, every initiative that this government takes. Only nine per cent of the population are opposed to our health reforms, and the Leader of the Opposition stands condemned for being amongst them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. The fact is that this government is delivering in education to make sure that every school in Australia is a great school and that every child, no matter where they live, gets a great education. That is why we have almost doubled spending on education - some $63 billion - compared with the opposition's record in their last four years: to make sure that we can deliver good education to students right around Australia.In particular, we have the national partnerships, a $1.5 billion investment in low socioeconomic schools, benefiting some 1,600 schools with additional resources to make sure that there are opportunities for those students to get the quality teaching they need. Additionally, the partnership on numeracy and literacy, another national partnership initiated by this government, is ensuring that we have a half-billion-dollar investment in schools that are specifically focused on issues of numeracy and literacy. That is really important, because if we do not provide that investment in schools for numeracy and literacy then students will not be able to develop the skills and capacities through their school career to make use of into the future.Again, there will be an investment of some $2.5 billion over 10 years in trades training centres. We have approved over $1 billion of this investment, which will see some 288 projects benefiting over 927 schools around Australia in trades training centres. That is a significant commitment by this government and it makes sure that those students who might consider a trade vocation have the opportunity to do it whilst they are still at school. Again, there is a commitment of more than $2 billion over seven years to get computers into schools for years 9 to 12 by the end of next year. Already 345,000 computers have been delivered, with funding approved for more than three-quarters of a million computers.Then there is the Building the Education Revolution, a $16 billion investment. We have 23,738 projects right around Australia, in all of the states, and in particular around half are to be delivered to regional and remote Australia with some 99 per cent started and 70 per cent completed. -  - I can hear some of the opposition starting to call out about the Building the Education Revolution. The member for Sturt has 123 projects in his own electorate. The fact is that, when the opposition went to the election in 2007, they were pledging to cut money from the education budget. They wanted to cut some $3.2 billion and that included some $425 million from the smarter schools Improving Teacher Quality program. So I was interested to read the first speech by the member for Aston. On 26 October, he said:I am proud to have helped establish the Teach for Australia initiative that aims to lift the standing of teaching through tapping into a different pool of graduates. I am pleased there is bipartisan support for it.I welcome the member for Aston's contribution and his participation in Teach for Australia, but I regret to tell him that his shadow education minister and the opposition leader were pledging to cut the very program which he thinks there is bipartisan support for. We understand the need for investing in education on this side of the House. We will continue to deliver the resources to make sure that every student in Australia, regardless of where they live, regardless of their background, gets a great education for their future.</DOC>

He also confirms that he has been advised that the cause of the fire is still undetermined and investigations remain ongoing.

This is obviously a tragedy in which three people have died and police are taking appropriate steps.On the question of inspections for home insulation, the member would be aware of the government's program about home insulation inspections.

 - I thank the member for his question and for his ongoing interest, including in the Springvale project in his electorate, which has now been completed. We are delivering $37 billion over six years in transport infrastructure - that is, double what the previous government spent in this area. Over $21 billion of this investment is going into regional Australia. We have made a tenfold increase in annual spending on rail. We have delivered a national standard gauge rail network under one track manager from Perth to Brisbane. It took 110 years but we got there directly as a result of the input through the economic stimulus plan. We are delivering 10 new urban passenger rail projects worth some $7.3 billion - that is, 10 more projects than those opposite delivered in their time in office because they did not spend one cent on urban passenger rail. - We have more than doubled the federal roads budget to $27.7 billion over six years. We have also been engaged in reform, not just in investment. We established Infrastructure Australia to overhaul the way we plan, finance, build and use major infrastructure. We have commissioned the first national freight and national port strategies. We have delivered national laws, slashing regulators from the 24 which exist across the transport sector at the moment down to just three - single national regulators in maritime, in rail and in heavy vehicles. We have implemented new, fairer, heavy vehicle road user charges in consultation with industry and we have delivered them. The Infrastructure Working Group last week signed off on our program of completion of microeconomic reform. We have delivered strong, national PPPP guidelines. We have delivered streamlined approval processes for major projects. We have delivered best practice on project delivery. On 1 January 2011 we will deliver for the first time a national prequalification system which is about increasing competition in the sector so that drives down prices to governments and at the end of the day to consumers.We have delivered alliance contracting reforms. The draft is currently out there. Consultation with industry will be delivered in 2011. And we have ended the exile from urban policy that occurred under the previous government. We will have strategic plans for all capital cities in place by 1 January 2012 as a condition of Commonwealth funding. So we have delivered record investment, we are delivering micro-economic reform to make sure that the productivity benefits flow through to the nation and, on top of that, we are delivering the single largest infrastructure investment, and the most important, in the National Broadband Network.</DOC>

 - I did answer a remarkably similar question from the member for Denison and I stand by the answer that I gave to the member for Denison. We had a proper process of making local promises. We costed them. As a result of costing them, we then had them included in the Charter of Budget Honesty process, and in that Charter of Budget Honesty process we found offsetting savings. That is why we can say in this parliament - because we properly costed policies, because we had them properly put through the Charter of Budget Honest process - that we are in a position to honour them. That is, we made the promises that we could afford to make because we had found matching savings for them. That was a stark contrast to the process that the opposition went through where it just went around saying whatever it wanted to in various electorates - never properly costed the promises - and we all know how that ended. It ended with an $11 billion black hole. -  - My answer to the member's question is that we made promises, we costed them, and because we costed them we can stand by them and bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13. The opposition made promises it never costed, never accounted for, and had it been elected as the government it would have been headed for an $11 billion black hole, or it would have wholesale marched away from those local commitments, indicating that it would have breached its word to local communities. I say to the member opposite that I stand by the answer I gave the member for Denison and if he cares about local commitments then he will be very happy that the government has properly costed promises that it made.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question and for her very real commitment to paid parental leave. As the member for Petrie knows, and as all members of the House should by now know, on 1 January 2011 Australia will finally get its first national paid parental leave scheme. This will be a historic day for the mothers and fathers of Australia, who have waited decades for paid parental leave. In just over one month, Australia will finally catch up with the rest of the developed world. This will be extremely important, not just for mothers and fathers but for all the newborn babies who are going to get a better start in life because of our paid parental leave scheme. It will give parents - mothers and fathers - the financial security to spend more time at home with their newborn baby, time which will allow mothers to recover from the birth, to bond with their newborn baby and, where possible, to establish breastfeeding.Today we saw the release of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare report Australia's mothers and babies, which shows that the number of women giving birth remains high in this country. So it is not surprising that we see so many mums enthusiastically ringing the Family Assistance Office and registering for the new Paid Parental Leave scheme. More than 2,700 applications for paid parental leave have already been registered. We have also seen a very significant number of employers signing up - around 550 employers have already signed up for the Paid Parental Leave scheme. Employers understand just how important paid parental leave is, both for their businesses and for their employees. They also understand that they will not be slugged with a new tax, one which was going to be delivered to them courtesy of this Leader of the Opposition. Employers understand that paid parental leave will mean that there will be better workforce connection with the mothers in their employment. They also know that it is likely to increase workforce participation.Everyone in this House will know that for 12 years this Leader of the Opposition refused to deliver paid parental leave. He so famously said that paid parental leave would only be delivered over his dead body. Paid parental leave is being delivered because of this government and we can only speculate what that might mean for the Leader of the Opposition. We know that the member for Moncrieff thinks that they are just a complete bunch of wreckers on that side of the House. By contrast, this government is delivering - we are delivering a strong economy; we are delivering jobs; we are delivering in health and education. This government is delivering high-speed broadband and, on 1 January, we will deliver Australia's first paid parental leave scheme.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his very widely-drawn question. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is time to stop being stranded as human history marches past you. We could not have a better example of that than we have in this parliament today and into tonight. This parliament is poised to deliver the biggest micro-economic reform agenda in telecommunications that this nation has ever seen - a reform agenda 30 years in the making, a reform agenda actually based on competition policy. Competition - a word that used to mean something to the Liberal Party. Instead of just accepting that his strategy of wrecking and demolition has been exposed to all the world for what it is, instead of just accepting that in his negativity the Leader of the Opposition has lost, he is forcing this parliament into the sham of sitting through the night and tomorrow when he knows that this ends in victory for those who believe in the National Broadband Network and in defeat for the Leader of the Opposition and his negativity. In my answering this question, the Leader of the Opposition adds yet again to his tidal wave of negativity and his lack of vision for the future. What does the Leader of the Opposition stand for except 'Stop this', 'End that' and 'Wreck the other'? Is he a man who has ever had a positive idea or plan for the nation's future?In this parliament today we are seeing on display the contest in Australian politics and the battle of ideas about this nation's future: one side of the parliament, aided and facilitated by those who have got a vision for the country, delivering a transformative technology, the National Broadband Network; and the bitter and defeated, mired in their negativity, as human history marches past them. The Liberal Party, the party of the past; the Labor Party, delivering the technology of the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. Of course, as a South Australian originally, I know her electorate well. It is a growth corridor. It is a place where people go to raise their families. It is a place where people go to open their small businesses. It is a place where people go to often open small businesses from home. In order to do that, they need the power of national broadband. In pursuit of delivering national broadband, I welcome the support of the crossbenchers in this place and the Independents in the Senate for structurally separating Telstra - a reform of the telecommunications industry that this nation has wanted for 30 years. This reform is being delivered against the relentless negativity of the opposition - relentless negativity. It is remarkable to me that the other side of politics has missed the opportunity to be part of this historic reform.The structural separation of essential services markets is Economics 101. Consequently there is no mystery why the Leader of the Opposition does not understand it. Let me quote to the parliament what Graeme Samuel said in the Wall Street Journal 
on 4 October:The fundamental reforms proposed in the legislation _ which will see Telstra separate its wholesale network operations from its retail operation - represent the most significant pro-competitive stance we have taken in this area certainly in Australia's history and probably that has been seen in any other jurisdiction in the world.Let us reflect on those words: 'the most significant pro-competitive stance' - and the Liberal Party missed it. Menzies would be turning in his grave to see the Liberal Party of the modern age turn its back on microeconomic reform, turn its back on competition. But, of course, this is a start, and the journey to build the NBN continues. We will use this structural separation pathway to build the National Broadband Network as the Liberal Party gets mired in the past and chants to itself, the way we are seeing on display now.Today the government is introducing another significant bill into the House that puts in place the regulatory framework for NBN Co. It establishes the governance, ownership and operating arrangements for NBN Co. It is building on what will be achieved through structural separation. What difference will this mean for Australians? We can put it in terms of faster internet speeds or we can just go to some examples. Some examples for farmers: 'revolutionising the way they conduct their farms' - not my words but the words of the Chief Executive of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association; revolutionising the way we deliver health care; and revolutionising the way businesses like a Korean language centre, which teaches children here and in Korea, can operate from a town like Gladstone. These are the transformative reforms of the future that the Labor Party, a party of the future, is delivering to Australians, and every step of the way we need to overwhelm the opposition, the party of the past - and of course, in this parliament, we have.</DOC>

 - I know the member for Wentworth is unhappy that the parliament has repudiated his entreaties to wreck the NBN, but his unhappiness is no excuse for coming into this parliament and just making stuff up, which is of course what the member for Wentworth has just done. I have said in this parliament on a number of occasions when the opposition have asked for more information about the NBN that there is no point providing it to the opposition. There is a point providing it to people of goodwill, like the crossbench representatives in this parliament, but there is no point providing it to the opposition because they will not care what it says; whatever it says, they are determined to wreck the NBN. We could not have a better example than what the member for Wentworth has just done in this parliament. The capital expenditure figure in the summary of the NBN business case released yesterday is $35.7 billion, and he knows it. And the capital expenditure figure is less than the earlier capital expenditure figure in the implementation study because capital costs have been changed by the deal with Telstra - the deal with Telstra that he wanted to fall over, the deal with Telstra he spent the last few days trying to wreck by holding up the structural separation bill.I understand the member for Wentworth is embarrassed by and ashamed of his political failure this fortnight. We all understand the member for Wentworth was out there trailing his coat with the backbench; he was going to be the custodian of a big political victory for the Liberal Party in this parliamentary fortnight, and it has all ended in tears. But all ending in tears for the member for Wentworth does not justify making figures up. Anybody who wants the facts should go to the summary of the NBN business case, released yesterday.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question, and I thank him too for his continued very feisty advocacy in this parliament of the interests of his local community. We should also be thanking him for his Christmas salmon, which is being circulated in the parliament courtesy of a great Tasmanian member. The member for Lyons asks about the core priorities of this government, and of course our core priorities are absolutely clear. We want a strong economy that offers Australians the opportunities that can flow only from a strong economy. We want a sustainable Australia; we all understand that there is an Australian way of life that we want to take with us into the future, and that requires action on climate change. We want a fair and inclusive society, and that means we need great quality health and education services to make sure every child gets a chance. We want to govern for all Australians; we want to make sure there is no part of the country that gets left behind; and, of course, we want to keep Australians safe and keep our nation strong in the world.Achieving a strong economy requires the budget to be in surplus in this phase of economic growth. We will bring the budget to surplus in 2012-13. We are engaged in the fastest fiscal consolidation since the 1960s. Other nations have government debt of over 80 per cent; ours will peak at 6.4 per cent of GDP. On the other side of politics, we are matched by an $11 billion black hole, and another $2 billion black hole would have been added had they succeeded in blocking the PBS savings measures in the Senate. We have over there a political party that was too ashamed to put their tatty costings into Treasury for the officials to have a look. When we sought to find out who was responsible for these costings, the shadow Treasurer blamed the shadow finance minister and the Leader of the Opposition blamed both of them.We will harbour a strong economy. We have kept the economy strong and growing through the financial crisis, and now we will balance growth with lower company tax rates, with lower tax rates for small business. On the other side of politics, this is matched by an aspiration for tax increases, including an aspiration for a higher company tax rate which would have cost families $350 extra per year. That would have been in direct breach of a policy promise of no new taxes. On this side of politics, we believe in using market principles to resolve market problems - in pricing carbon, in water reform, in the structural separation of Telstra. What we have seen in this parliament is a prize fighter, the Leader of the Opposition, who is always looking for a fight but he know longer knows what he is fighting for. - Thank you. I was asked a broad question about belief and priorities and I am answering it. I have outlined the government's priorities in strengthening the economy. I can say in this parliament that we have the policies, plans and vision for this nation's future, including a stronger economy. What we are seeing from the Leader of the Opposition is him throwing out fundamental Liberal Party tenets: competition - they no longer believe in it; markets - they no longer believe in them; balanced or surplus budgets - they no longer believe them; low taxes - they no longer believe in them. This is a pit bull that has turned on its owner. That is the limit of his vision for the country.

 - I thank the member for his somewhat remarkable question. If the member does not like seeing cables, then he should support the NBN. Through the NBN you get NBN Co. rolling out the cable for the country rather than multiple providers rolling out multiples cables in a repetition of the kind of problems we saw with the original rollout of pay TV. Yes, we need to cable the country with fibre. If you want to have fibre there is no alternative than laying the cables - that is absolutely right. The reason for a wholesale provider like NBN Co. providing that fibre backbone is that it should be provided once, it should be provided right and there should be retail competition on the basis of it.Without NBN Co., which is presumably the vision the member who asked the question has for the country, there would be multiple cable providers laying those multiple cables in parts of the country where they thought business was profitable but entirely ignoring parts of the country, like regional Australia, that did not fit in with their business plans. The member's question begs for more cables in some parts of the country and further neglect of regional Australia.The coalition might believe in neglecting regional Australia, the coalition might be in denial about the future, the coalition might not want to see superfast broadband, but I can tell this parliament one thing very clearly: Australians do not want to miss out on the opportunities of the future. They want the National Broadband Network. Responsible members from regional Australia know that their communities want the National Broadband Network to shatter the tyranny of distance that regional Australia has suffered under for far too long. In order to do that, we need to lay the very cable that the member for Cowper seems to object to. We will provide that technology for the future, despite this relentless negativity.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Denison for his question. I know that he is deeply concerned about the circumstances of Australians with disabilities, as I and many members of the government are. I want to particularly pay tribute to the work of the member for Maribyrnong when he held this portfolio for the government in the last parliament. Building on his work with advocates for Australians with disabilities and their carers, I specifically want to say to this parliament: we absolutely believe Australians with disabilities deserve any assistance to ensure that they can pursue their day-to-day lives, enjoy the benefits and dignity of being full members of our community - including work, if that is possible for them - and having a full community life.That is what has motivated us to ask the Productivity Commission to undertake a landmark inquiry into the feasibility of a national long-term care and support scheme for people with disability, and this does include considering the question of a national disability insurance scheme. The member for Denison is right: we will receive that report during 2011; we will receive it in July 2011. To the member for Denison what I can say is that we will seriously consider what is found by the Productivity Commission. We need to see the recommendations, we need to know them and we need to study and assess them and then respond. That is what we will do as a government. I can say to the member for Denison: we did ask for this report for a reason, because we wanted a piece of policy work done in this area and we believed that, in this policy area, the Productivity Commission was the right agency to do it.I can also say to the member for Denison that, whilst this work is being done by the Productivity Commission, the government is not standing still. We are delivering reforms and changes for Australians with disability. We have doubled Commonwealth funding, to more than $6 billion over five years, for more and better specialist disability services under the National Disability Agreement. Of course, our pension reforms included those who are disability pensioners and carers, and we have increased the maximum rate to around $115 a fortnight more for single pensioners. We have provided $1.7 billion to remove waiting lists for disability employment services, because we know that there are many Australians with a disability who want to work, who want to enjoy the benefits and dignity of work and the inclusion in the life of our community that that necessarily means. And we have mapped out the National Disability Strategy. More than 2,500 people with disability and their carers had their say in developing this important strategy. To build on these measures, from July next year the government will also provide flexible funding for early intervention services to parents of children diagnosed with conditions that we referred to in the Better Start for Children with Disability program, because we know that if people can get the benefits of early intervention it makes such a difference. So that will be a change for children with sight and hearing impairments, cerebral palsy, Down syndrome or fragile X syndrome. We will continue to work on this and, of course, we will work with the member for Denison and other members of the parliament on these important disability reforms that are so important to the life of our nation and Australians with disability and the people who love them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for this very important question. This government has a proud economic record. Over the past three years Australia has created 650,000 jobs. There is nothing that we are prouder of than the fact that 650,000 jobs have been created in this country over the last three years. During that period the rest of the developed world lost 30 million jobs. Unemployment in Australia is currently 5.4 per cent. It is almost twice that in most other developed economies and, almost alone amongst developed economies, Australia avoided a recession. Our net debt will peak at 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2011-12. In other major advanced economies it is closer to 90 per cent. And, of course, we are coming back to surplus in three years, three years early, while other developed economies are struggling to halve their deficits. Our financial institutions are in good shape. So in black and white this is the proud record of a Labor government in the face of a global financial crisis and a global recession. We are proud of the fact that breadwinners were kept in jobs and we are proud of the fact that small businesses right around this country were able to keep their doors open because we put in place stimulus which backed confidence in the community. So as a country we stand tall as a consequence of these actions - Australians working together; employers, employees and the government working together to produce this outstanding result for Australia.But there is always more work to be done. That is why we have a big reform program: tax cuts for companies, tax assistance for small business, investment in infrastructure and particularly the big microeconomic reform that the Prime Minister was talking about before to propel us into more prosperity in the future by making our companies and our great regions more productive. But every step of the way on this journey we were opposed by those opposite. If they had had their way, Australia would be in recession. It would have gone into recession, unemployment would have been far higher and business closures would have been far higher. They opposed us at every point along the way. The member for Wentworth stood up and said that stimulus would never create a single job. The member for Wentworth opposed the bank guarantees which gave security to our country. And, of course, now we have the Leader of the Opposition opposing the NBN. Those opposite would rather see the government fail than see the country succeed. That is the lesson of the last three years. They are defined purely by what they oppose because they stand for nothing positive. And the final word on their lack of economic credibility goes to the former Treasurer, Peter Costello. This is what he has had to say about the current Leader of the Opposition:Never one to be held back by the financial consequences of decisions - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for her question because I know she does understand the significance this program has to her electorate and she has been involved in many openings of great new facilities within her electorate for the students in La Trobe. The fact is that the BER program is the largest school modernisation program in Australian history. What is derided on the other side as a school halls program is, in fact, building classrooms, libraries, science centres, language labs, gymnasiums, multipurpose facilities and sports facilities. There have been 24,000 such projects across the nation in 9,000 schools. Indeed, this program has been welcomed across the nation from parents and students alike for state-of-the-art facilities that they never could have dreamt of and were never delivered under the previous government.As an example of how this program has been welcomed I refer to the opening of a completed project in Linden Park Schools. This was a new BER funded project of some $4.775 million and all of it was paid for under the BER - a teaching block with a shared activity area, an early years outdoor learning area, a middle years outdoor learning centre and a significant increase in the school gymnasium. - Here is an example of what has been said about this very significant program:I am very pleased to be a part of the opening of these new school buildings. But a school is made much better by having tremendous facilities and the facilities that Linden Park now has are second to none in the state and are going to be a gold standard for all the other primary schools across the electorate. - To continue the quote:What a marvellous job that's been done - This is in relation to the $4.775 million under the BER program, a Labor government program - What a marvellous job you've done in making this great school even better. Congratulations to those people who have made it happen and thank you very much for the opportunity to be here today.Now, who said this? It just so happens that it was the member for Sturt. There he is in the photo at the podium welcoming this great initiative. It was a very good speech. There is another photo. There he is in the school audience at the opening ceremony with his mouth open. He must have been saying something - you might say 'prattling' - but no-one is listening to him. - I will go the question, Mr Speaker, because I am asked how it has been received in the community. That is how it has been received in the community. - I am asked how this -  - Mr Speaker, I am asked how it is received in the community. This is an example of how the hypocrisy on the other side knows no bounds. This is the person who is the attack dog in this parliament but the lap-dog when he gets back to his community and wants to claim credit for what we have done.</DOC>

 - I am happy to confirm for the Leader of the Opposition that Labor caucus members did meet last night to talk about our shared vision for the country. We did meet last night to talk about our strategy. We did meet last night to talk about our positive plans for the nation's future. My recommendation to the Leader of the Opposition would be that he should try it. He should try going to a meeting and actually sitting in a chair and thinking about what he stands for, not what he opposes. He should sit for a moment or two and reflect -  - Does he have a vision for the nation, not a list of things he is opposed to but a vision for the nation? - He should perhaps sit in a chair and sit in a meeting and think about what positive policies and plans he wants to release to the Australian electorate for their consideration. The truth is that, since this parliament first sat, the Leader of the Opposition has not released one positive policy for the nation. I am not generally charitable to him, I know, but I have to give the shadow treasurer this: at least he got out an envelope and scribbled nine points on the back of it. Since this parliament first sat, the Leader of the Opposition has not released one policy for the nation. He is a man of slogans derived from focus groups -  - and they all start with words like 'end, stop, demolish'. The Leader of the Opposition is a man who can always give you a comprehensive picture of what he is opposed to but he can never give you a picture of what he stands for. He is a prize-fighter who always keeps fighting, but he no longer knows what he is fighting for. The real damage he is doing is to the nation by putting his political interests before the national interest every day. The real damage he is doing is to the heritage and legacy of the Liberal Party because, in looking for bricks to throw at the government, he is actually getting those bricks from the foundations of the Liberal Party. Competition - they used to believe in that, now he has pulled that brick out and thrown it; markets - used to believe in that, now he has picked that brick out and thrown it; balanced or surplus budgeting - used to believe in that, now he has picked that brick out and thrown it. In doing so he is destroying the political legacy and political brand of the political party that has propelled him into the leadership position he now holds. This is a pit bull that has turned on its master, and it is time the Liberal Party woke up to it.I understand that there are a few lonely progressives in the Liberal Party who are saying: 'Let's have an idea. Let's put a positive policy. Let's put a plan.' Those lonely progressives need some friends before this man entirely trashes everything they have ever believed in and everything they have ever stood for. He is a man determined not only to wreck the national interest but also to destroy the legacy of his political party in this country. It is remarkable.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Reid for his question. The foundation for any policy to deal with the challenge of climate change is the climate science. This is one of the defining differences between the government and the Leader of the Opposition in particular. The government respects the climate science and it was for that reason, amongst others, that Labor ratified the Kyoto protocol after the years of inaction and ineptitude demonstrated by the Howard government. There is a defining difference on this issue, because we know what the Leader of the Opposition thinks about the climate science. He has famously called it 'absolute crap'. That is his description. He has designed a climate change policy for the coalition in accordance with his belief about the climate science - because it does not take us any further.The government has articulated three key areas of policy to deal with the challenge of climate change. They involve strong support for clean energy, strong support for improvements in energy efficiency in our industry and in our households and the establishment of a carbon price through a market mechanism. In relation to the issue of clean energy, the government has legislated a 20 per cent target by the year 2020 such that 20 per cent of our electricity supply must come from renewable sources by that year. It is expected and modelled that $19 billion worth of investment in renewable energy generation will be a consequence of that policy measure by the year 2030. It is supported by the $5.1 billion Clean Energy Initiative, which includes important things such as the Solar Flagships program, developmental support for carbon capture and storage - extremely important for the future of the coal industry in this country - the Australian Solar Institute and other initiatives. The government has also committed a billion dollars towards connecting remote renewable energy generation to the national electricity grid. These are very strong measures in the area of clean energy.In the area of energy efficiency, the government has established the $100 million Energy Efficiency Trust and the Australian Carbon Trust to manage those funds and to work with the business community to develop innovative approaches to achieve energy efficiency improvements in business in particular. We have also brought in mandatory disclosure of the energy performance of residential and commercial buildings - a very important initiative. We have got new programs on the way - low-carbon communities and tax breaks for green buildings. We have released a Prime Minister's task group report on energy efficiency, and we are working with stakeholders on that issue now. Most importantly, the government has established what is necessary to achieve important structural change in our economy, and that is the objective to achieve a carbon price through a market mechanism. Again, this is an issue repudiated by the opposition and repudiated by the Leader of the Opposition - a repudiation of the fundamental importance of markets in driving the most efficient changes of this nature.A market mechanism will be extremely important in our economy to drive us towards a low-carbon future. It is supported by the business community, it is supported widely in the community and it will be supported by further policy initiatives. What we know about the other side of politics, as we head towards the end of this parliamentary sitting, is that they have papered over the cracks; they are split and divided on this issue. They are led by a leader who thinks the science is absolute crap, but we know that there are very different views on that side of the House.</DOC>

 - To the Manager of Opposition Business who asked the question, can I say: I do not think he has much insight into the meeting that we had. We talked about our vision for the future. Now I know 'vision' is a confusing word for members of the opposition. They are all looking at each other now and asking for a definition - 'A what for the future? We don't have one of those. Ooh, never heard of that.' We understand you do not know much about vision for the future. We talked about policies and plans for the Australian people. We talked about our goals for the Australian nation. So, yes, we talked about things that matter to Australian families and to keeping our economy strong and prosperous, building it for the future. We talked about tackling climate change and sustainability for our country. We talked about being a fair and inclusive society. We talked about governing for all, and we talked about keeping our nation strong and safe in the world. We talked about positive plans for the future.Of course, when we look at the Manager of Opposition Business, who has asked this question, what we can say to him is: we understand his frustrations being in a political party in opposition when they had hoped for more. We understand his frustrations that they are there with their three-word slogans, unable to add to them with any positive policies or plans. We understand that there is frustration on the Liberal backbench with the leadership of the Liberal Party - a man who went around with his slogans in the election campaign, driven by focus groups, hollow to the core, no belief for the nation's future and no ability to add to those policies or plans in opposition - not one positive policy statement since this parliament sat. We understand that it is frustrating for the Manager of Opposition Business and for some on the Liberal backbench. But I would say to the opposition that the solution for this frustration is not to come into this parliament and ask these kinds of questions of the government; it is actually to sit down and see if they are capable of working out what they believe in, what they think the future should hold, what their policies and plans for that future are, and how they cost them and make them add up.Across all of those phases of positive action and policy development the Liberal Party in this parliament has returned a 'fail' in every space. The Leader of the Opposition has been going to Christmas parties and his proudest achievements for this political year are all about hurting other people and stopping things. Not one positive achievement. He cannot go to a Christmas party and say, 'I celebrate having achieved one thing for the nation this year,' because there is not one positive idea he has pursued and not one for the Australian people. This is a legacy of wrecking. The Leader of the Opposition seems unable to lift himself beyond wrecking, looking always at his narrow political interest. The problem for the Leader of the Opposition is that you might be able to run a protest vote campaign for a limited period in the run-up to an election, but let me give you some advice: you cannot run one for three years. That is going to be very transparent to the Australian people. Over three years they are going to be on to you - hollow at the core.The member for Sturt then left the chamber. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. She will be particularly pleased with the good news that I can report to the House today, which is that we have this morning released the details of 240 general practices across the country, three of which are in her electorate of Chisholm, where investments are going to be made to allow general practices to expand, for extra doctors to be employed, for a new treatment room to be built, for a practice nurse and, maybe, some allied health professionals to be employed. This is unreservedly good news for general practices across the country that have been saying that they are ready to do more in meeting the needs of the community but need a little bit of extra assistance to be able to develop their facilities to do that.The good news goes beyond just general practice, although that is the particular focus of our announcement today. The other good news is that last night this House passed the 
Federal Financial Relations Amendment (National Health and Hospitals Network) Bill 2010, the first step to being able to reform the funding of our health system into the future. I want to thank the Independents and the Greens, who supported this legislation in the House. It adds to a list of successes in the health area over the last fortnight in getting changes through this House that actually provide a legislative base for doing things better into the future. We are very proud of the fact that this will allow us to invest properly in our hospitals into the future.People will well remember that when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister he pulled $1 billion out of our hospitals. In the year 1996 the Commonwealth funded 45 per cent of hospital services and in 2007, when we came to government, it was down to 38 per cent. Never again will that situation occur if this legislation that was passed by the House last night is passed by the Senate when we return in the new year.Let me provide a little bit more information to those members of the House who might be interested to know about the 240 clinics that are being supported by virtue of our announcement today. Members will be interested to know that 45 per cent of those grants are in regional parts of the country, because a number of these practices are the ones that are ready to expand but need some extra resources to do so. People might be interested to know that lots of electorates across the country have had one successful recipient. Many, in fact over 20, have had two. I think nearly 15 have had three.But I would just like to highlight a couple of electorates that have been extremely lucky because there are four or five projects in the electorates that have been successful. The member for O'Connor will be pleased to know that there are four in his electorate. The member for Barker I suspect will be pleased to know that four practices in his electorate are being supported. The member for Leichhardt might be surprised to know that there are five in his electorate that are being supported and the member for Cowper, who I know has been supportive of his superclinic, will no doubt be pleased to know that five general practices are being supported in his area. That is not to mention the member for Denison, the member for Franklin and the member for Kingston, all of whom have had multiple successes. This is good news for general practice across the country but even more importantly it is good news for those patients who will see expanded services and be able to get to see a doctor or nurse more quickly when they need one.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I understand that there are many Australian families struggling with cost-of-living questions. I would say to the member that the government has enacted a number of policies and plans to help Australians with cost-of-living questions. We have provided tax cuts for three years in a row. We created the education tax refund to help with the cost of getting the kids to school, which is something that did not exist before this government put it in place. And of course now we will be expanding it to cover school uniforms. We moved to increase assistance for the costs of child care. They press on many working families as the second-income earner, usually the mother, seeks to return to work. To provide extra assistance with those costs we increased the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. We understand that the Australians who most struggle with utility prices are often those on fixed incomes and consequently we moved to implement a historic rise to the pension to assist pensioners who feel these cost-of-living pressures.Of course we are committed to further measures to ease cost-of-living pressures. We want to change the circumstances for families of teenagers where the family tax benefit structure really is from an earlier age and assumes that it is quite likely that a 16-year-old is going to move into the workforce, whereas in the modern age we want 16-year-olds engaged in full-time education. So we will rectify that problem by increasing the family tax benefit to assist with the costs of teenagers.We are also moving to implement other policies and plans that will make a difference for Australians, including for older Australians who seek to combine a partial retirement with partial work. Our plans for things like superannuation are a long-term way of assisting people with the cost of living. There is nothing more important to helping with the cost of living than certainty and security of pay and entitlements, and it is the Labor government that have brought that about through the introduction of the Fair Work Act and the eradication of Work Choices.I understand that with these measures there are still families that feel cost-of-living pressures - I do understand that - and so we will, with determination, go about delivering our election commitments, which are there to help make a difference to cost-of-living pressures. But can I say to the member coming into this place that he should acknowledge that the government have taken these steps - for example, the increase in childcare rebate and the education tax rebate - and that these steps are more than the steps that were taken by the Howard government. The government are working in partnership with families to assist with cost-of-living pressures.</DOC>

 - I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question. When the 43rd Parliament was formed some were critical about how effectively we could govern. Of course we know that this is only the second time since Federation that those who have sat on the government benches have not had an absolute majority on the floor of the parliament.Well, after five weeks of sittings we can say that this government has shown that the 43rd Parliament is able to get legislation through and is able to function in the national interest. This parliament has adopted important reforms in the National Health and Hospitals Network, in delivering the National Broadband Network, in providing assistance for higher education with student services and, just this week, again an important piece of legislation in reforming child care. Indeed, the government has not lost a single vote on legislation nor has a single amendment been passed to its legislation on the floor of this House - a remarkable achievement and a fact.Indeed, the government have passed some 51 pieces of legislation - the radio communications amendment, social security amendment, the Civilian Corps, corporations, amending of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme to save $1.9 billion, offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas, superannuation, carer recognition, civil dispute resolution, telecommunications legislation, territories' law reform, income tax amendments, corporations amendments, water efficiency amendments, native title amendments. This is a parliament that is functioning and passing our legislation -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. It was better than the member for Mackellar's efforts on the sitting schedule, I will say that.The fact is that this government have passed 51 pieces of legislation through this House with the support of the crossbenchers. We are showing that government can function effectively. We can cooperatively negotiate our legislation through this parliament. Those opposite simply take a negative approach where they have three-word slogans that all begin in 'oppose', 'end', 'destroy' or 'stop'. With every single policy, that is where they are at - nothing positive whatsoever. We have also -  - whilst we have been getting through this legislation, had over 90 hours of private members' business before this parliament -  - and we have for the first time in a decade passed the private member's bill moved by the member for Denison. The fact is that this parliament is functioning effectively, the fact is that this government is governing in the national interest and the fact is that those opposite just have not got over their 21 August loss. It is all negative. They are continuing with the same frame that they had during the election campaign of just oppose, destroy, stop, end. What the Australian people want is a positive vision for the future. If anything embodies the difference between the two political parties which seek to form government, it is the National Broadband Network.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Point No. 1: the member for Wentworth has given her the wrong figure about the NBN. - She should look at that summary of the NBN business case and not use that figure because it is simply not correct. I presume she does want her constituents to get from her mouth the facts and the truth. Point No. 2: I would say to the member who has asked the question -  -  -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. In answer to the member's question, the second point she raised concerned health and what is being done for the hospital system. Let me explain to the member: a great deal more than under the Howard government where we saw the track record of the Leader of the Opposition in delivering cuts. If she cares about the hospital system, and I presume from the comparison she has used in her question that she does, then I can only imagine what she must be prepared to say about the Leader of the Opposition's cutbacks to hospitals - $1 billion ripped out of our hospital system. - Thirdly on the member's question, the member should note that we have more assets patrolling our borders than ever before. Of course, the government are committed to patrolling our borders, to keeping our nation safe, to operating a mandatory detention system and to working on a long-term regional protection framework. Not for us are the cheap, three-word slogans of the opposition.

 - I thank the member for Fowler for his question and his ongoing campaigning on this very important public issue. Today, as many know, is White Ribbon Day. It is a day that was created in 1991 by a handful of Canadian men who met on the second anniversary of one man's massacre of 14 women in Montreal, Canada. From that day this event has grown to the point where the United Nations General Assembly has recognised 25 November as a day when we have an opportunity to stop, to reflect and to act against violence against women and girls. Indeed, we do have some work to do. The facts are that there are nearly one in three Australian women who have experienced physical violence and almost one in five women who have been victims of sexual assault. These are damning statistics, they are appalling figures, because they effectively mean that in any one year almost half-a-million women in this country suffer physical or sexual violence. It is an intolerable situation and I am therefore very pleased that the White Ribbon Foundation in Australia is working very hard to create a national awareness of this problem. The foundation is working very hard with community groups and organisations to reduce this problem with a view to hopefully stamping it out.As a part of White Ribbon Day, Australian men are making a public oath to support the campaign and ensure that Australia becomes a safer place for women and girls. Today, in the Senate courtyard, this day was signified by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and members and senators of all political persuasions meeting to make an oath and in some cases reaffirming their commitment 'to not commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women' and to wear a white ribbon as a visual indication of this solemn commitment.The campaign goes from strength to strength. Today we have 1,200 white ribbon ambassadors, many of whom are in this place, but there is a lot more that needs to be done. I also note the efforts of a number of ministers, including the Minister for the Status of Women, who announced today a $1.1 million White Ribbon Workplace program to deliver ambassadors' accreditation and awards in workplaces, where we know violence against women does occur all too prevalently. This government, indeed this parliament, has a zero tolerance approach to all forms of violence. We are working in partnership with women's organisations, state and territory governments, other community groups and law enforcement agencies to reduce violence against women and girls. We are proud to be working alongside the outstanding community organisations that are committed to stamping out violence against women.The government today is calling on Australian men to show leadership in combating violence against women and girls. It is by not speaking out, it is by condoning violent behaviour and it is by turning a blind eye that men let themselves down. They let their communities down. Most importantly, they let down women and girls in this country. In particular, I call upon men in this place to make an oath, if they have not made an oath, and indeed urge all men in their constituencies to do the same.</DOC>
