     Our minerals belong to all Australians, yet much of the profit disappears overseas and the mining boom places burdens on the rest of the economy, where most people live and work.
     My own state of Victoria must compete with the miners for labour and capital, pushing up costs and restraining infrastructure investment.
     Despite this, the mining sector gets a big leg up in your budget on top of their free kick on the mining tax.
     Where is the plan for those sectors of the economy that are doing it tough at the moment because of the mining boom?
     Where is the plan for a sovereign wealth fund that can secure our economy after the boom is over?

     Tasmanian grandmother Dorothy Thurley has been fighting bowel cancer for eight years and is being kept alive by a drug not covered by the PBS.
     Too sick to work, Mrs Thurley has applied for a credit card to help her cover the $60,000 a year cost of buying the drug, even though she is broke from spending $20,000 on another drug, which has stopped working.
     Why on earth are people like Mrs Thurley in such circumstances when we live in one of the richest countries in the world?
     Please, will the government reconsider its decision to pause new PBS listings so that people like Mrs Thurley do not have to take out loans to save their lives?

     Is the Prime Minister aware that in all states, on the 25 per cent of land supposedly owned by first Australians, it is not legally possible to own land?
     There is no provision for the issuance of a title deed.
     In light of the recent death of Eddie Holroyd, the last holder of a title deed issued under the Queensland lands act amendment (Aboriginal), abolished in 1993, could the Prime Minister assure the House that the work of Holroyd, Shortjoe and Edwards, who took Pormpuraaw cattle numbers from 363 to 6,000, will not be in vain and that title deeds, the only pathway to economic development, will be provided?
     Or are our first Australians going to continue to be the only people on earth still deprived of the right to own their own home?

     In eight months not a single action has been taken to restore this lost access.
     This has left 300 kilometres without any safe harbour.
     The federal government's quick and serious commitment in earmarking $950 million for North Queensland has not been matched by the moribund Queensland flood - not cyclone - recovery authority.
     In light of this, could the Prime Minister assure the House that this blatant neglect will be addressed and that the PM will make good the government's much appreciated commitment to essential safe harbour facilities at regular intervals along our major recreational asset, the Great Barrier Reef, its islands and seas?

     Yes.

     No.
