    .
    .
     HMAS Kanimbla was performing `beach landing' exercises off Townsville with the troops from `Ross Island', some of the same troops now on board on their way to the Gulf.
    The mother goes on:Following this exercise the crew of 'Kanimbla' were on standby to go to the Gulf - on stand-by, and this is in September and October - it would appear not to replace one of the two ships 'doing sanctions' but to carry Australian troops from Townsville's `Ross Island' base to Bush's war on Iraq.

     Isn't it the case that the Prime Minister's declaration of interests, lodged on 2 August last year, describes this as a loan for approximately three months and yet he has still got the TV in his lounge room more than six months later with no subsequent amendment to his declaration?
     Given that the cheapest rental deal on these sets from Harvey Norman is $476 per month, hasn't the Prime Minister received an effective gift of nearly $3,000 in value, way in excess of the $500 limit set for all ministers on receiving gifts?

     Prime Minister, do you recall telling Australians, when you were opposition leader, that Medicare has been `an unmitigated disaster', that you wanted to get rid of bulk-billing because it was `an absolute rort' and that you were proposing to `pull Medicare right apart'?
     Does the Prime Minister also recall telling the House on 21 August 1986 that under his plan for Medicare:.
    .
    .
     bulk billing will be abolished except for such people as pensioners who really need it.
    Prime Minister, isn't the government's so-called new plan a re-run of the 1980s to turn Medicare into a second-class safety net for the poor and not a guarantee of quality health for all Australians?

     Minister, are you aware that in December 1999 the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Bruce Scott, advised that a small number of ADF personnel serving in the Gulf War received an anthrax vaccination?
     Wasn't this, in fact, confirmed by Dr Horsley from the Veterans' Affairs Department on 21 February 2001?
     Minister, doesn't the long awaited Gulf War Veterans Health Study released yesterday indicate that nearly 200 Gulf War veterans received anthrax inoculations?
     Minister, given this overwhelming evidence, I ask why, in releasing the Gulf War Veterans Health Study, you claimed:.
    .
    .
     that no personnel serving on ADF operations in the 1991 Gulf War were given anthrax vaccinations.

     Further in the report it states: `There was not the slightest basis for him to have that belief.
    ' - This is a very important question, Mr Speaker, because it relates to a statutory declaration signed by the Governor-General whilst he was in office.
     - The content of that statutory declaration is specifically referred to in the context of the Aspinall report.
     I go to the quotes again as to what the report said, because I want to know what the Prime Minister's comments are in relation to those findings in the report.
     I think that is a legitimate question for this parliament to have asked.

     - In relation to the statutory declaration the report says that there is no evidence that anyone told him that: the parents and Bishop Noble did not, nor did the priest.

     The Prime Minister informed the House that he had `not spoken to Dick Honan on this issue'.
     Did the Prime Minister check with the departmental officer present at his meeting with Mr Honan on 1 August 2002, with the written record of that meeting dated 2 August, or with any of the seven departmental officers that received a copy of that record?
     Why was the Prime Minister able to find 16 letters on the ethanol issue and report those to the parliament on 19 September but was unable to find his departmental record of the 1 August meeting with Dick Honan?

     this morning, which was repeated just a few minutes ago, when he said:The additional letters I wrote related simply to a matter of natural justice and were not intended by me to do anything other than to make that point.
    Isn't it a fact that the minister's letter on 16 January 2003 involved more than the general notion of natural justice and that it specifically asked for costs to be waived against Michael Tuckey - a direct financial benefit for his son - and that it asked for the matter to be relisted for hearing before a magistrate?

     At that time, it was too early to measure the outcomes of tax reform on the cash economy.
     Therefore, at the time of the audit, we were not in a position to comment on whether the compliance dividend had been met or even partially met.

     -  - My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services.
     - We got a unity ticket on that, Pete.
     My question refers to an incident at Tamworth Airport last week where air traffic controllers had to guess the altitude at which a light plane was flying.
     Is the minister aware that the light aircraft and a commercial jet carrying 30 passengers would have crossed midair within minutes if the private plane's pilot had not used a radio to call air traffic control before proceeding to land?
     Given that the government's new airspace management system discourages such calls to air traffic control, why is the minister persisting with a system which the experts say increases the risk of midair collisions?

     As recognition delayed is recognition denied, what steps is the Prime Minister taking to ensure that my constituent's contribution is formally recognised in the same manner as that of other volunteers forthwith?

     - I refer to the claim that Australians' mortgage interest payments have fallen under the Howard government.
     Treasurer - A government member - What sort of fool are you?
     - One that can count - that is your problem!
     -  - Treasurer, wasn't Ross Gittins correct when he said last month - that is, after last month's interest rate increase but before this month's further interest rate increase - of this claim by the government:But can you believe it?
     In that claim you have the quintessence of Howard .
    .
    .
     the carefully crafted statement that, while literally true in some sense -  - Mr Speaker, on the point of order: it is the height of the proper process of accountability in this House to be able to raise with the minister whether a criticism of a statement he has made that has been reported is accurate.
     It seems to me extraordinary if we were to interpret the standing orders to say, `Criticisms of ministers that have never been published are okay, but if somebody ever publishes them you cannot quote them in a question.
    ' That is the logical implication.
     What we have here is a proposition where a respected economics journalist has said that an argument previously put by the Prime Minister and today put by the Treasurer is inaccurate.
     I am merely seeking from the Treasurer confirmation of the accuracy of that quote.
     - Mr Speaker, can I briefly say I was not seeking to reflect; I was seeking to contribute to the debate on the point of order.
     - The quote was - and I begin again:But can you believe it?
