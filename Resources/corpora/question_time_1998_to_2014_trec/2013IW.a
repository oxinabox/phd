                APRA has not specifically assessed the potential impact on ADIs of the carbon pricing mechanism nor has it requested ADIs to undertake their own assessments. APRA generally only assesses the impact of external influences on ADIs where, in APRA's view, there is likely to be a material adverse impact. Given that the carbon pricing mechanism has only been in place for a short period , it is premature to consider whether the carbon pricing mechanism will have a material impact on ADIs' asset quality.

                APRA has not specifically assessed the potential impact on superannuation funds of the carbon pricing mechanism nor has it requested superannuation funds to undertake their own assessments. APRA generally only assesses the impact of external influences on superannuation funds where, in APRA's view, there is likely to be a material adverse impact. Any potential impact on superannuation funds would be mitigated by the generally well-diversified nature of investment portfolios.

                (1) ASIC is already delivering a wide range of consumer and investor education, for example via our MoneySmart website, our printed publications and our outreach work.
                The MoneySmart website aims to help ordinary Australians take steps to improve their personal finances. It offers free, independent guidance so people can make the best choices about their money. The site has around 320 pages of user-friendly content. Topics covered include managing money, borrowing and credit, superannuation and retirement, investing and scams.
                The content for investors includes in particular information on investing basics, financial advice, investment warnings and borrowing to invest, as well as content on various investment products such as managed funds, shares, property and complex investments such as derivatives, exchange traded funds, CFDs and hedge funds.
                MoneySmart also has numerous interactive calculators and tools to help people take control of their finances. The calculators include a budget planner, super calculator, retirement planner and mortgage calculator. 
                The online content is complemented by a number of targeted publications on a range of financial topics such as investing (our 'Investing Between The Flags' booklet), superannuation and credit, which provide essential information, action-oriented tips and contact details for other relevant organisations.
                We also issue a monthly MoneySmart newsletter and regular 'consumer alerts' on topical issues, as well as contributing editorials and articles for magazines issued by e.g. ADF, ASA, ATO and a range of seniors publications.
                (2) Most of ASIC's consumer and investor education activities are part of their business as usual and are already funded from ASIC's general budget.

                 - funding from the Companies Unclaimed Monies Special Account (CUMSA) to develop and build the MoneySmart website ($12.1 million over 3 years); and
                 - funding for the 'Helping Our Kids Understand Finances' initiative, to improve financial literacy in Australian schools by developing professional learning modules and digital resources linked to the Australian Curriculum ($10 million over 3 years).

                There are currently 15 'industry funds' that have defined benefit members. They are referred to as 'hybrid funds' in APRA statistical publications. Hybrid funds are superannuation entities that have a combination of both accumulation and defined benefit members. There are no industry funds that are solely defined benefit.

                (1) The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has service standards in place which publicly state its service commitment to the community. The service standards for processing individual and business income tax returns do not differentiate between returns where a refund is due or the taxpayer will need to pay.
                The standards are shown in table 1, along with the ATO's performance against those standards for the past three years.
 Performance against tax return lodgment service standards 2009-10 to 2011-12
                (2) As shown in table 1 above, the ATO has significantly improved its performance for the individual electronic tax return service standard in 2011-12 compared to prior years. Individual electronic tax returns account for over 75% of all tax return lodgments. Combined, individual and non-individual electronic tax returns account for over 90% of all tax return lodgments. 
                In the 2011-12 year, the ATO redirected resources into improving outcomes for the majority of individuals whose returns are lodged electronically, resulting in the improved performance. At the same time, the ATO continues to exceed its service standard benchmarks for both individual and non-individual paper lodgements.
                (3) The Commissioner of Taxation has the responsibility of administering the taxation laws. He advised that for 2011-12, the ATO met the service commitment on 3 of the 4 service standards. The standard that the ATO did not meet was electronic tax returns for individuals within 14 days, which for 2011-12 was 91% against a benchmark of 94%. We achieved 94% in 17 days.
                The ATO is focused on releasing legitimate refund claims in a timely manner and pays interest on refunds delayed beyond prescribed periods and on credit amendments.
                Delays to tax return refunds can occur for several reasons including incomplete or incorrect information requiring the ATO to request additional information, cross checking of data with another Government agency and pre-issue compliance reviews.
                In relation to delays caused by compliance activity, the ATO, prior to issuing income tax refunds, uses specialist technology to analyse individual income tax returns to detect potential over claiming or fraudulent activity. In 2011-12 (to 30 June 2012), over 109,000 income tax returns were stopped for potential over claiming or fraud with around 80,000 of these requiring a full review resulting in the protection of over $200 million of revenue.

                continuing to provide updates to professional associations regarding the progress of tax return refunds and listening to concerns raised on behalf of tax agents
                refining risk models to reduce the number of refunds stopped and subsequently released without adjustment
                improving our practices to more efficiently review held returns in a timely manner; and
                communicating our processes and progress including notifying the taxpayer within 12 to 14 days after lodgment that their return has been held for review and when they can expect further contact from the ATO.

                Since 1 July 2009, the Attorney-General's Department has published grant details on its website. Previously, grants details were published by the Department of Finance and Deregulation.
                Each year, the Department publishes over 1,200 individual grants on its grants register. The register includes the value of each grant. For some programs the published value of the grant represents an estimate and the actual amount paid may be different. The Department's annual reports also provide annual expenditure information for each of its grant programs.
                To provide further information in response the questions asked would require an unreasonable diversion of resources, particularly in that the questions cover a five-year period.

                The Australian Government is investing over $3.4 billion to upgrade the interstate freight network, including the rail line between Sydney and Melbourne. Overall, we have increased funding in rail tenfold compared to the then Federal Coalition Government.
                This investment is supporting the Australian Rail Track Corporation (ARTC) in performing a significant upgrade to the Sydney to Melbourne line by replacing the deteriorated life-expired wooden sleepers with concrete sleepers. This was a vital first step to improve safety and reliability of the line. The ARTC is also investing $134 million on a ballast rehabilitation program to address long standing drainage problems.
                ARTC is liaising with V/Line and CountryLink to put in place arrangements for affected passenger services.

                (a) There have not been any recent changes to the Financial Assistance Grants legislation. 
                The amount of Financial Assistance Grants available from year to year is set by Commonwealth legislation, the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995. At the end of the financial year, the Treasurer makes a determination of the final factor for that year and the estimated factor for the following year. The final factor is calculated on estimated Australian population figures, supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and the March Consumer Price Index. The difference between the estimated and final factors for the current year can result in a positive or negative adjustment on the following year's allocation. Adjustments happen every year, some are positive and some are negative. A negative adjustment occurred this year. The previous negative adjustment happened in 2009-10.
                (b). Yes. 
                The negative adjustment this year was $52.9 million. This was due to a reduction in the CPI figures as well as a downwards adjustment of Australia's population estimates after the 2012-13 Budget was delivered. The population adjustments were a result of more accurate counting methods used in the 2011 Census. 
                Local governments are receiving their legal entitlement under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995.Local governments received $2.74 billion in 2011-12, including the $52.9 million overpayment as outlined above, and $1.117 billion in accelerated payments brought forward from 2012-13 to assist local governments to manage the ongoing impact of the natural disasters in 2010-11 and other pressures.

 Report from the Inquiry into RAAF F-111 Deseal/Reseal workers and their families' tabled in June 2009. The Government also announced a funding package of $55m over four years to implement these 14 recommendations. 
                Of the 14 recommendations accepted by Government, 10 were the responsibility of the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA), three were the responsibility of the Department of Defence (Defence) and one was a joint responsibility. 
                DVA has implemented all 10 of the recommendations for which it was responsible and the joint responsibility (an F-111 specific website). 
                DVA has ongoing work in processing claims for compensation and health care, and delivering F-111 client specific group lifestyle courses through the Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service.
                The Department of Defence has implemented one recommendation (number 14) and has made much progress with the other two (17 and 18). These two are to strengthen Defence's occupational medicine capability (17); and to conduct a further research of the underlying cause of health conditions associated with F-111 fuel tank maintenance work (18). For the latter, the Jet Fuel Exposure Syndrome Study, launched in December 2010, is a multi-year study that is underway.

                    The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows

                The Australian Government faced ongoing challenges in identifying orphanages in which Australia could have trust and confidence. The growing numbers of non-government adoption agencies operating in Ethiopia, and the closure of orphanages due to greater government scrutiny, led to increased competition for referrals of children to intercountry adoption programs. My Department found that a competitive environment such as this is not always conducive to ethical adoption practices. 
                The Program received stronger demands for community development projects to be delivered in the region from which children would be referred, making it increasingly difficult for the Australian Government to ensure such assistance would be delivered in a way that maintained an appropriate separation between the Program and children referred to it for intercountry adoption (in order to avoid the unintentional effect of encouraging communities to relinquish children for adoption). 
                The Program's funds were limited to fees paid by prospective adoptive parents, and the ongoing financial viability of the Program depended on a regular and foreseeable referral of children to generate these fees. Such referrals could not be guaranteed in the current Ethiopian adoption environment.
                Rising costs for Program essentials (such as food and accommodation) in the 18 months prior to the closure meant that the Program could not continue to meet operational costs without significantly increasing fees for prospective adoptive parents. Even with an increase in fees, it was unlikely the Program would be viable into the future given Ethiopia's current inflation rates (approximately 20 - 40%).
                The Program's adoption service provider, Wide Horizons For Children, advised that, in light of changing circumstances in Ethiopia, it had decided to partially reallocate its resources and focus from adoptions to its humanitarian activities in Ethiopia. As a result, the Program and Wide Horizons For Children agreed to end their arrangement. Wide Horizons For Children provided essential ancillary and support services to the Program, including background checking and transition house facilities. Replacing Wide Horizons For Children or restructuring the Program would have required considerable expenditure of Government funds and resources which was not defensible in view of the other issues that would continue to affect the long-term viability of the Program.
 
                The continued strained relationship between the Australian Representative and the Program's service provider, Wide Horizons For Children.
                The difficulty in engaging the relevant Ethiopian Authorities, despite best efforts, to discuss updates to the bilateral arrangement underpinning the Program's operation in Ethiopia.
                The emphasis placed by federal and regional level Ethiopian government departments on the importance of receiving development assistance from the Program. 
                The difficulty in identifying orphanages in which the Australian Government could have trust and confidence. The delegation faced pressure from many orphanage directors it met with to provide additional aid when forming orphanage relationships. The delegation was concerned by the escalating requests from the Director of the Program's then Partner Orphanage for orphanage support payments and 'facilitation allowances'. 
                (c) At the time of the Program's closure, there were 27 files that had been approved and sent to Ethiopia for matching. My Department does not have information about how many approved applications were in Australia waiting to be sent to Ethiopia; state and territory Central Authorities are responsible for processing and approving individual adoption applications. 
                (d) In my media release announcing the closure of the Program on 28 June 2012, I noted that the Australian Government and its State and Territory counterparts would provide what support we could. As at 24 December 2012, my Department has refunded fees paid directly to the Program by affected applicants as expeditiously as possible, with all but two complete. My Department is waiting on the affected applicants to provide the necessary information to process the remaining refunds. 
                My Department also continues to receive a high level of correspondence on this issue, and, where appropriate, seeks to provide additional information to correspondents about the Program's closure. Other support, such as counselling and consideration of other options for affected families, including discussion of other intercountry adoption programs or domestic care options, is being facilitated by state and territory Central Authorities. 
                (e) The Australian Government assumed responsibility for the management of the Program on 1 July 2007. There was no specific budget for the management of the Program. Departmental staffing and travel costs funded by the Department as part of its management of the Program were met by the broader Departmental budget. It is not possible to provide an accurate amount of staffing and related costs for the Program as the level of staffing devoted to the Program varied over time. Since 2007, there have been eight delegation visits to Ethiopia, at a total cost (for travel and related expenses) of $226,456. Departmental funds have also been used to meet various costs associated with the Program's closure, including refunds of Program fees to affected applicants and a payment to the Program's Service Provider in settlement of invoices for services rendered (AU$194,325.40 in total to 24 December 2012). 
                Fees paid by prospective adoptive parents directly to the Program met fixed and variable running costs incurred in the Program's daily operation and in facilitating each individual adoption. 
                (f) Not specifically about the Program's closure. However, my Department provided the intercountry adoption community with regular updates concerning the Program, including meeting with representatives of prospective adoptive parents and providing updates through its website. In statements on my Department's website, the Program was referred to as 'consistently [being] Australia's most complex and challenging program' and it was often noted, with announcements of delegation visits, that the delegation would assess the ongoing ethics and viability of the Program.

                (a) From 1 July 2011 to 30 September 2012, 203 clients who arrived on either a Working Holiday (subclass 417) or Higher Education Section (subclass 573) visa have been removed from Australia. 
                (i) All 203 clients listed above had their removal costs paid by the Australian Government. 
                (ii) The cost of a removal depends on a wide range of factors including the destination and commercial airfare costs, whether security or other escorts are required (including their airfares, accommodation and allowances). The average cost for removal has consistently remained in the vicinity of $4 000 per client over recent program years. 
                (b) The Department is unable to respond to this question as departmental systems do not record whether a client had travel arrangements in place prior to their removal being effected.

                The regulations that dictated the requirements for security clearances in 2007 was the Protective Security Manual (PSM). At this time the security vetting function for Customs and Border Protection was conducted within the agency. The periodic review of clearances occurred as directed by the PSM or more frequently as information was obtained through a 'change of circumstances' of the employee or intelligence provided by an investigation that may have led to a 'review for cause' which is a review of a candidates suitability to hold a security clearance and access to security classified information. 
                Based on the position's duties and requirement to access classified information, the vast majority of staff within the Sydney Airport environment would require a PROTECTED security clearance. This level of security clearance required review after 10 years.
                The timeframes for periodic review of security clearances is provided in the table below.
                 
                The Australian Government announced on 1 December 2009 that Commonwealth security vetting processes would be centralised to the Department of Defence. This central vetting unit is known as the Australian Government Security Vetting Agency (AGSVA). The AGSVA, operational from October 2010, began conducting security vetting for all Commonwealth agencies (apart from exempt agencies). Clearances granted by the AGSVA have whole-of-government effect. 
                With the introduction of the AGSVA the clearance level of PROTECTED altered to BASELINE and this level now requires review after 15 years. The regulations that dictate the requirements for security clearances is now the Protective Security Policy Framework. 
                Customs and Border Protection has also introduced an agency specific pre-employment check; the 'Organisational Suitability Assessment' (OSA). The OSA is undertaken every 5 years or when individual circumstances alter or an individual is brought to the attention of the Integrity and Professional Standards Branch. This level of scrutiny includes specific checks relevant to the law enforcement environments. These checks were previously undertaken during the security clearance process, within the agency, as the 'fit and proper' component.

                (a) In 2008-09, the Investigations Branch of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs and Border Protection) received 141 referrals involving the alleged illegal importation of firearms and firearm parts. Of these referrals, three cases led to court proceedings, two of which resulted in convictions being recorded. In the remaining case, the offence was proven, but s19B of the Crimes Act 1914 was applied and no conviction was recorded.
                (b) In 2009-10, the Investigations Branch of Customs and Border Protection received 118 referrals involving the alleged illegal importation of firearms and firearm parts. Of these referrals, eight cases led to court proceedings, five of which resulted in convictions being recorded. In the remaining three cases, the offences were proven, but s19B of the Crimes Act 1914 was applied and no convictions were recorded.
                (c) In 2010-11, the Investigations Branch of Customs and Border Protection received 74 referrals involving the alleged illegal importation of firearms and firearm parts. Of these referrals, three cases led to court proceedings, two of which resulted in convictions being recorded. In the remaining case, the offence was proven, but s19B of the Crimes Act 1914 was applied and no conviction was recorded. 
                (d) In 2011-12 the Investigations Branch of Customs and Border Protection received 137 referrals involving the alleged illegal importation of firearms and firearm parts. Of these referrals, one matter is currently before the courts and other investigations are ongoing.
                These statistics relate to both civil and criminal prosecutions and cover the importation of firearms and firearm parts such as barrels, silencers, stocks and ammunition. Referrals not accepted by the Investigations Branch of Customs and Border Protection all undergo compliance or enforcement action, either by the originating area, another area within the agency, or a separate agency with the capability to take appropriate action. Regardless of other enforcement outcomes, all firearms and firearms parts detected that are prohibited imports are seized at the border, unless the importer is able to provide a valid import permit.
                It is worth noting that a decision to refer a matter for prosecution is made in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth. Where a matter is not prosecuted, there are a range of other actions that can be taken depending on the particular circumstances of the case at hand. These actions include; seizing the item and issuing a warning letter, initiating further audit activity, and issuing an infringement notice under the infringement notice scheme.

                Staffing
                Between 2007 and 2010, staffing increased from 5 to 45 and in December 2009, the Internal Affairs area changed its Branch title to Integrity and Professional Standards (I&amp;PS) to reflect the broader role encompassing fraud control and corruption prevention.
                All staff as a minimum possess a Certificate IV in Government (Investigations) or Certificate IV in Personnel Security or similar qualifications.
                Case Management System
                2009  -  Implementation of a Case Management System  -  CRIMEIA  -  to capture all allegations and complaints and to case manage all I&amp;PS investigations, intelligence and incidents and to record critical decisions.
                2012  -  CRIMEIA  -  Single database implemented for Case management across both Criminal and Administrative (Code of Conduct) cases within the agency.
                Intelligence Capability
                An Intelligence capability was established in 2009. The Intelligence area has grown in strength from one Intelligence Analyst to four Analysts. The intelligence area undertakes intelligence activities into allegations of criminality or serious misconduct made against Customs and Border Protection employees and conducts strategic intelligence assessments aimed at identifying trends of corrupt or serious misconduct.
                Integrity Risk Capability
                The Integrity Risk area is staffed by six officers to deliver Corruption Prevention including the development of formal Fraud Control and Corruption Prevention Plans and education and training of all Customs and Border Protection employees.
                December 2007 - Fraud Control responsibilities transferred to Integrity and Professional Standards Branch.
                Two Fraud Control and Corruption Prevention Plans have been developed
                o Fraud Control Plan 2008  -  2010; and
                o Fraud Control and Corruption Prevention Plan 2010  -  2012.
                Fraud Control and Corruption Prevention Plan 2012-2014 in development stage  -  to be completed by November 2012.
                Rolling program of integrity risk assessments provides assurance around the appropriate management of a broad range of integrity risks including the 'single point of failure' work.
                Fraud Control and Corruption Awareness Training  -  Nationwide refresher and induction training program  -  delivered to approximately 3000 staff from January 2010 to June 2012 including information about the role of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity.
                Commenced in 2012 a program of briefings for officers at all security clearance levels, travelling overseas on official business, to raise awareness on corruption and security risks relevant to the country(s) being visited.
                A mandatory online training program was developed for all staff covering security awareness (current program) and fraud control/ corruption awareness is to commence in November 2012.
                Integrity awareness campaigns and dissemination of Z Cards  -  initially rolled out in 2009 and updated in 2011 the campaigns provide an awareness to all staff of the multiple channels for incident reporting.
                Ethics and Integrity Handbook updated and made available to all staff both online and via individual hardcopies outlining the standards of behaviours and ethical conduct for Customs and Border Protection employees.
                Pre-Employment Clearances
                Implemented from October 2010
                Security Clearance Vetting Process transferred to Australian Government Security Vetting Agency (AGSVA) which assesses an applicant's ability to acquire a whole-of-government security clearance. All Customs and Border Protection officers must hold the minimum PROTECTED clearance.
                Improvements to Organisational Suitability Assessments (OSA)  -  OSA complements the AGSVA process by conducting additional agency specific checks to assess an applicant's suitability to operate in the Customs and Border Protection environment (eg probity checks against law enforcement and intelligence databases).
                Post-Employment Clearance Reviews
                Additional rigour surrounding
                o Change of circumstances  -  requirement for staff to report circumstances of potential concern (eg associations; gambling; financial changes; relationship changes).
                o Contact reporting  -  requirement for staff to report interaction with high risk persons (eg foreign intelligence officials; criminals etc).
                o Risk based reviews of OSA and/ or security clearance on occurrence of specific events (eg  -  critical incident; receipt of adverse intelligence etc).
                o Security Investigations  -  initiated to investigate security breaches.

                I&amp;PS has representation on the 'Community of Practice' with ACLEI, AFP and ACC.
                New Measures
                The Government has introduced legislation to implement a range of measures designed to enhance the corruption resistance of Customs and Border Protection and other Commonwealth agencies. 
                  On 30 March 2012, I announced that the Federal Government will introduce legislation to conduct targeted integrity tests on Commonwealth officers suspected of corruption.
                  This includes officers from the Australian Federal Police (AFP), the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) and Customs and Border Protection. 
                  Integrity tests are observed covert simulations designed to test whether a public official will respond to a situation in a manner that is illegal or would contravene an agency
                  '
                  s standard of integrity.

                  A covert operative handing a wallet containing cash to officers and observing that correct handling protocols are observed;
                  Leaving valuable goods at a simulated crime scene or suspected shipping container to test whether an officer steals the item;
                  A covert operative offering a Commonwealth officer a bribe; and
                  Putting false information in a database to catch a person suspected of unlawfully disclosing information.
                  Under the legislation the ACLEI and agencies including the AFP, Customs and Border Protection and the ACC will have the power to conduct targeted integrity testing.
                  The Integrity Commissioner, the head of the agency and/
                   
                  or delegated SES will be responsible for authorising integrity tests.
                  The Integrity Commissioner will be made aware of all integrity tests being undertaken by agencies, and thereby have visibility of the operation of the integrity testing system.
                  Oversight of any use of covert police powers will be provided by the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Law Enforcement.
                  Employee representatives are also being consulted on the development of the system to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.

                  coercive powers to gather information through hearings and notices;

                Customs and Border Protection firearms statistics are referred to in terms of undeclared detections and seizures.
                An imported firearm is considered an undeclared detection and detained at the border when it has been detected and identified by Customs and Border Protection as a prohibited or restricted firearm, AND where it has not been declared to Customs and Border Protection in accordance with the import requirements.
                Seizures occur when the detained firearms have failed, or will fail, to meet import requirements. 
                Many are subsequently released after the importer has been given the opportunity to meet import requirements (eg. obtaining relevant import permits).
 Undeclared detections / seizures / releases of non-air, conventional firearms, parts and accessories, and magazines
                 
 All figures are correct as of the date each respective yearly report was produced.

                (a) In 2008-09, the Investigations Branch of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs and Border Protection) initiated 42 investigations cases involving the alleged illegal importation of firearms and firearm parts. Of these cases, three led to court proceedings. All court proceedings produced successful prosecutions, of which one resulted in a criminal conviction being recorded.
                (b) In 2009-10, the Investigations Branch of Customs and Border Protection initiated 30 investigations cases involving the alleged illegal importation of firearms and firearm parts. Of these cases, eight led to court proceedings. All court proceedings produced successful prosecutions, of which one resulted in a criminal conviction being recorded.
                (c) In 2010-11, the Investigations Branch of Customs and Border Protection initiated 23 investigations cases involving the alleged illegal importation of firearms and firearm parts. Of these cases, three led to court proceedings. All court proceedings produced successful prosecutions, of which one resulted in a criminal conviction. 
                (d) In 2011-12, the Investigations Branch of Customs and Border Protection initiated 38 investigations cases involving the alleged illegal importation of firearms and firearm parts. One of these cases is currently before the courts. Investigations in relation to the remaining cases are ongoing.
                Investigations undertaken by the Investigations Branch of Customs and Border Protection are all managed to an appropriate conclusion. Regardless of other enforcement outcomes, including whether or not prosecution is undertaken, all firearms and firearms parts detected that are prohibited imports are seized at the border, unless the importer is able to provide a valid import permit.

                When Customs and Border Protection detects drugs at the border they are referred to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for further action. 
                Under the Crimes Act 1914, the AFP must submit a report to the Minister of Home Affairs and Justice, setting out the details required by subsections 15HM(2), (2A), (2B) and (2C) in relation to controlled operations for which the agency was the authorising agency during the previous 12 months. The data the AFP submits for this report does not distinguish between controlled operations conducted as a result of drug seizures made by Customs and Border Protection, and as such the AFP would be unable to provide figures to answer this query.

                Customs and Border Protection does not undertake controlled actions with regards to drug seizures. (See response to QoN1044). 
                The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) who undertake prosecution action in these matters advise they do not keep statistics on whether controlled actions were involved in the cases being prosecuted.

                16 May 2008. 
                The Integrated Cargo System (ICS) is primarily used by importers and the cargo industry reporting to Customs and Border Protection the movement of cargo across the border. Because of this primary role, the cargo industry needs to have a degree of access to the information held on ICS about cargo of direct interest to them. As such, limiting access beyond a certain point is not feasible as it would have a detrimental effect on the movement of trade.

 
                  o
                  Authentication (knowing who the message is from);
                  o
                  Integrity (knowing it has not been tampered with);
                  o
                  Non-repudiation (knowing that the sender cannot deny having sent it); and
                  o
                  Confidentiality (knowing that no unauthorised reading has occurred).
                  Customs and Border Protection is able to identify individual users as they access ICS and specifically the ICS screens and information viewed.
                  On 9 May 2012, a change was introduced into the ICS that limits access to specific cargo information to those in the cargo industry who have reported a direct and legitimate interest in the movement and clearance of cargo.
                  On 23
                  September 2012, the ICS logon screen was updated to include a warning about the penalties for misusing of the information in the system. Users need to accept this message before proceeding to log in.

                A review into functional access controls within the Integrated Cargo System (ICS). The focus of the review is the access controls delivered by the ICS application that limit or restrict the functions available to an authorised user of the ICS. 
                A risk-based review of the audit and monitoring capabilities of the ICS is in progress. The objective of the review is to improve the timely detection of fraudulent or inappropriate use of Customs and Border Protection systems using automated tools.

                (a) (i) The Port Botany Examination facility is located outside the Port precinct proper and therefore truck movements to and from the facility from the wharves can be observed from public roads and other public areas. The 'hard stand' (concrete) area of the facility can be observed from neighbouring premises. Customs and Border Protection takes necessary precautions to protect the integrity of its operations and all examinations are conducted inside the Examination Hall. 
                   (ii) Yes, concerns have been raised with Customs and Border Protection.
                   (iii) Yes, the Minister's Office has been briefed on action being undertaken by law enforcement agencies that are part of Taskforce Polaris to address these concerns. 
                (b) (i) Contracted labour is used to perform manual unpacking and repacking of sea cargo containers at examination facilities in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Fremantle, Adelaide, Darwin, Townsville and Newcastle. All contracted labour are required to undergo a baseline security clearance and are supervised while working at facilities. 
                   (ii) Yes, concerns have been raised with Customs and Border Protection. 
                   (iii) Yes, the Minister's Office has been briefed on action being undertaken by law enforcement agencies that are part of Taskforce Polaris to address these concerns.

                (a) It is not apparent that the Full Bench of FWA decision in Kaizen Hospitals (Essendon) Pty Ltd; Kaizen Hospitals (Malvern) Pty Ltd; Kaizen Hospitals (Mount District) Pty Ltd v Australian Nursing Federation [2012] FWAFB 8866; and the recent decision of Hamilton DP in Australian Nursing Federation [2012] FWA 9905 on 20 December 2012 have any wider ramifications. These cases were decided on the basis of their highly unusual facts and are consistent with the policy that a bargaining representative for an enterprise agreement must be validly appointed. 
                (b) It is not possible to answer this question without knowing the details of any arrangements that may have been made and considering how those arrangements may interact with any applicable industrial instrument. 
                However, in general terms, individual flexibility arrangements (IFAs) made under an enterprise agreement operate as a term of the relevant enterprise agreement. Terms of an enterprise agreement only have effect whilst the instrument is in operation. 
                (c) &amp; d)

                an employer must appoint its bargaining representative in writing (s 176(1) (d) of the Act);
                an employer must provide an employee bargaining representative with a copy of the instrument of appointment of its bargaining representative if the employee bargaining representative requests it (s 178(2) (b) of the Act);
                the Rules require employers and employee bargaining representatives to file statutory declarations in support of the applications for enterprise agreement approvals, in which they must attest that all statements in the declaration are true in every particular; and
                if one party considers that the other is not acting in good faith, they can apply to the Fair Work Commission for a good faith bargaining order under s 229 of the Act.
                The Government is committed to strengthening protections for employees during the bargaining process. For instance, the Fair Work Amendment Act 2012 inserted new subsections 174(1A) and 174(1B) into the FW Act to provide that a notice of employee representational rights can only contain the content prescribed by the Fair Work Regulations 2009 (the Regulations), must not contain any other content and must be in the form prescribed by the Regulations. 
                As noted by the Full Bench, the circumstances in this case were very unusual and the Government does not consider that the circumstances warrant legislative reform.

                (a) The Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) public summary document is available on the MSAC website (www.msac.gov.au). Section 12 of this document explains the consideration and rationale for MSAC's advice. This consideration included Medicare Benefits Schedule items 50124, 50125, 55848 and 55850. 
                (b) The number of claims by each medical specialty, including GPs, Rheumatologists and Radiologists, for each of the item numbers for each year considered by MSAC in their assessment. 
                 
                For composition of specialty groups (in terms of peer groups) see page 4.
                 
                (c) The number of referrals per annum to Radiologists for joint injection services from Rheumatologists, GPs and Other Specialists respectively for each year considered by MSAC in its assessment 
                The MSAC Review analysed data for MBS items 55848 and 55850 for the calendar years 2006 to 2011. The items are not specific to joint injections and are also used to treat other medical conditions.
                 
                (d) The number of claims by medical specialty per annum for MBS item numbers 50124 and 50125 for the years (i) 2006-07, (ii) 2007-08, (iii) 2008-09 and (iv) 2009-10.

                (1) The visa grant notice issued to successful applicants for permanent visas outlines the initial entry expiry date, the travel facility (multiple entry), and the 'must not arrive after' date. It also states that the permanent visa holder is able to remain in Australia indefinitely. Permanent visa holders are also generally given information in that notice about their ability to travel out of and into Australia until their specific 'must not arrive after' date (five years from the date of grant of the permanent visa), and the need to apply for an RRV should they wish to travel internationally and re-enter Australia after that date.

 www.immi.gov.au/e_visa/vevo.htm 
                (4) There are two Resident Return visa (RRV) related system prompts used at the border for departures. These prompts appear on a Customs and Border Protection officer's screen when the travel component of a passenger's permanent visa has expired or will expire within 14 days. The Customs and Border Protection officers are trained to advise the passenger that the travel component of the visa has expired, or will be expiring, and that they must hold a valid RRV before returning to Australia. They are also asked to advise the passenger that they may be unable to board their return flight if they do not have a valid RRV. Where a passenger requires further information they are referred to an officer of the department.

                (a) Attempting to answer this question fully would cause an unreasonable diversion of resources due to the very broad nature of the question and the fact that the relevant information would need to be extracted and collated from multiple sources  -  including paper-based  -  over the time period in question.
                Therefore, the scope of the answer has been narrowed to cover the amount spent on international advisers and consultants funded from AusAID's bilateral program of development assistance to Vietnam during the period from January 2011 to June 2012 inclusive, drawing on the three six-monthly adviser stocktake reports AusAID has published to date, and according to the definition of advisers set out in the ARF, including both remuneration and support costs. This information is provided in the table below.
                (b) Refer to (a).
                (c) Refer to (a).
                (d) Refer to (a).

                venous thromboembolism post major orthopedic surgery.
                (b) No, the Department of Health and Ageing does not hold tables of medicines reimbursed in other countries. It should be noted, that as all health systems are different, it is difficult to make direct comparisons of why a drug might be listed first (if at all) in one country versus another. A country's pharmaceutical reimbursement policies cannot be assessed in isolation from its overall health and industry pricing and policy objectives.

                I am aware that there have been calls from some in the Deaf community for access to emergency services to be available by Short Message Service (SMS). I understand that currently, people who are deaf, hearing and/or speech impaired who use text based communication can access emergency services via the National Relay Service (NRS) using a teletypewriter (TTY) to connect to 106, or using internet relay to connect to Triple Zero. 
                On 8 February 2013, I issued a media release announcing that the Government had delivered an improved NRS, including mobile text-based access to emergency services for people who are deaf, hearing-impaired and/or speech-impaired. New contracts have been signed with existing providers Australian Communication Exchange and WestWood Spice to deliver a new and improved NRS from 1 July 2013. 
                One of the new services to be implemented progressively in the second half of 2013 will be SMS Relay which will allow access to Triple Zero via text to the NRS for people who are deaf, or who are hearing-impaired and/or speech impaired. Some of the new services, including SMS Relay, require regulatory change and I have directed my department to immediately begin work on these changes and engage with the disability sector in their development. 
                The new contracts have achieved the Government's objective of ensuring that existing NRS services are maintained, and that new services are introduced that enhance the NRS for the deaf, hearing-impaired and/or speech-impaired communities.

                dabigatran derives its advantage over current available anticoagulants such as warfarin when warfarin is used sub-optimally;
                that the benefit of dabigatran observed in the clinical trial may or may not be reflected in the Australian population; and
                the opportunity cost to the Commonwealth of listing dabigatran would be significant ($1 billion over the forward estimates).
                In response to these comments, the Government commissioned Emeritus Professor Lloyd Sansom AO to conduct a review of Anticoagulation Therapies in Atrial Fibrillation. 
                The review found that awareness of atrial fibrillation should be increased, and that national guidelines and an education campaign for the detection and management of atrial fibrillation should be developed. Further, the review found that patients would benefit greatly if the use of existing therapies such as warfarin was better managed and supported.
                The review also concluded that the net benefit of the new oral anticoagulation therapies in clinical practice and the subsequent impact on cost-effectiveness is uncertain at this stage and the PBAC should review its March 2011 advice to list dabigatran on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule (PBS).
                On 13 December 2012 the PBAC advised that it was of a mind to rescind its March 2011 recommendation for dabigatran to be listed on the PBS citing that more work was needed before it could be listed.
                (b) PBAC considered a re-submission for dabigatran (Pradaxa®) at its meeting of 13 - 15 March 2013. The outcomes of this meeting will be publicly available on 26 April 2013. 
                Any further Government consideration of the matter would depend on the outcomes of the PBAC meeting (including the full context of any advice provided by the PBAC to Government) and subsequent pricing negotiations between sponsors and the Department of Health and Ageing. 
                The Government will not make any decision on the PBS listing of dabigatran until after receiving final advice from the PBAC.

                (1) NBN Co no longer intends to proceed with plans to erect a tower at Rock Forest as it was unable to identify a suitable location that would provide adequate coverage. 
                (2) NBN Co undertook a process of site assessment which required it to consult with relevant landholders. It had also consulted with Bathurst Regional Council about its plans, and has informed the Council of its decision not to proceed. NBN Co had not commenced formal community consultations at the time it decided to discontinue its plans.
                (3) These NBN Co wireless facilities will be used to provide services to customers outside the Bathurst fibre footprint.
                (4) NBN Co is seeking to deploy its fixed wireless network using a combination of existing infrastructure and new radiocommunications sites in order to meet the necessary coverage and performance objectives required to service these communities. Based on NBN Co's current plans, which are subject to planning requirements and other processes, there are a total of 11 planned sites in the Bathurst Local Government Area of which eight are expected to involve new towers. 
                (5) NBN Co has not yet included Bathurst in its three year fibre rollout plans. The three year rollout plan will be updated in March each year. These updates will be published on NBN Co's website - www.nbnco.com.au/rollout/. 
                Bathurst is on a list of NSW and ACT cities and towns that are expected to obtain fibre - www.nbnco.com.au/assets/documents/nbn-nsw-and-act-list.pdf.
                As part of its deployment in new developments, NBN Co is already offering services on fibre in stages 11 and 12 of the Avonlea/Llanarth Estate at Abercrombie. It has commenced construction of fibre in Stage 1 of Marsden Heights Estate and stage 900 of Windradyne Estate.
                Those remaining customers not serviced by fibre will be serviced either by next generation wireless or satellite.

                On 28 November the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Stephen Conroy announced that an inquiry would be held to identify what lessons can be learnt from the Warrnambool Telstra exchange fire that left more than 60,000 residents without fixed line telecommunications services. 
                The inquiry is being conducted by the Department of Broadband, Communications, and the Digital Economy. Further details about the inquiry including its Terms of Reference and public consultation process can be found on its website www.dbcde.gov.au/warrnambool_inquiry.
                It would be premature to comment on the potential outcomes of the inquiry before it has completed its investigations.

                NBN Co Limited (NBN Co) noted in its 2012-15 Corporate Plan (pg. 28) that is has created Business Continuity, Crisis Management and Disaster Recovery Plans that will enable it to continue operations in the event of a material business disruption, whilst also ensuring that it can continue to meet financial and service obligations to stakeholders. 

                Undertaking a Disruption Risk Assessment  -  i.e. to determine and evaluate the types of disruptions that could impact operations and to evaluate the risk level; 
                Production of a Business Impact Analysis, which details the impact on critical business processes across NBN Co, evaluating the risk level, and the subsequent priority and resources required to resume operations;
                Creating Plans, which document response strategies, resource requirements and contact lists; and 
                Plans are then tested or rehearsed to ensure their effectiveness.
                Risk is factored into the plans by linking with NBN Co's Enterprise-wide Risk Management Framework, with the risk appetite level being set by the Board of Directors and Executive Committee.

                I have been advised that Telstra has decided to discontinue its Telecard Service because the supplier which supports this platform will no longer be supporting and maintaining the system.
                In November 2012, Telstra wrote to its existing Telecard customers announcing its decision to discontinue the service from 2 September 2013. It also advised customers that they could continue to use their Telecard, both in Australia and overseas until that date.

                a Telstra Pre or Post-Paid mobile service which is capable of international roaming (where needed) and a handset can be used overseas.
                aPre-Paid PhoneAway service which allows customers to dial a special access number to then make calls within, or back to, Australia.
                aAustralia Direct Reverse charge where customers call a toll-free number and can then make a reverse charge call to any Telstra number in Australia.
                Local calling cards which are widely available in most overseas countries.
                Telstra made the announcement of their decision early to give Telecard customers ample time to consider and move to their best alternative solution.

                (a) Resource flows to developing countries reported as either ODA or Other Official Flows are in accordance with the Statistical Reporting Directives issued by the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). As needed, AusAID provides assistance to agencies to help their understanding of ODA eligibility and reporting requirements.
                (b) AusAID (and predecessors) have been collecting information on resource flows from Australian Government agencies since the beginning of the 1960s, according to protocols issued by the OECD DAC. 
                (c) The protocols are applied to each survey return, that is twice each year for all government departments and agencies. 
                (d) Australian Government departments and agencies report assistance expenditure for developing countries to AusAID via a six-monthly survey. Responses to the survey are signed off by the agency's Chief Financial Officer and are checked and verified by AusAID against the reporting directives. AusAID determines whether the spending constitutes ODA or Other Official Flows.

The incorrect reporting applied to their Afghanistan operations only. Defence were requested to provide formal notification of the revisions, certified by their Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The certified notification was received 2 November 2012. There have been no other formal notifications of other Government Departments incorrectly reporting ODA. 
                (i). The OECD was notified that historical expenditure by the Australian Department of Defence had been revised and had implications for Australian ODA to Afghanistan.
                (iii) Defence reported aid expenditure at the broader level and did not submit detailed accounts of their expenditure to AusAID. Survey returns were receipted with a signed letter by the Defence CFO stating that transactions are reported accordingly to the ODA guidelines. These arrangements are no longer in place. Defence now provide lower level disaggregation as part of their six-monthly survey returns.

                  The business of all Disability Employment Services  -  Employment Support Service providers with a Star rating or 3 or below was subject to open tender. Progressive Employment Personnel received a 3 Star rating and was therefore invited to demonstrate its capacity through the tender. 
                The outcomes of the DES tender process are the result of an independent purchasing process undertaken by the Department of Education, Employment Relations and Workplace Relations (the Department) under strict probity arrangements. In awarding tenders, the Department took into account each organisation's demonstrated understanding of disability employment services and the most effective ways to meet the needs of job seekers with disability; past performance; management, governance and value for money; local community links and partnerships; and strategies to meet the needs of local employers and job seekers. All decisions were subject to a 12-step checking process. Unfortunately, Progressive Employment Personnel Inc. Hornsby, was not successful in the tender process.
                As a result of the DES tender, job seekers with disability will benefit from a 50 per cent increase in the number of service sites across the country; bringing the total number of sites to more than 1650. In addition, new specialist providers and an increased number of mental health specialists will more closely meet the needs of the community. From March, job seekers have access to better services than ever before, through greater access to high performing employment service providers. On average, a job seeker moving from a 1 star to a 5 star provider will be more than twice as likely to get a job and around seven times as likely to have kept that job after 26 weeks.
                Australia ranks just 21 out of 29 OECD countries for employment participation for people with a disability. This is not good enough. Through record investment in supporting job seekers with disability, and by pursuing important reforms  -  such as uncapping services and conducting an open tender for DES  - the Government is working to improve employment outcomes for Australians with disability. The decision to put DES to a competitive tender has been welcomed by disability advocates, including the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations and the National Council on Intellectual Disability.
                The Government is absolutely committed to improving services and opportunities for people with disability. In addition to the life-changing National Disability Insurance Scheme, we have made revolutionary changes to employment services for people with disability. We have removed the cruel caps on services that existed under the previous system, resulting in a 46 per cent increase in the number of people receiving services and a 100 per cent increase in the number of people securing jobs. In addition, we are investing a record $3.2 billion over 4 years on helping people with disability to secure work. The decision to conduct the first full competitive tender for DES was a continuation of the Government's commitment to improving services for people with disability.
                  The Hornsby area is covered by the Central Western Sydney and Northern Sydney Employment Service Areas (ESAs). All participants who were connected with Progressive Employment Personnel have been connected to other providers in the local area. 
                  No job seeker with disability in the Hornsby area will be without employment services as a result of the tender.

                  Recommendation 16 and 17 of the 
                  Older people and the law
                   report
                The issue of improvements to the mutual recognition of powers of attorney and uniform powers of attorney legislation has been considered by the Standing Council on Law and Justice (SCLJ) (formerly the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General) a number of times in recent years. 
                The legislation governing powers of attorney is state and territory legislation. The states and territories have not reached agreement on the implementation of uniform legislation on powers of attorney or on the implementation of full mutual recognition. However, with the exception of South Australia all jurisdictions have legislation that provides for some level of mutual recognition of powers of attorney instruments that were created under another jurisdiction's legislation. 
                  Recommendation 19 of the 
                  Older people and the law
                   report
                The Government response accepted recommendation 19 of the Older people and the law report in principle. 
                The Government response to recommendation 19 noted that related work on the development of nationally consistent guidelines for advance health care planning and other related matters was being progressed. 
                In 2011 the Australian Health Ministers' Conference (AHMC) endorsed the National Framework for Advance Care Directives for use by Australian states and territories to align Advance Care Directives law and policy across Australia over time. The development of the National Framework for Advance Care Directives included work that will contribute to policy, legislation and practice for advance care directives and related assessment of capacity becoming more consistent across Australia over time.

                The deeming rules are used to calculate income from financial investments for Social Security and Veterans' Affairs pension and allowance purposes. To calculate income, deeming rates are applied to the total market value of a customer's financial investments. That is, a rate of return is deemed to have been received and is assessed under the income test, rather than the actual income from the financial investment.
                As the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, I have lead responsibility for deeming policy and monitoring of the deeming rates. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research have the authority, under Section 1082 of the Social Security Act 1991, to make a determination about the deeming rates that apply to payments that come within their portfolio responsibilities.
                A wide range of investment indicators are analysed when reviewing the deeming rates. These include term deposit rates; cash management account returns; changes in share prices; share dividend yields; and managed investment returns. Where relevant, the term of investment and access to funds are also considered.
                Reserve Bank of Australia data, for example five-year government bond rates, and regular statements and reports on current and expected economic conditions, and the Treasury's analysis of money markets are also examined. Analysis tends to focus on the medium to long-term trends rather than short-term market fluctuations to minimise disruptions for pensioners by making multiple small changes.
                In reviewing the deeming rates and analysing this information, the type of financial investments generally held by pensioners is also taken into account.
                While there are no weightings applied to any of the indicators or factors, there is a set of principles that are considered when reviewing the deeming rates. These principles provide that deeming should be a simple and fair way to assess income from financial investments, so that pensioners with the same amount held in different financial assets receive a similar assessment; it should reduce the extent to which income support payments fluctuate; and it should simplify investment choice to encourage pensioners to choose investments on their merits.
                Given the complexity of the financial markets in relation to the above range of factors and the number of products and their varying terms and conditions, it is not appropriate to use a set formula when reviewing the deeming rates.
                Deeming rates are kept under ongoing review and are set to reflect the returns available in the market to pensioners for their financial investments.

                Deeming rates are subject to ongoing review. If deeming rates are changed, it generally occurs at the March and September indexation points. This helps to reduce any potential disruption to pension payments.
                An exception to this was during the global financial crisis. Deeming rates were reduced on 17 November 2008 and 26 January 2009 because of rapid changes in market returns available to pensioners.

                The Australian Government continues its commitment to improving economic participation and outcomes for all Australian women. The Government strongly believes that all Australians should have the opportunity to engage in full and meaningful employment. Supporting women's social and economic participation is central to the Government's commitment to building a strong economy on the basis of a fair and just society.
                The Government has achieved significant outcomes with respect to increasing female participation in the workforce and has a number of relevant policies in place, including supporting the provision of affordable and quality child care, the Paid Parental Leave Scheme, reforms to the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999 and the Fair Work Act 2009, and reforms for the aged care workforce to attract and retain skilled and trained aged care workers, most of whom are women. 
                More broadly, the Government is also working to ensure low paid and vulnerable workers generally, many of whom are women, are supported and treated fairly.
                  Affordable Child Care
                Access to affordable child care is critical to women's participation in paid work. 
                The Government has increased its investment in child care, committing $23.1 billion over the four years to 201-16, including $20.6 billion in Child Care Benefit and the Child Care Rebate to help around 900,000 families each year with the cost of child care and helping primary carers back into the workforce. Programs to support affordable access to child care include the following.
                  Child Care Benefit (CCB) assists parents with the cost of approved and registered child care. The payment of CCB varies depending on family income, the number of children in care, the hours of care, and the type of child care used. 
                  Child Care Rebate (CCR) covers families for 50 per cent of their out-of-pocket approved child care expenses after CCB has been received. This assistance helps eligible working parents and carers with the cost of child care, if they are using approved child care for work-related reasons. 
                  Jobs, Education and Training Child Care Fee Assistance provides assistance with child care fees for parents receiving income support, mostly sole parents, while they work, study or train to enter or re-enter the workforce. An additional $225.1 million over four years from 2012-13 is being provided to meet growing demand for this program.
                  In Home Care is a flexible form of child care provided in the family home for families whose circumstances may mean that other child care services are not suitable, such as families working shift or non-standard hours, families with a child or children with a disability or those located in rural or remote regions of Australia. In 2011 the Government announced a 17 per cent increase in the allocation of funded In Home Care places.
                  Child Care Flexibility Fund provides $1.3 million in one-off competitive grants to fund up to 50% of the total costs of projects proposed by community organisations and interested stakeholders to help deliver more flexible child care to better meet the needs of Australian families.
                  Child Care Flexibility Trials represent an additional $4.2 million investment to help existing child care providers trial longer opening hours. More than 500 families in total will take part in trials to test alternative child care arrangements to see what works best for Australian families, including shiftworkers and emergency service workers.
                  Early Years Quality Fund will help support the implementation of the National Quality Framework. Grants totalling $300 million over two years will boost the quality of early childhood education and support workplace reform. Eligible services will receive grants to promote productivity and increase wages for employees with a Certificate III by $3 per hour from 1 July 2013. There will also be proportional wage increases higher up the classification scale.
                  Paid Parental Leave Scheme
                The Government's Paid Parental Leave Scheme began on 1 January 2011. The scheme provides eligible working parents with government-funded pay to support them to take time off work to care for a newborn or recently adopted child. It enables women to maintain an attachment to the workforce and increases women's workforce participation. For many low-paid, casual and part-time working women, this is the first time they have had access to this sort of support.
                There are two payments under the scheme.
                Parental Leave Pay provides up to 18 weeks' pay at the rate of the national minimum wage (currently $606.50 a week before tax) to eligible primary carers (usually birth mothers).
                From January 2013, the scheme has been extended to provide eligible dads or partners caring for a child with up to two weeks' Dad and Partner Pay at the rate of the national minimum wage. 
                  Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012
                On 22 November 2012, the Parliament passed the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Amendment Act 2012 to strengthen the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Act 1999 and its administering agency's focus on gender equality. These reforms recognise that both men and women experience barriers in the workplace. As part of the reforms, the Act is now called the Workplace Gender Equality Act 2012 and the Agency is now the Workplace Gender Equality Agency.
                The Workplace Gender Equality Act now requires employers to report on outcomes associated with women's and men's employment, and aims to educate and support businesses to change organisational culture and advance gender equality in their workplaces. Under these reforms, an extra $11.2 million over four years from 2011 - 12 is being provided, which represents a doubling of funds to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, with most of this extra funding to provide practical help and advice to employers. 
                The Government understands that Australian women are often stretched between work and family responsibilities and changes to the Workplace Gender Equality Act aim to improve the capacity of women and men to combine paid work and caring responsibilities.
                  Fair Work Act 2009
                The Fair Work Act establishes a strong framework to support women's workforce participation, provides fairness and flexibility for employees, and promotes opportunities and equality in the workplace. The 10 National Employment Standards and modern awards provide employees in the federal system with clear, comprehensive and enforceable minimum protections. This is particularly significant for women, who are statistically more reliant on awards and minimum wages than men. 

                facilitates additional periods of unpaid parental leave by providing a right to request an extension of unpaid parental leave, which the employer can only refuse on reasonable business grounds; 
                provides a right to request flexible working arrangements to employees with twelve months service who have responsibility for a child under school age or a child with disability who is under 18 years of age; and
                provides employees with enhanced protections from discrimination by adding carer's responsibilities as a ground of discrimination and by providing remedies for discrimination generally.

                allow employees to take unpaid special maternity leave without reducing their entitlement to unpaid parental leave;
                enable pregnant employees to transfer to a safe job regardless of their period of service;
                increase the maximum period of concurrent unpaid parental leave from three to eight weeks and allow that leave to be taken in separate periods within the first 12 months of the birth or adoption of a child; and
                extend the the right to request flexible work arrangements to more categories of employees.
                  Closing the gender pay gap for Social and Community Sector workers
                The Fair Work Act provides genuine opportunities to address pay equity concerns including extending the equal remuneration provisions to work of equal or comparable value. In a test case of the new provisions, Fair Work Australia has awarded significant wage increases to certain social and community sector workers in recognition that their work had been undervalued on gender grounds.
                Around 150,000 of Australia's lowest paid workers are benefiting from substantial pay rises of between 23 and 45 per cent above the minimum rates in the modern award as a result of Fair Work Australia's historic pay equity decision. This represents a significant achievement for women who make up around 120,000 of the 150,000 workers covered by the pay equity order. Over $2 billion has been provided in the Commonwealth share of funding and is being phased over eight years from 1 December 2012. 
                  Aged care workforce reforms
                In terms of the workforce, 90 per cent of workers in the residential and aged care industry are women. Through the Aged Care Reform package which is progressively being implemented from 1 July 2012, the Government will provide $1.2 billion over five years to tackle critical shortages in the aged care workforce, benefiting the many women working in this sector. The Government is developing and implementing an Aged Care Workforce productivity strategy in collaboration with the sector to ensure that a skilled workforce is attracted and retained to meet a growing demand. 
                  Attracting and retaining women in the resources and construction sectors 
                As part of the National Resource Sector Workforce Strategy, $534,000 is being provided over three years to the Australian Mines and Metals Association (AMMA) to help enterprises improve their attraction and retention of women. AMMA will work with stakeholders to develop resources, including tools and services, for enterprises to implement strategies to attract and retain more women in the resources and related construction sectors.

                (1) No. Consistent with the Legal Services Directions 2005 (Cth), the Minister for Foreign Affairs sought legal advice from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 
                (2) It is the widely held view of the international community that Israeli settlements in the Palestinian Territories contravene international law. This is reflected in, for example, the 2004 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall on Occupied Palestinian Territories and resolutions adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and the United Nations Security Council.
                The basis for the statement is outlined in a document tabled by the Minister in the Senate Estimates (Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation) Committee on 14 February 2013. A copy of this statement is attached for reference. 
                (3) Yes. The Minister's Office advised the US Embassy on 18 January 2013. 
                  Israeli Settlement Activity
                Israeli settlement activity is a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention (to which Israel is a party)
                The applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory is widely accepted
                - For example, the annual GA resolution on the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the other occupied territories, was adopted at UNGA67 on 15 November 2012 by 164 in favour; six against; four abstentions.
                Article 49(6) of the Fourth Geneva Convention (on the protection of civilians in time of war) provides that 'the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies'.
                In its 2004 Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall on Occupied Palestinian Territories, the ICJ unanimously concluded that the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (including East Jerusalem) had been established in breach of international law.
                - The Court said that Article 49(6) prohibited not only deportations or forced transfers of populations such as those carried out during the Second World War, but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the occupied territory. The Court found that since 1977, Israel had conducted a policy and developed practices involving the establishment of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory contrary to the terms of Article 49(6).
                - By majority (Judge Buergenthal dissenting) the Court also found that the construction of the security barrier and its associated settlement regime was in violation of key provisions of occupation law, human rights law and (Judge Kooijmans dissenting on this point) the right of Palestinians to self-determination.
                The Security Council has, over time, described Israeli settlement activity as having 'no legal validity'
 'Considering that the policy of Israel in establishing settlements in the occupied Arab territories has no legal validity and constitutes a violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949'.
 'Determines that all measures taken by Israel to change the physical character, demographic composition, institutional structure or status of the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied since 1967, including Jerusalem, or any part thereof, have no legal validity and that Israel's policy and practices of settling parts of its population and new immigrants in those territories constitute a flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of the Civilian Persons in Time of War and also constitute a serious obstruction to achieving comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle East'.
                - The most recent attempt at a Council resolution on settlements (Draft resolution S/2011/24, on which the Council voted 14-1 (US) on 18 February 2011, contained the following language 'Reaffirming that all Israeli settlements activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including East Jerusalem, are illegal..'
                This position is further supported by the annual General Assembly resolution on Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the occupied Syrian Golan, which was adopted at UNGA67 on 15 November 2012 by 163 in favour; six against; six abstentions
                - The resolution 'reaffirms that the Israeli settlements_are illegal' (OP1) and 'calls upon Israel to accept the de jure applicability of the [Fourth Geneva Convention]_and to abide scrupulously by the provisions of the Convention, in particular article 49' (OP2).
                Prior to the Foreign Minister's recent statements Australia had stated that Israeli settlement activity is illegal on two occasions before the Security Council, in January 2011 and October 2012.

                  (1) The native title respondent funding scheme has not closed. From 1 January 2013, funding will be available to a broader range of native title respondents for the cost of disbursements related to native title claims. Subject to means testing, financial assistance for legal representation costs may also be available where there are new or novel questions of law, or where the court requires a respondent to participate in a claim beyond standard procedural processes. The changes bring the scheme into line with access to justice principles and ensure a consistent approach to the administration of financial assistance. 
                The native title respondent funding scheme shares a small appropriation with 23 other statutory and non-statutory schemes of legal financial assistance. Other legal financial assistance schemes include serious overseas criminal matters (such as death penalty cases), overseas child abduction and Commonwealth public interest and test cases.
                In the 2011-12 Budget, financial assistance funding for all 24 schemes was reduced by $0.7 million ongoing. From 2012-13, funding was further reduced by $2.5 million ongoing. Across all schemes, the appropriation for 2012-13 is $4.825 million.

                 
                * expenditure to 1 January 2013.
                All figures are exclusive of GST.
                There is a longstanding practice, endorsed by successive Attorney-Generals, to treat information on individual applications for Commonwealth financial assistance as confidential. As such the department does not report on the particulars of grants of financial assistance, including location.
                (3) The Native Title Act 1993 does not distinguish between categories of respondents and it would be inappropriate to do so under the native title respondent funding scheme. The department does not collect data on type of respondent.
                (4) The department consulted extensively with stakeholders about the changes to the native title respondent funding scheme.
                In August 2011, existing recipients of native title respondent funding were advised of the Budget changes affecting their scheme. 
                  Between August 2011 and December 2011, Mr AC Neal SC undertook an independent review into the native title respondent funding scheme. As part of the review process, recipients, and other stakeholders, were encouraged to make written submissions to the review and many were invited to meetings with Mr Neal SC. 
 &lt;www.ag.gov.au&gt;. 
                On 20 December 2012, the revised guideline implementing the changes to the scheme was released and provided to existing respondents.

                This CENTROC study investigated a wide range of options for securing the water supply for the Central New South Wales (NSW) region. One of those options identified was a pipeline from Macquarie River to Orange to help secure the water supply for Orange. 
                The NSW Government identified the project as their highest priority to secure the water supply for existing rural and regional communities in NSW and, as such, proposed the project as part of the package of activities to be funded under the Menindee Lakes Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). It was included in the MOU subject to the requirement that the project would obtain all required environmental and planning approvals before full funding would be made available. 
                (2) The primary focus of the MOU was on developing a project to reduce evaporative losses at Menindee Lakes, but the MOU also envisaged potential Commonwealth investment in rural water security projects in New South Wales. New South Wales nominated the Orange Pipeline project as being of highest priority in this regard.
                (3) The project meets the core objective outlined in item 14 in that the funding conditions set out in items 22 to 28 support the achievement of the whole MOU.

                (1) No recent cases of the Government providing such guarantees have been identified. An exhaustive search of records has not been undertaken.
                (2) Yes. The Department's position is that it generally cannot provide legally binding guarantees about the behavior of Australians overseas. However, having regard to advice it received from Indonesia about its law and practice in relation to such guarantees, and the specific circumstances of this case, the Department recommended that the pro forma guarantee form be signed. 
                (3) The Government has advised Indonesian authorities that it will make every effort to assist them in advising Ms Corby of her parole conditions. It has also advised that Ms Corby's passport may be retained by Indonesian authorities for the duration of her parole. 
                (4) The Australian Government will consider requests for support on a case by case basis.
                (a) &amp; (b)
                The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will make recommendations to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on a case by case basis taking into account the circumstances of each case, including the specific requirements of the foreign government concerned.

                (1) (a)  -  (i) The Prostheses List is published twice a year (February and August). Prior to 2010 applications were submitted six monthly and the average time taken from application to listing was six months. From 2010, following the formation of the Prostheses List Advisory Committee, applications have been accepted on a continuous basis and the department endeavours to ensure that applications are processed in time to be included on the next published List, which is on average within a 22 week timeframe. 
                However, timeframes for processing of applications may be influenced where additional information is sought from sponsors to support an application.
                There are currently over 10,100 prostheses listed on the February 2013 Prostheses List.   
                (2) Evidence requirements for prostheses have been promulgated by the Prostheses List Advisory Committee and the relevant Clinical Advisory Groups. These reflect expert advice on appropriate levels of evidence and are supported by the government on that basis.

                (1) The Department of Health and Ageing is aware that other countries and unions of nations (e.g the European Union) have treaties and agreements in place such as Mutual Recognition Agreements and Memorandums of Understanding in order to utilise another nation's medical device assessments. The extent to which the assessments assists specific countries deliberations may vary between countries and between the types of medical devices assessed. 
                (2) The Australian Government has adopted agreed international standards for medical devices.
                (3) The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) becomes aware of the market approval status of new and emerging medical device technologies in other countries mainly at the time an application for marketing approval is lodged in Australia.

                (a) The Chair of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) usually meets with the Minister for Health after each meeting of the PBAC. This has been common practice for over a decade. 
                (b) The Australian Government does not intervene in the PBAC decision making process. 
                The Australian Government relies on the advice and recommendations of the PBAC. The PBAC is a statutory committee, which is independent, with its functions defined in the National Health Act 1953,that makes recommendations to the Government on a case-by-case basis for each submission considered by the Committee. 
                The PBAC considers each Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) listing submission having regard to the safety, clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (value-for-money) of the medicine for the intended use, in comparison with other available treatments (including non-pharmaceutical treatments). The same evaluation requirements are applied in all cases, as required by legislation, to ensure consistency and fairness in the listing process. 
                This evaluation process includes an assessment of applications by external third party experts (universities), consideration by a drug utilisation sub-committee, consideration by an economic evaluation sub-committee and consumer input. At each step, the sponsor is provided with information and recommendations from the sub-committees to allow consideration and response. This ensures that the PBAC considers all the relevant available evidence (not just that provided by the sponsor) before making a recommendation.

                In June 2012, the Drug Utilisation Sub-Committee (DUSC) of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) requested a utilisation review of diabetes medicines. The utilisation review was requested due to recent changes in diabetes management, including the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listing of a number of new anti-diabetic medicines. From this, a broader post market review, encompassing other aspects of diabetes management including self - monitoring of blood glucose and continuous insulin infusion via insulin pumps was developed. This will ensure all aspects of diabetes management can be assessed in context.
                The Review of diabetes is focused on the overall management of the condition and how Commonwealth funded medicines and products are being used to benefit patients. In August 2012, the PBAC agreed to the Terms of Reference for this Review.
                Further information on the Post Market Review of Products Used in the Management of Diabetes is available at pbs.gov.au/reviews.
                Potential PBAC recommendations resulting from this review cannot be pre-empted. However, the outcomes of PBAC consideration will be made publicly available, consistent with current practice.

                Expert Advisory Groups for Post Market Reviews of medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), are formed to provide advice on specific clinical and consumer issues with regard to, but not limited by the Terms of Reference of the Review. 

                members of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee or its sub-committees;
                independent specialist clinicians and/or nurse practitioners;
                researchers and representative of peak healthcare provider or prescriber bodies related to the medicines under review;
                health educators;
                health economists;
                consumer representatives or advocates; and,
                representatives from the National Prescribing Service, Therapeutic Goods Administration and National Health and Medical Research Council
                (a) No, industry are not represented on Expert Advisory Groups for Post Market Reviews of PBS listed medicines. It would be inappropriate for industry representatives, or any other representative with a financial interest, to be members of the Advisory Groups due to commercial conflict of interest issues. However, industry is provided with several opportunities to provide input to each review through the public consultation process and the opportunity to comment on draft reports. Additionally, industry (both Medicines Australia and the Generics Medicines Industry Association) are represented on the Drug Utilisation Sub-Committee.
                (b) The membership of Expert Advisory Groups for Post Market Reviews will be published in the final report of each Review.

                It is not practical to individually agree timeframes when it comes to specific reviews, due to the large number of stakeholders, for example, with the Diabetes Review the Department of Health and Ageing notified over 100 stakeholders directly.

                (1) a) and b)
                Quality use of medicines and health outcomes are inherently linked as better use of medicines leads to improved health outcomes.
                The Review of Anticoagulation Therapies in Atrial Fibrillation (AF Review) concluded that the net benefit of the new oral anticoagulation therapies in clinical practice, and the subsequent impact on cost-effectiveness, is uncertain at this stage and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) should review its March 2011 advice to list dabigatran (Pradaxa®) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The PBAC reconsidered submissions from all sponsors of new oral anticoagulants at its March 2013 meeting. The outcomes of the March meeting were published on the PBS website on 26 April 2013.
                Aspen Australia has sent out information booklets to all Australian GPs entitled 'Eating well with warfarin'. The need for this was identified in recommendation 14 of the AF Review. The other recommendations in the AF Review are being investigated by the Department of Health and Ageing.
                The Statins Review and Post Market Review of Anti-Dementia Medicines used to treat Alzheimers Disease (Alzheimers Review) resulted in price reductions on PBS listed medicines, which will contribute to the sustainability of the PBS. This improves the health outcomes of Australians by enabling new medicines to be listed on the PBS for a wider variety of conditions, and by providing affordable access to medicines already listed on the PBS.
                The Alzheimers Review also resulted in changes to patient assessment required for continuation of PBS subsidised therapy. These changes enable clinicians and carers input to patient assessment which facilitates better identification of eligible patients and ensures access to these medicines is retained for those patients benefiting from treatment. The continuation rule has also been changed to a streamlined authority to reduce the administrative burden on clinicians. This will allow more time for clinicians, carers and patients to focus on optimising health outcomes. 
                (2) PBAC recommendations arising from Reviews that are agreed by Government will be implemented within existing programs. For example, changes to PBS listings will be implemented through standard PBS processes, as has always been the case and the results of any changes to access to PBS medicines will be monitored through the Drug Utilisation Sub - Committee of the PBAC.

                (1) (a) Price changes for Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) subsidised medicines can occur on 1 April, 1 August or 1 December and requests to medicine sponsors to offer price cuts are aligned with these price change dates. 
                The timeframes for price reductions to take effect are generally about 3 months. The Department of Health and Ageing consistently applies a response deadline of 2 weeks for sponsors to respond to requests on pricing matters including price reduction offers. Requests from medicine sponsors for extensions to this deadline are granted where possible taking into account individual circumstances.
                (b) The deadlines to apply a brand price premium or change a current premium are published on the PBS website in October to November of the preceding year, and are around 3 months before the premium change takes effect.
                (c) All changes to the PBS restriction of a medicine require the involvement of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). The timelines for the PBAC processes are on the Department's website.
                (2) Sponsors of PBS-subsidised medicines have on occasion challenged the adequacy of the timeframes to respond to requests for price reduction offers on their medicines. However such challenges are not universal. For example, sponsors of three of the four medicines included in the recent Alzheimer drugs review offered price reductions within the initial 2 week timeframe requested by the Government.
                (3) The majority of price reductions arise from PBAC recommendations. To date, price reductions have been requested before or in conjunction with restriction changes.

                As published in the 2011-12 Annual Report for the Department of Health and Ageing, Further PBS Reform saved the Government $189.3 million in 2011-12. 
                (c) The total administrative cost to Government associated with development and management of Expanded and Accelerated Price Disclosure reforms that took effect on 1 December 2010, for the period until March 2013, are $5.8 million. This sum includes the legal costs of the Commonwealth associated with the court challenge mentioned in Question Number 1481.
                (d) No. Price disclosure results in price changes that follow the average prices at which the affected medicines are actually being sold in the market. The price changes are therefore consistent with the commercial decisions already being made by pharmaceutical companies about the sustainable price for sale of the medicines.

                timely access to the medicines that Australians need, at a cost individuals and the community can afford;
                medicines meeting appropriate standards of quality, safety and efficacy;
                quality use of medicines; and
                maintaining a responsible and viable medicines industry.
                Recognising the linkages between each of these pillars, the Government continues to coordinate both industry and health policy to ensure that a consistent and supportive environment is maintained for the pharmaceutical industry. 
//www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/National+Medicines+Policy-2 
                The Department also works through various fora such as the Pharmaceutical Industry Working Group, the Access to Medicines Working Group and the Generic Medicines Working Group to provide all industry stakeholders opportunities to contribute to pharmaceutical policy in the health sector.
                Additionally, the Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education take the lead in managing industry specific policy that relates to the pharmaceutical sector in areas such as clinical trials, and has taken steps only recently to improve Research and Development in the pharmaceutical sector in Australia.

                (a) and (b) The Australian Government is committed to paying its share of the cost to organisations delivering in-scope programs in implementing the Equal Remuneration Order (ERO). 
                This has been done by providing supplementation funding to service providers delivering these programs, generally through a variation to current funding agreements. Supplementation was calculated based on the current funding received, the wage-cost component of the in-scope program delivered and the ERO percentage increase for the relevant state/ territory.
                All Commonwealth agencies issued offers of supplementation to eligible service providers in November and December 2012. If organisations considered their supplementation was insufficient, they were able to request a review from the department through which they receive their funding.

                (1) (i) The Medical Services Advisory Committee (MSAC) is an advisory body and does not apply to Cabinet for listing or funding of medical services on the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS).
                Prior to 2010, the then Minister for Health and Ageing held a delegation to approve new items with a financial impact on the MBS of less than $10 million without having to go through Cabinet. As a result there are several measures that were not required to go to Cabinet. 

                From 2008 to 2013 Budget announcement dates were used. For example if the measure was included in the 2009-10 Budget the Cabinet meeting date was estimated as May 2009; and
                From 2011-12 to 2013 if it was able to be identified where a measure appeared in another Cabinet submission, the month of that submission was used.
                (a), (b) and (c) - Previous Governments' Cabinet records are not available. 
                (d) 2008  -  17.1 months
                (e) 2009  -  2.8 months
                (f) 2010  -  3.3 months
                (g) 2011  -  6.1 months
                (h) 2012  -  2 months
                (i) 2013 (to date) - None
                   (ii) The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) is an advisory body and does not apply to Cabinet for listing or funding of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).
                I, as the Minister for Health, bring forward submissions to Cabinet on the listing of medicines on the PBS.

                (a), (b) and (c)  -  This information is not available as it relates to deliberations of the previous Government.
                (d) 2008 - 2.7 months
                (e) 2009 - 3 months
                (f) 2010 - not applicable (no PBS listing considered by Cabinet that were listed in 2010)
                (g) 2011 - 3.7 months
                (h) 2012 - 2.7 months
                (i) 2013 (to date) - 3.4 months
                (2) Since 2009, in response to stakeholder concerns about lengthy, cumbersome health technology processes identified through the HTA Review, the Australian Government has undertaken a comprehensive overhaul of the management and governance processes relating to the MBS. This was done to improve not only the quality of MSAC's advice to government, but also the transparency, timeliness, efficiency and effectiveness of the processes that inform MSAC's advice.
                A medicine cannot be included on the PBS unless the PBAC recommends to the Australian Government that it be listed. Therefore, a positive PBAC recommendation is a very important step in the listing process. 
                However, other steps generally need to be taken before a listing is achieved, such as pricing negotiations with the product's sponsor, finalisation of the conditions for listing, quality and availability checks and consideration by Cabinet.
                The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Medicines Australian and the Government commits the Government to use its best endeavours to implement a maximum time frame of six months for consideration and decision by Cabinet. Cabinet consideration of PBS submissions within six months of the finalisation of price negotiations has been on schedule and applies to PBAC recommendations from July 2010. 
                The Government has continued to meet all its commitments under the MoU. All high cost medicines subject to the MoU have been considered by the Cabinet within the agreed six month timeframe. 
                All minor cost PBS listings continue to be listed within the usual timeframes, generally about four months.
                (3) In 2010 MSAC reforms were introduced to address timeframes for implementation of new medical services and to establish an alignment between the MSAC and PBAC processes where appropriate. The reforms have resulted in significant decreases in the length of time taken from MSAC consideration to implementation on the MBS.

                health educators, including the Australian Diabetes Educators Association;
                consumer representative organisations, including Diabetes Australia, Asthma Australia and the National Asthma Council; 
                organisations that have a known interest in and/ or have been in communication with the Department, such as the National Prescribing Service;
                the National Health and Medical Research Council; and
                the Therapeutic Goods Administration.
                The Pharmaceutical Policy Branch took advice from a range of sources including other Divisions within the Department and related agencies when developing the comprehensive list of stakeholders to contact directly.
                All stakeholders were notified of the diabetes review on 4 October 2012, via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) website. On 16 October 2012 the Department wrote to key stakeholders via email and postal mail inviting them to provide submissions. Sponsor companies were notified of the Asthma in Children Review on 8 February 2013, via e-mail and postal mail. All other stakeholders were notified of the review on 12 February 2013, via e-mail, postal mail and the PBS website.
                The Department is confident it notified all stakeholders. In addition to the direct contact for sponsors and representational groups, the information is made publicly available through the PBS website. It is not practical for the Department to directly contact all individual consumers and prescribers.
                Key health outcomes the Department is seeking to improve include the morbidity, mortality, safety and quality of life for patients with diabetes and children with asthma.
                Measures may be implemented to ensure key outcomes are achieved, once the outcomes of these reviews are known.
                The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) agreed to the Terms of Reference for the diabetes review at its August 2012 meeting. The National Medicines Policy Committee (NMPC) developed the Terms of Reference for the asthma review at its April 2012 meeting. The PBAC agreed to the Terms of Reference at its November 2012 meeting.

                The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) process is a 17 week cycle from receipt of submission, to PBAC consideration. To date post-market reviews have taken anywhere between seven to 12 months, including multiple periods of public consultation. 
                Submissions for new or extended listings on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme are initiated by sponsors, not by the PBAC or the Department of Health and Ageing. Major submissions must be submitted 17 weeks prior to the PBAC meeting, with companies provided one week to provide additional information or comment in response to the Drug Utilisation Sub-Committee (DuSC) and Economic Sub-Committee (ESC) processes, before provision to the PBAC for final consideration.
                In respect to post-market reviews, it is a matter for individual sponsors as to the data they provide in their submissions to a review. 
                Post-market reviews to date have followed a process of initial public call for submissions of between six and nine weeks depending on the time of year. Additionally, all reviews have provided for a period of subsequent comment on the draft report, for a period of between two and six weeks, again depending on the time of year.

Specifically, this decision was made due to a significant reduction in the full-time ADF dependency (less than 150 persons) for that pharmacy. This was a direct result of complex Navy medical cases being moved to the personnel support unit at HMAS Kuttabul. These cases were the most frequent users of medical services at HMAS Penguin, including pharmacy. 
                (c) The pharmacy at HMAS Penguin was the only pharmacy in NSW to close. In this instance this was an isolated case where ADF dependency numbers had reduced significantly. In the normal course of business where there are changes to ADF dependency numbers for specific health facilities, Defence reviews its workforce requirements in those locations and makes amendments as required. 
                (d) The strict probity guidelines required of the procurement process for the ADF Health Services Contract, and adhered to by the project team, dictated that very little information concerning the contract could be shared or discussed with regional staff, especially given the close local working arrangements with the then current on base workforce providers and contracted health workforce.
                Defence has no obligation to consult directly with contracted health professionals engaged by prime services providers to Defence. As the then existing contracts for provision of contracted health professionals were coming to an end (4 November 2012), the prime service providers were notified by Defence about the proposed new contract arrangements. 
                (e) (i) &amp; (ii) Efficiencies expected to be achieved from closure of the pharmacy include one (1) Full Time Equivalent (FTE) pharmacist position, and a reduction in pharmaceutical and consumable administrative stock management overhead. As transition to the new services has only recently been finalised any efficiencies have not yet been measured.

                The requested information is not readily available for the period 2001 to 2004 and to search for the information and undertake the required analysis to answer the question would involve a significant diversion of Departmental resources. 
                The Department of Health and Ageing currently publishes key activity indicators for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) on the Departmental website (www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/health-pbs-activity-indicators). The indicators are a set of outcomes, based on calendar years, resulting from a collaborative project between Medicines Australia, the Department and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC). 
                With respect to the period 2011 to the present date, figures cannot yet be independently verified as not all PBS Public Summary Documents (PSDs) for major cost effectiveness submissions to PBAC from 2011 to the present date have been published. With the introduction of the PBAC/Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) parallel processing as part of the Memorandum of Understanding with Medicines Australia, the PBAC outcome for a product submitted under the parallel process is not published until the TGA delegate's overview of the relevant medicine is made available. Parallel processing is where a sponsor may submit an application to the PBAC for PBS listing before the registration of the medicine for the requested indication is finalised by the TGA.
                In accordance with the 'Framework for the introduction of parallel processes' agreed with Medicines Australia, the Department cannot publish PSD's until the medicine is added to the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods for the indication seeking PBS listing. This practice stems from industry sensitivities regarding potential disclosure of commercially confidential information. Additionally, were the Department to publish a positive PBAC recommendation for a product before the TGA outcome is known, this may be viewed as possibly prejudicing the TGA process. The Department does not publish indicative statistics on PBAC outcomes until all individual outcomes are published to ensure that these statistics can be independently verified.

 a dispersible tablet or a different injection delivery device). It is not appropriate for the Department to make public a list of affected medicines as these listing decisions are a commercial matter for the companies concerned.
                The PBS has mechanisms in place that reward innovations that improve patient outcomes with higher prices. Sponsors with innovative medicine delivery mechanisms can make a submission to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) with evidence of the improvements in patient outcomes. No such submissions have been made to PBAC in recent years.

                1. The department has now completed a long and unprecedented consultative process to establish Australia's world-leading network of marine reserves and to develop the statutory framework to ensure the reserves are managed effectively and efficiently.

                identification of areas for further assessment for proposed marine reserves, including extensive stakeholder meetings (May 2009  -  March 2010)
                90 day consultation period on draft marine reserves networks (May 2011  -  February 2012)
                60 day consultation period on a final marine reserves network proposal (July  -  September 2012)
                30 day consultation period on the preparation of management plans for the marine reserves networks (November  -  December 2012)
                30 day consultation period on the draft management plans for the marine reserves networks (January  -  February 2013)
                The recreational fishing sector has been involved in each of the stages of the consultation process, with 138 meetings having been held specifically with recreational fishing organisations or individual recreational fishers. Attachment A1 provides details of the organisations that were represented at these meetings. Representatives from a range of recreational fishing organisations met with the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities in May 2012 prior to the commencement of the public consultation period on the final Commonwealth marine reserves network proposal. These organisations are detailed in Attachment A2.
                Additionally, individual recreational fishers were able to participate in the consultation process by attending any of the 35 public information meetings held around Australia and by providing a submission within any of the statutory consultation periods. A Schedule of the 35 public information sessions is detailed in Attachment A3.
                Over the last two years, the department has considered around three-quarters of a million public submissions, including from the recreational fishing sector, with the overwhelming response in support of establishment of Commonwealth marine reserves.
                The final Commonwealth marine reserves allow recreational fishing in all zones except highly protected Sanctuary (IUCN Ia) zones and Marine National Park (IUCN II) zones. Areas important to recreational fishers have largely been avoided by locating the majority of highly protected zones far offshore and remote from access points such as boat ramps. In Commonwealth waters, some 96 per cent of all waters within 100km of the shore (excluding the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park) will be open to recreational fishing.
                2. No. The management plans for Commonwealth marine reserves relate to Commonwealth waters only. This area generally begins 3 nautical miles (5.5km) offshore at the edge of state waters, and extends to the edge of Australia's exclusive economic zone, 200 nautical miles from shore. Commonwealth waters do not include beaches, bays and estuaries in coastal waters. The management plans before Parliament do not change arrangements in any terrestrial national parks.

                (a) and (b) As part of the Future of Financial Advice reforms the Government commissioned Mr Richard St. John to undertake a review to consider the need for, and costs and benefits of a statutory compensation scheme. This review was announced in response to recommendation 10 of the report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services Inquiry into financial products and services in Australia.
                Mr St. John has since provided his final report on Compensation arrangements for consumers of financial services to the Government. On 8 May the Government released Mr St. John's report for public consultation.
                Chapter 3 of that report considers 'compensation following recent licensee failures' including the compensation position of APRA regulated superannuation funds, trustees of SMSFs and of individual investors.
                On 16 May the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services publically released their report following an Inquiry into the collapse of Trio Capital. This report also examines the impact on Trio Capital investors and the issue of compensation. 
                The Government responded to both reports on 26 April 2013.

                (1) The facility was temporarily closed from 15 February 2013 until 31 May 2013 because of the risk of bushfires. The closure dates aligned with the bushfire risk period defined by the local Serpentine Jarrahdale Shire fire authority and published on its website. 
                (2) Employees will return to the site from 31 May 2013 to prepare the facility for the first intake of animals. It is expected this first intake will occur on 17 June 2013. 
                (3) The department refunded daily quarantine fees for all animals that were evacuated from the Byford facility from 15 February 2013 and released under quarantine surveillance. For cats and dogs imported from 15 February 2013 until 18 March 2013, the department arranged, and paid for, all domestic transfers to and from Perth airport to Eastern Creek Quarantine Facility in Sydney. Owners that were provided with a reasonable period of notice of the temporary closure, that is those seeking to import to Byford between 19 March and 31 May 2013, were given the option of delaying their import until the end of the fire risk period or using alternative quarantine facilities at their own cost.  
                The department operates two alternative dog and cat quarantine facilities. Both these facilities had sufficient space to accommodate all cats and dogs booked into Byford Quarantine Facility from 15 February 2013 until 31 May 2013. 
                (4) There were no cost savings arising out of the decision to temporarily close the Byford Quarantine Facility. Fixed costs were still incurred and all employees were temporarily reassigned duties within the department.

                (a) NBN Co's website indicates it will require approximately 2300 sites to roll out the NBN fixed wireless network. NBN Co will aim to use existing towers where feasible. The number of new towers required for the rollout will be dependent on the number of existing towers NBN Co is able to utilise feasibly.
                (b) It should be noted that the failed OPEL contract introduced by the Howard Government involved the construction of 1361 wireless broadband towers across Australia.
                (c) NBN Co has indicated publicly that it plans to complete the rollout of the fixed wireless network by 2015. The timetable for the construction of new towers is dependent on the identification and acquisition of appropriate sites, and the receipt of any required planning approval from state, territory or local government authorities. Consequently, a detailed building program cannot be provided at this time.

                The Government's National Security Statement released in January 2013 observed that the rapidity of China's military growth had given rise to a degree of uncertainty or sensitivity, and that this had been exacerbated by a series of maritime territorial disputes between China and some of its neighbours. The government has called on all parties to resolve these disputes peacefully and in accordance with international law. Through bilateral and regional diplomacy, the government has sought to encourage China to use its growing capabilities and influence to contribute actively and positively to maintaining regional peace and stability, and to embrace openness and transparency to help build understanding and trust across the region. The government has also encouraged China to play a constructive role in multilateral forums, commensurate with its status as a global power.

                The Australian government does not promote Tibetan independence. The Australian government recognises that Tibet is a part of China. This was implicit when Australia recognised the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1972. It is not a judgment on the historical rights and wrongs of the issue, but is an acknowledgement that the territory of the PRC includes the region of Tibet and that Chinese authorities exercise the functions of government in this area. Australia's stance on this issue conforms to that of the wider international community. It is the practice for countries which have diplomatic relations with the PRC to recognise its sovereignty over Tibet.
                This has not prevented the Australian government from raising concerns with the Chinese Government about its human-rights record and its protection of religious heritage in Tibetan areas. The Australian government also supports continued direct talks between Chinese authorities and representatives of the Dalai Lama on autonomy. The Australian government was disappointed that the last round of such talks in January 2010 did not make any progress, and continues to urge China to resume substantive negotiations.

                The World Trade Organization Dispute Section forms part of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Taskforce. 
                The Tobacco Plain Packaging Taskforce was established in April 2012 to prepare Australia's response to international legal challenges in the WTO and under the Australian-Hong Kong bilateral investment treaty, related to Australia's tobacco plain packaging legislation, as part of an interagency team. The Tobacco Plain Packaging Taskforce replaced a smaller taskforce which had been established in August 2011 in response to the claim under the Hong Kong treaty. DFAT is the lead agency in relation to the WTO dispute proceedings. 
                Resources are allocated to the Tobacco Plain Packaging Taskforce according to the requirements of the disputes. The Taskforce currently comprises officers at the SES, Executive and APS levels.
                The Government does not intend to disclose costs associated with defending these legal actions so that complainant countries are not able to use that information to their tactical advantage. Disclosure of such information could prejudice Australia's position in on-going litigation.

                (1) Yes.
                On 28 September 2012 at Ukraine's request a dispute settlement panel was established by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body in relation to Australia's tobacco plain packaging measure. The panel members are yet to be appointed in that dispute. 
                Honduras and the Dominican Republic have also each requested the establishment of a WTO dispute settlement panel in relation to Australia's measure. Australia rejected Honduras' first request at the 19 November 2012 meeting of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. Australia rejected the Dominican Republic's first request at the 17 December 2012 meeting of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. Australia cannot reject a second request to establish a WTO dispute settlement panel. 
                Australia received a request for WTO dispute settlement consultations from Cuba on 6 May 2013. Consultations are the first step in WTO dispute settlement proceedings.
                (2) The Government does not intend to disclose costs associated with defending these legal actions so that complainants are not able to use that information to their tactical advantage. Disclosure of such information could prejudice Australia's position in on-going litigation.
                Further, the WTO disputes related to tobacco plain packaging are unique for Australia. Australia has not previously been involved in a dispute involving the number of complainants, third parties, or complexity of issues which arise in the tobacco plain packaging disputes.

                (1) Mail deliveries are not being 'held up or delayed' in the NSW mid north coast region. 
                Australia Post's letter delivery performance, which is measured against the prescribed performance standard of 94% on time delivery*, is independently monitored and audited annually by the Australian National Audit Office.
                Australia Post achieved 96.1% on time delivery in the NSW mid north coast region for the March 2013 quarter.
                [* Regulations made under section 28C of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 prescribe the particular performance standards Australia Post is required to meet in order to fulfill its Community Service Obligations.]
                (2) Australia Post does not offer a specific 'flat pack' product or service. On 8 April 2013, Australia Post introduced a new parcel range, with enhanced tracking as a standard feature, and increased the price of selected products, most by less than 7 per cent.
                  Like all businesses, Australia Post is operating in a challenging business environment with increasing external costs, particularly related to delivery and transport. It delivers to more than 11 million addresses and must expand its capacity to deliver to around 200,000 new addresses each year. This requires it to continually reduce its operating costs, improve the efficiency of its network and adjust prices.
                The parcel delivery market is highly competitive and Australia Post must compete on the same basis as other carriers. Australia Post is confident that its parcel products represent good value for money.
                (3) Weight is an important factor of freight costs and therefore a key determinant of parcel prices.
                More importantly, for Occupational Health and Safety reasons, it is not appropriate to offer packaging regardless of weight. To protect Australia Post staff, the maximum acceptable weight of parcels lodged at an Australia Post outlet is 22kg.

                (1) As the MRRT is a profits based tax, whether particular projects, including magnetite projects, will be liable to pay MRRT in a given year will depend on whether they have earned a MRRT assessable profit for that year. This, in turn, will depend on a range of factors including commodity prices, the exchange rate, and costs incurred in relation to the specific project. 
                (2) The MRRT is a tax on the proceeds arising from the sale of iron ore and coal, but only that part of the proceeds that is reasonably attributable to the resource. To ensure the MRRT does not tax the value-added by downstream processing and beneficiation, the point at which MRRT liability is determined is set at a point immediately after extraction. The value attributable to the resource at that point will depend on both the costs incurred in downstream operations and the final price received for the marketable commodity. Consequently, a lower value will be attributable to the resource in cases where significant downstream processing of the resource is required to produce a marketable commodity, relative to a case where it is not. 
                (3) The MRRT applies in relation to the extraction of iron ore and coal resources in Australia. The Policy Transition Group, in its report to Government in December 2010, considered that magnetite should be subject to the MRRT like other types of iron ore. The PTG noted that excluding magnetite would result in inequitable treatment of competing segments in the iron ore industry and may distort investment decisions within the sector. Such an outcome would be at odds with a key rationale for profit-based taxes such as the MRRT and PRRT which is to minimise distortions. 
                (4) MRRT revenue forecasts were calculated using an aggregate 'top-down' model which took account of industry data as a whole, rather than on a project by project basis. This was checked against a project-by-project model that was built for DRET during the PTG process.

                (1) The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport (the Department) supports a strong, creative and liveable Australia by focusing on regional development, arts and sport and empowering communities to improve economic and social outcomes. At the core of the Department's work is an understanding of the significance of the regions to Australia's economy, environment, wellbeing and identity. The Department achieves this through partnerships and policy design which gives regions a voice and contributes to effective service and program delivery. 
                  The Department plays a coordinating role, working across Australian Government agencies to ensure regional implications and opportunities are embedded in policies, programs and service delivery. The Department supports the COAG Standing Council on Regional Australia which enables the Australian Government, states and territories to work closely on regional matters. Additionally, the Department has developed the Regional Australia Impact Statement (RAIS) which is used to inform the Government of the likely specific impacts, positive or negative, of a new policy on regional Australia. The RAIS must be included in all Cabinet Submissions and associated new policy proposals that are likely to impact on regional Australia.

                  The Department provided regional policy advice to ensure regional input and perspectives were included in policy development and implementation across government. 
                  The Department contributed to the development of major policies relating to regional economic development, regional infrastructure and regional engagement across government through the COAG Standing Council on Regional Australia. 
                  The Department also contributed to the design of regional elements of major government policies and reform in the areas of education, health, aged care, immigration, the Clean Energy Future plan, the Asian Century White Paper and the National Food Plan. 
                  A key success for the year was the 2013-14 Regional Budget package which identified Government initiatives for regional Australia. These initiatives are outlined in the Ministerial Budget Statement 
 Strengthening Communities.

                My Department works collaboratively with all levels of government and with a range of community and industry stakeholders to advocate for positive outcomes for regional Australia, including in the areas of health, education, skills, infrastructure, environment and industry. 
                My Department acts as a conduit to provide local information from the ground up to inform Commonwealth policy and program design and delivery, including information generated through local governments and the Regional Development Australia committee network. 
                My Department also plays a coordinating role, working across Australian Government agencies to ensure regional implications and opportunities are embedded in policies, programs and service delivery. For example, my Department has contributed to the design of regional elements of major government policies and reform in the areas of education, health, aged care, immigration, the Clean Energy Future plan, the Asian Century White Paper and the National Food Plan.
                The Department also administers the Regional Australia Impact Statement (RAIS) which is used to inform the Government of the likely specific impacts, positive or negative, of a new policy on regional Australia.

                (a) The Australian Government recognises that metastatic prostate has a significant impact on the Australian community and is committed to improving outcomes for men affected by this disease and their families.
                On 30 June 2013, I announced that the Australian Government had approved the listing of abiraterone acetate (brand name Zytiga®) on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, at a cost of $46 million over four years. The listing is subject to final arrangements being met by the supplier of this medicine, but is expected to be made available from 1 August 2013.  
                Abiraterone acetate's availability on the PBS is a significant development in the treatment of prostate cancer  -  the most common cancer in Australian men. Over 1,000 patients will benefit from the PBS listing of abiraterone acetate.
                (b) At its March 2012 meeting, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) recommended the PBS listing of abiraterone acetate (Zytiga®) for the treatment of metastatic advanced prostate cancer, as an Authority Required listing.
                However, Janssen-Cilag Pty Limited, the manufacturer of abiraterone acetate, was not satisfied with a number of aspects of the PBAC recommendation, including the price offered for a PBS listing of the medicine, and made a re-submission requesting the PBAC to review its decision.
                The PBAC considered the re-submission for the review of the proposed PBS listing for abiraterone acetate at its July 2012 meeting, and again recommended listing abiraterone acetate tablets as an Authority Required listing.
                The sponsor yet again decided not to proceed with the listing as it was again not satisfied with the price offered for the PBS listing of abiraterone acetate from the PBAC recommendation, and lodged another submission with the PBAC for its consideration at the November 2012 PBAC meeting. This was again recommended by the PBAC.
                The sponsor has now accepted the PBAC recommendation of November 2012.
                Had Janssen-Cilag Pty Limited proceeded with the PBAC's initial recommendation from its March 2012 meeting, the Australian Government's decision making processes would have enabled consideration and potentially PBS listing of this medicine in 2012.
                  (c) Refer to (a) and (b). It should also be noted that the Australian Government relies on the advice and recommendations of the PBAC. It would be inappropriate for the Government to interfere with or exert influence over the work of the independent PBAC.

                (a) This support is provided by AusAID through a World Bank project  -  the Transforming School Education Project (TSEP). The project funds improvements to primary and secondary education in state schools throughout Sri Lanka and supports the implementation of the Government of Sri Lanka's education sector plan. Over the life of the four-year project it is expected that 4 million Sri Lankan students and 250,000 teachers will benefit from TSEP.
                The program is not designed to provide equal distribution to every citizen of Sri Lanka but to provide extra support where it is needed. A formula, which includes factors such as poverty indicators and population distribution, is used to determine how much funding goes to each province under TSEP. This is to ensure the project gives appropriate attention to schools with the greatest needs. 
                The World Bank ensures funding provided under TSEP is used appropriately by undertaking regular project supervision and the ongoing application of its safeguards to guard against fraud and other potential risks to the project.
                (b) AusAID estimates that out of a total project budget of $134 million about $34.4 million (or 25.7 per cent) will benefit school students in the Eastern and Northern provinces of Sri Lanka. This means that one-quarter of the project is focused on the two poorest provinces in Sri Lanka.
                TSEP allocates funds in accordance with provincial education action plans. These plans must be in line with the Sri Lankan Government's national education sector plan that aims to improve access and quality and strengthen governance across the nation's school system.

                (a) Mr Joyce was convicted of commercial offences in the Court of First Instance in Dubai on 20 May 2013. He has lodged an appeal against that ruling. It is not yet clear when the appeal court will be constituted and commence its deliberations. While Mr Joyce is subject to legal processes in Dubai, he is unable to leave the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Following representations by the Australian Government, the UAE authorities recently returned the passport of Mr Joyce's wife which had initially been withheld as part of Mr Joyce's bail conditions. Accordingly, his wife and children are free to travel out of the UAE if they wish.
                (b) The Government has provided extensive assistance to Mr Joyce and his family since he was charged in 2009. Consular officers have attended all but one of his court hearings and the Australian Embassy in the UAE is maintaining close and regular contact with Mr Joyce and his family. 
                The Government has made 22 representations at the political level to the UAE Government regarding Mr Joyce's case, including three by the Prime Minister, one by the Governor-General level and fourteen at Foreign Minister level. The Australian Ambassador to the UAE has also made numerous representations at senior levels of the UAE Government. In those representations, the Government has registered concerns about the duration of the legal process, underlined our expectation that Mr Joyce will be afforded due process, and underscored the adverse impact of the proceedings on the welfare of Mr Joyce and his family. The Government's representations also drew the attention of senior figures in the UAE Government to the findings of a relevant civil case in the Victorian Supreme Court involving the Sunland company. 
                In relation to Mr Joyce's appeal, the Government will continue to register with UAE authorities our view that the appeal process should be conducted in a timely and thorough way, and that due regard should be given to all submissions made by Mr Joyce in his defence. Our Embassy will be consulting closely with Mr Joyce and his legal representatives during the appeal process and will continue to provide consular assistance to Mr Joyce and his family.

                (a) and (b) The numbers that are identified in Table 10 (page 22) of the Defence Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS) 2013-14 do not refer to positions, but rather the forecast of the average number of personnel who will be paid in each financial year.
                There were 99 vacant approved senior officer positions (Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel equivalent as defined in the PBS) as at 21 June 2013. The planned growth of personnel at senior ranks, as has been identified in the PBS 2013-14, reflects the requirement to reduce gaps at these rank levels and is part of the overall ADF growth plan. 
                The ADF workforce is currently below Average Funded Strength guidance and is forecast to be 1,249 below funded guidance in FY 2012-13. The total forecast growth in the PBS 2013-14 for the ADF Permanent Force from FY 2012-13 to FY 2013-14 is 2.7%; this reflects the need to grow the workforce towards Average Funded Strength guidance. The forecast growth of senior officers and star ranked officers as identified in the PBS is proportionate to the total planned workforce growth.

                (a) Since 1 July 2008, child support law requires a person's care of a child to be expressed as a percentage. This means, in situations where care of a child is shared equally, the number of nights that each parent provides care for the child over a 12 month period would be 183 to one and 182 to the other. Expressed as a percentage, this equates to 51 per cent and 49 per cent. However, if, in discussion with the Department of Human Services, parents advise that they each have exactly 50 per cent care, care will be recorded as 50 per cent to each parent rather than calculated on the basis of 183 / 182 nights.
                (b) Information about the number of complaints specifically against care being recorded as 51 per cent to one parent and 49 per cent to the other is not available.
                (c) As per (a) above, where both parents agree that they share the care of their child equally, functionality exists in the child support system to record shared care for each parent as 50 per cent. However, if the decision is that one cares for the child 183 nights of the year and the other 182 nights, the percentage of care resulting from those nights is recorded as 51 per cent and 49 per cent respectively. This is due to a legislative rule that requires percentages of care that are not whole numbers to be rounded down to the nearest percentage when the number is less than 50 per cent and rounded up when the number is more than 50 per cent. 
                Whether a person is recorded as providing 49 per cent, 50 per cent, or 51 per cent care for a child, their cost percentage will be 50 per cent. This means that they are taken to be meeting 50 per cent of the overall costs associated with that child when the child is in their care and the rate of child support will be the same. That is, the assessed rate of child support would be exactly the same whether the person's care is 49 per cent, 50 per cent, or 51 per cent.

                (a) Yes. As a result of the High Court decision in Canute each injury resulting in impairment requires a separate permanent impairment assessment. This includes employees who suffer from multiple injuries as a result of a single occurrence, for example an employee who sustains a crush injury resulting in impairments to their chest, upper and lower limbs. These impairments will not be able to achieve permanent impairment compensation if each value falls below the 10 per cent threshold. This outcome would also apply to injuries that manifest later as result of a compensable injury (Mr Canute's circumstance). That is the employee suffers a back injury and as a result of the chronic pain develops a depressive disorder 12 months later. 
                (b) Yes. If each separate injury to an employee results in a permanent impairment of less than 10 per cent, compensation for permanent impairment is not payable. Exceptions are permanent impairment as a result of hearing loss (prescribed threshold is 5 per cent) or loss of or loss of use of fingers or toes or taste or smell (no threshold requirement). 
                (c) The Government is considering its response to recommendation 8.2 of the Review of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 that recommended an amendment to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 so that separate impairments arising from a single injury occurrence can be combined to achieve a combined impairment value.

                (a) The National Assessment Program  -  Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) scale bands, including the National Minimum Standards (NMS), were developed during 2007 by the Australian Education Systems Officials' Committee (AESOC) NAPLAN Steering Group. 
                The Steering Group received advice from the Expert Advisory Group (comprising leading Australian measurement experts) and were also informed by existing state and territory literacy and numeracy assessment programs that preceded NAPLAN. The bands were endorsed by AESOC early in 2008.
                The NMS for each year level is represented by a particular band on the ten band NAPLAN common scale. The skills described in the table at Attachment A represent those assessed in NAPLAN tests at the relevant NMS band level for each year level. This information is available at www.nap.edu.au.
                (b) The NMS remain the same from year to year and do not change. The scoring processes of NAPLAN tests have also not changed from the inception of NAPLAN. The number of correct responses needed to meet or surpass the NMS may change from year to year depending upon the difficulty of the current test when it is compared with the initial 2008 NAPLAN test. 
                A well-established psychometric equating process is used to adjust for differences in the difficulty of the tests across years so that the results from different years can be reported on the same achievement scale. 
                (c) The Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) is reviewing a range of matters relating to reporting student performance as part of its ongoing work to align NAPLAN with the Australian Curriculum and transition to online testing. This work will also take account of results from and standards set for international testing programs in which Australia participates. 
                ACARA's work will take account of a request from the Council of Australian Governments in June 2012 to the Standing Council on School Education and Early Childhood (SCSEEC) to give consideration to establishing 'proficient' NAPLAN standards, which would further strengthen focus on reporting student achievement across multiple levels. 
                In undertaking this work, ACARA will seek advice from its advisory, reference and working groups. These groups comprise departmental and school sector representatives, measurement experts, and representatives from other organisations. Advice on changes to the NAPLAN reporting process will be presented to the ACARA Board and SCSEEC during 2014 as part of the overall implementation of NAPLAN online. 
                Any change to the NMS and the process for reporting on student performance will require a decision from SCSEEC.
