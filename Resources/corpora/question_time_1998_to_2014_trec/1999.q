     Prime Minister, doesn't Max Moore-Wilton's report, upon which you relied to water down your code of conduct, state at paragraph 90 in its recommendation, and again I quote:The office holders should nominate as the equivalent of immediate family for conflict of interest purposes any other people having especially close relationship with the office holder.

     Minister, are you aware that yesterday Senator Harradine said that relevant to his consideration of further partial privatisation of Telstra was whether Telstra could meet proper service levels for regional Australia?
     Given that Senator Harradine has made it clear that commitments given to him by the government over the government's first one-third privatisation of Telstra have not been met and that the government cannot be trusted, how can any promise you give to regional Australia over service levels under a 49 per cent privatised Telstra be worth the paper it is written on?

     Minister, why did you negotiate in bad faith with the Democrats?
     -  - Minister, isn't it the case that these emission standards would have been introduced GST or no GST?

     Do you recall that on Friday the Prime Minister released a document which provided a precise costing of the government-Democrat deal to exclude urban operations of mid-range vehicles from the diesel fuel rebate - $199 million in extra revenue in 2000-01, $209 million in 2001-02 and $223 million in 2002-03?
     How were you able to provide this precise costing when it is clear no-one knows precisely how the diesel rebate scheme will work?
     In making the costing did you assume that truck operations in Queanbeyan would receive the rebate or not?
     And what about Tweed Heads, Ipswich, Nambour, Maitland, Wyong, Rockingham and the La Trobe Valley - are these places in regional Australia or not?

    How can you claim that education is GST free when you are going to impose a GST on books which parents use to teach their young children to read and write?

     Prime Minister, do you recollect that I asked you yesterday:How can you claim the member for Leichhardt inadvertently failed to declare his directorship when it is clear the member has misled this House, the Australian people and you, and are you completely satisfied that there are no other directorships on his part to disclose?
    Do you recollect, Prime Minister, my raising a point of order - recorded again in Hansard  - in which I said:The Prime Minister has not dealt at all with my question as to whether or not there are any other directorships he failed to disclose.
    So, Prime Minister, I ask you again: did you fail to inform the House of these undisclosed interests because you did not know about them or were you seeking to withhold crucial information about Mr Entsch's blatant and consistent failure to disclose the full nature of his relationships with private companies with which he is closely involved, as it would cast doubt on the supposed inadvertence of his failure on Cape York Concrete?

     Prime Minister, do you recall that yesterday the member for Leichhardt described the $1.

     Are you aware that under the Corporations Law Mr Entsch, as company secretary of that company and Vervale, has a legal duty to `exercise the degree of care and diligence that a reasonable person in like position in a corporation would exercise'?

     Minister, will you confirm that the explanatory memorandum to the diesel grants scheme bill states that a 10-tonne furniture truck that makes a round trip from Forbes to Sydney to Dubbo to Forbes will be eligible for a grant for diesel used on the whole trip?
     How will this rule apply in the many situations happening today, where such a truck then picks up in Sydney city and makes a delivery in Parramatta before travelling on to Dubbo?
     Is it the case that a grant will not be claimable for the diesel used in the leg from Sydney to Parramatta?
     Minister, aren't you imposing a compliance nightmare on such a truck owner who has to determine how many litres of diesel was used on the Sydney to Parramatta leg and then make a deduction from the total claim at the risk of a heavy fine if he gets it wrong?

     I ask the Prime Minister this question, because last time he cast doubt on the veracity of what I had to say about the Auditor-General's guidelines.
     Prime Minister, are you aware that 138 of the Auditor-General's guidelines, Administration of grants better practice guide , says:The criteria and basis for recommendations and decisions at all stages of the grant process, including appraisal and approval, must be effectively documented.
     Appraisal forms should provide for the recording of reasons for decisions and recommendations.
     They should be maintained consistently as part of the official record and be accessible under freedom of information provisions.
    Prime Minister, why have you not made them accessible?

     Isn't it a fact that the coalition environment minister in Western Australia, Ms Cheryl Edwardes, has accused your forestry minister of inflaming the forestry issue and inciting a group of masked men to destroy a camp in a forest outside Perth over the weekend, as testified to here in this article in the West Australian ?
     Didn't Ms Edwardes yesterday tell Mr Tuckey, after his actions, to `grow up and shut up'?

     It arises from the 13 August hearings of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into East Timor, when DFAT deputy secretary John Dauth told the committee that he could not confirm reports of Indonesian Kopassus troops in East Timor.
     He said:I am not really able to say, not because I am hiding anything but because we do not have any definitive information on that .
     .
     .
     I simply do not know whether it is true.
    Is it not the case that at least five weeks before Mr Dauth's testimony Australian CIVPOL and military liaison officers had reported their serious concern about the presence of a large number of Kopassus troops in East Timor?

     Prime Minister, do you recollect back in September 1985, shortly after you became Leader of the Opposition, saying these things about the situation in East Timor:Generally speaking, I think that the preoccupation of the left of Australian politics with the events in East Timor has needlessly soured our relationship with Indonesia.
     It is just very much to our benefit and long-term interest that we have a better relationship with Indonesia.
    Then do you recollect the compere asking you this question:But the right of Labor politics, which happens to govern this country at the moment, some people would say bends over backwards to accommodate Indonesia.
     How would you bend over further?
    You then said:I don't think they bend over backwards.
     I think what they have really done is essentially left it in the pigeonhole because it is an internal embarrassment to them.
    Prime Minister, when you said that of the Australian Labor Party, did you mean it?

     Further, she went on to say that the effect of the GST would be `devastating and the rise in fees would certainly reduce our membership by many thousands'.
     Are these valid concerns the reason why Guides Australia was de-funded on 1 October?
     Minister, now that you have re-funded the National Council of Single Mothers and Their Children, as announced by Senator Newman today, will you now re-fund all the other organisations that were defunded last Friday?

     Prime Minister, yesterday you referred to some well-known charity organisations such as the Salvation Army.
     I want to ask a question today about a less well-known one, the Greenfields Foundation.
     Prime Minister, do you recall being asked on Radio National this morning whether you would support Senate moves to prevent tax deductibility for donations to sham charities which provide financial support to any political party?
     Do you recall your response: `I'll have a look at it and I'll address the issue that you've raised'?
     Prime Minister, why did all the coalition senators vote against this amendment in the Senate this morning?
     Prime Minister, will you guarantee that, when the amendments come back to the House, your government will support them to ensure that no financial supporter of any political party can gain tax benefits by posing as a charity?

     - My question is addressed to the Prime Minister.
     Are you aware that, according to the GST manual of the Department of Finance and Administration, the Commonwealth government will not be increasing grants to charities by 10 per cent to compensate for the GST that will apply to the grant?
     Doesn't this advice indicate that `the gross up will be significantly less than the 10 per cent GST'?
     Isn't this just a clever way for the government to cut the real level of grants to charities at a time when they will be struggling with GST compliance costs?

     Following your previous answer to the Leader of the Opposition, isn't there a shocking admission in the finance department's GST manual that says:The risk is that grossing up a grant .
     .
     .
     places the cash flow problem on the agency, namely once the grant is paid there is a time lag before the input tax credit is received.
    Prime Minister, won't agencies be paying the GST up front without proper adjustment of their grant and without immediate access to input tax credits, leaving them significantly out of pocket?
     How can you argue that you would be the last person in Australia who wants to damage charities, when that is exactly what you are doing?

     Has the Prime Minister read the tax ruling concerning vouchers that are provided to poor families to help them buy food and clothing and to pay bills, which says:.
     .
     .
     the introduction of the GST may mean that a voucher will purchase less of some items?
    Next year when your government is handing out the Christmas emergency relief grants to community organisations will you be increasing all grants, so that vouchers can retain their value at local shops?
     Or will you be short- changing organisations like Anglicare South East in Eden, the Smith Family in Nowra and in Camperdown, the Casino Neighbourhood Centre, Parramatta Community Services and Centacare in Townsville?

     Will services which provide supported employment to people with disabilities all have to charge GST -  -  - My question is to the Prime Minister.
     Will services which provide supported employment to people with disabilities all have to charge GST on the goods and services they sell, including the packets of lollies sold at Christmas time, ironing services and plants sold in local nurseries?
     I quote the relevant tax ruling:If the disability service business produces commercial supplies then those supplies will be subject to GST.
    Won't the government now be taking its cut from the money raised by people with disabilities - money which should go to improving their living standard and not into government coffers?

     Do you stand by your promise that the price of books and other publications won't increase by anything like the full 10 per cent of the GST?
     Are you aware of a report in this week's Inside Canberra , also carried in your own flyer, that the price of some publications issued under your finance portfolio has just increased by up to 7 per cent, with a full 10 per cent for the GST on top of that for the six months after 1 July?
     Prime Minister, if your own Finance Department is defying you by whacking on the full 10 per cent GST, how can you expect Australian book publishers to do any different?

     Prime Minister, earlier this week you confirmed your election promise on petrol prices saying, `Introduction of the new tax system and the application of the GST of itself would not lead to price increases.
    ' In light of that statement, let me ask again the part of the question you failed to answer.
     When you cut the excise, will you base it on the highest pump price in regional Australia so there are no GST price rises anywhere, or will you base it on an average pump price inclusive of the metropolitan price so that it does not cost you revenue?
     Which promise will you keep - no petrol price rise anywhere or no more cost to revenue?

     I am more than willing to give an undertaking that I, my current staff and my former staff will give the Auditor-General all available assistance?
    In light of this commitment, why did you wait until late last evening before informing the House that there was correspondence in your office which goes directly to the allegation that members of the MRI negotiating task force took advantage of inside information for their own commercial benefit?
     For how long have you and your office been sitting on this serious evidence of insider trading?
     Did you instruct your staff to provide this and all other relevant evidence to the Auditor-General?

     Minister, I refer to your repeated assertion that allegations of misconduct in relation to MRI machines have been anonymous and unsubstantiated and made on the basis of professional rivalry.
     Before making this assertion, why did you not call for your department's files or, at the very least, why did you not seek an assurance from the Secretary to your department that there were no written and signed allegations about this matter?
     Given the revelation that your department has been sitting on a number of these allegations, including the letter from Dr Burgess, why have you not corrected your assertion on any of the 43 subsequent occasions that you have been questioned about this scam in the parliament over the last nine months?

     Minister, is it a fact that you provided the trigger for radiologists to backdate their MRI contracts when you created the opportunity for other radiologists in the know, their competitors, to take advantage of inside prior knowledge of your 1998 budget decision?
     Isn't it a fact that you neglected to ensure that the radiologists in the MRI negotiating task force declared their interests?
     Isn't it a fact that you failed to bind these radiologists to confidentiality and isn't it a fact that you did absolutely nothing to prevent them from obtaining substantial personal gain from their inside knowledge?
     Isn't it also a fact that you failed to set up an investigation when evidence of insider trading first came to light and that you consistently ignored the seriousness of the scam and, even with that letter that you revealed that you had yesterday, you have still left open the question as to whether or not it goes to the Auditor-General?
     Minister, when are you going to stop blaming others for the MRI scam and start taking responsibility yourself?
