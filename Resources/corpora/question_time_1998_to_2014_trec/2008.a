 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The undertakings which we made as the alternative government are as follows: to establish for the first time an independent inquiry into grocery prices - the terms of reference of that inquiry have been set - and, in the case of petrol, to establish a petrol price commissioner. I note for the record that in the period of the previous government, which had more than 11 years to act on both these matters, they did nothing and nothing. I would strongly suggest that the Leader of the Opposition reflects on the performance of his government in relation to these matters before reflecting on what might be achieved through both of the measures which we promised in opposition and have delivered on.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Here in this parliament today we have had an opportunity to recognise the stolen generations and to deliver an apology on behalf of the parliament. As I indicated - and I believe the Leader of the Opposition did as well - this, however, is but a first step. The second step is much harder, much more difficult, and it goes to the question of what we now do in closing the gap, bridging the gap, between Indigenous Australia and non-Indigenous Australia. We need to make real progress in each of these areas, whether it is education, whether it is health outcomes or whether it is overall life expectancy. The commitment we have in each of these areas in closing the gap is clear-cut.As I argued earlier today, unless we have clear-cut targets in each of these areas, we will not meet them. There will be no central organising principle for our policies. So, when it comes to life expectancy for Aboriginal people, we should set ourselves a target of, within a generation, reducing that atrocious gap of 17 years which now exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. On top of that, we should also have as our objective halving the current attainments when it comes to literacy and numeracy against the current level of nonattainment on the part of young Aboriginal children out there in the schools and communities and, in some cases, not attending schools as well. The appalling statistic when it comes to infant mortality for Indigenous children under the age of five is, again, to halve that within a 10-year period.These are policy objectives. The hard bit now is implementing programs on the ground which will give effect to them. What I suggested earlier today was to let us take just one of those areas, which is how we deal with young children. The objective that we have set for ourselves by way of policy is to make sure that every Indigenous child at four years of age in the next five years is properly accommodated in early childhood education. We must make that the first step forward in ensuring that little ones are put on the path to better educational attainment and that, subsequent to that, with each of those young children, little children out there in remote communities, we then provide each step along the way the next year of educational opportunity for them, and then further to provide through that a platform for the delivery of effective primary healthcare programs for those young children. If we are serious about the policy objectives that we have set, we must begin with little children, and that is the resolve of the government which I have the privilege of leading in this place.The final point that I would mention in response to the honourable member's question is this: as I indicated in my remarks earlier today, I look forward to the possibility of establishing a joint policy commission with the opposition on this. This is something new in the public administration of Australia. We have never done this before. The object here is to take this one area of the public policy debate of Australia and just see what we can do to transcend the partisan divide. What I would like to do before the end of this week is to sit down with the Leader of the Opposition to work out how such a commission might work involving him and me as its joint chairs, with this core term of reference: to develop a housing strategy which will deal with the housing needs of Indigenous communities in remote areas across Australia. If we prevail on that, let us add to it a further item, a further term of reference - that is, to work on the overall project of effecting constitutional recognition of Aboriginal people. If we can get that right between us in this parliament, we would have made a strong step forward not only when it comes to the interests and wellbeing of Indigenous people in Australia but also in doing something new in how we go about the public administration of the Commonwealth in areas which should transcend the partisan divide.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member's question, I would have thought all of us in this place would know that public economic enemy No. 1 across Australia right now is inflation. I would have thought that the common resolve of the parliament, and all people responsibly contributing to public policy in this parliament, would be to do what we all can in the fight against inflation. Let us deal with some facts first. As of the December quarter last year, the underlying inflation rate delivered by the then data tells us that inflation as of when this government took office was running at its highest annualised rate in 16 years. That is a fact from the ABS, not a piece of politics from the Australian Labor Party or this government. That is a fact from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, however uncomfortable members opposite may find it. That is the first point.The second is that, if you reflect on the further facts contained in the Reserve Bank of Australia monetary policy bulletin released only a few days ago and the inflation projections contained in that document going out not just to 2008 but to the end of 2009 and the beginning of 2010, they are projecting an inflation number in excess of the three per cent band. This is the inflation reality we inherited from the previous government. It is a fact contained in the data produced by the ABS. It is a fact reflected in the forward projections independently by the Reserve Bank of Australia.The government of Australia has been in office for 72 days. If you look at the Reserve Bank warnings to the government which preceded us, going back for more than two to three years, there were 20 warnings on capacity constraints in the economy and each of those warning was ignored by the government which preceded us. The government which I lead has embarked upon a course of action to deal with, first and foremost, skills constraints in the economy. Second, we will deal with infrastructure bottlenecks - critical, ignored for a long period of time as far as the national government is concerned. And third, and also critical, when it comes to proper, prudent conservative management of the public finances of the Commonwealth, we have set ourselves early a budget surplus target of 1.5 per cent of GDP at least to be delivered in the upcoming budget. This is responsible in terms of the proper management of public finance, responsible when it comes to public savings, responsible in terms of our five-point plan against inflation dealing with the encouragement of private savings and responsible also on the supply side of the economy - skills, infrastructure and workforce participation - where, regrettably after 11Â½ long years of the coalition in office, there is so little to show for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The situation in East Timor today, as we are advised, is stable but tense. Our security forces and diplomatic personnel are keeping the government informed of developments but, as we know from previous experience, while things may be calm now there is no way of predicting firmly how they may unfold in the days ahead.As we know, on 11 February there were assassination attempts on both the President and the Prime Minister of East Timor. This government has utterly condemned those actions and, in doing so, has been supported appropriately by the opposition. On 11 February I spoke on two occasions with the East Timorese Prime Minister, Xanana Gusmao, and he made two requests of the government in relation to both military assets and police resources. As a consequence of that, the National Security Committee of Cabinet agreed to both those requests.On 12 February the troops which were to form part of the additional deployment to East Timor were dispatched, and they arrived in Dili yesterday at company strength. Today the AFP deployment will be increased by something in the order of 50 additional AFP personnel. Taking these two additional deployments together, it will mean the total Australian troop strength in East Timor will stand at something like 1,000 and the AFP component something like 100. On top of that, because of the additional logistical requirements of our force in being on the ground in East Timor, the decision has also been taken, in consultation with the government of East Timor, to have HMAS Perth lie offshore to provide any assistance as may be required.The Minister for Foreign Affairs travelled to Darwin yesterday and, as I understand it, met with his East Timorese counterpart. We are still deeply concerned in this place about the health, condition and struggle which the President of East Timor, Jose Ramos Horta, is currently engaged in following the assassination attempt on him on 11 February. All medical resources which can be deployed to assist him since that event occurred have been deployed. Our thoughts and our prayers go with him in his fight for recovery. It is a tough fight, and he is a friend of so many people in this parliament on both sides that we wish him and his family well.I conclude in response to the honourable member's question by saying that those in East Timor should be aware of one central fact: the government of Australia remains resolutely committed to use all powers within its possession to reinforce that democratically elected government and will not restrain itself in the future in providing further assistance to the government of East Timor should those requests be forthcoming and reasonable.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. I think the first thing to be said is that Australian working families deserve a fair and balanced industrial relations system, and they will get one from the Rudd government. They will get a fair and balanced industrial relations system. Those on the other side are pretty famous for making all sorts of ridiculous statements about industrial relations systems, interest rates and wages. All through last year the member for North Sydney, for example, was making claims that Work Choices would produce higher wages. Now those in the opposition are trying to claim that somehow the abolition of Work Choices will produce higher wages. This is simply voodoo economics. They do not know whether they are Arthur or whether they are Martha when it comes to industrial relations. Half of the opposition frontbench want to support our abolition of Work Choices and half of them want to oppose it. -  - I do take statements from the Reserve Bank very seriously. I take them very seriously when they talk about inflationary pressures in the Australian economy. I take them very seriously. But the facts are these: following the introduction of Work Choices the Australian people had six interest rate rises. There have been seven interest rate rises driven by inflation in the Australian economy in the last three years - seven interest rate rises driven by elevated inflation. Why is the Reserve Bank important here? Because its job is to target inflation. That is what its job is: to target inflation. - I am here to talk about our industrial relations package, our repeal of Work Choices. Our industrial relations reforms will improve the functioning of the labour market. - We will invest in skills. We will attend to labour productivity. That is what we will be doing. Our industrial relations system -  -  - We do take the issue of inflation very seriously. It erodes living conditions. It attacks wages. It really is a threat to the sustained growth of the Australian economy. Our industrial relations system will guard against wage inflation because it will be underpinned by workplace-level enterprise bargaining. That is what it will be underpinned by, meaning changes in wages must be linked to productivity. That is what our system will do. And it will provide flexibility at the individual level. This government will put in place a fair and balanced industrial relations system. Along with our investment in skills, we will do everything we can to lift productivity in this economy. Nothing is more important in the fight against inflation than improving our productivity performance, and all of our package is aimed at doing that. - Yes, they are.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. I note the interest of members in the House in the question of fighting inflation. As members in the House would be aware, one of the key problems in fighting inflation is the skills crisis. We of course know that wage pressures are most acute in those segments of the economy where skills shortages are most acute. Consequently, if we are to fight inflation, we need to fight inflation by ensuring that we are investing in skills development, particularly in those sectors which are facing acute shortages.Given the interest of the current opposition in the question of inflation, they may try to explain to the Australian community at some point why it is that we are facing such critical skills shortages in the economy after 11 years of their government. The current Leader of the Opposition and the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition, as the last two education ministers of this country, may choose to explain their personal complicity in creating these skills shortages which are putting upwards pressure on inflation. It would be a very interesting explanation to hear, given their interest in inflationary pressures. Of course, we know that these skills shortages were unaddressed by the former government, unaddressed by the current Leader of the Opposition and unaddressed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. They have come to the Rudd Labor government to be addressed - and be addressed they will.Today it was my pleasure to introduce into the House a bill to create our new leadership body, Skills Australia. Skills Australia will be fighting the inflation challenge by ensuring that we have additional training places available to get people skilled up in the areas of the economy where we need them most. Skills Australia will guide the allocation of the Rudd Labor government's 450,000 additional training places over the next four years. So serious is the Rudd Labor government about fighting the inflation challenge and ensuring that we are addressing the skills crisis left to us as a legacy by the former Howard government, the current Leader of the Opposition and the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition that 20,000 of these places will be made available in April.This is part of the Rudd Labor government's five-point plan to address inflation. Of course, the other components - setting a fiscal target for the surplus of 1.5 per cent of GDP, increasing incentives for private savings, taking an active role to address infrastructure bottlenecks and looking at ways to lift workforce participation - are the things that the Rudd Labor government needs to do to fight inflation. There is no greater challenge than the skills challenge. It has been left to us as a legacy and, yes, we are going to fix it, and we started today.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to receive a question on this issue. The government did not cancel the $65 million in works. As stated before the election, we will spend $15 million for the Australian Rail Track Corporation to do a detailed study. Work done so far has identified a preferred far-western subcorridor. Our study will finalise the alignment within the corridor, identify planning and environmental issues and look at cost and demand for the line.The previous government had brought forward money to do work on the existing track at the same time as the study was being done. That is putting the cart before the horse. You need to know where the line is going before you fund the building of the line. The government is not alone in thinking that this is appropriate. Everald Compton, Director of the Australian Inland Rail Expressway, said on ABC Radio New England just this week:I am not shedding a single tear over the deferment of this $65 million because we never ever asked for it in the first place and I approve of what the government is doing to defer expenditure that is not needed while we tackle the inflation situation in Australia.So I say to the Leader of the National Party, who is profligate with taxpayers' funds - of course, we know about the National Party and the way that they abused taxpayer funds through programs such as the 'regional rorts program' -  -  - In his support for the government's position, Everald Compton went on to say, 'The inland railway is alive and well.' The fact is that the government has instituted a study for an inland railway, something that in the first 12 years of the Howard government they did not get around to doing. They did not do anything to build the railway; they did not do anything to plan the railway. Our position recognises commonsense: that you need to have the study, get the planning right, get the details right and then assess the project properly and be prudent with taxpayers' funds - not make, in the lead-up to an election when you know you are about to go out the backdoor, irresponsible promises to fund projects before you have funded the study to show where the projects will be built.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The government is fundamentally optimistic about the future of the Australian economy. We do recognise that unemployment is low. We do recognise that we are in our 17th year of continuous economic growth. As I move around Australia talking to people in the board rooms, talking to people in the lunch rooms, talking to CEOs, talking to regulators or talking to working families, two things are very clear to me: No. 1 is that there is an increasingly uncertain global outlook - and we are certainly not immune from the fallout of that uncertain global outlook; and No. 2 is that we face an extended level of inflation. We face, for a period to come, high inflation. That is what the Reserve Bank's statement on monetary policy earlier in the week was all about.The fact is that inflation will be elevated above the Reserve Bank's target band for at least another two years. We had the December quarter figures from the bureau back in January, figures which put the level of underlying inflation at a 16-year high. So there is no doubt that, in addition to the problems internationally, which will produce a slow down internationally and will have a flow-on effect to this country, we have an elevated level of domestic inflation, which is at a 16-year high, and the Reserve Bank is now saying that it will be above the target band for at least another two years.That is a very sobering assessment of the Australian economy because it points to a number of things. It points to the fact that, as a nation, we have to do something to bring inflation down if we want to avoid further interest rate rises. There were 10 interest rate rises on the trot under the previous government - 11 in total. This country has faced seven interest rate rises in the last three years. Those interest rate rises have been derived principally from an elevated level of inflation, which has been caused by a number of factors. The first factor is the one that the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government talked about before - capacity constraints in this economy, particularly infrastructure capacity constraints and infrastructure bottlenecks. It is true that over a three-year period the previous government received 20 warnings about the impact of capacity constraints relating to infrastructure bottlenecks. The elevated level of inflation was caused not just by what is going on in infrastructure but also by the inattention of the former government and its complacent approach to skills formation - the complacent approach of the opposition to skills formation over a prolonged period of time. Lastly, it was caused by reckless spending by the previous government over a period of time. All of that has produced an elevated level of inflation which must be dealt with. This is why the Rudd government began work on day 1 - on 25 November last year - to tackle this inflation problem. We began work on day 1.Members opposite behave as if somehow inflation magically just appeared on Monday morning, at 9 o'clock, on 26 November last year. Well, it didn't! Inflation has been rising for a long period of time because of the inattention and complacency of the previous government to capacity constraints in the economy - to skills, to infrastructure - and also because they engaged in reckless spending. This document from the Reserve Bank shows conclusively that the complacency of the previous government has led to the inflation threat that this government now must deal with. And deal with it we will. This is why the Prime Minister announced his five-point plan in Perth a couple of weeks ago. It is very important that we as a nation come together and deal with this inflationary threat. We on this side of the House have accepted responsibility for fixing it. I just wish those on the other side of the House would accept some responsibility for creating it.</DOC>

 - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for your guidance on those sorts of matters. It is my great pleasure to say today that I introduced into this parliament legislation to begin transitioning Australian workplaces to a fair and balanced industrial relations system. For the edification of the shadow Treasurer, it will be a decentralised system built on enterprise-level cooperation and on rewarding productivity in workplaces. It will be impossible under Labor's system for a wage outcome in one enterprise to flow through automatically to wage outcomes in other enterprises. The system will give Australians a safety net on which they can rely and, when Labor's system is in full operation, there will be no individual statutory employment agreements, no Australian workplace agreements, that can override the safety net and strip away aspects of the safety net.I say to the shadow Treasurer, who says he is concerned about the inflation challenge: if he looks at the statistics to see who in our workforce has had the greatest uptake of AWAs, the most AWAs imposed on them, it is workers in the retail sector and in the hospitality sector. If the shadow Treasurer wants to advance to the Australian people that the way to fight inflation is to take away a safety net for low-wage, predominantly young workers in those industries - with some of the horror stories that we have heard about 17-year-olds, 18-year-olds and 19-year-olds having basic conditions like redundancy pay ripped off them, and they can still be ripped off people today - he can put that case. But we will be saying that the inflation challenge in the labour market is a product of the skills shortage.When I introduced the legislation today in the House, I did three things that the Howard government did not do in the last parliament. First, I brought a piece of workplace relations legislation to the parliament that has the mandate of the Australian people -  Applause from the gallery -  
 - The Howard government did not take Work Choices to the Australian people, because they knew it would be rejected. They snuck it in after the last election; they did not bring a piece of legislation to this parliament with the mandate of the Australian people. - I am sure we will all live in fear of the dimension of the member for O'Connor's cheer squad when it turns up. - Back to workplace relations. The second thing that happened today when I introduced that piece of workplace relations legislation was that I brought a bill to this parliament that was a product of genuine consultation. That is not something that the Howard government did in the last parliament. It did not believe in consulting with those who have expertise on industrial relations. Specifically, the bill went to the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council and its subcommittee, the committee on industrial legislation. With those experts from employer and employee organisations sitting around a table, the bill was improved. That is the benefit of consultation. The consultation continued with state workplace relations ministers. Of course, the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations never sat around a table with his ministerial colleagues - not once. This bill was the subject of discussion at the Workplace Relations Ministerial Council, and the council fulsomely endorsed the Rudd Labor government's policy directions and our intention to go forward with fairness.The third thing we did today was something else the Howard government would never have believed in doing. The Rudd Labor government led by example positively in the area of workplace relations when we announced that, from today, the government will not make new Australian workplace agreements in the Australian Public Service. We are leading by example to achieve a workplace relations system in which such agreements will be gone.There appears to be some delusion going on in sections of the opposition benches. There appear to be people who have forgotten the year 2007. I know that for some of them it is a set of painful memories -  - And I appreciate that the opposition does not like to be reminded of 2007. But the delusion that is happening on the opposition benches is that somehow the workplace relations debate in 2007 was not about Work Choices and not about the abolition of Australian workplace agreements and the eradication of all individual statutory employment agreements from Australia's workplace relations system. That was the government's policy which was put to the people in our policy documents, and the bill today implements it.I was asked about certainty for employers and employees as we move forward on industrial relations with our bill. Our bill came to the parliament today. The last time this parliament dealt with a piece of industrial relations legislation, we dealt with the then government's so-called fairness test. I remind the House that the so-called fairness test was processed within four sitting weeks, inclusive of a Senate inquiry. The then government, the now opposition, believed that four sitting weeks was an appropriate length of time, inclusive of a Senate inquiry, for parliamentary scrutiny of a piece of industrial relations legislation. That was in circumstances where they had announced their policy intentions in early May and the bill came to the parliament in late May.We announced our policy intentions in April and provided implementation details of our policy in August. If four weeks was good enough for the processing of the so-called fairness test, inclusive of a Senate inquiry, then it is good enough for the processing of Labor's legislation. The members opposite, including most particularly the Manager of Opposition Business in the House, must agree that that is an appropriate time, because that is the time he provided when he was Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. We therefore look to the opposition to facilitate passage of this legislation, inclusive of any Senate inquiry, before Easter.I say to every member of the House that, if Labor's legislation is unduly delayed beyond that point, it is not the Labor Party that they on the opposition benches are frustrating; it is the will of the Australian people who voted for this when they voted at the last election. If there is any worker who is offered an Australian workplace agreement and has to take it in that time, who gets a take it or leave it AWA put in front of them that rips off a basic condition like redundancy pay, if the opposition has manipulated it to extend the time of Work Choices, that Australian will know exactly who ripped those conditions off them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question because it goes to the question of how we monitor and implement effectively the arrangements we supported on a bipartisan basis in this place last year concerning the Northern Territory intervention. We will continue with that implementation. We will, as we undertook to do prior to the election, monitor the effectiveness of that implementation at the 12-month point. We anticipate that review to occur some time around the end of the third quarter of this year. That will cover all the measures which were imposed at that time and review the effectiveness of the various education, health and policing programs which form part of the intervention.More broadly on the question of how we deal effectively with Indigenous communities and education outcomes, we on this side of the House - as I hope we all concluded from this morning's deliberations - welcome any positive suggestions from anyone in the community about how we can achieve better education outcomes for Indigenous children. As I said quite frankly, about both the government that the honourable member himself was part of and other previous governments, state and federal, none of us -  I repeat, none of us - have got this right. It is time to put it beyond the partisan divide and to try to get it right.In the middle of April we will convene here an Australian 2020 summit. I have invited the Leader of the Opposition to attend that, and I look forward to his participation. One of the working groups within that summit will canvass very widely and very broadly all innovative proposals from across the Australian community on how to achieve better education and health outcomes in Indigenous communities. If, as consequence of that summit or in response to the monitoring and evaluation of the intervention in the Northern Territory, we come up with new approaches for the future, we will pursue them.As for the intervention itself and any reservations we had about it, we articulated our reservations prior to the election and, since the election, we have implemented changes, and they refer to the CDEP and permits in particular. The rest of that intervention is on track. We will monitor its effectiveness and then determine an appropriate course of action for the Northern Territory and the rest of Indigenous Australia in the future. So many people are depending on us all to get it right.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I do indeed have big task, and I thank the Prime Minister for the appointment. I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. A central part of the Prime Minister's five-point plan to fight inflation and boost productivity is the creation of Infrastructure Australia. We must take a nationally coordinated approach to tackling infrastructure bottlenecks, which are causing inflationary pressure. Infrastructure Australia will develop a strategic blueprint for our nation's infrastructure and will drive investment where it is needed most.Bottlenecks and urban congestion slow down our economy and create inflationary pressures - something the Reserve Bank has warned about on 20 separate occasions. Australia's bandwidth lags at 25th amongst all developed economies. Too many working families are spending more time stuck in their cars on clogged freeways than they are able to spend with their children. In the areas of water, energy and land transport alone, CEDA has estimated that we have a $25 billion backlog. Infrastructure shortfalls are costing us 0.8 per cent of GDP, or some $8 billion.So it is not surprising that key industry groups, such as the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group, CEDA, Engineers Australia and Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, have over a number of years called for the creation of a body that would coordinate and drive infrastructure provision from the national level. Infrastructure Australia will do just that. The government committed to creating a federal infrastructure department, and we have done that. The government committed to appointing a federal infrastructure minister, and on 3 December we did that. The government committed to creating Infrastructure Australia within the first 100 days of the election of a Rudd Labor government, and we have done that too.On 20 December, the Prime Minister and other senior ministers sat down with their state and territory counterparts at COAG and decided to end the blame game when it came to infrastructure provision. They established the COAG infrastructure working group, which I chaired at its first meeting on 23 January, to collectively get together, to get results and end the blame game. On 21 January, cabinet agreed to the structure and functions of Infrastructure Australia. Next week I will introduce into the House the Infrastructure Australia Bill and I call upon the opposition to support that legislation. Infrastructure Australia will not just draw upon expertise from the three levels of government; most significantly, it will involve the private sector front and centre. Five of the members of that advisory council will come from the private sector, including the chair.Infrastructure Australia will conduct a comprehensive audit of our infrastructure capacity as we have now and our future needs. It will deliver an infrastructure priority list so that we can create a pipeline of projects. Critically, Infrastructure Australia will develop guidelines and principles for the assessment of public-private partnerships that are nationally consistent. It will provide advice about removing barriers and disincentives to investment in infrastructure and about policy and regulatory reforms so that our infrastructure networks are used efficiently. It will streamline planning and approval processes across Commonwealth and state jurisdictions. It will standardise tender documents and contracts to promote best practice procurement and to expedite decision making. Infrastructure Australia is an important economic reform that has been applauded by the business community because it will be able to drive investment in nationally significant infrastructure.</DOC>

I am further informed that, at the time when a large part of the rest of the gathered throng in the Great Hall turned their backs at a particular point of the Leader of the Opposition's speech, the two members of my staff in question did so as well. -  - I am further informed of these matters by my chief of staff, who has spoken to the two individuals concerned -  - My chief of staff has advised me that these two individuals, at his decision, have been counselled. I understand further that the two individuals, if they have not done so already, will be corresponding with the Leader of the Opposition to extend an appropriate apology. - </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, may I add my congratulations to those of others on your elevation to the speakership. I want to thank the member for Calwell for her question. This question has enormous significance in her electorate, where mortgage stress has increased by 82 per cent between 2001 and 2006 and where almost half of households are in rental stress. Indeed, Calwell has the highest rate of rental stress of any electorate in Victoria. Of course, it is not the Lone Ranger in terms of nonaffordability. Under the previous government we saw rent stress go up, we saw mortgage stress go up, we saw homelessness go up, we saw home repossessions go up, we saw housing affordability go down and we saw first homeownership go down. - I think it is important to understand the very difficult context that we are working in. - In 1996 the average home cost four times the average annual wage; in 2007 the average home cost seven years worth of the average annual wage. Housing affordability is at its worst point in Australian history. Indeed, Australians now spend about $30 out of every $100 on their mortgage repayments.The member for O'Connor then left the chamber. - This is a problem that the previous government were in denial about for a decade; they still do not admit that housing affordability is a problem in this country. I am painting a picture for them to explain that housing affordability is at its worst ever. Today, home buyers spend $30 out of every $100 they earn repaying their mortgage. In 1996 it was less than $18 out of every $100. -  - It is interesting that the opposition should ask how we are going to fix this, because in the 10 years of their government there was not a housing minister nor a housing policy. They have got a shadow housing minister now, and I welcome her to the position. Indeed, it is a very important position. I hope that she will be able to convince her colleagues that this is an issue for this country. -  - It is harder to find a place to rent and it is more expensive when you do find a place. Many young Australians have given up on their dream of home ownership. Before the last election, the Labor Party came up with a number of very important policies to address these issues. Indeed, at its first meeting, the Council of Australian Governments made it a priority for the states and the Commonwealth to work together, and we are, right now, implementing those election policies. The National Rental Affordability Scheme includes a payment from the Commonwealth and a payment from the states to draw in private sector investment. There will be 50,000 new, affordable private rental properties. - Our Housing Affordability Fund is a $Â½ billion program that will address some of the high infrastructure charges that we see around the country and some of the planning delays that we have. - Our policy is to release excess Commonwealth land. The states have been writing to the Commonwealth about some of these parcels of Commonwealth land for years, asking, 'Please can we buy this land?' They have not even had the courtesy of a reply from the previous government. We also have our National Housing Supply Research Council, our $150 million policy to build more homes for the homeless and our First Home Saver Accounts.The Treasurer and I last week released our discussion paper on the First Home Saver Accounts. These new accounts will help hundreds of thousands of young Australians to save a deposit for their first home. We know how important savings are. The previous government obviously had no interest in increasing national savings. We know how important it is to save a deposit for the first home. The total proportion borrowed to buy the home will lessen, mortgage repayments will lessen and mortgage insurance will lessen. First Home Saver Accounts will see the government invest $850 million over their first four years of operation to help first home buyers save a bigger deposit for their first home. I understand better than anyone that housing affordability is a complex problem. There is no silver bullet solution. -  - I said it a hundred times before the election. We announced before the election and we have delivered on our housing affordability plans for this nation. As the first housing minister in a decade, I am pleased to say that with these policies in operation we will begin to make a dent on housing affordability for first home buyers, for renters and for people who rely on community and public housing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question on a very, very important subject, particularly as it has to do with economic development and the participation of Indigenous Australians in the economic boom that is taking place in many parts of Australia that neighbour Indigenous communities. - This is an important issue - and I will come to the permits issue, which is a critical matter that the government has a commitment to. I might just remind the honourable member that at the time of the election on 24 November the permit system was still in place. The permit system has remained in place for the last 11 years. I think that fact needs to be remembered before we go any further.On the issue of economic development, as I said, this government is strongly committed to making sure that Indigenous Australians are able to participate as much as possible in the economic boom that is taking place. The Minister for Resources and Energy and I just recently went to the Pilbara to make sure that we were able to understand, as quickly as possible in our new portfolios, how we could assist the mining industry to deliver on the commitments that they have to Indigenous Australians to make sure that Indigenous Australians can get the jobs that are available in many of these mining communities. We are determined to work with the mining industry, the forestry industry, the tourism industry and all of the industries that are now recognising that many Indigenous people want to be part of this economic boom. We will certainly do everything we can to make those opportunities come alive.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for that question. I know that she has a keen interest in the government's commitment to ending commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean, as do the majority of Australians. I want to assure the House that the Australian government is resolutely opposed to commercial whaling in whatever guise, even under the guise of science. The government has an increased range of measures that it has identified and undertaken. They include a serious and careful assessment of international legal options, a reinvigorated approach to the International Whaling Commission and, importantly and critically, in an unprecedented act, close, first time monitoring of the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean.We respect the important, long-term cultural and trade ties that we have with Japan, but we do want to say clearly that that relationship is strong enough to withstand disagreement around this particular specific issue. On 21 December we led a demarche - a strong diplomatic protest - to the Japanese. It was the largest of its kind, involving some 30 or more nations, including the European Commission. I have written to Japan's minister for agriculture, forestry and fisheries to voice my concerns. My colleagues the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade have also represented Australia's views at the highest levels and, at the same time, we are bringing proposals to modernise the International Whaling Commission. I have also asked my department to commission a report on the global conservation status of whales and dolphins and, importantly, the economic benefits of living cetaceans - including whale watching, which is an important industry here in Australia, and people on the coast will, I think, know that.The Australian government's action, for the first time, to directly monitor the Antarctic whaling fleet using Australia's Customs ship, the Oceanic Viking, enables us to collect information which could be used in the event of possible legal action in the future. These are the commitments that we took to the last election and they are commitments that we are delivering on. Notwithstanding the fact that there is strong Australian support for clear action against commercial whaling, I cannot help noticing that the member for Flinders has been out and about saying that the government is not serious about this issue. He has been talking about ghost ships and ghost planes and delays in monitoring the fleet. Let us be very clear about it: there has been a delay in monitoring the Japanese whaling fleets in waters to our south. It has been an 11 year delay and it is a delay that was underway with this government.The member for Flinders was at it again last night talking about patterns of deception. I want to make it perfectly clear to the member that the prime purpose of Australia's activities in the Southern Ocean is to ensure that we have the necessary and relevant information to consider the possibility of future legal actions, something which the previous government, of which he was a member, never had the confidence to take on board.Can I say lastly to the House and to the people of Australia that this is a difficult issue, but it is not business as usual for the Rudd Labor government. This government is taking on the difficult issues. They are not going to go away, and our resolute opposition to commercial whaling in any guise means that we will continue to pursue this issue in a way which will bring confidence to the Australian people that we are serious about this matter.</DOC>

 - I will respond to the Leader of the Opposition's question in these terms: I understand that these matters were the subject of extensive and spirited debate in the House last night, and I understand that there have been extensive and spirited discussions between both the Leader of the House and his inestimable opposition counterpart. But the proposal we have put forward is that Fridays be backbenchers' days, an opportunity for backbenchers in this House to advance the legitimate interests of their constituents. We regard this as an important opportunity for backbenchers to bring to the attention of the nation's parliament the concerns in their local communities. I recall that in recent years, when I was sitting on benches opposite and when I was a backbencher, the opportunities to bring to the attention of this chamber the concerns of my constituents were often constrained by the general business of the House. I believe the innovation put forward by the Leader of the House and fully supported by the government are appropriate in providing a proper, decent national platform for backbenchers seeking to bring to the nation's parliament the concerns of their constituents on local matters. I support this extension of the democratic forum of the House to local backbenchers, and I would hope that it is properly used by both government and opposition members.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her important question and also for the very hard work that she does with local youth in her electorate. In responding to this question, can I first acknowledge that it would not be possible for me to be here outlining this government's commitment to giving young people a voice, and then listening to it and acting upon it, if it were not for the leadership of the Prime Minister in re-establishing the position of a federal Minister for Youth. The position of federal Minister for Youth is, of course, one which was abolished by the former government. This is just the first example of the different approach that this government intends to take when it comes to youth representation.We believe that young people play a vital role in our community, that they must be listened to and that their experiences and opinions must be included in the democratic process. Too often in this parliament we talk about the youth of Australia being this country's future - and this of course is true - but what we must also recognise is the important role that young people play in the present and how their experiences, circumstances and opinions must be included in debates in this place. We must recognise that there is a generational divide, which is widening, amongst the Australian community. Generations coming through have different circumstances, different opinions and different concerns to those of previous generations. This is true when you look at the experiences of young people today in attaining first home ownership. It is also true when you look at the experiences of those who are entering adulthood already with hefty debts on their shoulders from their education. And it is also true when you look at concerns about issues like climate change. These are the people who will be experiencing the consequences of the actions that we take today.In recognising all of these points, this government is acting to establish the Office for Youth. This office will have the role of examining all government priorities, all government policies going forward, so that we can make sure that across all of government the impact on young people will be considered in the policy-making process. In addition to establishing the Office for Youth, this government is also committed to delivering upon our election commitment to establish the Australian Youth Forum. This will be a body by which young people - a broad and diverse range of young people - can come together and talk directly to government about their views and concerns. This will operate all year round and will be an important way in which young people can speak directly to government and have those concerns addressed and responded to by all of our ministers. The Australian Youth Forum will also play the important role of providing a body of experts in youth policy and young people whom we will talk to directly about our priorities and how they will impact on their lives. These are some of the ways in which we will be giving young people a voice going forward.As to the more immediate future, can I also say that I have been absolutely amazed by the number of people who have contacted me just in the last couple of months to talk about the impacts of the voluntary student unionism legislation which was introduced by the previous government. These concerns have come not just from students - and certainly students have been amongst that group - but also from vice-chancellors, sporting organisations, local councils and a whole range of people in the broader community. One of the things that I am embarking upon in the immediate future is to visit campuses throughout Australia to talk to the different stakeholders, assess the impacts of the damage caused by the VSU legislation and work with these stakeholders so we can ensure that students in Australia have the services and representation that they need on campus. Young Australians have been silenced for far too long. It is my great pleasure as the Minister for Youth to make sure that not only do they have a strong voice in government but also that it is listened to and responded to by this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. My recollection is that in this House we have never had parliament sit on a Friday. You were in government for 11 years and there was no sitting on a Friday. This government extends the democratic opportunities to members of parliament to be here on a Friday to raise the concerns of their local members. We have done that, it is a reform and I commend it to the House for its support.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In the light of our democracy it is important to be up-front and direct with the Australian people about what you commit to prior to an election and what you then implement subsequent to an election. Honouring commitments to the Australian people, not consigning them to boxes called 'core promises' and 'non-core promises', is in fact the lifeblood of an effectively operating democracy. We ask ourselves why cynicism emerges in the Australian community about the operation of this place. It goes to the practices that we have seen so often in the past whereby things were consigned to the dustbin of history once governments got past the day of the election itself. That period of core and non-core promises sits squarely in the mind and the recollection of the Australian people.On education, we said before the election that we would establish a National Curriculum Board to deliver for the first time in Australia's history a national education curriculum for schools. We have implemented that; we have appointed the board. That is the No. 1 first achievement and the first time that a government of Australia has actually taken steps to bring about a national curriculum in this country through the agency of a national board.Secondly, on the question of infrastructure, we committed to the Australian people to establish Infrastructure Australia. In the first or second cabinet meeting of this government we took a decision to proceed with that and, as the minister for infrastructure just said, that legislation will be introduced in a matter of days or weeks. We will for the first time in the history of the Commonwealth have the national government taking national leadership in the provision and planning of infrastructure across this country. That is the second commitment honoured.Thirdly, on the question of broadband, as a result of regulatory advice from the ACCC and decisions taken based on that on the part of the minister for communications, we have the ADSL2+ rollout by Telstra, which brings higher speed broadband to up to 2.4 million extra Australians - one instalment in terms of the much larger program of reform we have in mind when it comes to the overall rollout of fibre optic to the node broadband services across Australia.On health we committed to the Australian people before the election that for the first time the national government would provide incentive payments to the states to do something about elective surgery waiting lists - a matter of deep concern to working families across Australia. In the past the response has been to blame the states. Labor have taken the attitude: what do we do to fix it? Therefore, we took a decision to provide incentive payments up-front. The sum of $150 million has been committed and that money is beginning to flow. That is the fourth commitment honoured. Then we go to the whole question of what we do more broadly with the states and territories. We said that we wanted to get -  -  - I hear the interjection opposite that we should get rid of the states and territories. Would the member who made that interjection like to put their hand up so that we see what strong federalists we have on the part of the conservative parties of Australia. When it comes to making the federation work, it is along these lines: either you can cooperate or you can simply engage in the blame game. What did we do? Within three weeks of taking office, Labor convened a meeting of the Council of Australian Governments and established seven groups to deliver real outcomes in health, education and in other areas, such as business deregulation, by year's end, with a strict program of COAG meetings to be done throughout this year.On top of that, we turned to our place in the world on Iraq. Prior to the election we committed that when it came to the completion of the rotation of our combat forces in Iraq we would bring our combat forces home. That commitment is being honoured. Together with the Minister for Defence I travelled to Baghdad and spoke to our Iraqi counterparts, as we have spoken to our American counterparts, to negotiate that withdrawal of Australian combat forces - a withdrawal which has come far too late in the piece, given the overall appalling history of the conduct of that war by those who preceded us in this place.On the question of our international environmental policy, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has indicated the actions we have taken on whaling. Prior to the election we committed to the Australian people that we would dispatch Australian national assets to the Southern Ocean to monitor and collect evidence for possible international legal action against Japan with the object of bringing to an end commercial whaling. We have honoured that commitment. The Oceanic Viking has been sent to the South Pacific and it has undertaken the photographic reconnaissance of the type that we promised would occur, and its mission is continuing.Labor said prior to the election that we would bring an end to the Pacific solution. Negotiations have now occurred with relevant ministers of the government both in Papua New Guinea and Nauru to bring the Pacific solution to an end. Those persons who have been incarcerated in those facilities are now no longer there.On the question of the apology to Australia's Indigenous peoples, we said prior to the election that if we were elected as the next government of Australia we would make an apology early in the history of this parliament. We have honoured that commitment to the Australian people.This government has been in office for 72 days. It does not matter whether it is on questions of enhancing the independence of the Reserve Bank, on education, health, climate change and current attempts to bring a cessation to commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean or whether it is on infrastructure, broadband and our place in the world or a decision on the future disposition of our combat forces in Iraq, in 72 days we have implemented each of these commitments to the Australian people. We took those commitments seriously, we have honoured our word to the Australian people and we are proud of having done so.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. When it comes to one of the core sets of factors impacting on the family budget each week, it is the cost of petrol, groceries and mortgages. In each of these areas, the government has advanced plans to the Australian people, and we intend to get on with implementing them. On the first one, when it comes to housing affordability, I note the fact that the government which preceded us had no minister for housing. This government has appointed a minister for housing, and we have already, within the first 72 days of operation of the government's term, outlined how we intend to implement our first home saver accounts. There are a range of other policies on housing affordability, because that goes to the ultimate cost-of-living pressures on working families.Then it goes to the question of petrol. This government has a plan to appoint a petrol price commissioner. Our predecessors - and I notice that the former Treasurer smiles in the seat which he now occupies - in the previous government failed to act decisively when it came to effective monitoring of petrol prices. They failed to do it until, in the middle of last year, we in opposition said that our policy would be to appoint a petrol price commissioner. As a consequence of that, the government, led by the then Treasurer, announced such an inquiry. This government has already undertaken other measures to enhance greater external scrutiny on the oil majors when it comes to the cost of petrol. On grocery prices, we have indicated we will have a -  - The cost-of-living pressures which affect working families are housing mortgages, the cost of petrol and the cost of groceries. On the cost of groceries, over the last 10 years food prices have risen an average annual rate of 3.8 per cent - well above the 2.9 per cent average for the CPI. A large part of the rise in the price of food can be attributed to the drought and high world prices for commodities such as grains. The government is keen to ensure that consumers have access to a competitive market for basic food items.On 22 January 2008, the government directed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to undertake an inquiry into the competitiveness of retail prices for groceries under the Trade Practices Act 1974. Under the TPA the ACCC can monitor prices, costs and profits in any industry or business, as directed, and report the results. The ACCC has been instructed to take a broad approach to its inquiry and ensure all aspects of the grocery supply chain are included, from the farm gate to the checkout point, with the ACCC report due to the government by 31 July 2008. This is action which the previous government never undertook.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. This government was elected on a platform of helping working families under financial pressure. That goes to the core of changing the industrial relations system of this country, an industrial relations system which we inherited which was unfair. Part of unpicking that unfairness lies in today's release of the exposure draft of the National Employment Standards. It is the government's next step in honouring its commitment to build a fair and flexible industrial relations system. It follows the introduction of the government's transition to Forward with Fairness bill into the House yesterday.The government's new workplace relations system will provide a decent safety net for fair minimum pay and conditions for all employees. The government believes in a consultative process and in laying out what it intends to do on the industrial relations blueprint it has for the future. It laid out its workplace relations policies well in advance of the last election in detail - unlike various governments which have preceded us. It has also continued to consult widely and does so through the agency of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations at present. Consistent with that spirit of consultation, the minister is laying out an exposure draft for comment on these important National Employment Standards.The National Employment Standards establish a stronger safety net than existed in the past from the so-called Australian fair pay and conditions standard under Work Choices. For example, under the AFPC, no matter how many hours an employee was being forced to work, an employee could generally not seek relief for working excessive and unreasonable work hours until they had been employed for 12 months. The National Employment Standards make it clear that an employee cannot be asked to work unreasonable hours - period. Flexibility will be retained in modern awards to allow for averaging of hours when that is relevant for particular work arrangements, such as fly-in fly-out arrangements. Such arrangements will be relevant for determining whether the additional hours required are reasonable. That is just one example of how the government's workplace relations system will deliver fair and minimum standards and sensible flexibility for business. We believe in a simpler set of arrangements for business and we believe that it is important to have appropriate responses from industry and from others once this exposure draft is tabled.These National Employment Standards, which are important for all working families - though met with the derision of members of opposite, who seem not to have learned the lesson from the last election when it comes to industrial relations - provide as follows: (1) minimum weekly hours of 38 hours per week plus reasonable additional hours; (2) a right to request flexible working hours for parents of young children; (3) 12 months additional parental leave for families by granting each parent a separate entitlement of up to 12 months unpaid parental leave so that a baby has up to two years continual care from a parent on unpaid leave; (4) annual leave of four weeks per year of service; (5) personal carers leave of 10 days for each year of service; (6) community service leave to allow employees to request absence from work; (7) long service leave arrangements to be protected under a new nationally consistent approach; (8) reasonable notice of termination arrangements and a right to redundancy pay; (9) protection of public holidays; and (10) a right to basic workplace information. These are important reforms for working families right across the country, working families which had inflicted upon them an industrial relations system about which they were not consulted at the last election. They were not consulted one bit. It was imposed on them unilaterally by a government which has now paid the political price for it.But I am asked further whether there are any other measures which the government would embrace and measures which would be supported by members of parliament here on the overall question of how we approach the inflation challenge this year, including wage restraint. In a modest exercise in wage restraint the government has decided to propose to the parliament a regulation which will have the effect of not increasing MPs' salaries through until the middle of next year. Furthermore, the government proposes that, when this measure comes to a close in mid-2009, there be no clawback mechanism for any salary forgone between now and then. This is a modest measure. It does not of itself solve the nation's economic challenges or problems. But it does, I believe, indicate to the public at large that the government - and I hope the parliament - is serious about the overall challenge of wage restraint. Therefore, we are not calling on working families to engage in some sort of freeze on their wage claims or wage outcomes. Working families are already under financial pressure. But we need to be able to face the Australian community in the eye and say that we in the privileged position of this place are doing one small bit when it comes to exercising some wage restraint on our part. I will conclude by saying this. Right across the country and the economy many people have responded to various claims for further CEO salary increases. Markets ultimately determine these things. But, in the difficult challenges we face ahead this year on the economy and inflation, I would hope that those in the most privileged positions in the corporate sector also reflect carefully on the need for CEO wage restraint in the year ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. When the government outlined its five-point plan to tackle inflation earlier this year, restraint in public demand was one of the measures. I will come back to the direct question which the Leader of the Opposition has put forward concerning the budget surplus target for this year. It was one part of a five-part approach. The second related to how we best encourage private savings in the economy, because it is the aggregate of private demand and public demand which of course is one-half of the overall inflation equation. Therefore, restraint is important in both. But that is not the end of the story. The rest of the inflation equation goes to the supply side. It is on the supply side I would commend to the attention of the honourable member that the government which preceded us was most lax indeed. We have been warned on 20 separate occasions by the Reserve Bank on the question of capacity constraints within the economy: skills and infrastructure. Then, on top of that - beyond skills, beyond infrastructure - is the overarching problem also of workforce participation. On these supply-side measures it is not just the Reserve Bank which issued this series of warnings. Many respected economic commentators did the same over a long period of time. And why I suspect those opposite respond so volubly to this argument when it is put forward is they happen to know that it is true. If you look at the content of each of those warnings, the sharpness of the advice which the previous government received from the institution responsible for the conduct of monetary policy in this country, they were ignored - skills, infrastructure and workforce participation.Go back to the first of those elements, which the Leader of the Opposition raised, on how we deal with public demand and the shape of the budget surplus. We have indicated that our target for the year ahead is for a minimum budget surplus of 1.5 per cent. I note for the record that, as the government approached the election, in its official documents it was projecting a budget surplus not in excess of 1.1 per cent. If the government, as it then stood, had a different view of the shape of the budget surplus, which should have pertained in the year ahead, why did it not say so prior to the election? Or was it content simply to continue the spending binge in which it was engaged in the years leading up to the election, in the hope of stealing another election through profligate spending?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his very well put question and the associated remarks. Can I join with the Prime Minister in indicating that the government today has taken another important step forward in the delivery of fairness and balance in Australian workplaces. We have released an exposure draft of our 10 new National Employment Standards. Under Labor's industrial relations system, these will be protections that every working Australian can rely on - protections about hours of work, annual leave, public holidays, personal leave, long service leave and a new category of community service leave. There will be rights to parental leave, including a new right -  - Once again, the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is showing his complete ignorance. There will be a right to parental leave, including a new right to sequencing leave, so that the mother and father of a child, if they choose, can sequence their unpaid maternity and paternity leave so that they can have the first two years of a child's life with a parent at home. It includes a new right to request flexible and part-time work, a right to have information about employment law, and a right to notice of termination and redundancy pay.These provisions have been produced as an exposure draft to enable public commentary. We will not make the same error made by the Howard government when it put out its Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard, which it did without adequate consultation, and it had to issue version after version with increased complexity and red tape for Australian businesses. We care about making these provisions work. That is why an exposure draft is here, with a public commentary period. This is one part of Labor's safety net for working Australians.The second part of Labor's safety net is a modern, simple award system for employees who earn $100,000 or less. That modern, simple award system will be created by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The modernisation request was contained in the explanatory memorandum to our Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill, which was presented to the House yesterday.What is very important about this safety net under Labor is that, under Labor's workplace relations system, the safety net can never be stripped away. Never again will an Australian walk into a workplace not knowing if that is the day that they will have an Australian workplace agreement thrust into their hands which strips away aspects of the safety net. We will not allow that to occur in Labor's system. There will be no Australian workplace agreements and no individual statutory employment agreements. This is in stark contrast to Work Choices and the industrial relations extremism of the Liberal Party. What they gave us was Australian workplace agreements that can strip the safety net away - including, today, stripping away redundancy pay and basic protections like a notice of change of shift.It is important for this House and the Australian people to note that, when the Leader of the Opposition said to them that Work Choices is dead, he did not tell them the truth. Today in the Senate the Liberal Party has voted to keep Work Choices going. Today we asked the Liberal Party to process our transition bill, which will mean there will be no more new Australian workplace agreements. We asked them to process that bill in exactly the same time frame that the parliament processed the last industrial relations changes of the Howard government. That is, we asked the Liberal Party to apply their own standards to themselves. Faced with that proposition of applying their own standards to themselves - something that they must agree is fair, something that they must agree is proper, given that it was brought into the parliament by the former Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who is now their guardian of parliamentary practice as the Manager of Opposition Business - they must concede that that is a fair time frame in which to process legislation. The only reason they did not agree to it is that they want Work Choices to continue as long as possible. Notwithstanding the words of the Leader of the Opposition, they believe in Work Choices and they believe in industrial relations extremism. Any Australian who has put into their hands in this time period an Australian workplace agreement that takes away a basic condition that they rely on should look at that Australian workplace agreement and say to themselves, 'This agreement is in my hands because the Leader of the Opposition is not a truthful man, and the Liberal Party believe in Work Choices and industrial relations extremism.'</DOC>

 - I was waiting for page 2, but page 2 did not come. For a former minister of the Howard government who claimed to care so much about literacy, it would be really useful if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition read Labor's policy. If she is in any doubt about how to find it, it is on the internet. We campaigned on it for all of 2007. I will send it to her. The policy contains the answer, and I will give it to you now. The policy is Forward with Fairness. You should read it. And if you did read it, you would know that we do not have a preferred industrial instrument in Forward with Fairness; we talk about creating a fair and balanced system in which people have choice. People have choice, if they want to, to negotiate a collective agreement. They can do that with or without the assistance of a trade union. That is a matter for them, because that is a basic freedom of association matter. Alternatively, they can choose to not collectively bargain; they can choose to have individual agreements. The important thing about those individual agreements is that they stand on top of the safety net. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and her party today voted for a continuation of Work Choices -  - What I am trying to do is to explain the equivalent of complex mathematics to someone who cannot count, so it does require a bit of explanation. Under Labor's full system, you will have a choice as to whether you have a collective agreement or an individual common-law contract. You might want to concentrate here, because you might learn something: the collective agreement is not lawful unless it passes a full no-disadvantage test against the award. That means that people under a collective agreement have to do better than the award. How is that different from the current system? Under the current system, award conditions can be ripped away without any compensation - redundancy pay gone, notice of change of shift gone. You believe in that, you voted for its continuation today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Shortland for her question. Today in the Senate, the Liberal Party voted for the continuation of Work Choices. In order to do that - to vote for a continued industrial relations extremism and a continued ripping off of Australian working families - it tried to hide behind creating an inquiry. One of the terms of reference of that inquiry is - would you believe it! - the 'economic and social impacts from the abolition of individual statutory agreements'. This has come from a political party which, in government, deliberately did not want to know how Australian workplace agreements were hurting working families.They could have collected this data, analysed it and released it but they did not want to know how bad these agreements were. They did not want them to come to public light. Given the members of the Liberal Party used to get up in this place and screech on about how good AWAs were for working families, for women, for young people - for all Australians - you would have thought they would have comprehensively analysed the data at their disposal. But, of course, they did not. What we do know is that, in May 2006, the Office of the Employment Advocate revealed that it had been reviewing AWAs to determine how many were stripping away what the former government deceptively and contemptuously called 'protected award conditions'.I welcome the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's new-found interest in things like annual leave loading, because the data showed this: under the government of which she was a cabinet member, 64 per cent of Australian workplace agreements cut annual leave loading. That is how much she cares about annual leave loading - 64 per cent of those agreements cut annual leave loading. Then, 63 per cent of them cut penalty rates. Does she now care about penalty rates because she has made the short walk from here to there? She clearly did not care about them then - 63 per cent of those agreements, no penalty rates. - The member of the Liberal Party, sitting opposite, when in government could have had this data and did not want to know about it. Fifty-two per cent of these agreements cut shift loadings, 51 per cent cut overtime loadings, 48 per cent cut monetary allowance and 46 per cent cut holiday pay. The government at that stage denied it was doing any further modelling but, in April 2007, data was leaked to the media that revealed further erosion by Australian workplace agreements of pay and conditions. In that leaked data, 75 per cent of agreements cut shift loadings, 68 per cent cut penalty rates, 57 per cent cut monetary allowances and 52 per cent cut public holiday pay. - What we know - and the former minister really should be a bit more wise about his interjections - is that they never properly coded or analysed the data to be able to tell whether the loss of these conditions was compensated for. The minister could have authorised analysis of that data, but he did not, because he did not want to know the answer. He deliberately wanted to run a system where he did not want to know the answer. What we do know is that these conditions were ripped away by a government that put the information into the dark and did not want Australians to know. What we do know is that Australian workplace agreements ripped away those basic conditions, and we also know that many of those agreements had in them no particular compensation in terms of the amount of money that was paid to people. This is the system that the former government put into place in this country. This is the system that they argued for in the lead-up to the last election, and this is the system that the Australian people voted against and rejected. They voted in favour of Labor's fair and balanced system but, in arrogant contempt of the views of the Australian people, the Liberal Party - informed by their born-to-rule mentality - have today voted for a continuation of Work Choices. They have voted to spit in the face of the Australian people and to deny them fairness and balance at work. Every Australian should know this and every Australian should judge them on the basis of it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I responded to one part of his question yesterday, in the response I think I gave to the Leader of the Opposition concerning sitting Fridays. The position of the government is absolutely clear on that. The purpose of sitting Fridays is to ensure that backbenchers in this parliament have an opportunity to bring to the attention of the parliament issues of concern to them in their local communities, such as in the honourable member for Kalgoorlie's community. My experience as a backbencher in this place is that the opportunities to raise concerns here as a backbencher are limited. Therefore the parliament providing further opportunities of a sitting Friday to do so is an appropriate way forward. We remain committed to that reform. And we would hope that all honourable members, including the honourable member who has asked the question, make appropriate use of that mechanism.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, because today's employment figures are welcome figures. A government member - Hear, hear! - Hear, hear - too right! We always welcome the creation of jobs on this side of the House. On this side of the House, it goes to the very core of our being. We welcome the creation of 28,600 new jobs in January, with the unemployment rate falling to 4.1 per cent. As I said yesterday, we are very optimistic about the future of the Australian economy. We recognise that unemployment is low and that we are in our 17th straight year of growth. But we also have very substantial challenges, because we are in the midst of a terms of trade boom, which has been delivering the wealth creation and the jobs of recent years. The challenge that we have as a nation is to prepare for the future, to meet the challenges that flow from that terms of trade boom, because the labour market is tight. It is the tightest it has been in a generation. -  - It means it is very tight; it means it is low. That is what it means: very low. -  - The problem with the opposition is that they cannot recognise the scale of the skills crisis in this country, which they neglected, which they denied -  - Those opposite did ignore the capacity constraints in the Australian economy precisely at the time that we needed them to put in place some far-sighted reforms. And they did not do it. They ignored 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank over three years about capacity constraints in the Australian economy. This government will not ignore those capacity constraints. At the very core of the program that we took to the Australian people are schemes to address the skills shortage and a whole series of plans to deal with infrastructure bottlenecks. This government will expand the skills base in this economy. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has already announced additional training places, and we have announced what we are doing in terms of infrastructure.But also, in this environment, what is really important is labour force participation. Enhancing labour force participation, giving incentives to Australians who work hard, is very important. So I am proud to say that today I introduced into the House the tax cuts that will provide incentive for people not only to further participate -  - No, they are not. - These tax reforms will put incentive in the system. They will enhance labour force participation and, in particular, they will encourage second-income earners into the workforce. The previous government, the opposition over there, ignored for years disincentives in the tax system. They simply ignored them. We are proud to put these forward today. In addition, we have put forward an increase in the childcare rebate. The member for Flinders then left the chamber. 
 -  - The previous government was not prepared to front up to these challenges. This government is on the front foot from day one. Those opposite do not recognise the problem, so they cannot be part of the solution.</DOC>

 - On the question of the sitting days and question times for this parliament, the number of sitting days proposed under this government for 2008 is 82. The Howard government average was 67. As to question times, it is proposed for 2008 under this government to have 67 question times. The Howard government averaged 63 question times. -  - It is a fact. For government business there is an extra three hours and 25 minutes per week, and for private members business there is an extra one hour and 35 minutes per week - and that is apart from community cabinets. As to the other point which the Leader of the Opposition raised concerning our proposal to exercise modest restraint when it comes to MP salaries, I would like very much to hear what the Leader of the Opposition's position on that is. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I did not hear that part of the question which the honourable member said was about public servants. The measures that I propose purely relate to those of us here - members of parliament. It is time that we ourselves, as the parliamentarians of the nation, gave this as a modest demonstration of restraint in a year in which there are inflationary challenges across the economy.On a point I raised about private members business, I said before that, under this government, there will be an extra one hour and 35 minutes per week. I am advised by the Leader of the House that is one hour and five minutes extra a week and not one hour and 35 minutes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. This government sees climate change as one of the greatest intergenerational challenges that this country faces. To enhance our understanding of climate change, the Australian Treasury is undertaking detailed modelling of the macroeconomic impacts of emissions reductions. It is very important work. This modelling will be a very important part in our determinations of an emissions trading system. The Treasury is consulting broadly with international and domestic experts in developing modelling assumptions. This modelling work is expected to be complete by mid-June.In designing the government's response to climate change, the Australian government will draw on a range of work, including this modelling from Treasury, independent academic analysis by Professor Garnaut and other analysis from here and abroad. We on this side of the House recognise the costs of climate change and that the costs of inaction are far greater than the costs of action. That is why we will take an evidence based approach to finding solutions for the long term. It is very important. Australia now has a government that recognises the important implications of climate change and is addressing them.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment, and I thank the member for Fowler for her question. I would remind the House of three simple but extremely important facts: the underlying inflation rate in this country has hit 3.6 per cent - the highest in 16 years and it threatens to go higher; we have had 11 interest rate increases in a row; and government spending in the current financial year, according to the budget figures of the previous government, is running at an increased rate of 4Â½ per cent in real terms, possibly even higher depending on which indicator you use. These are three simple facts that should be seared into the consciousness of every member of this House.Increased inflation threatens us with increased interest rates, less economic efficiency and eroded savings. This government is absolutely committed to ensuring that we take action, both in the short term and in the longer term, to meet and defeat the inflation challenge. We are absolutely committed to getting inflation under control. On 21 January in Perth, the Prime Minister announced the government's five-point plan to tackle the inflation problem; to deal with skills, infrastructure, participation in the workforce and private savings; and, of course, to tackle the problem of government spending accelerating way too quickly.As was mentioned earlier today in the House, we are absolutely committed to getting the surplus above 1Â½ per cent of GDP, and that means significant cuts in government spending, serious cuts in government spending. It means tough decisions. Last week I announced a very modest first instalment, which was required to be addressed because of the additional appropriations legislation needing to be put to this parliament, an instalment which will yield savings of approximately $643 million over four years - but that, I stress, is only a modest first instalment.We will be guided in this exercise - the razor-gang exercise that we committed to prior to the election and that we are now following through on - by our election promises. We will fulfil those election promises. Of course, we will be guided by existing contracts; we will honour contracts. But there will be pain; there will be difficulty; there will be tough decisions. That is unavoidable. After years of excessive, wasteful, profligate spending by the former government, that pain is necessary in order to ensure that we avoid the far worse pain that higher inflation and higher interest rates will bring to ordinary working people in this country.As you can probably see, the government's analysis of this problem and its prescription for a solution are not shared by everyone. Not everybody agrees. During the course of last year the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, just as inflation was starting to push up against the top level of the Reserve Bank's range, said that the government had inflation just where it wanted it. The Leader of the Opposition said a couple of weeks ago that, when the former government handed over to the current government, the Australian economy had been in absolutely first-rate condition. There was no inflation problem according to him. The shadow Treasurer, the member for Wentworth, is on the record as saying that the inflation problem is a fairytale; it does not exist.But, as usual, you can always rely on the National Party to top the lot. When you are in the market for a bit of economic literacy, you can always rely on the National Party! Last week, in response to the initial cuts that I announced, the Leader of the National Party held a press conference. When he was asked, 'Isn't it necessary to cut government spending in order to put downward pressure on inflation?' his response was: 'The United States has actually got a higher inflation rate than Australia and it is actually increasing government spending.' So, in other words, we should be increasing government spending! The National Party solution to the inflation problem is to increase government spending.Here they all are: the economic party animals of Australian politics. They have formed a new parliamentary friendship group: it is called the 'friends of Corey'! They are all out there with the big yellow shades - the party animals of Australian politics. They have not realised that the party is over. It is time for a bit of discipline, and it is time for somebody to clean up the mess. That is what we are going to be doing. The reason is that we understand what is happening in the supermarkets, the petrol stations and the estate agents of this country. The opposition do not.In conclusion, the government is committed to achieving good economic outcomes for the working people of this country. Central to that is ensuring that we continue the low inflation that has occurred over 16 years under governments of both political persuasions. Returning to that low inflation rate is critical to ensure that the working people of this country enjoy good economic opportunities and good economic outcomes. But I will tell you this: there will be some things you will not see as part of our exercise. You will not see $457 million spent on government advertising in 16 months, which is what you saw under the previous government. You will not see $350 million spent in a single year on Work Choices - triple the amount previously spent on industrial relations machinery - as you saw under the previous government. You will not see the kinds of outrageous rorts under the Regional Partnerships program that the Auditor-General so thoroughly exposed. You will not see the ludicrous indulgences like $350,000 given to a private individual to build a carriage to give as a private gift to the Queen. They are the kinds of things that you will not see in our efforts to get inflation under control, because we realise that every dollar that the government has to spend on behalf of Australian taxpayers is coming from a working family's budget. That is a very great responsibility. We are not going to be spending the Australian taxpayers' dollars on those things.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for her question and acknowledge her longstanding interest in East Timor. On Tuesday I travelled to Darwin to meet with the East Timorese Minister for Foreign Affairs, Zacarias da Costa. The purpose of that visit was to relay personally to the East Timorese foreign minister the Australian government's response to the deplorable acts that had occurred earlier in the week in respect of the East Timorese President, Dr Ramos-Horta, with the attack on him, and the attack upon the East Timorese Prime Minister.I took the opportunity of speaking to medical staff at the Royal Darwin Hospital, in whose care the President is. I also took the opportunity of speaking with Ramos-Horta's family. I personally relayed to Zacarias da Costa the Australian government's speedy response to the deplorable events. Firstly, I relayed our best wishes for a speedy recovery so far as the President was concerned. Secondly, I relayed our quick response to the East Timorese government's request for support: additional troops, additional police and the stationing of HMAS Perth off the coast of Dili.The East Timorese response was one of very grateful acknowledgement of our support. The foreign minister and I agreed that - after the East Timorese government, the Australian government, the United Nations and the international stabilisation force had effected a full and proper evaluation - we would take account of what, if any, lessons there were to be learned as a result of these terrible actions.Taking the opportunity to speak to the medical staff at the hospital, two things became clear. Firstly, but for the very skilled work under enormous pressure at the Aspen medical facility in Dili, the President would not now be in the serious but stable condition that he is in. Secondly, at the Royal Darwin Hospital the President is in the highest quality care. Before I came into the chamber, having checked upon the President's medical condition, I was informed that he remains in a serious but stable state. Members would appreciate that in these circumstances stability is progress.I also took the opportunity of expressing the Australian government's and the Australian people's sorrow and sympathy to members of the President's family, in particular his mother and his sister. The family members are very appreciative of those best wishes and also very appreciative of the good work that is being done at very short notice by officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who are doing their best to take care of the family members visiting Darwin in these terrible circumstances. Can I also indicate that I took the opportunity of meeting with the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, who indicated to me the Territory government's readiness and willingness to provide whatever support they can to the family.This morning I took a phone call from the Portuguese foreign minister, who expressed his concern to me. Portugal has a longstanding historical and emotional interest in East Timor, and the minister indicated to me that once an evaluation had been done Portugal stood ready to consider any requests that might come its way. Portugal will do that in full cooperation and consultation with the Australian government. I am appreciative of that expression of support and best wishes from the Portuguese government.The East Timorese foreign minister, Zacarias da Costa, has returned to Dili from Darwin, but I very much hope that he will be in a position to visit Australia next week as part of a longstanding arrangement for a guest-of-government visit to Australia. That will entirely depend on the circumstances in Dili which, as I came to question time, were still being described as tense but calm. We certainly hope that that continues. The Prime Minister will visit Dili and speak with the East Timorese Prime Minister tomorrow, relaying all the things that I have outlined to the House. At the first available opportunity he is personally attending Dili at a time of great need as far as East Timor is concerned, reflecting the Australian government's, the Australian parliament's and the Australian people's longstanding support for and longstanding friendship and special relationship with East Timor.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for the question. I know that, like many new members to this place, he will be making a substantial contribution to the debate in Australia. In opposition, the Labor Party supported the intervention in Afghanistan. We did so because we wanted to ensure that the mission, so important to Australia's national security, enjoyed broad public support. The new government continues to support the Afghanistan project. The international community cannot afford to sit back and allow a failed state to remain a breeding ground for terrorists prepared to kill innocent people en masse in the name of their extremist beliefs. I described the war in Afghanistan as a project, and I did so quite deliberately. I did so because the work of the international community there necessarily goes well beyond the military action - consolidating new democratic health and educational institutions, building economic capacity absent of narcotics and developing Afghanistan's security forces to the point where the government can independently enforce the rule of law or require coherent and coordinated plans which marry all military and non-military strategies.Unfortunately, such coordinated and coherent plans have been the absent part of the Afghanistan jigsaw. Indeed, the highly respected Lord Paddy Ashdown said only today that the absence of an agreed national strategy meant that in Afghanistan 'defeat is now a real possibility'. What a tragedy failure in Afghanistan would be for all of those who have given their lives for the cause or have been badly injured. What an ominous development it would be for global security and for the Afghan people. What a tragedy it would be if all the good work done so far in the end were to count for nought.There have been significant gains. Economic growth in the war-weary country is currently running at an impressive eight per cent. Health care in Afghanistan also continues to improve. Indeed, 80 per cent of the Afghani people now have access to basic health care services. Infant mortality rates continue to steadily decline. The number of Afghan children receiving an education now exceeds some six million. Importantly, a number of those, some two million people, are girls. The outcomes flowing from Australia's military role have been significant and substantial. The work of our Special Forces, our infantry, our cavalry and other elements are very highly regarded by our partners. Our Defence Force engineers, tradespeople and project managers are rebuilding local infrastructure. They have helped construct schools and bridges. Amongst those schools is an important trade-training school. What a tragedy it would be if this were all for nil.Unsurprisingly, the future of the Afghanistan project was an early priority for me when I was appointed the Minister for Defence. Alarmingly, early in the course of my work I found a lack of common objectives amongst the partners - no coherent strategy; confused chains of command and blurred lines of responsibility; a failing counternarcotics strategy; the absence of benchmarks for progress; a crisis in burden sharing, with a number of NATO countries failing to meet or live up to their side of the bargain; and poor progress in advancing Afghan security forces towards the critical mass in skill required for them to be able to hold our military gains. But what surprised me most was the extent to which Australia had been denied access to important war information and excluded from the strategic-planning processes. Our people have been going to war, some to make the ultimate sacrifice, but it seems their political masters have been happy to sit on the sidelines. - I hear the interjection from the former foreign minister. - He says, 'That is not true.' Let me refer the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and all members of the House to an ABC radio interview which occurred on AM just this morning. The interview was with a NATO spokesperson. The reporter asked the NATO spokesperson whether these complaints to NATO were new. He asked the spokesperson very deliberately, 'Oh, do you mean Australia and other non-NATO countries have made these complaints before?' And here is his response. It is very important. He said:Countries like Sweden and Finland for example, that are very heavily deployed with us in Afghanistan, but are not NATO members have raised this issue in the past...I repeat: 'Countries like Sweden and Finland'. I did not hear any reference to Australia in the NATO spokesperson's remarks. But the new government is determined that if we are to send our troops to war we must be privy to the war plan and we must always be part of the planning strategy. No government, surely, can make informed decisions about whether to send their people to war or keep them at war without access to the vital information required both to assess the risk involved and to assess the likelihood of success.In Vilnius last week I told my NATO counterparts and the Secretary General that their failure to share information with the Australian government and to exclude us from those planning processes were both unsustainable. I am pleased to report to the House that no NATO country raised any objections to my appeals and that, along with a number of key defence ministers, including from the US, the UK, the Netherlands and Canada, the Secretary General made a personal commitment to me that he would do all he could to right this wrong. I was very pleased to hear the Secretary General's spokesman today also reinforce that commitment that I heard in Vilnius last week. I was also very pleased to hear him acknowledge, on behalf of NATO, the very good work our troops are doing in Afghanistan. Advancing beyond the Vilnius promises will not be easy, nor will embracing or getting NATO to embrace new strategies, but the size of the challenge should be no reason not to try; the stakes are all too high.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Port Adelaide for his question. Building long-term productivity growth after years of decline is indeed a central priority of the Rudd government. Like few other areas, development of infrastructure has the capacity to boost the productive economy, to lift our living standards and to lock in our long-term prosperity. That is why infrastructure is a key element of the government's five-point plan to fight inflation and to boost productivity. The government committed to establishing Infrastructure Australia to coordinate nationally significant infrastructure, including transport, water, energy and communications. Infrastructure Australia will develop a strategic blueprint for our nation's infrastructure and it will drive investment where it is needed most. It is an unprecedented overhaul of the way that we think about infrastructure development in this nation.This government makes no apologies for moving away from the 'business as usual' approach of the last 11Â½ years. The Reserve Bank warned on some 20 separate occasions that capacity constraints were creating inflationary pressures. -  - Those opposite should listen to what happens in parliament. The Treasurer has already tabled the 20 different warnings from the Reserve Bank about capacity constraints.Opposition members - When? - They were tabled earlier today. I say that to help the opposition. - I am surprised that they have not heard about these warnings because many of them were made at the House of Representatives economics committee hearings with the Reserve Bank Governor which are held twice a year. If they looked at Hansard they would see the warnings from the Reserve Bank of Australia about the capacity constraints and the problems that exist with skills and infrastructure. Twenty warnings on 20 separate occasions were ignored by those opposite. The Rudd Labor government is committed to putting in place structures that will fix the problem.The Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics estimates that urban congestion will cost nearly $20 billion by 2015. With the freight task set to double by 2020, the greatest impact will be in urban areas, particularly around our ports, our inner modal terminals and our distribution centres. However, a policy for moving goods will not work without a policy for moving people. It is motorists in their cars, much more than truckies in their cabs, that are clogging our cities. Whether it be road or rail carrying commuters or containers, the systems must work together to achieve the best outcomes for workers, businesses and exporters. Freight must be able to move seamlessly, not be slowed down when moving from the farm gate to the kitchen table and from the mines to the ports.Transport will represent a significant element of the Infrastructure Australia work program. I have taken steps to ensure that there is early progress to advance a national transport reform agenda. I am working closely with my state and territory colleagues to drive national transport outcomes. I have written to the National Transport Commission requesting urgent advice on the development of a national policy framework and a national infrastructure plan for all modes. This work will dovetail the work of -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. We did not get any answers to questions from the minister for infrastructure in the Howard government because they did not have one. For 12 years they did not have one. We have a plan to address these issues through Infrastructure Australia. Transport is central to that task, and that task is central to fighting inflation and boosting productivity.</DOC>

 - Thank you for the question. I know the member for Canberra has had a great interest in health issues not just in this region but across the country. I am very pleased to be able to say that, since the election of the Rudd Labor government, we have been incredibly busy in the health area. In less than 100 days we have put in place some of the infrastructure for reforming our health system to build a modern Australia. That is something that the previous health minister was decidedly against - any sort of reform was a dirty word - and I note that the new opposition spokesperson on health has not yet rebutted that view. So, as far as we are aware, it is only this side of the House that is interested in reforming our health system so that we can deliver for a modern Australia and for working families. We have not just put the infrastructure in place; we have also delivered on practical reforms. With respect to elective surgery waiting lists, there is money to provide 25,000 procedures across the country. The 25,000 people who will have their hip replacement done or their cataract surgery done will be able to live their lives free of pain because we are the first Commonwealth government to put money into elective surgery. That is something the previous government never did. -  - Interestingly, the members from Queensland are interjecting. Perhaps the members from Queensland want to explain why they do not think we should give Queensland $27 million to undertake 4,000 procedures for Queenslanders who live in the electorate of the members who are interjecting. You do not want the people who are waiting for knee surgery, cataract surgery or hip surgery to have their procedures done? It would be interesting if the members opposite objected to the government paying for 25,000 people to have their elective surgery done across the country. Perhaps they want to stand up and say why they are against families in their electorate getting assistance from the federal government, when they know full well that the previous government ripped $1 billion out of the public hospital system. The Leader of the Opposition, even with this background in health, the member for North Sydney and the member for Warringah all stood by in the previous cabinet and let that $1 billion be ripped out of our system. So don't all come in here and complain about us, piece by piece, trying to fix the system and the mess that you left. -  - Interestingly, the members from Victoria are also interjecting. Perhaps the members from Victoria would like to stand up and say - the member for Casey is welcome to; he has a very good hospital in his electorate - why they do not want $34 million paid to Victoria for nearly 6,000 procedures to be undertaken for people in their electorate. -  - In addition to the $150 million already being delivered to undertake 25,000 procedures across the country, in the space of three months I have met four times with my state colleagues to bat out and negotiate health reform. Interestingly, that is already double the number of times that the previous minister met in a whole year with the state health ministers. I am sure that the former Minister for Health and Ageing is well aware that in three months I have already doubled the work that he did in a whole year.Importantly, there are a number of other very important initiatives that have been undertaken. I think members, despite their interjections, will share with me my pleasure in Labor having already instigated our home nurse visiting program for Indigenous mothers. This is something that we supported and that the previous government was committed to. It is being extended massively by this government with a $260 million commitment to investing in early childhood health and development for Indigenous children. It is really important and we have hit the ground running with it. On top of that, we have already implemented initiatives to attract more nurses into our hospitals. All of these are things that the previous government neglected. We are proud that we are up and running on these initiatives. All of us will benefit from an improved health system that will be developed under a Rudd Labor government so that we ensure we have the modern health system that is needed for a modern Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. She has significant primary industries within her electorate and is also, I understand, an ambassador for Beef Week in Queensland. I would like to kick off by referring to some malicious rumours that have been put out by the National Party, which claim that I do not have a background in primary industries. I would like to put on the record that they are absolutely true - I do not. That is why I have decided that it is essential not only to be taking advice from my own department and from the official stakeholder groups but also to be spending every moment that I can actually meeting with people who work the land, on their land. To that end, I am pleased to report to the House that since receiving the portfolio in December, I have met with primary producers in Roma and Kyogle - with the Prime Minister - and in Emerald, Tamworth, Inverell, Glen Innes, Guyra, Armidale, the outskirts of Hobart, Launceston, Innisfail, Griffith, Hay, Broken Hill, Mildura, throughout the Fleurieu Peninsula in South Australia -  - In the course of those visits I have had the opportunity, with regard to the different election promises which we have undertaken, to gain a view of the different views of people working the land - for instance, on the reforms which we have undertaken and are now implementing with respect to wheat marketing arrangements for the $3.5 billion wheat industry in Australia. Both Kelly Shields and Mark Hyde, and the pastoralists and graziers when I visited them in Western Australia, are very supportive of the changes of the government. At the same time, the WA Farmers Federation are taking a different view and are urging me to depart from the promises that the Labor Party took to the election.I inform the House that we will be keeping to the promise to have a regulated but competitive wheat export market in Australia. The process for drafting legislation to establish Wheat Exports Australia has begun. I have also established the Independent Expert Group to advise me on the 'industry good' functions previously undertaken by the AWB. The IEG met for the first time last week. It is chaired by South Australian wheat grower John Crosby. Under the existing law, we have also issued three wheat export permits allowing further wheat exports to Iraq and the UK.Our promise on the Torres Strait fisheries buyback has been implemented. The new member for Leichhardt has been a strong advocate on this issue, and the outcomes acknowledge and protect the traditional way of life and the livelihood of Torres Strait traditional inhabitants while providing long-term economic and employment opportunities.We have also extended assistance in the wake of equine influenza. That assistance was due to end on 8 February but has now been extended to 14 March. Particularly given the comments today from the New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries, we are very hopeful that there will no longer be red and purple zones by 14 March. I have had the opportunity to meet with the leaders of the peak bodies of the Australian horse industry from Queensland and New South Wales and also those involved in the racing industry at Warwick Farm. It is no exaggeration to say that in the wake of EI the horse industry has been devastated in recent months, and I am sure that we will have more to say on that when the Callinan inquiry reports.The damage caused by the floods in New South Wales and Queensland has been particularly shocking. When I visited Emerald with the Minister for Human Services and Kyogle with the Prime Minister, we had the opportunity to meet with affected families. It was made clear to us that the full extent of damage by floods is not always clear at the high-water mark. We were able to lend a helping hand under the National Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements and hear about the good work being done on the ground by the members for Flynn and Page to help working families affected.The savings measures on drought have been referred to and were announced by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. The two concepts of drought and climate change, while different, are intrinsically linked. The member for New England, as well as presenting me with an Akubra, for which I thank him, took me out to Brian and Marion Reid's sheep and cattle farm at Bendemeer, near Tamworth. Compounding the problem of drought that those families were able to tell us about is, of course, the serious inflation problem. It is not simply people in suburbia who are affected by mortgages and who are concerned about Australia having the highest inflation rate in 16 years. To that end, we identified where savings could be made within the drought assistance programs that would not affect farmers who are receiving much-needed help.Unfortunately, in the wake of those savings, which were done in a way that would not affect farmers who were receiving much-needed help, a fear campaign was waged by the Leader of the National Party which, if successful, will only have the impact of causing farmers who are entitled to assistance not to apply. It is the first time there has been a departure from bipartisan support on drought assistance. - Listening to primary producers on their own properties is the way that we intend to do business. That is how primary industries will be part of building a modern Australia to meet the challenges of the future for working families and the country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fremantle for her question. Today are the first parliamentary elections in Pakistan for six years. These elections were scheduled for 8 January but were postponed because of the tragic murder-assassination of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on 27 December. Benazir Bhutto was a woman of great courage. She refused to be cowed by the extremists, and she paid the ultimate price for that with her life. The government is pleased that these elections are proceeding. The government has consistently urged its counterpart in Islamabad to return to the democratic processes in Pakistan as quickly as possible.There are of course difficult circumstances on the ground in Pakistan. The political environment is tense, and the physical security within that country represents huge challenges for those wishing to exercise their democratic right. A suicide bomber over the weekend killed over 40 people and injured more than 100. I condemn unequivocally this suicide attack, as I condemned unequivocally the murder of Benazir Bhutto. Extremists behind these attacks cannot be allowed to succeed in derailing Pakistan's elections.The critical challenge for the future is to see extremism marginalised in Pakistan, and the challenge for the democratic process in Islamabad and more widely across Pakistan is to ensure that that occurs. That can be assisted by there being a free, fair and transparent democratic process through the conduct of these elections. That will be important for a full restoration of confidence in the political and electoral processes of that country on the part of all the citizens of Pakistan, whatever their religious beliefs and whatever their political beliefs. In a small way, Australia is making a contribution to voter education campaigns through a program run by the Asia Foundation.This is not just a matter for Pakistan itself, though primarily the exercise of the democratic right to elect the next government of that country is of first relevance to the people of that country; it is also pivotal for the future of regional and international stability. What happens in Pakistan through these elections and the government which emerges from it will fundamentally shape so much of the global community's war against terrorism and what happens in the adjacent country of Afghanistan, where we currently have troops deployed.This therefore is not simply a passing election of remote or marginal consequence or interest to the Australian people. This country, Australia, has a deep strategic interest in the outcome of these elections in Pakistan and what flows from those elections. We have 1,000 troops next door in Afghanistan, and their future and the future of their operations are deeply shaped by events in Pakistan and therefore will be deeply affected by events which proceed from this election. Also, in the wider war against terrorism, the fact that al-Qaeda has been able to safely base its operations in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan and in the north-west of Pakistan itself will in turn be affected by what happens with the electoral process and its outcome in Islamabad. Also the outcome of the Pakistani elections will shape the future of the relationship between Islamabad and New Delhi, India and Pakistan representing nuclear weapons states within our own region. It will also, of course, affect radically the lives and aspirations of more than 100 million Pakistanis themselves in a rapidly growing country with a rapidly increasing population and will shape so much of their future as well. For democracy itself the successful conclusion of these elections is important intrinsically because of the future of the democratic project across wider South Asia.These elections therefore go to the core interest which we have as international citizens but specifically when it comes to our strategic interest with our troops on the ground deployed in Afghanistan and the wider war against al-Qaeda and terrorist organisations. We the government and the people of Australia will be watching carefully the outcome of events in Pakistan in the days ahead and hopefully the successful and peaceful conclusion of that democratic process.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Werriwa for his question. I can advise the House that today the Prime Minister and I went to the national mailing and marketing centre in Canberra to send the final of these WorkChoices booklets off to be pulped - 436,000 of them off to be pulped. Let us remind ourselves that last October when the Howard-Costello government decided to introduce Work Choices it knew Work Choices would hurt working families. As verified by John Howard's autobiography, the cabinet sat around the table and talked about how many working families would lose out under Work Choices and they decided to go ahead with it anyway. A deliberate decision was taken to rip off working families. But in order to disguise that deliberate decision, the Howard government -  - A deliberate decision was taken to rip off working families and consequently a deliberate decision was taken for a propaganda campaign to try and disguise that fact. Some $120 million of taxpayers' money was ultimately allocated towards that advertising campaign. Let us remember the highlights of this propaganda war: the 36-page booklet that contained the example of Billy, who got a minimum wage job and lost everything else. He lost public holidays, rest breaks, bonuses, annual leave loading, allowances, penalty rates, shift loadings and overtime - Billy with a minimum wage job in this propaganda. - But the propaganda did not end there. It was joined by a to-do list, a Work Choices to-do list. It was joined by a Work Choices mouse pad. The propaganda continued, apparently under the guise of informing Australians about their rights. - I think the Manager of Opposition Business is saying he still uses one of those mouse pads. But this propaganda war is now at an end. Six million of these booklets were produced, but Australians know a con when they see one. They did not want these booklets, just like they did not want the Howard-Costello government's Work Choices laws. So 3.5 million of them ended up being shredded by the Howard government itself. These booklets sat in storage containers around the country costing taxpayers, to add insult to injury. They paid the $2 million for the booklets, then they paid $110,000 -  - I am just reminding everybody of the Work Choices propaganda that Australian taxpayers paid for - $2 million on those booklets and then $110,000 to store them from October 2005 until 28 September 2007, more than 3Â½ million of them. And, on the topic of pulping fiction: whoever is the Harvey Keitel-Winston Wolfe character of the Howard-Costello government, whoever used to do the clean-up jobs, then ordered that these booklets be pulped - and they were pulped, immediately before the election campaign started. But we found 436,000 of them that the clean-up job missed, and we are ensuring that today they are pulped, just like the Rudd Labor government will pulp Work Choices.On the question of pulp fiction, the Manager of Opposition Business is today trying to get away with the biggest fiction of them all: he is trying to pretend that members of the Howard government, Howard government ministers, did not know that Work Choices could hurt Australian working families. He is trying to pretend that the only Australians who did not know Work Choices could hurt working families were the Australians sitting around the Howard government ministerial table. Apparently they are the only ones who missed out on the news. The member for Higgins, hunched over Ian McLachlan's wallet note - apparently he missed out on the news. - I am searching for an explanation, Mr Speaker, which could possibly make the version from the Manager of Opposition Business true. So here we have the Howard government ministers around the ministerial table - the only Australians who do not know, according to him, that Work Choices is hurting working families, so self-absorbed are they by their divisions: the member for Higgins hunched over his wallet note, the current shadow minister for family and community services hunched over the John Howard defence minutes because that was his role, the current shadow Treasurer hunched over a number sheet - apparently the only ones who were so self-absorbed they did not know that Work Choices was hurting working families. Well, this truly is fiction. Each and every one of them knew that it was hurting working families. Before the election they defended Work Choices with propaganda, and now they defend it with their Senate numbers. It is time to do what the Australian people want and vote for Labor's - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corio for his question. Climate change, for the government and for the nation, represents core economic business and core environmental business. That is why we as the government have embarked upon a comprehensive set of measures to deal with this challenge. These measures go to what we do in terms of international diplomacy. They go to the question of what we do in our domestic arrangements for the future development of an emissions trading scheme. They go to the question of what we do on the future of mandatory renewable energy targets. They go to how we harmonise such mandatory renewable energy targets across the states and territories to create a unified system for the country. They go to mitigation measures including, for example, $130 million which the minister for primary industries has already announced for use by primary producers to assist in their mitigation measures on farm and on property. And they go to a range of other measures which can be embraced by individuals and families - for example, the solar rebate programs which will be unfolded by the government during this year.It is this sort of multifaceted approach which is necessary to deal with the overall challenge of climate change. All this is made possible in terms of Australia's international diplomacy by the fact that, within the first 11 minutes of the existence of this government, we proceeded to ratify the Kyoto protocol. Within the first 11 days of this government's existence, we handed the instrument of ratification to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, at a UN climate change conference in Bali. And within that framework we have, through the agency of the minister newly appointed for climate change, embarked upon a range of negotiations with our partner governments around the world - within the framework, for the first time, of the Kyoto protocol - to ensure that we have an effective Bali road map ahead, which goes from this conference at Bali through the Warsaw conference which will be held later this year, through to its destination point, which will be the Copenhagen conference at the end of next year.These are difficult and challenging negotiations, but negotiations of which we could not be fully part were we not ratification members of the climate change convention. As a result, we the government, through the agency of the Minister for Climate Change and Water, are expending every energy possible to ensure that those negotiations can come to a successful conclusion. This would not have been possible had the previous government been returned to office. This would not have been possible because that government had embarked upon a series of measures and statements the end point of which was to refuse, after 11 years, to ratify the Kyoto protocol. It took us 11 minutes to ratify Kyoto and 11 days to present the instrument of ratification - after 11Â½ years that that government had still refused to ratify.The program of work we have before us of course goes beyond international diplomacy. It goes also to the targets we set for this nation for the future, and those must be compatible with what we agree on globally as well. Therefore, the work that has been commissioned by the Treasury in terms of the independent Garnaut report - one which we began by commissioning independently, from opposition, in the middle of last year - will be important. When that report comes down it will be one of the sources of advice, together with what the Treasury says and what we also have from the Department of Climate Change and elsewhere, in shaping our overall framework for the delivery of an effective emissions trading scheme for the country.Beyond that, a core challenge which the minister is wrestling with is also how we evolve an effective mandatory renewable energy target regime for the country, given the conflicting state regimes which exist. These are important items of work for the nation. They are of core relevance to the business community and to the general community. They are of fundamental relevance to whether we have in place in this country a set of measures which underpin long-term economic growth. But Australia is now back in the circle. We are back in the negotiating ring fully - not half-heartedly - as demonstrated by the response to us as the new government of Australia by the international community when we presented our instrument of ratification in Bali in December.This will be serious, difficult and challenging work ahead, but we are prepared to exert every element of the government's energy to bring these negotiations to a successful conclusion. I commend the work done thus far by the Minister for Climate Change and Water. This is a very difficult task that she has before her, but this is fundamental economic and environmental business for the nation. It is one of the core priorities for this government. It is one of the core priorities upon which this government was elected, and it is a government determined, as in other spheres, to honour the pre-election commitments it gave to the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Australia welcomes foreign investment. Foreign investment helps to develop our industries. It creates jobs and prosperity and provides access to new technology, skills and overseas markets. These are all very good things for the Australian economy. While we encourage foreign investment, we must also ensure that foreign investment is consistent with the national interest. Under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, it is my job as Treasurer to ensure such investment is consistent with the national interest. I have the legislative powers to, in certain circumstances, prohibit proposals that are contrary to our national interest or to impose conditions as I see fit to protect our national interest.On Sunday, I released guidelines, or principles, to enhance the transparency of Australia's foreign investment screening regime. The six principles set out the main factors to be considered in determining whether investments by foreign governments and their agencies are consistent with Australia's national interest. These relate to the investor's independence from its own government and its commercial conduct. Further, the principles look at the proposed investment's impact on competition, government revenue or policy, national security considerations and the overall contribution to the economy. These principles are to be applied on a case by case basis to judge whether any investment by a foreign government or its entities is in the national interest. The principles are consistent with the approach that was applied by the previous government through the Foreign Investment Review Board. What is new is that there has been heightened public interest and heightened commercial interest in these proposals. That is why the Rudd government has moved to provide full transparency in relation to these matters. The government will ensure that investment in Australia continues to enhance our national interest and our national prosperity.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Chisholm for her question. Members will be aware that in April 2007 there was a major gastroenteritis outbreak at Broughton Hall nursing home in Camberwell, Victoria. Out of the 22 residents affected, tragically five died. On 17 April 2007, the previous Minister for Ageing announced that Ms Rhonda Parker, who is now the Aged Care Commissioner, would investigate an allegation that a staff member from the Department of Health and Ageing and/or the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency did not respond to calls for help from a Broughton Hall resident. The resident involved was Mr Merson Dunstan, who was in his early 80s. During the outbreak he was taken to hospital and subsequently died. In May 2007, Ms Rhonda Parker's report was finalised and delivered to the then Minister for Ageing. That was almost 10 months ago and the Dunstan family has heard very little since.On 7 February 2008, my office contacted Rhonda Parker to inquire about the investigation and express concern about the lack of feedback to the Dunstan family. A day later, on 8 February, Ms Rhonda Parker provided a summary investigation report. I have been advised that the full report was unable to be released publicly due to legal constraints imposed by the Privacy Act. Ms Parker's investigation has found that, whilst the allegation that departmental staff and/or agency assessors ignored pleas for help was not substantiated by the evidence, she believed there needed to be changes. Ms Parker recommended that during a disease outbreak departmental staff be required to check on actual nursing home residents rather than just examine documentation and meet with management and staff. It is a very sensible recommendation and I do not see why the previous government did not act on it. I have asked the department to work on implementing Ms Parker's recommendation. - On Sunday, 10 February, I hand-delivered a copy of Ms Rhonda Parker's summary investigation report to the family of the late Mr Merson Dunstan. I also took the opportunity to apologise for the previous government's and the previous minister's failure to provide any information to the Dunstan family. Whilst it does not bring the matter to a close, I hope it is a step forward for the Dunstan family. It must have been a very frustrating and indeed a very sad nine months for the Dunstan family, and our thoughts are with them as they now face the coroner's inquest later this year. I now table the summary investigation report provided to the Dunstan family.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for his question because it is a good question. As I indicated to the House only last week, we are optimistic about the future of the Australian economy. Unemployment is at a record low. We are in our 17th year of straight economic growth and that is a good thing for Australia, but what Australia has to do is deal with the economic challenges that are emerging. As I indicated last week, we have an uncertain international environment and we are not immune from international fallout. But the biggest challenge the Australian economy faces is dealing with the inflation challenge - the parting gift of the Liberal Party of Australia to the Australian people. We should always aim -  - I would like to make it very clear that the objective of the Rudd government is to get unemployment as low as we possibly can. But there is one hurdle, and that is the level of elevated inflation. The highest level of inflation in 16 years was left to the incoming government. That elevated inflation, which has been on the march for the last couple of years, has produced seven interest rate rises in a row. That is the legacy of the Liberal Party of Australia. That is the parting gift of the Liberal Party of Australia to the incoming government. We have taken responsibility for that from day one. The Prime Minister has put out there his five-point plan. Very important to ensuring that we have sustainable growth in this economy is to put in place our five-point plan to tackle inflation, and we are doing just that. - We all know that those opposite dropped the ball on inflation. If anyone wants any proof of that, watch Four Corners tonight. - What we will see on Four Corners tonight is all of the disunity in the former government on display in all of its glory. - I think Australians, as they are watching Four Corners tonight, when all the disunity is on display, when the complacency of the former government is on display -  - Mr Speaker, I have answered the question. We aim to get it as low as possible. That is the objective of the Rudd government: to get it as low as possible. But I am sure the Australian people will want to know tonight -  - I think Australians will want to know, when these meetings were taking place at the Quay Grand, who was running the Australian economy. Who was fighting the fight against inflation? - Who was guarding against reckless spending while they were out there stabbing each other in the back? This government will always put the national interest above the petty interests of those opposite and what they were doing at that time.</DOC>

 - I appreciate the question from the honourable gentleman and I appreciate the opportunity to outline to the House the actions the government has taken in its first few months in relation to transparency in the petrol market. On 18 December, less than a fortnight after the Rudd government was sworn in, we issued formal monitoring powers to the ACCC. These powers give the ACCC the ability to subpoena documents and witnesses if they fear anticompetitive conduct at any point in the petrol supply chain.Importantly, on Saturday we fulfilled another election commitment with the announcement that Mr Pat Walker will be Australia's new petrol commissioner. Mr Walker has been Consumer Protection Commissioner and petrol commissioner in Western Australia for the last 10 years. Under his leadership and the leadership of the Western Australian government, petrol prices have been a major focus of the Department of Consumer and Employment Protection in Western Australia. Indeed, Perth has gone from being one of the more expensive cities in Australia for petrol to one of the cheapest. I have asked the new Petrol Commissioner to investigate the recent increases in LPG and diesel prices which have been causing concern across the country, and particularly in relation to diesel in rural and regional areas, and to report back to the government on what more can or should be done. I welcome the endorsement from the Leader of the Opposition of that action.The ACCC's petrol report, handed to the government last December, underlines the need for these sorts of actions. The ACCC found the wholesale petrol market in Australia to be 'a comfortable oligopoly'. Perhaps it is comfortable for producers, but it is not comfortable for consumers. It is important to understand that our position in government is the same as it was in opposition. The biggest impact on Australian petrol prices comes from world oil prices. But, when world oil prices are so high, it is incumbent on the government of the day to do everything possible to put downward pressure on prices by ensuring the market is working competitively - something the previous government did not do. They shrugged their shoulders and said over 11 years, 'Australian working families have never been better off.' Therefore they chose not to take action in relation to petrol prices. This government has a different approach. We believe that through competition and transparency we can put downward pressure on petrol prices, and that is what we will continue to do. I am pleased to report to the House that the Rudd government has done more to introduce transparency into the petrol market in Australia in the last 2Â½ months than the previous government did in 11Â½ years.There is, of course, more to do. We will continue to work with the ACCC on their suggestions and recommendations for action, including investigation of the so-called buy-sell arrangements between oil companies, which mean that a problem in a refinery of one producer flows through to other producers and all consumers pay more for their petrol. We will also continue to work on the issues of transparency and more information for consumers that the ACCC raised in their report.Given that I have been asked by the honourable member for Leichhardt about the government's actions since the election, it is appropriate that I inform the House of some of the third-party commentary on those actions in relation to transparency in the petrol market. Peter Kell, the CEO of Choice, has said:We are pleased to see the federal government stepping in on behalf of consumers in relation to petrol prices -  - Peter Kell said:We are pleased to see the federal government stepping in on behalf of consumers in relation to petrol prices and are especially pleased to see the ACCC has now been given a greater monitoring role.The President of the NRMA, Mr Alan Evans, said:Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Assistant Treasurer Chris Bowen should be congratulated for acting quickly to expand the powers of the ACCC and work towards appointing a Petrol Commissioner as soon as possible.On the weekend Mike Harris, Chief Executive of the AAA -  -  - Mike Harris, the Chief Executive of the AAA, the peak motoring body for Australia, said:The AAA motoring clubs -  - The AAA, the premium motoring organisation in Australia, said:The AAA motoring clubs - the NRMA, RACV, RACQ - And all the state motoring organisations - welcome ... Mr Walker's appointment and we believe the scope of his brief will ensure motorists are paying a fair and reasonable cost for their fuel.There is just one more. I did say I would inform the House of third-party independent commentators. I must admit: the next one is not a third-party independent commentator. She is the former leader of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory. She said on 18 December, after I was interviewed on Darwin ABC radio:We know governments and the ACCC are doing what they can on petrol, and I don't think people expect more than that. I am pleased to hear what the federal minister had to say this morning.I am glad that at least one conservative leader has taken a constructive approach to the issue of petrol prices in Australia. I note that the leader of the National Party has called for the GST to be reduced on petrol. Eleven years in office and they never came up with that idea. - Eleven years in office and now all of a sudden they think they have a plan. I am not sure if it is actually official National Party policy. We can never be sure these days.Opposition Â members interjecting - </DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. At the election Labor made a clear commitment not only to continue with AusLink 1 but also to expand our funding for AusLink 2. What we need is a plan to deal with infrastructure in an integrated fashion. We need a plan for road and we need a plan for rail. We need a plan that recognises that we need to get our goods to port and we need to get our people around our cities. With regard to the specific question which the minister raised, I am very pleased that this week I will be introducing into the parliament legislation to create Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia will conduct an audit of the infrastructure needs of the nation, both now and into the future. It will be able to establish an infrastructure priority list based upon objective criteria, with input from the Commonwealth, input from the state, input from local government, as well as input from the private sector. - This government does indeed have a very different approach towards these processes. What we will not do is make promises during election campaigns to the point whereby they simply do not add up. With regard to the now opposition's AusLink commitments, during the federal election campaign they just made promises regardless of whether or not they added up. They made promises because they knew they were never going to be in a position to fulfil them.What is interesting about the specific question raised by the shadow minister is that he was the minister prior to the election. Did he do anything about it? No. Did the previous National Party minister do anything about it? No. Did the minister before that do anything about it? No. And yet, just 11 weeks post the November 24 election, they have come in here and put forward specific questions about commitments that were given. I will tell you what we will be doing. We will be doing two things. One, we will be establishing a proper process so that assessments can be given in terms of priority, establishing one that consults with Commonwealth-state governments and the private sector. Two, we will be repairing the state of the Commonwealth finances caused by the national pork-barrelling and waste whereby the former government were prepared to just make commitments regardless of whether they added up.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calwell for that question. Yesterday the government of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence for the nation-state of Kosovo. This unilateral declaration of independence followed a long period of negotiation between Kosovo and Serbia, largely under the auspices of UNMIK. As members would appreciate, this long period of negotiation has not been successful. There has been no agreement between Kosovo and Serbia. I think it is true to say that there will not be unanimous community welcoming of yesterday's unilateral declaration of independence, and that was reflected in the debate in the Security Council yesterday. Having said that, Australia very strongly supports recognition of Kosovo's independence. We believe that that is the best way forward for peace and stability not only in Kosovo but also in south-eastern Europe. The Australian government urges the relevant leaders - Prime Minister Thaci of Kosovo and President Tadic of Serbia - to ensure that whatever disagreements there are between Serbia and Kosovo, whether on the unilateral declaration of independence or on other matters, they are resolved peacefully and in a way which does not incite violence.The Australian government also urges this view upon relevant parts of the Australian community. We know that attitudes towards the independence of Kosovo are strongly held in sections of the Australian community, and whatever views are expressed should be expressed by way of restraint so as to ensure that all persons' views in this matter are respected.The Australian government's approach to recognition is that the Australian government recognises nation-states, not governments. The criteria for the recognition of nation-states are that we find a permanent population, a defined territory, a capacity for effective government and a capacity to have relations with other nation-states. We believe that these criteria are met in the case of Kosovo; and, as a consequence, we are very favourably disposed to recognition of Kosovo. We are currently in discussions with our allies, partners and friends about our approach, and after these discussions we look forward to formal recognition of Kosovo at an early opportunity.I think one of the very key priorities for Kosovo into the future is to ensure the rights and the safety of minorities in Kosovo, including and in particular the protection of cultural and heritage sites. We have seen in Kosovo and in south-eastern Europe in the last decade or so a very sorry history. Australia played its part with the warm and generous welcoming of Kosovar refugees to our shores a few years ago. The Australian government very strongly believes that the best way forward for peace and stability in Kosovo and in south-eastern Europe is to recognise the independence of Kosovo under international supervision, and after appropriate discussion with allies, friends and other nation-states, we hope very quickly to move to such a formal recognition.</DOC>

 - I never made any such comment. My comment in New York at a lunch of potential or prospective and current investors into Australia was along the following lines: firstly, that one of the things that has made Australia a prosperous nation has been Australia being an attractive place for capital investment - originally and historically, overseas capital investment and, more recently, domestic capital investment led by Labor's great superannuation reforms; and, secondly, that we had been a prosperous society by being a great trading nation.I encouraged investors to invest in Australia by making points which went to the attractiveness of investment in Australia. I also drew attention to one of our current problems. That problem is called inflation. I made the point that, far from being neglectful and complacent about inflation, the new Rudd Labor government had made combating inflation its highest economic priority. I would have thought that any investor contemplating investing in Australia, either a domestic investor or an overseas investor, would want to ensure, would want to know, would want to be confident that the government of Australia was on the case when it came to making sure that inflation and, as a consequence, interest rates were under control, rather than being neglectful and complacent about it as our predecessors had been for a long period of time.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I will deal with the 'why' first. Over the last five years without a Doha conclusion the growth in world trade has been twice the rate of growth in world output. The message from that is clear: if we can get growth in world markets, and through the liberalisation of our trade agenda, that will create the environment for sustained economic growth. It is important not only for us but also for the global economy. That is the reason that it is critical that we get a successful outcome in the Doha Round - not just any outcome, but an ambitious one that deals with agriculture, with industrial goods and with services.As to the likelihood of that outcome, in my judgement, whilst it will be terribly difficult, it is doable. There has developed a new political will - and this was demonstrated at the recent conference of trade ministers in Davos - to achieve a successful and ambitious outcome. This has been backed up in the dynamic of that political will in three new texts that have recently been issued in Geneva dealing with those three areas that I talked of before. But it is one thing to have the text; it is another to maintain the political will to achieve the outcome. I think - and this seemed to be the view of the ministers present - that, at this time of global uncertainty in the world economy, trade ministers can do a great deal by introducing some certainty to that uncertain environment.Finally, can I just say that, even if we do succeed in Doha, this is really only the beginning of the next set of trade rounds. We on this side of the parliament have always taken the view that what we need to do is get the most ambitious outcome at the multilateral level, to reinforce and enhance that at the regional level and to reinforce it again at the bilateral level. We have never been against bilateral trade arrangements; our criticism of the previous government is that they reversed that order. They put the emphasis on the bilateral rounds and they achieved outcomes that drew away from the multilateral outcome both in resources and in terms of outcome.It is also our view that the previous government squandered the opportunity presented by our riding the resources boom to sustain our economic future. In terms of their leadership of the Cairns Group, we do not believe they took the opportunity that that structure presented to reach out to the newly emerging groups in this Doha Round. This government will take a new strategic direction and make a new commitment to achieving the outcome at the multilateral level, enhancing it at the regional level and enhancing it again at the bilateral level - WTO-plus. That is what this country needs. But you have to start at the beginning. The previous government never got there. We hope to help turn that around.</DOC>

 - I note that the agreement that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has in her hand would have been negotiated under the previous government. But, putting that to one side, I will explain Labor's industrial relations policies, which can be read by any of the members of the Work Choices political party in this parliament. If they read those policies, they will find that you can make a collective agreement which has in it flexibilities but the underlying benchmark is a no disadvantage test against the full award. The underlying benchmark under Work Choices in its initial phase was against five protected conditions - only five - which means that everything else could have been signed away, and routinely was. Indeed, the then Howard-Costello government advocated the trading away of conditions for nothing in the example of Billy. - I am explaining, or endeavouring to explain, to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that I am for collective agreement making when parties choose to do it. Whether parties choose to use a union or choose not to use a union is a matter for them; that is a question of freedom of association.What is the job of government? The job of government is to set the appropriate benchmark to make sure people are protected. What is the appropriate benchmark? It is the full award. What was the benchmark under the Work Choices party? It was five minimum conditions. That meant leave loading - about which she claims to be concerned - could be traded away for nothing, penalty rates could be traded away for nothing, overtime could be traded away for nothing and so on and so forth. They sat there and knew it was happening and did nothing about it.I understand that, as the Four Corners show will reveal, they are deeply divided about a number of things, but the one thing they all seem to believe -  - I do not contend that the Four Corners show is relevant but it is going to be interesting to watch; there is no doubt about that. Irrelevant or not, I suspect a lot of people in this parliament will be watching it.The benchmark the government has set is a full no disadvantage test against an award. That means that you always get better than the award. Under the Work Choices party, you could always get worse than the award. Using their Senate numbers to keep Work Choices going is what they are guaranteeing today - more rip-offs of working families.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flynn for this question. I am pleased to have him in the House because he grew up in Gladstone and has lived and worked there for most of his life, in one of the key regional resources and energy regions of Australia. More importantly, he joins a growing band of regional members of the government, such as the representatives of Capricornia, Dawson, Leichhardt, Lingiari, Solomon, Lyons, Hunter and Brand, who have a good appreciation of the importance of the resources and energy sector to the Australian community. They very much appreciate that the resources and energy sector in Australia represents some major challenges.It is interesting to note that the Leader of the National Party did not, for example, question the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government today about the AusLink investments in key regional centres - investments which the opposition failed to match during the election - such as the AusLink money being spent in places such as Dampier, Karratha, Bunbury and Esperance to try and overcome some of the infrastructure blockages in those key resources centres around Australia.Let us go to the issue of skills shortages. We all appreciate that the resources and energy sector is vital to Australia's future. One of the responsibilities of the Minister for Trade is not only to ensure that we maintain momentum on resources and energy but also to guarantee that we diversify the Australian industry base so as to make sure that, whilst we ride the resources boom for the foreseeable future, we open up additional employment and export opportunities for Australia. That is very important to the future of Australia. This is about a government actually confronting Australia with the need to make the hard decisions on a variety of fronts to guarantee that Australia is best positioned to confront the challenges of the 21st century. The resources sector is one of those vital sectors. It represents five per cent of Australia's GDP. Importantly, when you add the downstream processing and associated minerals activity, it represents 20 per cent of Australia's GDP. It also represents more than half of Australia's export opportunities at the moment. We are talking about a nation that sees the resources and energy sector as being very much central to where we go in the next 20, 30 and 40 years.One of the problems is not only infrastructure blockages but huge shortages of skills in Australia. We have to make sure that we do everything possible to overcome these key skills and infrastructure blockages, because in the resources and energy sector they are very much central to our future wealth and prosperity as a nation.Let us deal with some of the backlog with respect to potential investment in Australia in the foreseeable future. At the moment, the investment planned in the resources sector is estimated at about $30 billion, up from $22 billion in 2006-07 and more than double the average expenditure over the last quarter of a century. So one of our challenges is to work with a whole-of-government approach to try and overcome some of the skills shortages at the moment, skills shortages which are in danger of stranding resources and energy development in Australia. You have to understand that, once it is stranded and investment goes elsewhere, it will be a long time before Australia attracts that investment back, and we will therefore miss out on important skilling and export opportunities.I am pleased to say, in a complimentary way, that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship recently announced an increase in skilled migration of 6,000 people for this current financial year, with a special focus on the resources and construction sector.More importantly, I am also pleased to say that during a recent visit to the Pilbara with the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs we had an important opportunity to actually sit down with key resource companies such as Woodside, Chevron, BHP and Rio to talk about the problems that confront them. They reinforced to us that the issue of skilled labour is one of the biggest problems in Australia. They also appreciate our endeavours not only to increase skilled migration but also to build integrity back into the 457 visa class, because it is important to their future. We also had the opportunity to talk about the support that the minister for Indigenous affairs is going to give to the resources and energy sector to try and maximise Indigenous employment and training opportunities.I also welcome the recent announcements by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister of not only creating additional training places but also bringing on Skills Australia. This is not just about government at federal and state levels acting on this front. It is also about reminding the private sector: 'Training is not a cost of running your business; it is an investment in your future.' So we are looking to that new partnership. I encourage those key resource companies in major regional centres in Australia to actually start doing the work now with their local high schools and local communities: be on the ground running when we announce and put in place key election commitments to put apprentices back in schools, where they belong - to get these young people to start their apprenticeships at school. That will give us a better opportunity to enable them to finish school and also to start an apprenticeship, which will create great career opportunities for the rest of their lives. I simply say in conclusion that the resource and energy sectors are important to Australia, and the responsibility of all ministers, including me, is to actually do what we can to overcome the blockages on the infrastructure front and the skills front that could leave Australian resources stranded. In doing so, can I say time is not on our side. Our responsibility is to make sure we take the hard decisions to enable a modern Australia to confront the 21st century and guarantee working people a vibrant future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for this question. As I said in response to a question in this place last week, firstly, the number of question times in this House this year will increase relative to the average annual number of question times through the duration of the Howard government. That is very important. Secondly, the number of sitting days for the parliament will also be greater than was the case under the Howard government. These provide ample opportunities for members to ask questions of the executive - a greater number, in fact, than existed on average over the years of the Howard government - and a greater opportunity for members such as the member for Maranoa to raise questions in this place and to use the opportunity to stand up in private members' business to put forward the interests of the good people of Maranoa and the challenges that they face. As the government peruse observations and reflections made by the member for Maranoa about what needs to be done in Charleville, Roma and places like that, we will be very attentive to what those contain and will reflect on them in the responses we provide.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, as this is my first opportunity, can I congratulate you on your election to high office. I think you have already shown a great capacity to chair this magnificent chamber. - I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for his question. It is a very important question. Indeed, this particular area of public policy has a great bearing on Western Sydney. I know he understands that and I certainly will want to work with him on this particular matter over the course of the parliamentary term. Skills and training are vital to Australia's future prosperity and our ability to compete on the international stage. We all know that a skilled society is central to the next wave of economic reform, but the previous Liberal government left Australia with its worst skills shortage in living memory. That shortage has critically affected key industries and put at risk our economic growth. This is exemplified by the migration occupations in demand list, which has seen the number of occupations on the shortage list increase by 400 per cent since 1999. In less than 10 years, there has been a fourfold increase of occupations on that particular list, which is indeed an indictment of the previous government. We told the Australian people we would improve employment services to get more Australians into work and to help employers get skilled labour to boost their productivity. We will create a new suite of employment programs which will provide better opportunities for training and indeed for a more skilled workforce. The Rudd government are committed to addressing the severe skills shortages in Australia. Before the election, we actually committed to 450,000 vocational education and training places over the next four-year period, which I think is a significant commitment to providing the training required for Australians. In the area of my own portfolio, 175,000 places out of those 450,000 will be provided specifically for Australians entering and re-entering the workforce from unemployment. We are already acting on that commitment, and that is why 20,000 of those training places will be rolled out between 1 April and 30 June this year.The second part of the honourable member's question asks why Australia is facing such a severe skills crisis, which is putting at risk our long-term economic prosperity. For almost 12 long years vocational education and training was relegated to the bottom of the government's priorities. It was not even regarded as a significant matter by the previous government. There is a case in point with respect to that particular assertion. Under the previous government the number of apprenticeships and traineeships commenced as a result of a Job Network placement fell by more than half. Between 1998 and 1999 there were 32,807 places compared with only 14,925 in the financial year 2006-07. That is a disgrace. That is an indictment of the self-absorption, the self-interest and the incompetence of the previous government. If you want to see some more signs of that, watch Four Corners tonight because we know there will be versions of history and revisionism going on. There will be many versions, as we know. It will underline -  - how absorbed the previous government was. There was no investment in training; there was just a 'get them into any job at any cost' mentality. In my portfolio, that blinkered approach created an employment system with the wrong emphasis, where training and education had little or no value. I refer the House to the words of the Age's economics editor, who only on 5 February said: 'The Howard government dropped the ball on skills training.' Indeed it did. And as recently as two days ago the Daily Telegraph reported on a survey conducted by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research. It found that 80 per cent of large employers have had difficulty recruiting over the last 12 months. That is 80 per cent of large employers, up from 68 per cent in 2005.The Rudd government is currently waging a war on inflation. We will continue to fight that war, something that was neglected by the previous government for more than a decade.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Building on the answer which has just been given by my honourable colleague concerning vocational education and training: this is core business for the new Australian government. It was marginal business for the government we replaced. You see that in the pattern of expenditure; you see that also in the inflation challenges that are before the Australian economy. We have had warning after warning from the Reserve Bank about skills shortages in the Australian economy, going back years and years, about which the previous government did nothing, as a consequence of which we have inflationary pressures unleashed in the Australian economy -  - Part and parcel of dealing with the skills shortages is what we do with voc ed and training. And a core part of that is what we do with voc ed and training in schools. I remember visiting schools during the election campaign, including the school that the Treasurer and I attended as kids. It is an absolute disgrace that, at this stage in the country's history, trades training centres such as that have barely changed an inch since we attended that school back in the early to mid-1970s. And you see this pattern right across the country, with mums and dads across Australia saying, 'I want my kids to have decent access to voc ed at school' -  - Therefore the challenge lies in making sure that kids from working families have decent opportunities for trades training in schools. The previous government just waved goodbye to that and for 11Â½ years did fundamentally nothing for hundreds and thousands of young Australian kids wanting to pursue a trade. Kids wanted to pursue a career in the motor trades, a career in carpentry or other careers in industrial design, but there were no real opportunities available to them. They had to wait for an alternative government to stand up here - and I recall doing so - at the dispatch box in the budget reply and say, 'Enough is enough is enough: this government, were it to be elected, would be committed to delivering trades training centres to each of Australia's 2,650 secondary schools.' We have committed funding for doing that into the years ahead. It will be delivered, as we undertook at the last election, because we are a government committed to honouring our undertakings to the Australian people, unlike those who preceded us, who categorised their promises into that which was core and that which was non-core, because they did not believe in the promises they gave in the first place.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Following the fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942, then Labor Prime Minister John Curtin predicted the beginning of war on Australian soil. He said:The fall of Singapore opens the battle for Australia. Our honeymoon is finished.Four days later, war came to Australian shores with two air raids launched on Darwin. The two air raids killed more than 250 people and wounded between 300 and 400 people. Twenty military aircraft were destroyed, eight ships at anchor in the harbour were sunk, and most civil and military facilities in Darwin were devastated. The air attacks on Darwin continued until November 1943, with Darwin being attacked some 64 times. This was testament to Darwin's pivotal role in the war effort into the islands.During the war other towns in Northern Australia were also attacked, with bombs being dropped on Townsville, Katherine, Wyndham, Derby, Broome and Port Hedland. The battle for Australia was a struggle that encompassed a nation's heart and soul, as Australia resisted the enemy's attacks on its soil and territories. The threat of invasion was very real. The struggle stretched our nation's resources to the limit. Men and women in uniform and men, women and children on the home front responded to the call. The battle for Australia comprised the bombing of Northern Australia, the Battle of the Coral Sea and those battles along the Kokoda track and from Milne Bay through to Buna, Gona and Sanananda. The defence of Australia became a springboard for victory.The Battle for Australia Commemoration National Council was formed in 1988 to encourage annual commemoration of the battle for Australia on the first Wednesday in September each year. The date coincides with the anniversary of the Battle of Milne Bay, which proved to be the first of many Japanese land defeats in the Pacific war and a turning point in the defence of our nation.This government went to the electorate promising to formally recognise Battle for Australia Day as a national day of observance - action the previous government would not take. Work is underway for the Governor-General to issue a proclamation to observe Battle for Australia Day on the first Wednesday in September each year. It will not be a public holiday or an alternative to Anzac Day or Remembrance Day, but it will provide all of us with the opportunity to reflect on the momentous events that helped shape our nation and to remember those who lost their lives to protect our freedom and way of life.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I am not aware of the comments of the petrol commissioner, but I tell you what: I am very pleased that he has been appointed. Everybody on this side of the House wants a petrol cop on the beat in the ACCC full-time. This side of the House is committed to competitive markets. Competitive markets are very important at a time when prices are on the rise, which is why we made the commitment to the appointment of a petrol commissioner.We had to shame the opposition when they were in government into doing something in this area at all. We eventually forced them to have an inquiry. That was a good thing. The problem was that they did not do anything. But within 10 weeks we have put in place a petrol commissioner. Our objective is to put the pressure on the petrol companies to ensure that motorists do not pay one cent more than they have to, one cent more than is fair. That is the commitment that the Rudd government made to the Australian people.And we have gone further. We have put in place the grocery inquiry, something those opposite could not do in 11 long years, something those opposite could never do.So on this side of the House we are absolutely determined to protect working families. We understand -  - The Rudd government is determined to ensure that consumers get value for money. Those opposite had 11 long years to take action. Did they do anything? They did nothing. You are going to see this government very active in this area of competition policy to ensure that Australians get the best value for money, whether it is at the petrol bowser or in the supermarket.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Franklin for her question. Australia faces a range of economic challenges at present, challenges which come from abroad and challenges which are being generated domestically. From abroad we see corrections to growth projections across many of the developed economies in the world, coming out of in part the subprime crisis in the United States - revision downwards in growth for the American economy, those in Europe and those in Japan.But on the domestic front we also face a serious economic challenge arising from inflationary pressures in the economy. At the time the government took office at the end of last year, inflation in this country was running at its highest rate in 16 years. It did not get there overnight. Further on the inflation front, this morning the Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Malcolm Edey, highlighted the risk in a speech to the Committee for Economic Development in Australia. In that speech Mr Edey stated that for the Australian economy 'the main domestic challenges are those of strong demand, tight capacity and inflationary pressures'. Mr Edey added the warning that the consumer price index's annual figure 'could spike to something close to four per cent next quarter'.The threat of rising inflation, as I said before, has not arisen overnight. We have seen the emergence of data on rising inflationary pressures in the economy over some years now. The Reserve Bank Statement on monetary policy most recently projected ahead that this economy was in the likelihood of receiving inflation outcomes in 2008, 2009 and through to mid-2010 which would be at or above the projected Reserve Bank upper range of three per cent.These mean that the government and the nation must act in concert in the fight against inflation. We, the government, are the first to concede that inflation cannot be controlled by all factors which lie within domestic policy. You have massive boosts to the terms of trade. That has an effect in terms of the amount of consumption which then flows around in the domestic Australian economy. Another causative factor of these inflationary pressures is what is happening with the drought in recent times.But there are factors which are within the range of government policy, and they go to what we can do on the question of public demand, what we can do through budget policy, what we can do when it comes to boosting private savings, what we can do when it comes to inflation and what we can do when it comes to infrastructure as well as skills and participation in the economy. That is why the government has articulated a clear-cut strategy in its fight against inflation. Our five-point plan deals with, one, what do we do with the overall projection for the budget surplus; two, what do we do to boost private savings; three and four, what can we do to boost skills and infrastructure; and, five, increasing our overall workforce participation rate. This is a clear-cut plan for the future and is necessary if we are to confront the challenge of inflation.Part of the participation challenge lies with what we do in industrial relations to ensure that we have a flexible system which is both fair for working people and flexible for employers. That is why we believe in having an industrial relations system which gets the balance right, an industrial relations system which says to working families, 'Here is a fair outcome for working families,' and says to employers, 'Here are a flexible set of arrangements which enable you to build your businesses into the future,' and overall to enhance participation in the economy and long-term productivity growth. We know on this side of the House where we stand on industrial relations. Our position on industrial relations has been rock solid throughout the year leading up to the 2007 election. Everyone knows what we stood for. We would abolish Work Choices; we would abolish AWAs.We have not seen so far parallel parity from those opposite. In fact, what we have seen from those opposite is an evolution of positions. We had the opposition leader telling us just after the election that Work Choices was dead. Then straight afterwards they unleashed the Senate to try and give Work Choices some mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, bring it back to life and make sure that our legislation in the Senate would be frustrated to the greatest extent possible. Now we have the third iteration, the third evolution, coming out of the party room today. As of today, Tuesday, I think Work Choices is off again. I think it has gone again, but I am not altogether clear and I would like some clarification from those opposite. We have had flip, flop and flap when it comes to the whole question of Work Choices and the future of AWAs. I gather we are up to the flap stage but I am all ears to hear what the current status of Liberal Party policy is formally on Work Choices and AWAs for the future.If the Liberal Party is returned to office in the future, and whichever group within the Liberal Party happens to have assumed dominance by that stage, where will their industrial relations policy stand at that point? I know that the Leader of the Opposition's chief of staff is gung-ho on this stuff; he comes from ACCI. I know that a whole lot of people are gung-ho on this stuff. So, once they get the chance, as happened before the 2004 election, whatever is said before the election, we know one thing for certain: what they say before the election they will turn turtle on after the election. We have got flip, flop, flap now on Work Choices. If they return to office, the guarantee is that we will have another extreme, hardline approach to industrial relations, because the party opposite has lost its way and lost touch altogether with working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question because it is true - it is absolutely true - that the participation rate in Queensland and Western Australia has increased substantially. The participation rate has increased and the unemployment rate has gone down - and isn't it a fantastic thing that the participation rate in Queensland and Western Australia has upped substantially and that unemployment is down? And one of the reasons why this has occurred is that people have gone back into the workforce. -  - Absolutely - people in those states have gone back into the workforce, and what that has done is enhance the labour supply in those states, and that is very good for a lot of people. There are members all around here who will have older women or older men in their electorates who are back in the workforce for the first time in a long time because the participation rate has increased in those states. At the very core of our plan to lift productivity in this economy, to combat inflation, is to lift workforce participation. That is one of the reasons why we are so supportive of the income-tax cuts which we have argued for for a long period of time, because people on modest wages do deserve some incentive. Particularly when it comes to second-income earners, we have to design an income taxation system and a transfer system which gives them incentives when they go back to work. So not only is it older workers -  - Yesterday, the shadow Treasurer wanted to engage in some sort of arid debate about NAIRU. And what we have today is a repeat of the stupidity of yesterday from the shadow Treasurer. This is what the former governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Macfarlane, had to say about what the shadow Treasurer was saying yesterday -  -  - Listen for a second. Let's just listen to what the former Governor of the Reserve Bank had to say about the proposition that was put by the shadow Treasurer yesterday. He said:I do not think it is a particularly useful construct. I do not think I have ever heard it mentioned in the Reserve Bank boardroom.The NAIRU has never been mentioned in the Reserve Bank boardroom. And there is a reason for that: it is not used in practical economics. -  -  -  - The reforms that are required to ensure that we have strong growth across the whole of this country, but most particularly in Western Australia and Queensland, are precisely the reforms that go to the core of the Rudd government's five-point plan. And it has been the complacency of those opposite over a long period of time, when it came to investment in skills, when it came to their failure to deal with infrastructure bottlenecks, that has put upward pressure on inflation and made it harder in all states of Australia, but most particularly in those states, to have strong growth with low inflation.So the answer to the question is a very simple one: put in place a raft of reforms that lift productivity, lift economic growth and put downward pressure on inflation. And that is what our reform of federal-state relations is all about. That is what the Deputy Prime Minister is talking about when she is talking about investing in skills. That is what the minister for infrastructure is talking about: things that those opposite could not do for 11 long years. So if you cannot be part of the solution, you certainly will never ever be fit to govern this country.</DOC>

 - Yesterday the Prime Minister and I sought to ensure the destruction of the remaining Work Choices propaganda of the Howard-Costello government. We arranged for the recycling of 436,000 Work Choices booklets. We made sure that they were taken off to the recyclers so that they could be turned into things more useful - things like scribble paper for children. There were some suggestions from the media about other uses that these paper products could be put to, but I will not go there. But we did ensure that these booklets would be recycled. Of course, this was part of the $121 million propaganda blitz of the Howard-Costello government to try and sell its grossly unfair Work Choices laws, which stripped basic working conditions away from Australian families. We know that even that government thought it was best to start shredding these booklets, because 3Â½ million of them were in fact sent off to the recyclers before the election. The waste of taxpayers' money was just amazing.I have to say that I allowed myself to believe yesterday that the Prime Minister and I had brought an end to the scourge of Work Choices propaganda in this country, just as we are committed to bringing an end to the scourge of Work Choices itself. I had allowed myself to believe yesterday that we had achieved that goal, but overnight I have discovered more. Whilst the Four Corners program was exhibiting Liberal rats in the ranks, I found 100,000 Work Choices propaganda mousepads lying around from the days of the Howard-Costello government. I am going to ask the House to help me with a very difficult issue here, which is this: one can easily recycle booklets; it is less clear what one can do to recycle mousepads. What I am committed to doing -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Can I reassure you that it is not my intention to scare small children through that distribution of these mousepads. They would obviously be very worried about their parents' working conditions if this turned up at their school. I do have a dilemma, which is what to do with these 100,000 mousepads. It is my intention to send them to the supporters of Work Choices, so there are 65 on their way to the opposition members in the House of Representatives and there are 38 on their way to the opposition senators. Now I have 99,897 left and I cannot find another Work Choices supporter to send them to. If anybody has any suggestions about what to do with the remainder of the 100,000 mousepads, I would be very grateful to receive them. In sending these mousepads to the opposition today, I do not know if I have made an error, because I watched the press conference of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition at lunchtime today. - I am not sure whether I have sent the Work Choices mousepads to the right people. I watched the press conference of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition today. I have to say that I listened carefully but, having listened to that press conference, I have no idea what on earth is going on. This is the same Deputy Leader of the Opposition who said that she was going to defend AWAs with a no-disadvantage test to the death. She was reported in the newspaper in quotes as saying that she would not be 'complicit in a downturn' -  - Well, I read the newspaper reports and some of our friends upstairs have them. - On the question of marketing Work Choices, of course, Work Choices was the policy of the Howard-Costello government. We need to ask, 'Who is it the policy of now?' We know the Deputy Leader of the Opposition wanted AWAs with a no-disadvantage test. Now she does not know whether she is going to amend the bill, whether she is not going to amend the bill, whether she is going to amend it in the Senate, whether she is not going to amend it in the Senate -  -  - Yes, Work Choices is horrible and you are in a horrible mess. Yes, that is absolutely true. - On the question of the mousepads, can I say this: we are now in a situation where we do not know whether you stand behind this propaganda or the policy that led to it, but what we suspect is that - </DOC>

 - It would appear that the member for Wentworth does not understand the reason why there is a need to crack down on government spending. On top of the figures he has quoted, I will add another one: government spending is currently running at a 4Â½ per cent real increase in the current financial year, well ahead of the growth projections - either of the growth projections that he quoted - in the economy. That is what we inherited from the previous government. We inherited a situation where inflation is beyond the Reserve Bank's target band. It is at 3.6 per cent underlying. We inherited a situation where we had five interest rate increases in the previous six months, and we inherited a situation where government spending is running out of control. The primary commitment of this government is to ensure that government spending gets into an area that will ensure that we put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates.Let me remind the member for Wentworth that, if he talks to business, the one thing they will tell him they do not want is inflation to take off in this country. The one thing that business in the mineral sector and in other sectors of the economy that are so crucial to the future of this nation do not want is inflation to take off, because that erodes savings, it erodes productivity and, most importantly of all, contrary to the commentary from the Leader of the Opposition a couple of weeks ago, higher inflation means higher interest rates. It means higher interest rates for homebuyers and it means higher interest rates for businesses. So that is why the government is committed to getting government spending under control. - The question I was asked was about growth projections and the significance for sectors of the economy that are particularly important to the future of the Australian economy, especially the mining sector, and how this connected with the government's economic policy. What I am trying to explain to the member for Wentworth, who amazingly was described the other day by a journalist as one of the more numerate members of this House, is that the critical commitment of this government is to get under control the inflation problem that was left by the former government, and that means getting government spending under control. It means getting rid of the sort of nonsense that we inherited, some of which we cut out of the budget a couple of weeks ago and more of which we are going to cut out. It means cutting government advertising. It means getting rid of the regional rorts. It means getting rid of the plethora of spending programs, all of which were contributing to a pattern of increased government spending, 4Â½ per cent in real terms -  - I will conclude on this point. The opposition has a fundamental question that they have to ask themselves, and that is this: do you think there is a problem? Do you think there is a problem with government spending in this country? Do you accept that it is running too fast and that it needs to be brought back under control? And do you believe that programs like, for example, the $3 million that had been earmarked for the fishing hall of fame are fundamental to the economic future of this country, or would you like to relieve the tax and interest rate burden on ordinary working people in this country? That is the fundamental question that you need to ask yourselves, because at this point we do not know. The member for Wentworth has told us that the inflation problem is a fairytale. The opposition leader has said that the government has taken over an economy in first-rate condition. So the question you need to answer is: is there a problem with inflation in this country, or do you think it is a fairytale?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question, because it is a very important one. Today the Reserve Bank released minutes of its February meeting, and this was a first. I do not intend to give a running commentary on Reserve Bank board minutes and their publication, but I would certainly like to welcome their publication and the increased transparency in the conduct of monetary policy. These minutes will help working families better understand the reasons behind interest rate movements.Within weeks of the election of the Rudd government, the governor and I issued a joint statement on the conduct of monetary policy in which we committed to a number of governance reforms that enhance the independence and transparency of the Reserve Bank. The statement delivers on the Rudd government's election commitment to strengthen the independence of the Reserve Bank and to enhance the transparency of its decisions. Firstly, and this is the very important one, we increased the statutory independence of the positions of the governor and the deputy governor so that termination would require parliamentary approval. Secondly, we agreed to make future Reserve Bank board appointments from a register of candidates of the highest integrity. This was to ensure we did not see a repeat of the Gerard affair.Strengthening the independence of the RBA is a critical part of the government's commitment to putting downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. The Rudd government has a five-point plan to fight inflation and will ensure the government is working with the Reserve Bank and not against it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. In our five-point plan to combat inflation, to tackle the inflationary pressures in the Australian economy, we made it very, very clear that we would allow the automatic stabilisers to work. It is very important that we put in place a fiscal policy that backs up the monetary policy which is put together by an independent Reserve Bank board. And because, as the Minister for Finance and Deregulation was saying, spending has been out of control, we have got to bring it back into control. We have had the fastest increase in spending in the past four-year period out of any four-year period in the past 15 years. That expansion of Commonwealth demand simply has to be brought under control. That is why we have said that we will set an objective of a surplus of at least 1.5 per cent of GDP in our next budget. - The Commonwealth will provide the leadership that those opposite could not provide in recent years. - It was interesting watching the ABC last night. The ABC last night showed in all its glory the disunity in the coalition -  -  - We will pursue our objective of having a surplus, as a percentage of GDP, of at least 1.5 per cent. We will provide the leadership to restrain the spending that those opposite could not restrain. Of course, the former Treasurer is on the record, in the Howard biography, complaining that the previous Prime Minister, in 2004, went on a reckless spending spree - a reckless spending spree that put upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates. The consequence of that has been seven interest rate rises in the last three years. - We have a very specific commitment in this budget process to have a surplus of at least 1.5 per cent of GDP and to keep our commitments over the cycle.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. There appears to be some confusion amongst some members of the House about the impact of Australian workplace agreements and Work Choices on hardworking Australians. The member for North Sydney last night said that former cabinet ministers of the Howard government did not know about the impact of AWAs on hardworking families. I note the shadow minister for foreign affairs disagreed with this view on radio this morning, where he said:I heard what Joe said. I don't know whether _ how true that was. But, you know, certainly I led the task force there for six months and certainly I understood that the removal of the no disadvantage test did expose us, and the community were on to it very quickly.So there is confusion amongst the opposition about the impact of Australian workplace agreements. Can I help the opposition with that confusion, because the opposition, when in government, deliberately decided not to collect information on what Australian workplace agreements were doing to hardworking families. They knew that those results would be bad, so they preferred not to ask any questions that they did not want the answers to.We did have some samples in May 2006; they came out in Senate estimates. Then the clamper went on - no more information was to come out. The government did sample AWAs between March 2006 and May 2007. To the extent that that analysis got into the public domain, it was there because it leaked. In particular, a sample of over 1,000 AWAs was leaked to the Sydney Morning Herald. Today I can confirm what the results were for that complete sample of 1,700 Australian workplace agreements. These are actual results. I note that the former government denied the figures in the Sydney Morning Herald leak. They will not be able to deny these figures, because these are the actual results. Of the 1,700 Australian workplace agreements that were sampled, 89 per cent removed at least one protected award condition, 83 per cent excluded two or more protected award conditions, 52 per cent excluded six or more - that is more than half - and of course the list goes on.When we are talking about protected award conditions, we are talking about the things that the very expensive propaganda told people were protected by law but could still be taken away without compensation. In these agreements, we know that they were stripped away. What was excluded? What were the sorts of things that got stripped away? We know that the things that are basic to the take-home pay of Australians got stripped away. Shift loadings were excluded in 70 per cent of agreements, annual leave loading was excluded in 68 per cent of agreements and penalty rates were excluded in 63 per cent of agreements. This is the truth that the Howard government covered up in the run-up to the election. - Of course, these questions from the former Howard ministers are fatuous because they deliberately decided, in government, to not do this analysis because they did not want to know the results. They deliberately decided they did not want to analyse the dimension of the rip-off of Australian working families. We should also note that these are the people who deliberately decided not to release any economic modelling of Work Choices. They did not want that information out there.We are in a situation today where hardworking Australians are still caught by Work Choices. We are trying to get rid of Australian workplace agreements, in accordance with our policy and the election mandate of the Australian people. That is why we introduced last week the transition bill. What has been the answer, given these shocking statistics, in this parliament of the opposition to that bill's introduction? Well, really, we have got confusion, but what we know that they have actually done is extend the Senate inquiry in order to keep Work Choices going on as long as possible. Whatever they say about amendments, whatever they say about not opposing, whatever they say about five-year transitional agreements and them lasting to 2012 or 2017 - they do not seem to know - whatever they say about those things, the thing that they have achieved is the continuation of the Australian workplace agreements that these shocking statistics come from. The one thing that should happen today in light of these shocking statistics is that the opposition, in all of its confusion and division, should say, 'What we will do today is we will agree with Labor that this bill will be through the House and through the Senate before Easter.' That will enable a Senate inquiry on the same timetable that the parliament last had when workplace relations laws were dealt with by this parliament. This opposition should get people out of the clutches of Work Choices. In delaying that, all it is doing is reinforcing its reputation as the Work Choices party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. It is the case that there is a substantial amount of state debt out there, a very substantial amount. Why are those borrowings taking place? I will tell you why those borrowings are taking place. Those borrowings are taking place for essential economic infrastructure - the sort of essential economic infrastructure that those opposite would not concern themselves with for 11 long years. The Rudd government has made it very clear that it is prepared to work with the states when it comes to critical economic infrastructure because this is a key plank in its platform to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. Eleven years of neglect in infrastructure have produced a situation where the states are having to borrow because the Commonwealth would not come to the table and provide the political leadership that was required so that we could develop a modern economy which was capable of tackling the future challenges. - I am happy to provide the member with the exact figure. We have had the member for Wentworth and now another member, the member for Riverina, wanting to conduct a pop quiz. That is what they have come to; they are just so desperate. Sometimes I will have the details on hand and sometimes I will not. -  - Let me tell you what I will never do. I will never arrogantly dismiss inflation as a fairy story, like the member for Wentworth has. I will never, ever do that to Australian families. I will never, ever, like the Leader of the Opposition, say -  - The one thing that I will never, ever do is this. I will never lecture working families, after 10 rate rises, saying that they have never been better off. I will never do that, and that is what those opposite did. - Mr Speaker, I made it very clear to the member that I will provide that information to her. I will get the exact figure - not a problem. But the one thing that I will never do -  - I will be very happy to provide all of that material.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question and congratulate her on her first speech last evening. The government inherited challenging economic circumstances: underlying inflation running at 3.6 per cent, five interest rate increases over the past 18 months - with another one well and truly in the pipeline - and government spending growing by 4Â½ per cent in real terms. In an economy already being supercharged by very high returns from the mining boom, allowing government spending to increase at that rate is simply and totally irresponsible. I would like to go through one example to illustrate this point - just one example. From the middle of 2006 until the election late last year, over a period of 16 months, the former Howard government spent $457 million on government advertising - almost half a billion dollars within a space of 16 months.And it is interesting to look at the figures over the preceding five years or so. On a calendar year basis, government advertising spending increased from $95.6 million in 2002 to $368.8 million in 2007. That is a 285 per cent increase - and they did not even get to go the full year. They did not even get to go the full year and they still managed to spend nearly $370 million in that one year. If you divide the spending between campaign advertising and non-campaign advertising - non-campaign advertising is routine stuff mostly; job ads and the like - you will see that it increased from $60.4 million in 2002 to $281.2 million in 2007. That is a 365 per cent increase.The House and the Australian people are entitled to ask: how did this happen and who was in charge? I note, as the Treasurer did earlier, that in the middle of last year the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, was quoted in the biography of the former Prime Minister about his worries in relation to government spending running out of control, and I quote:I do worry about the sustainability of all these things.That was the then Treasurer in the middle of last year. Well, good on him! Isn't that hunky-dory - he was there in his office worrying about it all! He was really worried about the sustainability of government spending. Thank goodness he was worried, because you can imagine what they would have spent if he had not been worried! The great pity is that he did not take any action; he did not actually do anything. That is the great pity. The truth is that, as on so many other things, the member for Higgins is all talk, all bluff, all bluster and no action. He is Australia's champion flat-track bully, and we saw that in evidence last night. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Sadly, not much has changed since the election. I note that, in the member for Higgins's local paper, the Stonnington Leader, he is quoted on 5 February as saying: -  - It is a very interesting newspaper. The member for Higgins is quoted as saying:If I was still Treasurer we'd have 10 CCTV cameras on Chapel St._Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _ 
Before the election, I wouldn't have had to ask Mr Rudd; I would have authorised the cheque myself.That will be his political epitaph: 'I just kept authorising the cheques.'I can assure the House that the Treasurer and I will not be in the business of automatically authorising cheques. We will not be in the business of massive increases in government spending for things like government advertising, because we and the government are serious about cutting government spending and putting downward pressure on inflation and on interest rates. We are particularly serious about cutting out the outrageous misuse of taxpayers' money on things like government advertising. The previous government spent almost half a billion dollars within the space of 16 months in a desperate attempt to secure re-election. That money could have been invested in infrastructure and in building the skills of this nation to help tackle the inflation problem that has been brewing for some time but instead it was spent in a desperate attempt to secure re-election. There is one big lesson that we can learn from all of this, and that is that you cannot trust the Liberals with public money.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. My contention is that spending to enhance the productive capacity of the economy is absolutely critical to lifting productivity and to putting downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates, which is why we have a minister for infrastructure - someone who will work with the states, someone who will provide political leadership. That is why, as part of our five-point plan, we are committed to providing national leadership when it comes to essential economic infrastructure. And, for the record, the shadow Treasurer should have a good look at the commentary on this from the former Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Macfarlane, because it simply disproves the ridiculous claims he is making in the House today.</DOC>

 - And everything else; and lots of things! I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. The Rudd government supports reward for effort, risk-taking and entrepreneurship. We support the freedom of working Australians to be employees or to choose a career in small business or independent contracting. The government will support small businesses by tackling inflation, which hit 16-year highs under the previous coalition government. We will tackle inflation by reining in the extravagant government spending of the 'coalition Coreys' over there. We will tackle inflation by investing in skills through an education revolution. We will tackle inflation by investing in infrastructure, including through a high-speed national broadband network. And we will tackle inflation by increasing workforce participation to boost the supply of labour.The government will support small business by amending the Trade Practices Act to combat anticompetitive behaviour by powerful businesses and by reversing what the Business Council of Australia described as 'the creeping re-regulation' of the Australian business community that occurred over the 11 years of the previous government. This government will also fulfil its election commitment and introduce a fair and flexible industrial relations system, based on productivity. We will remove the red-tape burden on small business created by the farcical Work Choices 'fairness' test and we will take on the task of award modernisation, a task that was shirked by the coalition in 11Â½Â  years in government. And the government will work with small business in developing a fair dismissal code. The Rudd Labor government does not consider it fair that the four million Australians working in small businesses should be able to be sacked on the spot with no explanation, for no reason and with no remedy.I noticed that last night the Manager of Opposition Business said that members of the former coalition cabinet did not know that Work Choices could make people worse off. What is he saying - that they did not know that sacking good workers would make them worse off? How out of touch can you get if you do not know that getting the sack makes you worse off?I have been asked about the prospects for a successful implementation of the government's policies. Those prospects are being threatened by the confusion and the divisions in the coalition. The opposition leader declared that Work Choices is dead but he was contradicted by the shadow minister for families, who said, 'I think that whatever they put up we should vote against.' But then he was contradicted by the Manager of Opposition Business, who said, 'But the people have spoken and the Labor Party have a mandate to tear up Work Choices.' But he was contradicted by the small business spokesman, who said that Labor's attempts to apply unfair dismissal laws to small businesses would meet his 'absolute and determined opposition'. But then he was contradicted by the shadow Treasurer, who said, 'Labor ran very hard on this issue and they have a mandate for change.' Flip, flop, flap. - I was also asked about the prospects for successful implementation of these policies. The fact is that the opposition is divided and confused. It is out of touch with working families. The Rudd Labor government is building a modern economy to meet the challenges of the 21st century for the nation and for the working families of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. This is an important issue. The Rudd government is committed to open government, and that is why we have introduced greater transparency and broader consultation in respect of the appointment of senior public servants. On the weekend I had the opportunity to give a speech to the Queensland Bar Association, and I outlined similar proposals in respect of the appointment of federal magistrates and federal judges. As a result of vacancies that have arisen on the Federal Magistrates Court, I have had the opportunity to put that process in train.We have put ads in national newspapers calling for expressions of interest by way of application or nomination. We have sought input from a broad cross-section not only of the legal professional bodies but also of the community legal centres, the Legal Aid Commission, academia and the Australian Women Lawyers Association. I intend to appoint a selection panel made up of the Chief Magistrate, a retired judge and a representative of my department. That panel will assist in the selection of candidates according to criteria which have been published on the department's website - criteria determined to achieve not only selection on the basis of merit but personalities who have empathy with litigants who appear before them. That panel will provide me with a short-list, and it is proposed that I would recommend a suitable candidate from that short-list for the consideration of government. I have outlined options in respect of the appointment of Federal Court and Family Court judges. I have invited input from the profession. I also have invited input from the broader public. Indeed, I would welcome input from members of the House.It is an incremental step but an important step. We are not advocating a United States-type veto through the Senate or otherwise, but it is an important step to assure Australians that those people who will deliberate in respect of their rights or, if it be in force, obligations against them are chosen not by a narrow, select few but by an appropriately qualified panel. It is important that Australians have confidence that all judicial appointments are entirely on the basis of merit, not on personal associations or political affiliations. This is an important step in further developing the Rudd Labor government's commitment to open government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The National Capital Authority was established, along with the government of the Australian Capital Territory, in 1989. It is a statutory body whose role is to promote awareness of Canberra as the nation's capital and to look after the planning and management of the parliamentary triangle and other sites of national significance. It is an important role and it is one that the government supports. But there is a widely held view, in my short experience in this place - a view held by most Canberra taxi drivers - that, under the previous government, the NCA's role became unclear. This was a deliberate strategy adopted by the Howard government because of its political differences with the ACT Labor government; in other words, the Howard government allowed the NCA's role to expand beyond its original responsibilities, purposely thwarting the planning and administration roles of the democratically elected government of the ACT and inevitably causing tensions between those two bodies. It is time for that to end.This is a new government that is not interested in the blame game, not here or elsewhere. We are interested in preventing duplication and waste and improving the performance of all agencies. That is why it is time to take a fresh look at the NCA's role to see that it operates effectively, that it has its planning responsibilities clearly defined and, once and for all, to end the wrangling over Canberra's designated areas.The previous government was much more interested in picking a fight with the ACT than ensuring that the NCA operated usefully. It was happy to allow taxpayers' money to be wasted - the Minister for Finance and Deregulation has sufficiently demonstrated his concern about that - for its own political purpose by allowing that unnecessary duplication and confusion to occur. That will not be happening under this government. We are interested in forward-thinking, sensible policy that will see governments and agencies working together to meet our commitments, one of which is to reform the NCA.The National Capital Authority is subject to the scrutiny of a joint standing committee. When it last reported in 2004, it was very critical of the NCA for focusing on local events that did not meet the requirement to promote national awareness. The previous government ignored all of the standing committee's recommendations, and that further compromised the work and reputation of the NCA. It is time again to have another look at that role, and that is one of the reasons that I have asked the joint committee to conduct an inquiry and report back by the middle of this year. The committee has been given five terms of reference. It will look into the administration of the National Capital Plan, the governance arrangements for the NCA, the level of oversight required to maintain the highest standards of design in the ACT, opportunities for greater cooperation with local planning authorities, and the promotion of the national capital and new infrastructure projects. The decision to conduct a new inquiry has received wide support. The Canberra Business Council said it was exactly what they had been seeking. The Property Council of Australia said that it supports any reforms that can get the NCA and the ACT government working together. Senator Gary Humphries, who is a member of the joint committee, has told ABC radio that it is a good chance to clear the air.The government has directed many agencies across the whole area of government to achieve substantial savings, and this authority is no exception. Its budget of more than $20 million will be reduced by $1.6 million, and the NCA has the authority - indeed, it has the obligation - to come up with its own plan as to where those cuts will be made.There have been many reports suggesting that this will mean the end of the Australia Day celebrations. However, the NCA does not own that event. The Australia Day concert belongs to the National Australia Day Council. It has merely had a partnership with the NCA for the last five years. I am assured by the Australia Day Council that it will seek sponsorship elsewhere, and it expects to be successful in that respect. The National Capital Authority has a significant and important role to play in the future, but under this government it will be a role that is properly defined.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. We are at an interesting phase in this question time, and I will tell the House why. The reason is that at last we have a question about climate change from an opposition that did nothing about it for 11 years. -  - The fact is that for 11 years the Howard government did not even acknowledge the existence of climate change. Now they are coming into the House to ask us questions about the economic impacts of actually doing something about it. That is the gesture that we are witnessing in the House today. I remember very well when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change first produced a set of data which suggested that there was the possibility that we may have an increase in temperatures on this planet of some four to six degrees and the question was put to the then Prime Minister, Mr Howard, as to what the impact of that would be on the people of Australia and our planet, and he said that it would be uncomfortable for some. Let me tell you, Mr Speaker, that it will be uncomfortable for some if they get up to the dispatch box and ask us questions about climate change, because their record is one that can be condemned with every answer that is given. Let me continue, Mr Speaker. Don't wave your fingers at me, Joe. -  - The fact is that the Rudd government has in place a set of measures which will ensure the least cost delivery of greenhouse gas emissions trading through the appropriate utilisation of market mechanisms and sensible frameworks and regulations - something that those opposite were never able to bring forward to the Australian people. We saw last night that they did not have any idea about the impact of Work Choices. For 11 years they showed us they did not have any idea about the impact of climate change. The Rudd Labor government is fully committed to putting those measures in place -  - The Rudd Labor government has brought forward a set of complementary measures which ensure that we have a least cost impost on the Australian economy as we go about the fact of reducing greenhouse gas emissions over time. It was the Rudd Labor government that set a target - something that the opposition was allergic to. It was the Rudd Labor government that ratified Kyoto - something that the opposition was allergic to. It is the Rudd Labor government that has put in place a sensible process of understanding research and commissioning advice to best inform this government as to the best way to ensure that we have both a sustainable economy and a sustainable environment - something that the opposition was never capable of doing. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. He will be interested in this answer, and I am sure all members of the House will be. Yesterday we heard from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs about the bombing of Darwin festivities today, commemorating that fateful event in 1942. A month after that event was the strafing of Broome. As a result of the strafing of Broome, the North Australia Observation Unit was formed, later called the 'Nackeroos' or, euphemistically, 'Curtin's Cowboys'. It was pulled together by a subsequently very famous Australian, Major Bill Stanner. This unit consisted of 550 personnel, based out of Katherine, in the Northern Territory, and was charged with patrolling northern Australia to try to discover if there were any enemies on Australian soil. It was disbanded three years later, in March of 1945.Its equivalent today is the Regional Force Surveillance Units, or RFSUs, one of which exists in the member for Leichhardt's electorate. That is the 51st Battalion, the Far North Queensland Regiment. Forty-seven per cent of its members are Indigenous Australians. Another unit is in NORFORCE, based out of Darwin. Forty-eight per cent of its members are Indigenous Australians. The other is in the member for Kalgoorlie's electorate, at Karratha, in the Pilbara Regiment, where only four per cent are Indigenous Australians.What we need to comprehend here is that Indigenous people make up 2.4 per cent of the Australian population. They make up 1.4 per cent of the Australian workforce. But across the Department of Defence and the Australian Defence Force they are only 0.6 per cent. There is much that needs to be done. One of the biggest challenges currently facing the Australian Defence Force is a shortage of the right people, the right skills. We know this. The now Leader of the Opposition understood this in his former role as Minister for Defence. We need to make the most of Australia's human resources, and this includes Indigenous Australians. Attracting Indigenous people into the Defence Force is a huge challenge, but it offers huge potential.There are many reasons why Indigenous Australians are not attracted to the Defence Force or are not adequately represented. Some of those reasons go to the issues which we confronted last week on those momentous days, Tuesday and Wednesday. They involve lifestyle, health, homelessness, lack of education, poor skills, cultural issues, isolation - things that we as a nation need to address. But there are many reasons why we should have Indigenous people in the Australian Defence Force. They have an incredible amount to offer.I am someone who has been able to observe this over many years. I have observed their role in NORFORCE in particular. I have had the opportunity to go on patrols with the squadron out of Darwin. They have done great work over the last 12 months on Operation Outreach, supporting the government's intervention in Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory and providing logistical support, primarily for the health teams. They have done great service over a number of years by protecting Australia's borders, doing those surveillance tasks which have been very important to Operation Resolute.There is a lot more that can be done, but we need to appreciate that on the other side of the coin there are many advantages to Indigenous Australians being part of the Australian Defence Force, because the ADF can provide many things. It provides a capacity for not only new educational opportunities, new training opportunities and new skills but income support and personal and community pride. We have proven that it can be done. This success needs to be reflected across the ADF. There are lessons that can be shared. In fact, I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, the member for Eden-Monaro, has responsibility for the ADF Parlia-mentary Program. One of the activities in the parliamentary exchange this year is an opportunity to spend four days patrolling with the Centre Squadron from NORFORCE, and I commend that opportunity to members of the chamber.Currently, we are finalising within Defence an Indigenous recruitment strategy, which is part of a larger Aboriginal recruitment training, employment and retention effort within the department. We have to learn from the mistakes as well as the successes of the past. What we need to acknowledge is that the one-size-fits-all approach will not work and has not worked. If we need additional programs or initiatives such as mentoring, networking, cadetships and traineeships then sobeit - it will be done. We must do all that we can to enhance the capability of the ADF, including by increasing Indigenous participation. After all, it is in the national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Throughout Australia there has always been a high concern to make sure that our quarantine and biosecurity services were up to scratch. If ever this concern came to the front of public consciousness, it was during the equine influenza outbreak towards the end of last year. At that point, the then government initiated the Callinan inquiry, which looked only into the specifics of the outbreak of equine influenza. As the opposition at the time, we made a commitment that there would be a full and broad-ranging review into all aspects of Australia's biosecurity and quarantine systems. The last time a review of that nature occurred was in 1995 - the Nairn review - under the previous Labor government.We are in a world of increased international movements and, in so many ways, the world itself is getting smaller, which has particular challenges for our biosecurity system. In an age of climate change, we also have the problem of the migration of pests and weeds and the further biosecurity problems that come with that. We need to maintain our biodiversity, protect public health and ensure our primary industries are not further burdened by pests and diseases, whether it be outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom, avian influenza throughout many parts of the world or new diseases such as SARS. We also have to be mindful of having a review that takes into account the significant body of case law which now exists within the WTO.Earlier today I announced the commencement of that review. The review will consider the appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency of our quarantine and biosecurity arrangements. I also announced that this review would evaluate Australia's current arrangements to achieve its appropriate levelÂ of protection consistent with our international obligations; look at the adequacy of the consultation and review processes currently in place; and consider other important quarantine reviews, including the implementation of the Nairn review. This inquiry will be headed up by Mr Roger Beale AO. MrÂ Beale has held very senior roles in both public and private sectors and is a former Secretary of the Department of Environment and Heritage. He will be assisted in that task by Mr Andrew Inglis AM, Mr David Trebeck and Dr Jeffory Fairbrother AM. Mr Andrew Inglis AM was also a member of the Nairn review of quarantine. I spoke today with Mr Roger Beale AO, and he made it clear that he wanted to ensure that there was a maximum level of community consultation. There will be a full-ranging opportunity for the community to participate in this process.I cannot begin to say how important it is to make sure that we get our systems in place so that we can make available the maximum level of protection through our quarantine and biosecurity processes. I look forward to this report coming back to me in the second half of the year so that it can inform the budget process of the following year.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The challenge that we face this year is: how do we handle the overall inflationary problem which has been left to us by the previous government? -  - Whereas our friends opposite may find that difficult medicine to swallow publicly, it is simply the statistical reality that they have to get used to. It is not our say-so; it is the ABS's say-so. But let us go to the question of wage restraint, which was the core part of the Leader of the Opposition's question. The first thing we can do, and that we can do nationally, is to show some leadership. I am pleased about the fact that members on my side of the House, supported by the opposition, have decided in a modest way to demonstrate an appropriate level of restraint on our part, modest though it is, for the first year and a half - from now through until the middle of next year. That is important, particularly when we are confronted with statement after statement, report after report, by CEOs across the country, where unfortunately restraint has not been the first order of business for them when it comes to their own salary arrangements for the future.The second element goes to how we best deliver also on this government's pre-election commitments when it comes to tax cuts. There has been a lot of debate about this. We on this side of the House take seriously our commitments to working people. Were we to take the advice of some and not deliver those commitments to working people, the argument that would be advanced right across the country in the various industrial negotiations that would subsequently occur would be extraordinary - namely, that the absence of the tax cuts which have been promised to working families would not provide a basis for restraint in the subsequent wages demands. We therefore regard that as an important measure in moderating overall demand in the economy, in particular when it comes to demands by those who will be engaging in industrial negotiations this year. That is the second point.The third point is: what do we do about the overall inflationary challenge when it comes to public demand? That is where this government has laid squarely the challenge to those opposite: do you believe that we need to rein in government expenditure - the Minister for Finance and Deregulation asked this very clearly yesterday - or do you not? We believe you do because it is the aggregation of private demand and public demand which creates the fundamentals of the overall inflation challenge. We have a plan of action on both fronts in order to do what we can to ensure that the inflation problem is kept under control. It is a problem which we inherited from those who preceded us, and we have the course of action underway that I just outlined to the honourable member.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. The government's challenge is to build a modern Australia that is capable of facing the challenges of the future and, within that framework, for us to have a modern, competitive economy which is capable of dealing with threats to our long-term prosperity. Right across the developed world at present we face challenges when it comes to projections for economic growth for the year ahead. We have seen already in the sobering report from the IMF, contained in its World Economic Outlook, the revision down of the growth projection for the global economy from 2007, when it was to render an outcome of about 4.9, down to 4.1 for the year ahead, 2008. What has this been triggered by? A range of factors: instability in global financial markets, occasioned by the downturn in the US housing market, occasioned in turn by what we have seen with the US subprime crisis. And these developments have yet to fully wash through the entirety of global markets and the real global economy.Here in Australia we face a treble challenge. One is to keep a very clear weather eye on these developments in the international economy, particularly the capacity of these developments to wash over the economies of East Asia, where 50 per cent of this nation's trade occurs. The second thing is this: we must remain absolutely vigilant in the fight against inflation. Third, we must also prosecute a bold program of microeconomic reform to ensure that we can build long-term productivity growth so that this economy can be competitive in the long-term future, given the challenges we face.The inflation challenge that we face is substantial. Firstly, this is the highest level of inflation this country has seen in 16 years. When we took over office from the Howard government we inherited a level of inflation higher than that which the Howard government inherited from the Keating government. Those members sitting opposite need to be very mindful of that fact. Secondly, those inflationary pressures have been building for a couple of years. Thirdly, look at the Reserve Bank's Statement on Monetary Policy and their projections out, based on where the economy was standing in the final quarter last year - inflation numbers beyond the three per cent band through 2008, through 2009 and into the middle of 2010. These are substantial economic challenges, substantial challenges on the inflation front, and therefore demand a course of action.When it comes, therefore, to the impact of these high levels of inflation, it has of course washed through to what we have seen in interest rates moves. We have had 11 consecutive interest rates rises. This has placed enormous pressure on working families, to the point where when this government took office from its predecessor they were (1) running inflation at the highest levels this country has seen in 16 years and (2) giving to working families interest rates which are the second highest in the developed world. That is what we received by virtue of our predecessors by way of an economic inheritance. The question of course is what to do about it. The legacy problem I have referred to, but the beginning of wisdom in terms of how you deal with the problem is to recognise that a problem exists - The question that was asked of the Prime Minister was in order. The answer that the Prime Minister is providing is in order. If the House has problems with the length of the answer, that might be something that the House would like to bring its mind to through the Procedure Committee or other avenues. It is a great risk for me to put this on the record in that you might consider time limits for questions, because I do not believe that is the way we should really go if we are fair dinkum about sitting down and thinking about question time and the way that it should operate.The other observation I would make is that this early in the life of the government, whatever people believe is by way of ministerial statement or explaining the government's position, it is all new. It would seem legitimate that, in the early stages, we have questions that ask the position of the government and that it is explained. I believe that later today we might see the proper use of a ministerial statement, where something that may have in the past been announced outside of the chamber will be exposed and introduced inside the chamber. If we take a collective deep breath and work towards improving the way in which this place operates especially at question time, reduce the number of points of order and get on with the proper operation of the House, I will try to assist that. - The fact that we in the parliament and the nation face is as follows: we have inflation running at 16-year highs and we currently have working families, as a consequence of that, paying the second highest interest rates in the world. That is the challenge that we face. That is the challenge we have inherited from our predecessors. The question arises as to what we now do about it.The beginning of wisdom with this lies in recognising that you have a problem. The core challenge which remains unanswered in this debate is: do all members of this House recognise that we have a challenge in dealing with the inflation problem? If I listen carefully to those opposite in their recent contributions in the debate, I hear the member for Wentworth referring to the inflation problem as a fairytale; the member for Higgins, only six months ago, saying that the inflation rate was right where we wanted it; the Leader of the Opposition disputing the real relationship between inflationary movements and interest rates; and the good old Leader of the National Party giving the classic three-point National Party response to any problem: spend, spend, spend.The core question that we face is: how do you deal with the inflation challenge that we have now inherited? We on our side of the parliament - the government - have articulated a five-point plan to deal with the budget surplus, with the encouragement of private savings, with the skills crisis, with infrastructure and with participation, all of which are critical elements in bringing the inflation genie back under control and boosting long-term productivity growth.Part of the participation problem lies in having not only effective tax policy settings and effective welfare policy settings but also effective industrial relations policy settings. That is why we, the government, have put forward a fair and balanced industrial relations system for the future of this nation, embodied in the interim arrangements introduced by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in the bill which is currently before the parliament and as reflected elsewhere in our policy. We on this side of the House have a clear-cut policy when it comes to industrial relations. Our opponents do not. In December they said that Work Choices was dead, in January they said it was back alive again, in February it was dead again - and still we seem to have a bit of a flutter, based on the statement by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in terms of what may still happen in the Senate.In particular, I draw to the attention of honourable members a statement made today by the good old member for Canning, who, when asked, 'Wouldn't AWAs be gone forever after five years?' responded: 'But anything could happen in five years, you know. You could have a different government after five years.' Therein lies the point. Whereas they may say that Work Choices and AWAs are dead and buried or fluttering away there for a bit, the truth is that they lie in the back drawer and lie in the top drawer, ready to be taken out should the opposition assume office at the next election. You can just see it. There it is: Work Choices is dead one minute, back again, dead the next, then waiting for the next election. You can see them with the defibrillator prongs waiting to bring Work Choices back to life - zap, zap. On the day after the election, bang - it is back into life. No-one knows where the Liberal Party stand on industrial relations. They have not made up their own mind on this. They are a party that has lost touch and lost direction.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It is very important to understand that state government expenditure on critical economic infrastructure is a very important part of lifting the productive capacity of the economy. Those opposite do not seem to get it. They simply do not seem to understand the importance of critical economic infrastructure in this economy and, because of their failure to provide political and economic leadership in this area over 11 years, there are now inflationary pressures in the economy - elevated inflationary pressures, which have caused seven interest rate rises in the last three years alone. So we on this side of the House do understand the importance of critical economic infrastructure. It is absolutely essential that it goes in place if we are going to lift the productive capacity of our economy and put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates in the long term.Why are we getting these questions today? Because they are so embarrassed about their complacency over the last 11 years and because their failure in infrastructure gives lie to any claim they have to economic competence. Of course, the other thing that gives lie to their claims of economic competence is the seven interest rate rises that this country has experienced in the last three years on the back of the highest elevated inflation in 16 years. That is the parting gift of the Liberal Party of Australia to the people of Australia. But we take the fight against inflation very seriously, which is why the Prime Minister has put forward his five-point plan.I will quote an authority on infrastructure - this is from Governor Glenn Stevens to the Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee on 21 February. He said:Balance sheets of governments in this country, by and large, are in very good shape. - He is referring to state governments as well.They will not have any trouble borrowing money from the lenders of the world for a reasonable project.How inflationary is that? I do not think it will feed directly into the consumer price index per se - end of story; end of argument.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question and I know of his concern for fairness and balance in Australian workplaces. The Rudd Labor government is determined to get rid of the scourge of Work Choices and the scourge of Work Choices propaganda. The former government waged a war with Work Choices propaganda; we are now trying to wage a war on that propaganda and get rid of it. On Monday I reported to the House that the Prime Minister and I had arranged for the pulping of 436,000 Work Choices booklets. Yesterday, I reported to the House that we were getting rid of 100,000 Work Choices mousepads. Yesterday in this parliament I was convinced that I was winning the war against Work Choices propaganda, but it is with a heavy heart I am forced to report to the House: there is more. I am sorry about it, but there is more.There are 102,341 plastic folders - unfortunately, more than 100,000 of them. - It is a good question that the Manager of Government Business asks: we are going to have to get rid of them. There are 77,893 pens. There are 5,684 postcards and -  
Government members - Postcards! - Postcards - just in case anybody ever wanted one! There is an unknown number of fridge magnets. I am alert and I am alarmed, I would have to say! You cannot turn a corner in Canberra without Work Choices propaganda cascading on top of you. It is just remarkable.We are going to continue the war against Work Choices propaganda. I do concede that for some people this propaganda could come in handy. I can imagine that when the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition produced their 'Work Choices is dead' statement they did it at a computer with a Work Choices mousepad, they signed it with a Work Choices pen, they filed it in a Work Choices folder and then they had a drink out of a Work Choices fridge. I understand that this propaganda can come in handy to some -  -  - One with a fridge magnet on it - a Work Choices fridge. You would not want to doubt their bona fides, would you, as they sit in their office, cocooned in with their Work Choices propaganda, remembering the good old days when they had the political honesty to walk to a dispatch box and defend Work Choices? Now of course they still believe in Work Choices, but they do not have that political honesty anymore. The Work Choices propaganda is the propaganda of the Liberal Party, paid for unwillingly by Australian taxpayers, by a government that believed in Work Choices. This is a Liberal Party that still believe in Work Choices. If they want some things to remind them of the good old days, they can just ring my office. We have got a lot of them waiting for you!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Many years ago, far-sighted governments put in place enterprise bargaining, where wage rises were linked directly to productivity at the workplace level. And that is the policy of the Rudd Labor government. That is the fair and balanced system that we are going to put into place, a fair system where all participants in the system must adhere to the law. That is the policy of the Rudd Labor government. But it is so ironic today that we should receive these questions from those opposite, because only last year they looked the Australian people in the eye and they told them Work Choices was something they fundamentally believed in. They told the Australian people it was the secret to economic success in the future. They told the Australian people it was the key to productivity. - Those opposite do not know whether they are Arthur or Martha when it comes to Work Choices. They simply have not got a clue. They have not got a clue because they have not got a plan to fight inflation. They do not have a plan to fight inflation at all. They put all their policy power into the Work Choices basket and, for political expediency, they threw it overboard yesterday, leaving them with no plan for the future. Well, the Rudd Labor government has a plan for the future, and it includes a fair and balanced industrial relations system, one which will be based on productivity to create wealth well into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for the question. This side of the House believes it is very important that Australian employers and Australian employees can plan at work with certainty, knowing what the law is going to be. We believe that that certainty should not just last for a limited period of time; that certainty should be there for the long term, because people make long-term arrangements at work. That is why we published, before the last election, all of our policies in industrial relations: so Australian employers and Australian employees could see what it was that a Labor government would provide if elected. We have before the House the legislation that delivers the first bit of that policy, and we will have a substantive bill that delivers the rest of the policy. But the certainty on this side of the House is met on the other side of the House by confusion, by flip, flop, flap and then fuddle. - Fuddle. And before the last election these were the people that walked to the dispatch box and defended Work Choices day in, day out. Just a few short months ago they were at the dispatch box defending Work Choices. The current Leader of the Opposition talked about how much political capital and philosophical determination had been invested in workplace relations. The member for North Sydney, then the relevant minister, said in the context of the election campaign:The workplace relations system of the Coalition is providing benefits to workers, businesses and the economy as a whole. It must be retained _They believed in Work Choices before the election, and the truth is they actually believe in it now. They are pretending that they have had some road-to-Damascus conversion and they no longer believe in Work Choices. They are pretending that they no longer believe in the Australian workplace agreements, though one would have to say in the last 48 hours the degree of confusion on that point from the opposition has been absolutely remarkable. But apparently, if the statements of the opposition are now to be believed, they will give passage to Labor's bill through the parliament, and indeed today coalition members at the relevant Senate committee for the bill did not vote at all on a resolution to put the timetable for the Senate inquiry back to the timetable that Labor had asked for.Originally the Liberal Party in its defence of Work Choices had sought to draw this matter out to keep Work Choices going as long as humanly possible. Today the Liberal Party, confronted with a proposition that they come back to Labor's timetable, that they deal with this bill before Easter, did not even vote on it. So we are now in a situation where we believe - it is hard to know; it changes minute by minute with the flip, flop, flap and fuddle - that the opposition will vote for Labor's bill and we believe that the opposition will process Labor's bill in the Senate before Easter, as Labor originally asked.What could cause this remarkable change of heart from a party that believed in Work Choices and has always believed in industrial relations extremism and advocated it right up until yesterday? I would have to say I think I know what has fed into this change of heart, because I have come upon a secret Liberal strategy document. It is the secret plan that shows why the opposition has now repositioned on Work Choices. This is a secret plan that says that the opposition would be best advantaged by adopting Labor's policy and offering to fast-track it. Isn't that starting to happen? They are fast-tracking Labor's policy now, as we ask. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is echoing Labor's words, talking about a fair and flexible industrial relations system. They are adopting this policy of pretending to close the gap on industrial relations and endorse Labor's plan. This is a policy that talks about them losing their reputation for industrial relations extremism and Work Choices by pretending to endorse and give swift passage to Labor's policies.When you analyse this secret plan, the position of endorsing Labor's plans and giving it fast track is not because they should change their view substantively - that is not what this secret document says they are going to do. They are going to change their view cosmetically, because if they change their view cosmetically -  - Mr Speaker, the question was about certainty and stability for Australian employers and employees. So I think what a Liberal opposition believes in pertains to that question, because we are talking policy settings people are entitled to know for the long term. This secret policy document talks about pretending to agree with Labor -  - This secret document lays bare that the reason for this strategy is so business will come back into dialogue with the opposition and they can 'do some deals' - that is the terminology used - that they can have refunded. It is all about business fundraising. That is what this secret plan is all about. - This secret document from a Liberal Party strategist that includes the secret plan - it is all about attracting business fundraising, not about substantively changing their position on industrial relations. This is a document that lays bare a strategy to pretend that they have given up industrial relations extremism and then, if they are re-elected in the future, to go straight back to industrial relations extremism. I take it that the Liberal Party, the members opposite, think I am wrong. Well, if I am wrong, they can come to the dispatch box and say one thing: that a re-elected Liberal government will never introduce AWAs or statutory individual employment agreements again. - I conclude on this: the question of certainty and stability for Australian employers and employees would be assisted by a simple answer from the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - or whoever is in control these days - to a question. That question is this: would a re-elected Liberal government reintroduce Australian workplace agreements or a statutory individual employment agreement of any nature - yes or no? And if they do not answer that question then clearly it is about a secret plan to bring back Work Choices, should they ever return to the government benches. The party of Work Choices are still the party of Work Choices and they will always be the party of Work Choices. -  - Mr Speaker, I made reference to but did not read from a document.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. When I think of working families in Australia dealing with mortgage rate pressure, they have one thing and one thing only in mind: 11 consecutive interest rate rises in a row as a response to the economic policy settings put in place by those opposite. Working families across Australia are struggling to make ends meet. They have been dealing with the mortgage pressures which they have been confronted with - 11 increases in a row - on the back of mounting inflation pressures in the economy and an inflation genie let out of the bottle by those opposite.I would have thought that those opposite, if they were serious about dealing with the long-term economic challenges of Australia, would accept that we have an inflation problem. I do not hear any recognition from those opposite that we have one at present - none whatsoever. Six months ago the member for Higgins said, 'It's just fine and dandy.' We have had the member for Wentworth saying, 'It's all just a fairytale.' Is there an inflation problem? If you do not recognise that there is an inflation problem, how can we embrace a common set of policy undertakings in this place to deal with an inflation problem? For example, what do we then do when it comes to eliminating unnecessary waste and expenditure through government departments and through the razor gang exercise that we have embarked upon? Because, when it came to the waste of government funds, the growth in government outlays in the last financial year was, I am advised -  - And what is relevant to working families is whether we have a plan to deal with inflation, a plan to deal with interest rates, a plan to deal with unnecessary government outlays - a plan of action on each of the above. For 11Â½ years those opposite sat there, fiddled, allowed the macro-economic policy settings of this country to become unravelled by a loose approach to fiscal policy and a nonagenda on productivity policy. When it comes to cute questions asked by those opposite, I am advised by those around the tracks that when the NAIRU question was raised by the chief of staff of the Leader of the Opposition about what to ask in parliament this week, his first response was that they were talking about the Prime Minister of India in the postwar period. You can run as many pop quizzes as you like. We will get some right; we will get some wrong - The member for Mackellar then left the chamber. - The question posed by the honourable gentleman opposite has no logical premise to it in the first place. If there were any serious engagement of the economic debate in this nation about what we will be doing in the future on inflation, on interest rates and on cutbacks to unnecessary budget outlays, we would start to have an engagement of proper economic policy debate. I will tell you what the Treasurer of the Commonwealth has been doing in the 2Â½ months since we have been in office -  -  - sitting there in an Expenditure Review Committee of the cabinet cutting and burning the outrageous engagement -  - Why this House has absolute confidence in the Treasurer is because the Treasurer is engaged in day-to-day, week-to-week meetings in the Expenditure Review Committee of this government and cabinet cutting and burning the outrageous examples of waste and misallocation of public funds in which those opposite have engaged. The Deputy Prime Minister today has given you one example after another, one item of waste after another - $122 million worth of this outrageous self-indulgence in public outlays, all contributing to public demand and all therefore adding to the inflation burden in the economy. That is what the Treasurer has been doing. The Treasurer has also been engaged with me in how we advance a productivity agenda for this nation for the future, how we make sure that we engender long-term productivity growth through a human capital revolution, investing in skills and investing in infrastructure. These are the areas where this Treasurer has been engaged. The Treasurer has the absolute confidence of the House, the government and the parliament, because we are dealing with a record of mismanagement by those opposite, and they stand condemned.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question because this is a very serious matter. The wage price index for Australia grew by 1.1 per cent in December and by 4.2 per cent over the year. As we have said, this is a very, very tight labour market, so we need to be alert to the skill shortages and labour shortages in the Australian economy, something those opposite were not alert to for 11 long years.These are solid wage rises, but we need to ensure they are closely linked to productivity growth. As I was telling the House earlier, our industrial relations system, where wage rises will be linked to productivity growth at the firm level, is absolutely critical. It is fair, it is balanced and it is the key to our future prosperity. As the Prime Minister indicated before, so is our capacity building agenda, so is doing something about the skills crisis, so is providing some leadership when it comes to national infrastructure and so is enhancing workforce participation. They are all absolutely critical to the productivity agenda that this government has in hand.It stands in stark contrast to the approach of the current Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. They do not have a plan for the future. The shadow Treasurer has a plan for himself but he does not have a plan to fight inflation. Do you know what the Leader of the Opposition said in a radio interview a couple of weeks ago? He said that there was no link between inflation and interest rates. That is how economically illiterate and ignorant the Leader of the Opposition is when it comes to these basic economic facts about what we must do to tackle the inflation challenge and build prosperity for the future. The shadow Treasurer says inflation is a fairy story. It is not a fairy story for people sitting around the kitchen tables of this country who are finding it very hard to make ends meet. This government has a plan for the future. The opposition have no plan for the future at all. They just have a plan to take each other's jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question because I have just outlined a plan that we have got to tackle inflation. But I want to make a couple of points about the relationship between fiscal policy and monetary policy, because it is pretty true to say that monetary policy is a blunt instrument. Why is monetary policy a blunt instrument? It is a blunt instrument because it hurts working families. It is a blunt instrument because, when inflation goes up, interest rates follow. One of the problems we have had in this country is that the lax fiscal policy from those opposite is pushing up inflation, and inflation is not something that is confined just to one state or another. Inflation is not confined to Queensland; it is not confined to Western Australia; it is Australia wide. So we have to deal with that inflation problem. We have to deal with it to take the financial pressure off working families. We deal with it through our five-point plan. That is our plan, and those opposite do not have one at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. The Australian government welcomes the largely peaceful conduct of parliamentary elections in Pakistan on Monday of this week, 18 February. Members, of course, would be aware that Pakistan has had to overcome very significant difficulties to see the conduct of this election. The election was of course delayed by the shocking assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December of last year, but we welcome the fact that the elections have now been conducted.When I rang the then foreign minister of Pakistan, Mr ul Haque, to relay Australia's shock and sadness at the assassination of Mrs Bhutto, I made the point that the Australian government very strongly believed that the best way forward for Pakistan was to pursue the election, the best way forward for Pakistan was to have an election where there was full and free participation and which was conducted in a peaceable manner, and that the best way forward for Pakistan to combat extremism and terrorism was by restoration of democracy and restoration of the rule of law.Whilst the Pakistan election commission will not formally complete and declare the election for the next couple of days and whilst we will not see, for example, any independent international observations either from the US teams or from the EU teams until later tonight or tomorrow, it is clear that the opposition parties have made very substantial gains. The party of the late Benazir Bhutto, the PPP, led since her assassination by Mr Zardari, at last count had won up to 87 seats. The PML-N, led by former Prime Minister Sharif, has won 66 seats out of the 268 seats up for contest. So it is quite clear that for the first occasion at a democratically held election we see the demise of a Pakistan government which has for the first occasion run its full term.We will await with interest those formal reports of the election observers and the full and complete conduct of the election by the Pakistan election commission. We will of course be watching the election aftermath and its consequences very closely, but we are very pleased that President Musharraf has indicated that he is prepared and willing to cooperate with any new government which is formed out of the parliament as a result of these elections. We believe that that is very important and we encourage all parties in Pakistan to engage in such discussions in a peaceful and constructive way.Stability, democracy and the rule of law are very, very important to Australia. That is because any adverse implications for Pakistan, particularly any adverse implications for the south of Pakistan so far as extremism and terrorism are concerned, have adverse implications and consequences for the over 1,000 Australian troops in the south of Afghanistan. Deleterious consequences for Pakistan lead to deleterious consequences for Afghanistan. It is very important that Australia and the international community support very strongly the extension of democracy in Pakistan, the extension of the rule of law. We look forward, after the conduct of a relatively peaceful election, to seeing a peaceful transition to a new government in Pakistan in cooperation with the current President.</DOC>

As is the case with the automobile industry and is the case with the clothing and textile industry, they are very, very important manufacturing industries in this country and we make no apologies for the urgency with which we approach the problems challenging these industries. The principal problem challenging these industries at the moment, among many, is of course our exchange rate. We will from time to time take decisions about inquiries and involve the full expertise of the federal bureaucracy and agencies in those inquiries. The Productivity Commission will be involved in any future inquiry into the textiles industry, just as it is involved in the auto industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for her question. I note the critique of the leader of the National Party of the Australian National Audit Office: that it is just more money for bureaucratic inquiries. But, no, these are actually inquiries making sure that taxpayers' funds are used efficiently. I am not surprised that the National Party are so concerned about the operations of the National Audit Office because, given their concentration on National Party pork-barrelling, the National Audit Office -  - The ANAO report outlines how the former government made three special grant payments to the Australian Rail Track Corporation: $450 million in June 2004, $100 million in June 2005 and $270 million in June 2006. Why were these payments made in June each year? The Audit Office finds that these payments were made 'in the context of assisting to reduce higher than expected budget surpluses'. We have in this nation a significant infrastructure deficit, but were the excess funds used to improve productivity? No. It was just bailed out at the end of the financial year to get the funds off the books. The ANAO report goes on to say this about the $450 million payment in June 2004:_ prior to the grant being approved, the ARTC was not asked to provide any formal advice on specific areas in which a grant of that quantum could be applied ...It was as if they said: 'We have $450 million. Here you go. Do with it what you like.' That was the attitude. Then the government put out a release. They said that it was for rail realignments of the New South Wales North Coast line. It sounds worth while. But what does the Audit Office say the money was used for? The Audit Office says that the money that the government said was going to the New South Wales North Coast was used on the lines from Melbourne to Junee. No wonder they lost the seat of Page on the New South Wales North Coast during the election: they could not find it; they did not know where it was. That is just one of the recommendations of this Audit Office report. Indeed, the National Audit Office is thinking of changing its name to the 'Nationals Audit Office', because every week there is a new report being tabled in this parliament about the pork-barrelling and the waste and mismanagement of expenditure over there. There was so much money that they did not know what to do with it.I heard an interesting story the other day about the Nationals and their use of spending when it comes to infrastructure. During the campaign, the now leader of the National Party rang up some people in Singleton and said that he was going to pay a visit. If you are in Singleton and the National Party are coming to town you think: 'You beauty! Here come the big bucks. Singleton is going to get some allocations of funding. Here it comes.' The now leader of the National Party was in Tamworth and he drove down to Singleton. You have to drive through Muswellbrook to get to Singleton. When he got there the announcement was about the Muswellbrook bypass. He did not actually know that you should probably announce the Muswellbrook bypass funding in Muswellbrook.When it comes to the National Party, it does not matter whether it is funding for Junee to Melbourne, instead of the New South Wales North Coast, or announcing the Muswellbrook bypass in Singleton - it does not matter, because the Audit Office have said this about the management of this scheme:There are no contracts, funding agreements or documented governance arrangements that require the ARTC to use the $820 million in special grant funding on any particular projects or in any particular time frame.That is an absolute indictment of the former government's attitude towards taxpayers' funds. They stand condemned, not just by the government, not just by the Audit Office but by the taxpayers of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. When I was visiting New England, the honourable member for New England took the opportunity to take me through and show me some of the particular soil practices that are being engaged in by farmers there. For a long time New England has been in the front line of no-till farming. The same issues were raised by the representatives of AgForce during the visit the Prime Minister and I made to Roma.A lot of focus has been put, at different times, on carbon emissions and land clearing. It is also the case, though, that the different methods of soil use have a significant impact on carbon emissions. Packages put together by the government and announced in our election policy Australia's Farming Future go to some of the specific ways in which we can advance these practices to make sure that farmers are well prepared for the carbon trading scheme. The three particular programs in Australia's Farming Future which will go to some of the issues raised by the honourable member for New England are the agricultural adaptation programs, the adjustment programs and a program making sure that research and development has a particular focus on productivity and on climate change research. Together, those programs add up to $130 million, and that will provide an important part of the way forward on the issues raised by the honourable member for New England.It is important that we finally have a situation where the government of this country is concerned with preparing farmers for a future with climate change. It is all the difference in the world away from the prior government, which denied the climate was changing at all. It is all the difference in the world away from that government, which for 11 long years told people there was no need to prepare, there was no need to adapt and there was no problem at all. The report that came from ABARE at the end of last year made clear the real dangers to both our domestic and export markets if we do nothing in terms of preparation for climate change. This government has the Australia's Farming Future policy. We are committed to making sure that we are well prepared, as an agricultural sector, for the future so that we can deal with both adaptation and mitigation issues - in particular, in the soil areas raised by the honourable member for New England - in making sure we have not just a sustainable but a vibrant future for Australian agriculture.</DOC>

 - Underlying inflation is currently running at 3.6 per cent in Australia. We have had 11 interest rate increases in a row after 20 Reserve Bank warnings over the preceding two or three years about the threats of inflation. - Underlying inflation is running at 3.6 per cent, the highest rate for 16 years. We have had 11 interest rate increases in a row and government spending for the current financial year, and the projections from the previous government, is running at a 4Â½ per cent real increase. The rate of increase is way too fast.The Rudd government is committed to cutting into government spending to get it back in line with appropriate fiscal settings to ensure that the budget is putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. That involves taking tough, challenging decisions. We faced the first instalment of this requirement a couple of weeks ago. When we were confronted with choices about the former government's announcements that were made after the budget last year, a whole variety of spending initiatives were wrapped up in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook papers. There were 220 spending decisions.We went through all of those spending decisions. Some of them were entirely legitimate and some of them were the ordinary business of government, but many of them were a substantial part of John Howard's pre-election shopping list. As a result, we cut $643 million of government spending over four years and, particularly, for the forthcoming financial year we cut $265 million of government spending. That is just a modest first instalment. We accept that, because the real action, the big action, is going to be in the budget. We could not duck or avoid these decisions because we had to legislate on those measures, and that legislation is to be passed by the House today.Some of the measures that we cut included significant government advertising spending. I advised the House yesterday of the outrageous amount of money - $457 million - that was spent by the previous government over the last 16 months it was in office. Some of those things were government advertising and some were specific programs. It was notable that straight out of the blocks in responding to these initiatives we had none other than the new Leader of the National Party. He immediately responded, and here is what he said in his press conference in the wake of these cuts being announced. He described the removal of $3 million of funding to the Fishing Hall of Fame as 'absolute rubbish'. He said, and I quote, 'We do not have a shortage of money in Australia.' In other words, money grows on trees and the trees are in bloom so we do not really have a shortage of money in Australia.He pointed out that the United States has a higher inflation rate than Australia but it is actually increasing government spending, clearly implying that the solution to any inflation problem is to increase government spending, not cut it. Finally he stated that cuts in government spending of the kind that we have projected will do nothing to reduce inflation. It is notable that in the last couple of days the opposition have placed a lot of emphasis on the question of technical economic knowledge. I would suggest that the little task force that they have beavering away somewhere in the bowels of the parliament should pay a visit to the Leader of the National Party's office and give him a bit of a lesson about some technical economic concepts like the impact of public demand on inflation and the impact of government spending on the economy, because at the moment we have a Leader of the National Party who thinks that the big issue facing Australia is the prospect of cuts to the Fishing Hall of Fame. He thinks that there is plenty of money lying around, that there is no problem, that we do not have to worry about the rate of spending in our economy and that we do not have to worry about inflation or interest rates. He thinks that cutting government spending will have no impact on inflation and that the answer to inflationary problems and upward pressure on interest rates is to actually increase government spending. It is notable that there has been some speculation about the Liberal Party and the National Party merging. There has been speculation about a prospective merger of the two parties. Interestingly enough, the National Party cannot get a deal. - I will of course comply with your ruling, Mr Speaker. I was merely coming to the suggestion that, before any discussions of that kind might proceed, the Liberal Party might have a bit of discussion with the Leader of the National Party - given the Liberal Party's new-found discovery of technical economic knowledge that it has been so pleased to parade before the parliament over the last couple of days - about some basic economic concepts. We on this side of the House, we in this government, understand the importance of cutting government spending to tackle the inflation problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. At a time of climate change across Australia, it is very important that the Bureau of Meteorology provide a proper range of services not just for our national needs but for local needs as well. Of course this has been highlighted given the extreme weather events we have had in recent times in Queensland, New South Wales and elsewhere. In the case of Rockhampton, I know from the honourable member of the excellent work done by her local Bureau of Meteorology office there. That is why I have asked the minister responsible to ensure that the Bureau of Meteorology there not only continues to operate but also continues to operate all the meteorology services that it has provided in the past. These are of particular importance to local areas in regional Australia and in rural Australia. Of course, beyond that, we need for the same reasons to ensure that meteorology services are delivered in those other areas which have been the subject of recent debate as well: in Cairns, Townsville and Launceston - where I have also received representations from local members.If you look across the meteorology system in the country, you see that there are particular gaps. I refer in particular to one which exists around the Queensland town of Emerald. Today I am announcing that the government will be funding a new radar in Emerald to better meet the needs of that community: its farmers, its families and its businesses. Emerald has a high level of need for these sorts of services, as we have seen recently in the unseasonal weather events in that community. I look forward very much to working with the member for Flynn to ensure that this new radar is properly rolled out and the systems and meteorology services associated with it. - I will pick up on the interjection from the Leader of the National Party, who once again comes in on cue. Why is there a gap when it comes to the delivery of meteorology services in Emerald? The reason is that for the last 10 or 11 years nothing has been done about it. I have before me here a letter to the current Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts from the Emerald Shire Council addressed to you know who: it is the member for Flinders, who has been particularly vocal in this place in recent days. It says:We have lodged two previous submissions, the last one in 2003. Specifically, I refer to a letter of response from the Hon. Greg Hunt, MP, received by council in December 2004. Since the receipt of this letter, we have had no further correspondence or advice in this matter.That is three years of inertia, three years of inaction, three years of not providing effective meteorology services to local communities that need it. Since then, we have had these extraordinary developments in extreme weather events in and around Emerald, directly affecting that community, and we have here an epistle of indifference from the member for Flinders. We are acting on this. We have committed to ensuring that Emerald forms part of the Bureau of Meteorology network in Queensland and - in response to the representations of the member for Capricornia, the member for Flynn and other members, including the member for Leichhardt and also the member for Bass - the retention of those meteorology services in those areas.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There is, of course, no doubt that children are Australia's most precious asset, and our family payments system really must be used to support the raising of children. The government are already engaged in a number of important initiatives in this area. First of all, we are making sure that we develop a national child protection framework. We have to respond to the carer payment (child) report. Most recently, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer and I announced terms of reference for a Productivity Commission inquiry into paid maternity leave, with a particular focus on the needs of newborn children. One of my first acts as a minister was to introduce income quarantining, or income management, for 14 Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory to make sure that those welfare payments were being used for the benefit of children.In opposition, we announced that we would give authority to state and territory child protection authorities to enable them to quarantine welfare payments for the protection of children. The previous government, in the run-up to the election, adopted this policy. We heard a lot from them in this place and in the newspapers about their plans to link welfare payments to school attendance and to the protection of children. The previous minister's plan was reported in the newspaper as:Any parents receiving welfare who were not sending their children to school would have their welfare cheques quarantined.Mr Brough was quoted as saying:There will be thousands.He went on to introduce legislation which we in opposition supported. On coming to government, when I asked my department for advice about how this measure was proceeding - I wanted to know what the previous government had done to put these very important measures in place - I found, to my dismay, that the previous government had not funded it; they had not funded it at all. They had issued the press releases, they had given the media interviews, they had put the legislation into the parliament, but somehow they had neglected to fund it. There was no money at all. Not a cent had been allocated by the former government for welfare payments nationally to be managed in the interests of children. It was nothing more than policy by press release by the previous government. There was not one cent to fund this very important measure. If you have a look at the press release from the former minister, he said:The welfare reform changes announced today by the Prime Minister - that is, the previous Prime Minister - are a key measure -  - 'A very important measure', the Leader of the Opposition says. Whatever words might be used, not one cent was allocated to these critical measures. Unlike the Howard government, we intend to provide the national leadership that is necessary to make sure that these very important reforms are implemented.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The program funded by the previous government, as you would know if you were being truthful in this place, concludes in 2008. It concludes after four years. I recall that when the former Prime Minister made the final announcement of a funding allocation he said that it was 'the final allocation' for a four-year program. If the honourable member for Casey is going to stand at the dispatch box and seek to engage in a debate on schools policy, I would suggest he do so honestly, because that question was not an honest reflection of the previous government's policy and the honourable member for Casey is fully aware of it. - To reinforce the point I just made in response to the question of the honourable member, if you go to the forward estimates for this period you just see, effectively, blank, blank, blank, blank, going out beyond the period concerned. The honourable member knew that before he asked the question. I think if we are going to have an honest debate here about education policy it has to be framed in honest terms. Those opposite are here defending a policy which they constructed to conclude in 2008. The Prime Minister at the time, when he announced the last allocation of funds, said that it was 'the final allocation' of funds. What we have here is an entirely bogus question delivered by the member for Casey. He knows it full well. Presenting such a question to the parliament in that manner I think belittles him, frankly, in terms of the honesty which underpins him and the standing I previously held for him.On the question of schools policy, I say this: this government is passionate about an education revolution. This government believes in investing in our schools. This government is committed to a $2.5 billion plan to construct trades training centres in every one of Australia's secondary schools, government and non-government, right across the country and, on top of that, to deliver $1 billion over four years to ensure that our kids in year 9 and above have access to computers in schools. There is a $62.5 million plan over four years: Local Schools Working Together. These represent effective investments in building up our schools into the future. We are a party and a government who are passionate about the future of education in our country, passionate about schools, passionate about the need to invest in our schools and passionate about the future which our kids have before them, and that is why you have billions of dollars worth of new programs being invested in the future of those kids. I would have thought that the honourable member for Casey, in advancing that question, would have reflected a little more honesty in the way in which he put it forward.I have indicated that I am not really very happy when question time is used to make points about personalities. I mentioned that to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation yesterday. I would rather the contest be a contest of ideas. But on this occasion I think that we would be getting a little overly precious. Even though the member for Casey might feel a little aggrieved, I am sure that his skin is thick enough to take it on this occasion. - Given the offence which has been taken by the member, I of course withdraw.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. He, probably alone in this House with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, has the closest interest in the way that we are going to continue with the previous government's intervention. I do think it is important to be able to put on the record in this House that we intend to make sure that the previous government's intervention does turn into providing lasting change in the health sector - in particular for our Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory. I know that the chamber is well aware of the child health checks which have been and are continuing to be undertaken. As of yesterday, 6,199 checks have now been undertaken. We are committed to honouring the $100 million that was committed by the previous government over the next two years to improve primary health care and health workforce provision in the Territory. But we are also committed to so much more than the previous government ever put in. We promised in the election to support more Indigenous health services and we are going to deliver on those. We are already taking steps to deliver on those, from the $260 million for early childhood education and maternal nursing services through to an extra $50 million in alcohol treatment services that were announced just last week, of which $8 million is directed towards the Northern Territory. All these commitments and many more are about us getting down to work, rolling up our sleeves and delivering the services where they are needed.I would also like to provide to the House some information about the follow-up services that are being provided as a result of the checks that have been done for children in the Northern Territory and to reaffirm our determination to make a real difference to the health outcomes for Indigenous children. The House might be interested to know that from an analysis of the children's health checks - the first 4Â½ thousand - 35 per cent of children have been referred to further primary health care services, a big chunk of those already being provided by existing services; 27 per cent of children have been referred for dental care; 10 per cent of children have been referred to a paediatrician; and 7.8 per cent of children have been referred to specialist ear, nose and throat services.I want to take the time to go through how those services are being provided because it is interesting that in the two areas where there is the most demand for follow-up care - primary care and dental care - the Rudd Labor government has already made significant additional commitments and these are also the areas where the previous government totally dropped the ball. The Leader of the Opposition and the member for Warringah have already admitted on the record that workforce shortages were the fault of early decisions of the Howard government. And we know - in fact members have been reminding us today - that the Howard-Costello government cut funding to dental care. I want to deal with this issue. -  - Before members opposite object, members might want to hear a sobering bit of information about what the previous government did in dental care. Eleven years ago when the previous government was elected, the government made a decision that it would not contribute to dental care. It made a decision that it would not -  - The member for Warringah, who I know is good at maths, will be able to work out that most of the children were born after the Howard government was elected and now some 30 per cent of those Indigenous kids need dental care. The member for Warringah, even if the rest of you do not know, will know that not a single cent was spent for any child in the Northern Territory on dental care in the last 11 years. Even the government's chronic care program did not service in four years a single person under the age of 25 in the whole Northern Territory. Don't come into this House and tell us that they object to us providing money for dental care when not one cent was provided to provide dental care by the Commonwealth for Indigenous children. - I am very proud to be part of a government that is going to be providing money to the states and territories to provide more dental services. I might also highlight that, of the hundreds of children that have been referred who need ear, nose and throat surgery, 500 children have already been organised to have the surgery undertaken in April 2008 as part of the blitz, and I would note when talking about this sort of surgery that the Rudd Labor government's $150 million for elective surgery, $5.3 million of which went to the Northern Territory and will pay for an additional 500 elective surgery procedures, will be particularly focused on ear, nose and throat surgery. We are of course proud of the fact that when we see these problems - and everyone in this House, whatever their political view, understands that health services are desperately needed in the Northern Territory - we are putting money in to help fix them. We know that much more needs to be done to reduce child mortality in Indigenous communities and to improve the life expectancy gap. We are starting to do that and we hope we are going to have the House's support to continue doing that.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I have seen those figures and they are disturbing for all of us. They are disturbing to working families right across Australia, who are under financial pressure. They are disturbing because of the burden which those working families have had to bear as a result of 11 interest rate rises in a row. As a result of that, when you combine it with the cost pressures on the family budget - the cost of groceries, the cost of petrol, the cost of all those other things which everyone has to reconcile each week to make sure that they can pay the bills - it is getting increasingly tough out there.The challenge for us lies at two levels. What are we going to do in terms of ensuring that we keep maximum downward pressure on inflation in order to ensure that we therefore have maximum downward pressure on interest rates? That, as I said at the beginning of this year, is the core challenge which the government faces - the fight against inflation. That is why every element of the government's policy arsenal is deployed in that direction. It goes to what we do in terms of public demand through the budget; it goes to how we encourage private savings; it goes to what we do on the supply side of the economy, too, in skills and infrastructure and workforce participation.Then you go specifically to housing itself. What can we as the government of Australia do to assist those who are out there in the housing market or wanting to be in the housing market in these difficult circumstances in which Australian families find themselves? The first measure we have embraced is to establish a federal department of housing which has its own minister. - To take the interjection from the Manager of Opposition Business, it is important, and it is in direct response to the representations made to us by practically every peak industry body in this sector, including the Housing Industry Association, with whom we have consulted closely on this and related housing policy matters.The second thing you can do, apart from bringing direct government ministerial focus on the housing challenge, is this: when it comes to our young people trying to enter the housing market for the first time, what can we do in practical terms to assist? That is why the Treasurer, together with the housing minister, has brought forward the submission for First Home Saver Accounts, and we are proud and pleased as a government to have that as an early measure being put forward by the government into the community to assist those young working families who have no ability to get into the market or to do so with any degree of financial comfort at this stage.We have other elements of housing policy which we put out prior to the election and we will be honouring each element of those housing policy commitments. We want to ensure that the great Australian dream of young people having access to their own home remains alive and well. Hence why we have implemented these measures.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. If we are looking out to the big economic challenges facing Australia, fighting the fight against inflation is one; second, making sure that we are doing whatever we can to boost long-term productivity growth in the economy; and, third, to do what we can also embrace on the overall, overarching challenge of climate change. Climate change is as much an economic threat as it is an environmental threat as it is long term a national security threat as well, unless we are capable of acting on it.The government accepts the scientific evidence. The government accepts that the scientific evidence is in that climate change is real, it is happening, and no longer can this nation afford to be in any state of denial on something as fundamental as this. It does go to our long-term interests across the spectrum: economic, environmental and national security. And overall our view has long been, put in simple terms, that the costs of inaction on climate change are much greater than the costs of action.If you look at some of the data, the Bureau of Meteorology reported that 2007 was the sixth warmest year on record in Australia. Furthermore, 16 of the last 18 years have been warmer than the long-term average in Australia. Again, the CSIRO recently projected that temperatures will rise another one to five degrees by 2070 depending on the level of carbon emissions in the coming decades. This means that we in this country and the world at large are facing the requirement for a global economic transformation to a low carbon economy of an order of magnitude that we have not seen since the great economic transformation of the Industrial Revolution.This is a deep challenge not just for our country, Australia, but for the entire world. Failure to act is in fact consigning the future for our children to a very dismal destiny indeed. Without decisive action on climate change, we in this country will also be in the front line of the victims of climate change. Australia is the driest continent on the planet. As weather patterns change, this leaves us more vulnerable to impacts of climate change than other advanced economies. Great national assets such as the Barrier Reef and Kakadu are affected. There are also the risks to our farming communities, who are already exposed, as well as water shortages which could in the future make vast tracts of Australia uninhabitable.Australia must therefore seize the opportunity now to become a leader globally. In the transformation to a low-carbon energy economy, a low-carbon energy revolution is what is necessary. We have an opportunity to become world leaders when it comes to clean coal technologies. We have an opportunity to become world leaders when it comes to the proper deployment and use of renewable energies - what we do in the future with solar, wind, ocean tidal flows and other energy renewables. We have an opportunity to become world leaders when it comes to energy efficiency in our homes and our businesses, as well as in our factories and our mines. This is where we need to position Australia, not in a state of denial but out there ahead of the pack, because it is in our deep economic interest, our deep national interest, to do so.This government took steps very early in its term to become not just a part of the global climate change problem but a part of the global climate change solution. On our first day, we ratified the Kyoto protocol. Within our first week or two, we delivered that instrument of ratification of the Kyoto protocol to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. And, within that conference at Bali, within that first week, we had the Australian Minister for Climate Change and Water there, not skulking at the edge of the conference, as has happened in previous times. The Australian Minister for Climate Change and Water, within two weeks of this government taking office, was there acting as a co-chair of the important final negotiating sessions of the conference - part of the action, part of the solution; not just a carping part of the problem. And, if there was an opportunity for action on this, I simply pose this question to those opposite: why did it take 12 long years for those opposite to finally harness themselves into action? I ask them this question: do you support ratification of Kyoto now? Will you embrace the possibility of deratifying Kyoto? You do not have any clarity on that either. We in this government therefore are embracing a range of policy measures. - The member for Flinders then left the chamber. - Climate change therefore warrants a whole-of-government response. We need to be acting globally, as we are doing through our Kyoto ratification process, having embarked on the Bali road map, which will conclude with the Copenhagen conference at the end of 2009. Another element of our comprehensive approach is the development of a national emissions trading scheme. Another element of our approach is to introduce a new, much more ambitious and nationally consistent renewable energy target - and, on top of that, to ensure that we have proper energy efficiency measures across the economy, encouraging people in their homes and elsewhere to do their bit when it comes to dealing with the challenge of climate change. And then there is mitigating those unavoidable impacts of climate change, including for the farming community. That is why we have a $130 million climate change in agriculture program out there at the moment.Later today, Professor Garnaut will be delivering an interim report on his investigation into climate change. This goes directly to how we deal with the overall challenge of climate change into the future. Professor Garnaut was commissioned because the previous government refused to commission any such report in order to assess properly the economic impacts of climate change. Together with my state colleagues, we commissioned this review last year, asking Professor Garnaut to look at the costs of climate change and to recommend medium- to long-term policy options for Australia, and that interim report will be produced today. The Garnaut review will be a valuable source of advice to the government.Professor Garnaut has acknowledged the complexity of the economic impacts of climate change, and he has made clear that the release of his report is intended to encourage further debate across the Australian community. That is as it should be. We as the government encourage such debate, because climate change affects all of us. It affects our kids. It affects our farms. It affects our businesses. It affects the future of the country and the economy itself. - So the government looks forward to the release of Professor Garnaut's interim report. It will inform the public debate. We encourage the nation to engage in that debate. The government, by the time the final version of the Garnaut report is produced later this year, will be taking advice from other sources as well - the Treasury and other agencies within government. It is important we get our long-term policy settings on climate change right - critical for the economy, critical for families, critical for the environment and critical for national security. After 12 years of inaction on the whole question of climate change, it is time that Australia led the international community on this question. It is time we had a government in this country which led the national debate on this question. That is what needs to be done now; that is what this government is now engaged in.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The member is continuing with this assertion that somehow the borrowings of state government business enterprises are having an impact on inflation and therefore let them off the hook when it comes to seven interest rate rises in the last three years. Well, they are not going to get off the hook when it comes to their responsibility for high inflation - the highest elevated inflation in 16 years; seven interest rate rises in three years. It is absolutely essential that state governments invest in critical economic infrastructure - critical economic infrastructure such as water; critical economic infrastructure such as transport and ports. The previous government was simply -  - This government is determined to end the blame game when it comes to federal-state relations - absolutely determined to work to reform federal-state relations so we can put in place First World infrastructure that will put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. As the Prime Minister was saying earlier, the costs of inaction on climate change are far greater than the costs of action. The previous government put this problem in the too-hard basket. Now they cannot even answer the simple question as to whether they will ratify Kyoto. What is the answer? -  - Addressing climate change is a long-term growth strategy. It is very important that we put in place the policy settings to address climate change. From an economic perspective, climate change is a market failure. Emitters do not bear the full cost of their emissions, so we need a range of policies to reduce emissions. That is why the Treasury is engaging in climate change modelling. That is why there is independent academic analysis out there at the moment from Mr Garnaut. That is why there is other analysis here and abroad. Treasury's climate change modelling is expected to be completed by mid-June and will be informed by a range of international and domestic experts. Finally this country has a government that is determined to address climate change.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. The Australian government is committed to helping our schools take practical, concrete action to tackle climate change and to conserve precious water supplies. I am pleased to inform the House that from 1 July this year the government will roll out its commitments to make every one of Australia's schools, public and private, a solar school. Under the Australian government's $489 million National Solar Schools Program, every school in Australia will be eligible to apply for grants of up to $50,000 to install skylights, shade awnings and solar panels, in addition to rainwater tanks and solar hot water systems. This new program represents an additional $153 million on top of the existing green vouchers program. I have to say that it is far more flexible than the previous government's program.Under Labor's plan, schools can choose the most effective way to meet their energy and water efficiency goals, but we are giving schools the option to participate in the existing green vouchers program or wait until Solar Schools is rolled out on 1 July this year. It is clear that many schools are choosing to wait for the more flexible and comprehensive National Solar Schools Program. I note that the member for Flinders, who regrettably is now absent from the chamber - a practice that other members, including the member for Mayo, seem to have undertaken - has been getting quite excited about the transition to Solar Schools. He accused the government of all manner of sins, of wasting water and electricity. He was quoted in the Melbourne Age on 28 December saying, 'Potentially thousands of projects are now on hold.' I want to assure the House, in the absence of the member for Flinders, that no projects are now on hold. The government has set a very clear transition timetable for the National Solar Schools Program.Given the claim of the member for Flinders about projects being potentially on hold, I want to update the House briefly on the progress of the previous government's program. There was a time last year when one of the most common sights in Australian schools was the member for Wentworth brandishing novelty green vouchers left, right and centre. You can find the paper trail on the member's own website - a $50,000 voucher at a Far North Queensland school on 3 August, another voucher for a Brisbane school on 23 August, schools in Randwick, schools in Bondi, Rose Bay and Double Bay. - Mr Speaker, there is no doubt that what I am about to say is relevant to that question. Naturally the government was keen to see how payments under the former government's program were actually delivered. Remember, this was a program that was put in place on 17 July last year. It turns out when we look at it that, between 17 July last year and the federal election in November, not one payment was delivered to a school under the green vouchers program. We had the member for Wentworth visiting schools throughout the country, issuing press release after press release, and how much money did schools actually receive? - Not a single cent. The Rudd Labor government is actually delivering commitments. We will not be flying around Australia delivering novelty cheques to schools. We have a comprehensive program to deal with climate change, and Solar Schools is part of that comprehensive program. We want to enable Australian families to reduce their costs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and be fair dinkum in their efforts to tackle climate change - efforts that this government profoundly supports.</DOC>

Furthermore, the government is recognising something that the former government was unable to - that is, the profound connections between climate change, water and drought in the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for that question. It gives me the opportunity to again underline the fundamental importance and the long-term, enduring nature of the alliance relationship between Australia and the United States. This is an alliance which has served both nation-states well, an alliance forged by Labor Prime Minister John Curtin at a time of our greatest peril. It is an alliance which has lasted for over 50 years and is now part of Australia's indispensable strategic, security and defence arrangements. The alliance transcends either governments in this nation or administrations in the United States, whether it is Labor or Liberal here or Democrat or Republican in the United States.In January of this year I visited the United States. I met with Secretary of State Rice, my counterpart; Vice-President Cheney; and also the Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates. Both in our private exchanges and publicly, the Secretary of State and I underlined both Australia's and the United States's long-term, enduring commitment to the fundamental and indispensable nature of our alliance relationship.I also took the opportunity of informing the United States administration of our election commitment to withdraw our combat troops from Iraq by the middle of this year. That is now being done in close consultation with the United States and also with the United Kingdom. I have made the point, which is clear for all to see, that this carrying out of our election commitment in no way disturbs the fundamental nature of our alliance relationship. I also took the opportunity while I was in Washington to invite the Secretary of State to visit Perth and I was very pleased to be able to announce that she had indicated she would so do.In terms of the ongoing business of the alliance, I am pleased to inform the House that in Canberra on Saturday, 23 February, Australia will formally host this year's Australia-US Ministerial consultations, or the AUSMIN consultations as they are known. My colleague the Minister for Defence, Mr Fitzgibbon, and I will formally host the consultations on behalf of Australia and the Secretary of Defense, Mr Gates, and the Deputy Secretary of State, Mr Negroponte, will formally represent the United States. This is the first occasion since December 2006 that we have had the AUSMIN consultations. The December 2006 consultations were held in Washington and in November 2005 the last consultations were conducted in Australia.The AUSMIN consultations are the primary vehicle for pursuing the ongoing strategic arrangements so far as our alliance is concerned. We exchange insights on regional and global strategic matters and on security challenges. We discuss furthering our security and defence cooperation arrangements. It also gives us the opportunity to discuss matters of interest, including our own area, the Asia-Pacific.I also indicate that in the course of the AUSMIN consultations I will take the opportunity of reporting to Secretary of Defense Gates and Deputy Secretary of State Negroponte of my trip tomorrow to the Solomon Islands to have consultations with the Solomon Islands government, with Prime Minister Sikua and his ministers, and also to take part in the first ministerial forum review of the RAMSI operation, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, an important responsibility which Australia is only to happy to discharge in our area of the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and I am pleased that I finally have one from the shadow minister for health. I was a bit fearful - when he was on holidays for months on end, did not issue a press release, did not do anything - that maybe I would not get a question on health at all. - I thank the shadow minister for his question. As he well knows, we are in a negotiation phase with the states over the healthcare agreements. We are having intensive negotiations over a range of extensive reforms - something that the shadow minister's predecessor refused to do. I have no intention at all of flagging in this place or publicly the sort of funding that we might in our negotiations be discussing with the states.I can assure the member opposite that the one thing we will not be doing in our negotiations with the states is pulling a billion dollars out of public hospital funding. I have to wonder, particularly with this shadow minister, who spent so much of the last term in government doing over working people with Work Choices, whether he did not bother to take any time or pay any -  - The point is the shadow minister - if he is not aware already, he will no doubt be aware soon - sat around a cabinet table that pulled a billon dollars out of public hospital funding and did not do anything about it, and we intend to fix that problem. -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Of course, she is a Western Australian in this place, and the first set of data I want to go to relates to Western Australia. The ABS data released yesterday shows that in Western Australia the wage price index for the private sector rose by 6.4 per cent for the year to December, well above the national average of 4.2 per cent. By industry, Australia-wide, the highest rates of increase in the wage price index over the year to the December quarter 2007 were in mining, an increase of 5.1 per cent, whereas wholesale trade saw the lowest increase, of 3.2 per cent. ABS average weekly earnings data released today tells the same story. There is continued strong growth in adult ordinary time earnings, by 4.7 per cent, in the year to November 2007, with large rises of 7.4 per cent in mining and 11.6 per cent in construction for the year to November 2007, and also large increases in property and business services and cultural and recreational services. Wage growth in full-time adult ordinary time earnings is highest in WA for the quarter.All of these increases, of course, happened under the Liberal Party's workplace relations system, Work Choices. It is no mystery, when we look at these figures, that wages growth is strongest in those industries and those parts of the country where skilled labour shortages are at their most acute. The Rudd Labor government knows that managing wage inflation is not about using Work Choices or Australian workplace agreements or individual statutory employment agreements of any nature to cut the pay and conditions for Australians who are most at risk at work. Rather, containing wage inflation is about having an enterprise based, decentralised workplace relations system, one of course that Labor is committed to. But it is also about tackling the underlying cause of this wage inflation, which is skills shortages and capacity constraints.Unfortunately the Liberal Party engaged in 12 years of neglect of the skills agenda and allowed these skills shortages to become a critical problem. The lazy attitude of the Liberal Party was probably best summarised by the member for Goldstein, who was then the Minister for Vocational and Further Education, when he told an industry group last year:_ we've got a problem with skill shortage._Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _I mean we knew it was coming but it has arrived with a force._Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _And you know, it's only going to get worse.On tackling skills shortages in this country, the Liberal Party, like the member for Mayo, were out to lunch - not much verve being shown there, not much verve at all. Apparently it is okay for the Liberal Party to be out to lunch and for the member for Mayo to be out to lunch -  - In order to describe what the government is doing, it is important to understand the dimension of the problem, and the problem has only become so acute because of 12 years of inaction, 12 years of being out to lunch on dealing with skills in this country. It is of no surprise to me that the member for Canning defends such conduct, defends everybody's right to be out to lunch, with quotes like:He's - the member for Mayo is - exercising his right to lunch _ with the time difference between Adelaide his ruminations might be a little bit out of clock.Mr Speaker, I can tell you what is out of clock here. What is out of clock here is the out-of-touch, out-to-lunch Liberal Party. At least the member for Higgins comes to question time, even if he looks at seek.com.au for the entire duration! - On the question of jobs in general, the Rudd Labor government is getting on with the job and we are getting on with the job of tackling the skills crisis in this country. We will do that by investing in 450,000 training places, with the first 20,000 of these training places to be delivered in April this year. Members in the House who have attended for question time, including the member for Mayo, might like to note that the choices about where these places go will be in those qualifications that are critical for our economy. We are of course going to be investing in a range of options for those who are seeking to upgrade their skills in order to change career. In that regard, people might want to note that, for those without a business background who are looking for a career change, the Mount Barker Campus of TAFE in Mayo offers an Advanced Diploma of Accounting, and, for those who seek to understand corporate governance, there is a Certificate IV in Business (Frontline Management). - I am just trying to help in terms of overcoming that AWB scandal. I am just trying to assist. Whilst just trying to assist on the question of investment in skills, can I say it is -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. It was a concerning look. It is never too late for anybody to upgrade their skills. It is not too late for this national government to be investing in skills. It is going to take time to overcome the skills crisis, but it is a vital part of our strategy to fight inflation and to build economic prosperity for this nation's future. - From time to time. Certainly the ABS wages statistics - yes, I did read those. - The document from which I was reading has confidential material, of course. I did read the ABS statistics.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Firstly, when it comes to the government's pre-election commitments on skills, we will honour that commitment to the letter. Secondly, when it comes to a government which takes seriously the challenges of vocational education and training and apprenticeships across the country, that is core business for the new Australian government - not marginal business, as it was for the government which preceded us. If you had travelled as much as we have across the country and dealt with people suffering from shortages of skills and shortages of apprenticeships, and the state of trades training in our schools, you would reach the conclusion that policy is deficient. We will honour our commitments.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corio for his question. Indeed, the Australian National Audit Office report which came out last year, three volumes of it, has page after page indicating the failure of the National Party, in particular, to conduct its regional programs in an appropriate manner. What this documents, according to the Audit Office, is:The manner in which the program has been administered over the three-year period to 30 June 2006 examined by ANAO had fallen short of an acceptable standard of public administration.That is an underestimation, because what this report showed was that in 2004, in a 51-minute spending spree just before they went into caretaker mode, the former parliamentary secretary, the former member for Dawson, approved 16 projects worth $3.3 million - 16 projects in 51 minutes. But you would think maybe that the government of the time might have learnt something from that process. Upon coming to this job, I have been asking questions of my department about these processes, and what happened in the week before the 2007 election was called? They approved 32 Regional Partnerships projects - 32 worth $5Â½ million. Not surprisingly, consistent with the way that they confused taxpayers' funds with National Party funds, 28 of these projects were in National and Liberal Party seats.In November 2007, the member for Lyons, the then minister, admitted that there was room for improvement, but he had already approved some $650,000 for projects in his own electorate that year. One-third of taxpayer funds went to projects in only 10 coalition electorates. The Audit Office found that they approved projects where no funding application was received. They fast-tracked projects, they fast-tracked assessments, when it suited them. No wonder that I am calling the Audit Office the 'Nationals Audit Office', because for report after report what we find is an outrageous abuse of taxpayers' funds. And what's more, they wasted taxpayers' funds on red tape. It cost 20c in every dollar just on administering this program.We know that the community youth outreach centre in Wide Bay was funded in 2005 within one day of an application being lodged. In 2004 a health complex in Maranoa was funded within one day of an application being lodged. Then there is the Keith Seeds grant of $571,000. This was a grant paid to a commercial company for installing equipment. Even though the department recommended against funding this project not once but twice, the minister intervened to overturn that, and it was only later on that we found out that the local MP, the member for Barker, who wrote a letter of support for the application, was actually a shareholder in the company that got the grant. - It is all in the 'National's Audit Office' report. There was $1.05 million - this is a beauty - paid to the Gunnedah ethanol plant. As regional development minister, I might want to go and have a look at this plant, but it is pretty hard because, although $1.05 million of the $1.2 million grant which was agreed in August 2004 has been paid, nothing has happened. There is no plant there. Over $1 million of taxpayers' funds have been paid - and an application supported by the chief of staff to the then Leader of the National Party, even though he was not the relevant minister at the time. It goes on. There is example after example. In the interests of brevity we might roll them out two or three at a time, because this is very interesting reading and I recommend it to every member on both sides of the parliament. A Rudd Labor government is committed to proper funding for regional development programs - proper funding on the basis of proper consideration, not on the basis of short-term partisan political fixes by the National Party.</DOC>

 - Yes, it is very definitely necessary to reduce government spending, because the former government left Australia with a serious inflation problem arising from years of neglect of Australia's skills and infrastructure. As a result of facing this challenge, the Rudd government is committed to delivering a budget surplus of at least 1Â½ per cent of GDP in the forthcoming financial year, and this will require major surgery. It will require major spending cuts to the budget. It means eliminating wasteful, inefficient and lower priority spending in order to ensure that we can get the inflation threat under control.It is important to emphasise that that is only an immediate objective. Important though it is, it is only the initial objective for the government, because we are also very strongly committed to ensuring that we put in place longer term structural reforms to ensure that government spending can be reduced in the longer term also and, in particular, that taxpayers, that citizens, can get better value for money from their taxes into the future. We want to ensure that there will be much stricter processes applying to government spending in the future, and that is why we have put in place a strategic budget committee and that is why we will have the Expenditure Review Committee of Cabinet meeting all year round, not just in the pre-budget period. Significant spending decisions will have to go to the ERC, irrespective of the time of year. That is also why we will ensure that all spending decisions are considered either in the budget process or with genuine savings attached to those decisions.These processes are being put in place to ensure that all government spending is subject to very tight, very rigorous scrutiny and that the waste and the slackness of recent years is not repeated. We are also putting in place a second stage of the razor gang exercise that will ensure that a more systemic examination, a more structural scrutiny, of government spending and government processes and service delivery will occur. That will report to the government towards the end of this year and will deliver further savings that will have significant long-term benefits to the budget. They include things like greater coordination of procurement, much greater rigour in IT spending and much greater rigour in the purchase of IT hardware and services. The total government spend on IT is roughly $6 billion per year. That is an awful lot of money. There are considerable problems in a number of areas with that because it has been so decentralised and there has been so little rigour and application of due process to it. The immediate job is to get government spending under control to ensure that we are putting downward pressure on inflation. The longer term task is to set Australia and the Australian economy up for the next 15 or 20 years to ensure that we get better value for money, lower taxes and better government services and that spending is directed to the highest priorities.That means that spending discipline is not just going to be an occasional outburst in a sea of waste and profligacy. That means that we intend to make spending discipline a way of life for this government. We live in hope that the former government, the now opposition, will express a view on some of these questions. We would like to know: does the former government believe that we have an inflation problem in this country? Does the opposition believe that it is necessary to cut government spending? Does it agree with the proposition that we -  - Mr Speaker, I point out that I was not asking a question. I was stating something I would like to know. I would like to know what the opposition thinks. - The former government were only interested in the short term: next week, next month, where they would be on election night. That was the focus of government spending as far as they were concerned. They were not prepared to set Australia up -  - The Rudd government aims to address the long-term economic challenge that this country faces, and a critical part of addressing that challenge is to set a firm foundation for government spending that delivers the maximum efficiency and the maximum quality service to people who deal with government departments - particularly bodies like the Department of Human Services, Centrelink and Medicare - and the maximum quality output for government spending on things like IT and wider procurement. That is critical to ensuring that we get longer term value for money, that we get the best possible outcomes from government spending and that it creates the space to do the kind of investing in skills and infrastructure that our country so desperately needs to put longer term downward pressure on inflation. We are committed to the short-term task of cutting government spending to put downward pressure on inflation and tackle the problem that the former government, the now opposition, has left us. And we are committed to the longer term task of building the Australian economy for the working families of this country so that their taxes provide good value for money and we get good economic outcomes in the longer term.</DOC>

 - I do thank the honourable member for Bendigo for his question. I can report to the House that overnight the price of the benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose to a new high of $100.83 a barrel. The price of the benchmark used for Australian petrol purposes, the Singapore Mogas 95, rose to $108.04 a barrel. The basis of this increase was speculation that OPEC, at their meeting on 5 March, will cut production. This development underlines the importance of the government's approach. We have always said, in opposition and in government, that when world oil prices are so high it is important that there are extra efforts to ensure transparency and competition in the Australian petrol market, to ensure Australian motorists are not paying one cent more than they need to at the bowser.These increases have an effect on Australian working families. As CommSec has pointed out, the average Australian household is forking out $189.50 a month on petrol, which is up $27 a month on the past year. Just as concerning is the flow-on effect. Every good for sale in an Australian shop has transport as a component of its price. When petrol prices go up the transport component of those prices also goes up. So this has an inflationary effect. It is because of these impacts on working families and because of the impact on inflation that the government have taken the action that we have since the election: the issue of formal monitoring powers to the ACCC and the appointment of Australia's first petrol commissioner. And that is why we recognise and say very clearly that there is more to do. We will continue to work with the ACCC and the petrol commissioner on the range of measures that the ACCC recommended for further consideration in their petrol report handed to the government in December.When oil prices are so high it is particularly important that we ensure that there is no undue divergence between the price of oil in Singapore and the price of petrol in Australia. In other words, there will always be a difference between the price of oil in Singapore and the price of petrol in Australia because of production costs, refining costs, transport costs and profit margin. But it is important that the ACCC continues to monitor that divergence and ensures that it is no greater than could be justified by the market. This divergence, the ACCC tells me, is normally in the order of 60c a litre. From time to time the ACCC notices this creeping up. This happened twice in the last two years. - The ACCC advise me that normally the divergence is around 60c a litre but from time to time they see this creep up. They advise me that they have seen it rise to as much as 67c a litre. Under the previous government, the ACCC had one policy option to deal with this - begging. They would beg the petrol companies to give the Australian motorists a fair go. Honourable members might recall the newspaper article on the front page of the Daily Telegraph on 16 January 2007 in which the Chairman of the ACCC was reduced to begging the Australian oil companies to reduce their prices and give Australian motorists a fair go.Under our government there is a different approach. The Chairman of the ACCC and the petrol commissioner actually have some powers. They are not reduced to asking, requesting and begging the petrol companies to explain. On 18 December, less than two weeks after the Rudd government were sworn in, we issued the ACCC with formal monitoring powers, as, during the election campaign, we had committed to do. I can report to the House that the ACCC has used those formal monitoring powers. Recently, when noticing an increase in the divergence between the price of oil in Singapore and the price of petrol in Australia, the commission utilised the powers given to it by the government under part 7A of the Trade Practices Act and wrote to the oil companies under its formal monitoring powers. The ACCC advises me that, after those formal monitoring powers were used, it found that the divergence disappeared and that the difference between the price of oil in Singapore and the price of petrol in Australia returned to usual and normal measures. This is the advice to me from Graeme Samuel, the Chairman of the ACCC.The government has always said that there are no easy answers to this question. There are no magic bullets and no simple solutions. That is what we said in opposition and that is what we say in government. We also say that we will do everything in our power to ensure there is transparency and competition in the Australian petrol market. We also say that we will not do what they did and ignore the problem. We also say that we will do what they never had the wit to do: we will use every measure in our power to ensure Australian working families get a fair go, that there is competition in the Australian petrol market and that it is not the comfortable oligopoly they let run for 11 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Last week's apology here in this parliament to Indigenous people, to the stolen generation, was an important turning point in our nation's history. I take this opportunity to personally thank the Leader of the Opposition for supporting that motion. In this parliament we used a solemn occasion to do something about setting to right some of the wrongs of the past. It provides us all, as the parliament of this country and as the government and the opposition, a way to carve out a new future for Indigenous Australians.The future, from our side of the House, lies in the question: how do we now close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians? How do we close the gap in terms of life expectancy? How do we close the gap in terms of infant and child mortality? How do we close the gap in education outcomes and employment outcomes? These are the critical benchmarks which will be applied to us as a government in the future, as to whether our policy settings succeeded or failed. It is important that we, therefore, as a government embrace every practical measure available to us to achieve those targets within the time frames that we have put clearly on the public record.My colleagues in the cabinet and the ministry have been hard at work putting forward measures which are aimed explicitly at helping Indigenous communities in education and in other areas. For example, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs announced jointly last week funding for an extra 200 teachers for the Northern Territory. In my travels to the Northern Territory in recent months, we ran into teachers who had come to Darwin from remote communities. You cannot get past a single conversation without one of them raising with you: 'We do not have enough teachers in this community,' or, 'We do not have enough physical resources to ensure that kids are being taught in the school in our community, or enough housing for our teachers.' It is time we began to act in these areas.On top of that, the Minister for Health and Ageing announced funding of $50 million to reduce alcohol and substance abuse, given its impact on Indigenous families in particular. Furthermore, we have a commitment of $48 million to support welfare reform trials in Cape York communities.Last week in the parliament I also announced my intention to establish a new joint policy commission on Indigenous housing, to be co-chaired by me and the Leader of the Opposition. I have had the opportunity now of sitting down on a couple of occasions with the Leader of the Opposition to begin discussing this through, and I look forward to those discussions, as I hope they will continue next week and the week after.Together with the minister for Indigenous affairs, I will be visiting an Indigenous community tomorrow in New South Wales to begin looking at specific needs for Indigenous housing in those communities, as well as related questions concerning health, education and physical safety and security. I would also hope that, if discussions between the Leader of the Opposition and me come to a successful conclusion on the joint policy commission, into the future and the weeks ahead we will have an opportunity jointly to visit Indigenous communities around the country and to examine first-hand their particular housing needs.This is simply a start to what will be an ambitious program of work on behalf of the government. We know that the aspirations of the nation and Indigenous people, which were raised as a consequence of the events in the parliament last week, now have to be met through a program of practical action. Targets have been set and time lines have been established. We now have to roll up our sleeves and do it. Tomorrow, the minister and I will begin that process. We hope in due season, if it is possible to reach conclusion and agreement between us on the shape, architecture, composition and precise operating arrangements for this joint policy commission on Indigenous housing, we will be able to do it conjointly into the future as well.</DOC>

 - Thank you so much for the question. I think it is terrific that we have finally got a shadow minister for housing, given there was no minister for housing for 10 long years. The Rudd Labor government is the first government for more than a decade to pay any attention to the issues of affordability. We have committed to a national rental affordability scheme that will build 50,000 new, affordable rental properties. - Our National Rental Affordability Scheme, our Housing Affordability Fund and, more recently, our First Home Saver account provide the best opportunity that young Australians have had to save for their first home. We have seen a declining proportion of young Australians becoming first home owners, because they simply cannot afford a deposit. - What happens when they cannot afford a deposit is that they borrow 95 per cent, 100 per cent, 105 per cent of the value of their homes. The first question today was about defaulting. In many circumstances, the reason that people are defaulting is that they have been forced to borrow too great a proportion of the value of their home. - The benefits of the First Home Saver account reflect the same benefits that relate to superannuation. People on higher incomes benefit more from putting extra money into superannuation. The reason that we have introduced the First Home Saver account is that your government when in power did nothing for first home buyers. We saw a smaller proportion of young Australians buying their first homes than ever before, because you did nothing for housing affordability.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Canberra for her question. The care and protection of Australia's elderly is my main concern and my main focus as the Minister for Ageing. Can I remind the House that in Australia there are more than 2,870 accredited nursing homes and more than 116,000 people are employed as nurses, personal care workers and allied health workers. These people are the backbone of the aged care sector. They are indeed a very dedicated and committed workforce. However, the reality is that there is a tiny section of the community who prey upon the vulnerable and the frail. That is why I have instructed my department to look into the area of police checks for workers within the aged care sector.On 1 March 2007, the previous government introduced a scheme in this regard; however, the guidelines need to be improved. This must happen. Currently staff in aged care facilities are required to have police checks if they have unsupervised access to residents. I want to toughen up these requirements. Police checks should apply to all staff in nursing homes - that is, people who have supervised or unsupervised access to the frail and aged. I have instructed the Department of Health and Ageing to review the guidelines for staff working with residents and to write to all the nursing homes to inform them of our intention to review the guidelines and to seek their views. We will also consult with relevant peak body organisations and relevant unions. Protecting our older Australians within nursing homes is a serious issue, and I hope to have the guidelines in place later this year. I know that there will be some people in the community who will oppose these stricter police checks, but I make no apologies to anybody for protecting older Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. This certainly is a major concern of mine when it comes to nursing homes right throughout our nation. The member highlighted issues in relation to the Murwillumbah Nursing Home. I am advised that from 14 to 18 January this year, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency conducted a review audit of the Murwillumbah Nursing Home and the agency found the home to be noncompliant with 14 of the 44 accreditation outcomes. I am committed to releasing those details to the residents, because my primary concern is for the welfare of older Australians. Whilst I am here, can I just say that what we saw for 11 years under the Howard government was a decline in investment in aged care -  - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for bringing up that point in relation to compliance and the time period, because it was under the Howard government that these procedures were put in place, when we saw a decline in investment in aged care and we saw massive workforce shortages. That is what we saw when they were in office. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Returning to the Murwillumbah Nursing Home, as I said, the situation there is simply not good enough. That is why I am pleased to tell the House that I will be releasing that information. But, as I was saying before, the legacy of previous Howard government ministers for ageing is a disgrace - a massive underinvestment, aged care bed shortages and one scandal after another.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and I note that this week he has been in his electorate inspecting the flood damage and assisting the people of his electorate. I also acknowledge the work of members from both sides of the House from northern New South Wales and Queensland, who have been great advocates for their local communities in this time of need. Responding to natural disasters requires a whole-of-government response and a whole-of-community response. I can assure members that the Commonwealth government is playing its part. For instance, on 18 January this year Emergency Management Australia arranged for our defence forces to transport portable flood barriers from New South Wales to Charleville and, on 27 January this year, Emergency Management Australia requested Defence Force assistance in the drop of fodder for stranded and starving cattle around Emerald. With the assistance of the Minister for Defence, two Black Hawk helicopters were engaged to undertake the task of dropping the fodder.In terms of financial assistance, under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements, the Australian government is providing financial assistance to the governments of Queensland and New South Wales to assist them in coping with the disaster. That assistance includes measures such as alleviating personal hardship and distress, the provision of low-interest loans and assisting to restore public infrastructure damaged by floods. In terms of assistance to business, after the Prime Minister inspected flood areas, he announced a package for business. Under those arrangements, small business and primary producers will be entitled to grants of up to $5,000 and $25,000 respectively. As to tourism, again as a result of representations from local members from the affected areas, the Australian government has announced another $300,000, which is being matched by the government of New South Wales, for a tourism recovery package to assist the North Coast region of New South Wales. In addition, the government has provided over $3.3 million in flood mitigation measures in Charleville and Emerald.As mentioned this week by the Prime Minister, in conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Australian government has activated the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment Scheme to assist flood-affected families by providing payments of $1,000 to adults and $400 for children. As the Prime Minister has said in remarks supported by the Leader of the Opposition, the Commonwealth government remains committed to working with local communities to respond to the immediate impact of the floods and to assist in their recovery from the longer term consequences.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. Binge drinking imposes a huge toll on the community. In any given week, studies indicate that one in 10 people - that is, 168,000 young people - aged 12 to 17 are binge drinkers and are drinking at risky levels. - I note that the former Minister for Health and Ageing thinks this is very funny. Given his remarks earlier today, I would suggest he regard this as not a marginal or minority concern but a real concern for the mainstream community. Commonly defined as 'seven or more drinks for males' and 'five or more drinks for females', binge drinking is becoming a matter of widespread and legitimate concern in the Australian community. Among 16- and 17-year-olds, one in five are drinking at risky levels. Furthermore, young people aged 18 to 24 have the riskiest drinking patterns, with almost two-thirds drinking at risky levels for harm in the short term. Some may ask why this is necessarily a concern, given that we have drinking problems across the entire community. The answer lies in the fact that, for adolescents, particularly those in the age bracket from 14 to 17, studies show that a drinking profile of this nature can result in considerably increased physical harm which can be irreparable. Therefore, it is a legitimate matter of community concern.In addition to the objective evidence of the costs of binge drinking, there is the untold impact on families and communities across the country. The government is determined to work with the wider community, with parents and with young people themselves to tackle this problem. The strategy will not fix the problem overnight but it is a solid first step. This will initially involve three measures to tackle binge drinking among our young people. First, I want to work with sporting and other non-government organisations to affect the environments that shape the culture of binge drinking among young people. The government is committing $14.4 million towards a grants based program focused on reducing binge drinking at the community level. I see this supporting, in particular, sporting codes and clubs in educating and informing club members about the harms associated with binge drinking.Second, the government will invest $19.1 million to support innovative early intervention and diversion programs to get young people under the age of 18 back on track before more serious alcohol related problems emerge. These early intervention initiatives will involve a new emphasis on personal responsibility. They will target young people under the age of 18 who have been involved in an episode involving alcohol. The interventions supported could include requiring young people to participate in educational and/or diversionary activities and allowing police to confiscate alcohol or provide formal warnings. When young people involved in binge drinking present to hospitals or fall foul of the law, the personal responsibility approach needs to be triggered. The government will endeavour to have at least one pilot project operating in each state capital by the end of 2008. Pilots would require community buy-in from states and other local governments, community and health organisations and local police.Third, the government will invest $20 million in a targeted television, radio and internet based campaign to confront young people with the costs and consequences of binge drinking. This campaign will go through the appropriate approval processes of the new government to make sure that it is advertising not of a political nature but of a public health nature - a practice not engaged in by those who preceded us. Consistent with the government's election commitments, the public information campaign will be evidence based and non-political. I welcome the positive community reaction to these initiatives.Today I inform the House that, as a next step, I will very soon be forming a collaborative activity with the heads of sporting codes across Australia. This morning I spoke with Andrew Demetriou, from the AFL; Kate Palmer, from Netball Australia -  - When it comes to the next step, today I held discussions with the heads of the major sporting codes in Australia. I have spoken to Andrew Demetriou, from the Australian Football League; Kate Palmer, from Netball Australia; David Gallop, from the National Rugby League; John O'Neill, from the Australian Rugby Union; Ben Buckley, from Football Federation Australia; and James Sutherland, from Cricket Australia. I have convened a meeting this Friday to discuss with them how the government will work with peak sporting bodies across Australia to tackle together the challenge of binge drinking, which is affecting young people. I will be joined in those discussions by the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Sport. Millions of Australian kids play sport. We believe that, by engaging the peak sporting bodies in this fashion, we have a real opportunity to turn the corner on this problem which is confronting so many families and so many communities right across Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for the question. I know that the member for Chisholm, along with many others on this side of the House - and having listened to many of the first speeches by those opposite I must say they are also concerned - are worried about young people and the trends of binge drinking; we have watched it increase. The Prime Minister has already taken the House through the initiatives that were announced yesterday and I think it is important that we spend a little bit of extra time on the impact that binge drinking can have on young people. We are not just talking about young adults here. We are talking about children in some instances - people aged between 12Â and 17 - and reports that one in 10 in thisÂ age group are regularly binge drinking. Hundreds of thousands of children, adolescents and young adults are repeatedly causing damage to their own bodies and to their future health, as well as quite a lot of worry and cost within the community. - It is appropriate for the interjections to be raised about middle age drinking as well. If the member wants to wait until I complete my answer I will be able to deal with the questions that have been raised. We regard this as a very serious issue. We know that alcohol, tobacco and obesity are the three biggest risk factors for three of the biggest killers in the country, whether it be cancer, cardiovascular disease, car accidents or the increasing rate of diabetes. All of us in this House would do well to think about the way we might not only set good examples for young people but also encourage other interventions which will help tackle this serious problem within the community.We know that some of the immediate health effects can be loss of consciousness, fits and alcohol poisoning and we know of the much more common symptoms of diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. But many people are not aware of the long-term damage that can be caused to the small bowel, the central nervous system, the liver and the brain. This is a serious health problem. For some reason we have seen a massive increase in the number of young people who have taken on binge drinking as their form of entertainment. We all need to be involved in finding the solutions. Government can do a certain amount. The communities which are already actively engaged and the parents who fundamentally need to be involved in the way that we take on and handle this issue -  - Mr Speaker, it staggers me that members opposite would think that this is an opportunity for derision. This is a serious health risk for hundreds of thousands of young people in the seats of the shadow minister, the member for Hume and others. -  - Members opposite clearly are not aware that 72,000 hospitalisations occur every year as a direct result of overconsumption of alcohol. That does not take into account the presentations that result from the long-term effects of excessive consumption of alcohol. So let us understand how serious this problem is. The Rudd Labor government has committed to three initial steps which we believe will make a difference. We want to work with parents and community leaders to help bring about change. We are also going to work with the states and territories and will talk to them about the areas that they have responsibility for. Further, in the coming weeks we will announce our preventative healthcare task force which has been tasked with prioritising the excessive consumption of alcohol, tobacco and obesity. It will look at the long-term changes to our healthcare system to make sure that we are sending the message not just to our kids but to the whole community that this serious problem must be dealt with.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The December quarter national accounts released last week show that growth eased in the quarter but it still remains very solid. Growth was 0.6 per cent in the December quarter and it was 3.9 per cent over the year, and domestic demand continues to grow strongly. It is driven by strong growth in consumption. Domestic final demand rose by 1.6 per cent in the quarter to be 5.7 per cent higher for the year. Australia's net exports continue to weigh on growth, reflecting ongoing weakness in export volumes and strength in imports. This strong growth in imports is further evidence that domestic demand continues to outpace domestic supply, highlighting the importance of the government's supply-side policies.While domestic demand has been growing strongly, it has not been matched by increases in the economy's productive capacity. The national accounts show that productivity growth in the last year of the Howard-Costello government was zero. This reflects the pattern of long-term decline in Australia's productivity performance, with average productivity growth over the last five years lower than in any other equivalent period in the last 16 years. Precisely at this time, when Australia's productivity growth was declining, underlying inflationary pressures in the Australian economy were building. These figures paint a valuable portrait of the economic landscape that we inherited - an economy with strong demand but shackled by poor productivity growth and capacity constraints in the economy. These figures underscore the need to modernise the Australian economy and to lift our productivity -  - to lift the productive capacity of the Australian economy. - This is absolutely the case when there is international uncertainty in the wind, so the Rudd government is prepared to modernise the economy, to make the investments in skills and to provide the political leadership when it comes to infrastructure. We do acknowledge the challenges, but, sadly, those opposite do not acknowledge the challenges. The coalition has lost its way. On Sunday the Leader of the Opposition said that the economy was first rate. 
Opposition members - It is! - Is that right? Yesterday - three days later - the member for North Sydney said it was heading for recession. Of course, the member for Wentworth cannot agree with himself. He has been out there criticising others for talking down the economy, and this morning on Neil Mitchell's program he said a recession is a possibility. The member for Wentworth will say anything and do anything to get a headline because he has one job in mind - that is, the Leader of the Opposition's job - no policy to deal with inflation and no policy to do with productivity. This is a government that is facing up to the challenges. They are a divided rabble.</DOC>

 - I guarantee that carers will not be one dollar worse off as a consequence of the budget. Furthermore, it is time that we looked at the challenges of carers and pensioners long term, rather than a series of one-off payments made year after year after year by those opposite - and incorporated in so many of their statements leading up to the last election. We the government, by contrast, are examining ways in which we can place payments to carers and pensioners onto a more secure, long-term footing. But I repeat what I said before: carers do a fantastic job across the nation and, when it comes to this upcoming budget, they will not be one dollar worse off. In contrast to those who have preceded us, we are examining ways in which we can place payments to carers on a more secure, long-term footing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Everybody listening, and everyone in this House, knows that climate change is the greatest challenge that this and subsequent generations face, and most of the Australian community and most of us in this place are aware of the immensity of the challenge. I know for certain that members of Pacific island states - neighbours of ours - continuing to experience the prospect of rising sea levels are too. Fundamentally, this government understands that the basic point is that the cost of inaction on climate change is greater than the cost of action. That is the crucial point, and that is why we are taking action now, committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60 per cent by 2050 on 2000 levels, adopting market based instruments, including an emissions trading system, to be introduced by 2010, and mobilising the tremendous willingness of households and schools - and of the business community - who are all frustrated by a previous government, which viewed any action on climate change as an overreaction.If there is any doubt about the genuine concerns in the Australian community about the challenges of dangerous climate change, that doubt was put to rest last November. The electorate sent a very clear message that 11Â½ years of denial and delay on climate change should be brought to an end. In fact, I think the community realised then that the former government was actually light years behind the Australian public on the climate change challenge. I say 'light years' because, if we cast our minds back to last September - and it is not that long ago - we had backbenchers of the former government disputing the scientific basis for climate change. It is the case that it was the former members for Solomon and Lindsay and the current members for Tangney and Hughes who, incredibly, disputed the validity of the scientific consensus that human activities are contributing to global warming, citing evidence that:_ warming has also been observed on Mars, Jupiter, Triton, Pluto, Neptune and others.They were lost in space, light years behind the Australian community and the international community. As it was said at the time in this House, they were definitely on another planet. That was last September. One would have thought that times had moved on, that times had changed. In fact, they did, because a new government was elected and its first official act was to ratify the Kyoto protocol - and I note the comment made by the Leader of the Opposition that ratification is important.I was asked in this question about the barriers to practical action on climate change. We were reminded of one of the biggest barriers to practical action in a speech given last week by the former Prime Minister, when he said:Global warming has become a new battleground. The same intellectual bullying and moralising, used in other debates, now dominates what passes for serious dialogue on this issue.If we want to talk about serious barriers to action on climate change, it is the Liberal Party that for 11Â½ years dismissed a growing scientific consensus as 'alarmism', as 'moralising' and now, apparently, in this form of revisionism by the previous Prime Minister, as 'intellectual bullying'. This was the party that in government demonised former Vice President Al Gore. This was the government that refused to put the issue of climate change on the agenda for the South Pacific nations. And this is the former government that has a member who made an interesting contribution in the House just last month. I refer to the contribution by the member for Barker, who spoke on climate change in the parliament in 2008 and offered a scientific analysis from which he concluded:_ it follows that - climate change - cannot be attributed solely, or even partly, to human origin.Let me take this opportunity to refer the member and other members to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In 1995 it said:The balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.In 2001 it said:There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.There is more of this. Just last year it said:Most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.Is this intellectual bullying? Is it moralising? The fact is that there has been no greater barrier to serious action on climate change than the remarks and the thoughts -  - The member for Barker went on to advise that the most sensible approach to climate change would be 'to adapt'. The Australian community adapted. They took the most sensible approach to climate change - and that was to elect the Rudd Labor government, a government that would take climate change seriously.</DOC>

 - As I said the other day, there is no intention whatsoever on the part of the government to leave carers or pensioners in the lurch. The government that I lead takes seriously the concerns of working families, takes seriously the concerns of pensioners and takes seriously the concerns of carers. In my engagement with carers right across the country - hundreds and thousands of them, right across Australia - the work that they do is to be admired and supported by the community and supported by appropriate payments from the taxpayer. I confirm again, for the benefit of the honourable member, that carers, when it comes to bonuses, will not be a dollar worse off as a consequence of this budget and nor will pensioners.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question. Of course, as members of the House are aware, the government was elected on the basis of its policy Forward with Fairness, a new workplace relations system for the Australian nation. The bill before the House, the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008, is the first part of the government's plans to ensure that fair, flexible and balanced workplace relations system. It would, of course, end forever the ability of anyone in this country to make an Australian workplace agreement, and we know that Australian workplace agreements have hurt Australian working families by taking away hard-earned pay and conditions. This matter is not only before the House but before a Senate inquiry due to report on 17 March. It is the government's intention, when that Senate inquiry reports, to have the bill dealt with by both houses of parliament prior to the House rising before Easter. This will enable the bill to be proclaimed into law shortly after Easter and to deliver on one of the government's important election commitments, to end the making of Australian workplace agreements.The Australian people voted for this at the last election. They know what they want. The Australian government - the Rudd Labor government - knows where it stands. We stand behind our policy, Forward with Fairness. Unfortunately, the opposition have been unable to articulate a coherent position on Labor's bill, and I am concerned that their dithering and vacillation will mean that there is a delay in dealing with this bill before the parliament.Mr Speaker, can I direct your and the House's attention to an article by Steve Lewis published on 23 February. In that article, Mr Lewis reported that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that, when it came to defending Australian workplace agreements, her colleagues the member for North Sydney and the member for Warringah 'went to water'. Having read that article, I thought that clearly the Deputy Leader of the Opposition stood firmly behind AWAs and firmly behind Work Choices. One would have to give her points for bravery. A bit like the Black Knight in Monty Python, she was going to fight on - that election loss was 'just a flesh wound'. She was going to defend Work Choices. Then, last week, this belief that the opposition stood behind Work Choices and AWAs was further reinforced when the former Prime Minister gave a speech in the United States defending Work Choices and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition described it as an excellent speech. One could only conclude from that statement that they were going to fight on in defence of AWAs and in defence of Work Choices. - I am addressing the matter of timing because of course the timing is contingent on the bill going through the parliament. Whether or not quick passage of this bill is going to be facilitated depends in part on the position of the opposition. It is a material fact to the question of timing.Then we got a different position from the opposition - hence the confusion and hence the risk to timing - on the weekend, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition appeared on national television and said that the opposition did not support but did not oppose the government's bill. Is this a riddle that we are supposed to puzzle out? What is the meaning of this nonsense? By the standard of these contributions, the next thing that we will hear from the opposition - and I am surprised that we did not hear it today on climate change - is them wandering out telling age-old riddles like, 'If a tree falls down in a forest and no-one's there does it make a sound?' That will be the next quality contribution. - On the question of timing, what we are seeking is a straightforward answer from the opposition to a very simple question. It is not a trick question. It is not a hard question. It is a simple question. The question is: if a division on Labor's bill is caused to be held -  -  - in either house of parliament will the opposition vote for the bill, against the bill or will they try to hide in the corner hoping that no-one notices that they are still supporters of Work Choices? That is a key question on the timing of the bill. It is a question the Australian people, who voted for fairness and certainty in workplaces, are entitled to an answer to.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member's question - from the new party of compassion opposite: given the longstanding commitment that they have to bonuses for carers and pensioners, it is pretty interesting when you look at the actual forward estimates produced in the last budget. Where do you see any commitment on the part of the previous government to the payment of this one-off bonus? Next year? The year after? The one after that? In fact, it is missing in action; it is not there. If you go to the fine print of the previous government's position on this, it was, 'We don't rule these one-off payments out for the future, subject to economic circumstances.' Such is the depth of the continued commitment of compassion on the part of those opposite. I return to what I said before: when it comes to bonus payments to carers and pensioners, they will not be a dollar worse off as a consequence of the upcoming budget.</DOC>

 - I am asked about the government's election commitment so far as troop withdrawal from Iraq is concerned and the community support for that. Members would of course be aware of the government's election commitment to withdraw the combat forces, the combat troops, from Iraq - the so-called Overwatch Battle Group - and to do that by the middle of this year. Members will also recall the fierce criticism that that election commitment was subject to by the then government, by the Liberal Party and by the Leader of the Opposition, who was then Minister for Defence. There was a stark contrast between the approach of the Labor Party to withdraw troops and the approach of the Liberal and National parties, who said that this would be a disaster of mammoth proportions, that this would split the alliance. I am pleased to advise that the government is implementing this election commitment, in consultation with the United States and the United Kingdom, and that implementation is on course and going very smoothly.The Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence raised this matter when they visited Iraq in December of last year. I raised this issue and spoke to the Secretary of State and other officials when I was in the United States in January, and recently the Minister for Defence and I, when we hosted the AUSMIN conference here, discussed the matter further with the United States. Our approach to withdraw at the end of the current rotation with minimum disruption has been welcomed by the United States.I am asked about community support. There is widespread community support for the implementation of the government's election commitment in this respect. It is so widespread it is spreading to areas previously unthought of. Despite his trenchant criticism of the government's election commitment, recently the Leader of the Opposition said:... our position is that the combat troops would actually be withdrawn at the end of June also ...One policy before the election; a different policy after. One position before the election; a different position after. We know that the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Opposition have lost their way. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has lost his way. But there is one area where the widespread community support for the government's election commitment has not spread: John Winston Howard. In a speech recently in the United States, he said, 'The implementation of the government's election commitment was disappointing and could lead to a tragedy.' Despite the fact that overwhelming and widespread community support has not spread to John Winston Howard, the government will persist, the government will continue. The government will not be deterred from implementing its election commitment. The government will stay the course in the implementation of its election commitment to withdraw troops from Iraq. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, unlike the Liberal Party, there will be no cutting and running from the previous position - as there was cutting and running by the previous Prime Minister, John Winston Howard.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member's question, I would say to Mr and Mrs Stafford that when it comes to the upcoming budget they will not be a dollar worse off when it comes to their bonus payments - and that is our guarantee. The reason it is our guarantee is that these are among the most vulnerable Australians and, therefore, they need to have an assurance from the government and from the parliament that their payments are in order. It is not exactly the assurance that they had from the previous government in its election commitments on this matter. The previous government's policy, contained in the 'Coalition government policy: Election 2007', on this very question says:If re-elected, the coalition will consider continuing to pay these bonuses -  -  - wait for it: comma - depending on the economic circumstances at the time.I take it that that equals a rock solid commitment from those opposite! Carers have from this government a guarantee that, when it comes to their bonuses, they will not be a dollar worse off. I stand by that commitment, and this underlines the hypocrisy of those who sit opposite.</DOC>

 - Shortly before question time today I was advised of a certification error by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service which may have a significant impact on the beef industry in New Caledonia. AQIS has advised that, under the previous government, on 23 November last year cattle were exported to New Caledonia from Australia that were vaccinated against the disease babesiosis instead of being treated with a chemical treatment, as required by New Caledonia's import requirements. Animals vaccinated against babesiosis can be a source of infection to ticks. I am advised that the export of vaccinated cattle to New Caledonia has allowed the disease to enter their tick population and has caused a disease outbreak in their local cattle.While information on this issue is still coming to hand, it seems clear first of all that there was a certification error by AQIS and that, as a result of that error, there may be a significant impact on the beef industry in New Caledonia. On hearing this information prior to question time I immediately held a telephone conference with the secretary of my department, who is also the Director of Quarantine, and I am urgently seeking more information, including what assistance measures can be provided to New Caledonia. I hope to meet with their ambassador later today. I understand that AQIS is seeking expert advice from the Queensland Tick Fever Centre on ways to manage the exported cattle and cattle which have been in contact with the exported animals in New Caledonia.Preliminary advice is that treating all the cattle - those exported from Australia and the New Caledonian cattle in contact with them - by injecting them with the chemical Imazol would kill the organism in the cattle and prevent further transmission of the disease to ticks. I understand that AQIS is also seeking advice on how to ensure that the disease is eradicated from the New Caledonian tick population. I also took the opportunity during the last hour to speak with Russell Bock from the Queensland Tick Fever Centre. He has confirmed that the centre is willing to assist the New Caledonian authorities in whatever way it can to help them deal with the outbreak, including with serological testing. Russell Bock told me that in order for them to be able to receive the samples they will require cooperation from AQIS. I have received an email in the last couple of minutes from the Director of Quarantine and the secretary of my department confirming that AQIS will expedite the import permits for samples from New Caledonia to be sent to Australia for serological analysis by the Queensland Tick Fever Centre. Members will already be aware that I announced a review into Australia's -  - This is important information about a major impact on the beef industry in New Caledonia. Members will be aware that I previously announced a review by Mr Roger Beale AO into Australia's quarantine services. It is critically important both for the protection of biosecurity in Australia and for our neighbouring countries to which we provide a service under agreed protocols that our quarantine and biosecurity services are robust. This review will help inform that process. We are also making sure that we meet all our obligations with respect to the government of New Caledonia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As we have seen over recent months, there is increasing global uncertainty in financial markets. This highlights the importance of responsible economic policies and prudent management of public finances. Last night the United States Federal Reserve, acting in coordination with other central banks, announced initiatives to improve liquidity in credit markets. The Federal Reserve has initiated a new term-securities-lending facility which will provide up to $200 billion in additional funds to credit markets. The funds will be accessible by primary dealers, including major investment banks, which will be able to use a wide range of securities as collateral. That will help financial institutions manage their activities by trading relatively illiquid assets they currently hold for more-liquid assets. The extra liquidity will work in conjunction with low interest rates to assist financial markets in dealing with current challenges. The Federal Reserve's action is a recognition that global credit market conditions are very tight. Since the onset of the subprime crisis, major banking institutions have announced around US$125 billion of subprime related write-downs, and capital positions are stretched by the need to take on a further US$120 billion of assets previously held in off-balance-sheet vehicles.While Australia's economy and our financial sector remain strong, the events of recent months demonstrate we are not immune from the influence and turbulence of global markets. But the government is also in close contact, through the Treasury, with our regulators, businesses and the Reserve Bank. Australia's economic fundamentals are sound and our regulatory arrangements are the best of any in the world. However, we in Australia remain alert to the impact of global credit market conditions on the Australian economy. Credit spreads remain at elevated levels. The tightening of credit is being felt in our corporate sector through higher costs of borrowing, tighter lending standards and reduced access to credit. It is also being felt by working families with the higher mortgages which are currently offered by banks and the rates which mortgage holders have to pay.Developments in the global economy combined with significant inflationary pressures in the domestic economy reinforce that this is the time for responsible economic policy, prudent fiscal management and prudent management of the outlays of government. The inflation challenge that we face is not something that has emerged overnight; it has been building for some time. Inflation is now running at a 16-year high and interest rates are the second highest in the developed world. Working families have now had to suffer 12 interest rate rises in a row. The combination of these domestic inflation and interest rate pressures and uncertainty arising from global financial markets is also reflected in today's consumer sentiment survey, which has recorded a fall of 9.1 per cent in March to its lowest level since September 1993.The government remains committed to its policies of responsible economic management, remaining mindful of developments in international financial markets, reining in unnecessary government spending and investing in long-term productive capacity. The government remains committed to building a modern Australia and national economy in these difficult times ahead both in terms of the pressures which come from the global economy and the inflation challenges at home.</DOC>

 - Working families right across Australia are under financial pressure. We have seen so many challenges which working families have had to face in recent times, including the highest interest rates - the second highest in the developed world - and inflation now running at a 16-year high. These, of course, impact on the circumstances of working families. Their ability to manage the family budget is impacted on by all of these considerations, including petrol, groceries, child care and health insurance premiums. There have been 12 interest rate rises in a row since 2002, and we have had seven interest rate rises since Work Choices was introduced two years ago. All of these have placed real pressures on working families.The Australian Fair Pay Commission will be reviewing applications for increases to the minimum wage over the coming weeks ahead of their pay decision in July. I note that there are reports in today's papers relating to the ACTU's claim for an adjustment in minimum wages. The government will be asking the Fair Pay Commission for a fair and reasonable outcome. We want an outcome that takes into account the cost of living pressures on working families and we want an outcome that takes into account the need for restraint in the economy because of current inflationary pressures - inflationary pressures which we have inherited from our predecessors. Inflation is the enemy of working families, and it is critical that we reduce those inflationary pressures.It is in that context that today I again call on Australia's business leaders to show some restraint when it comes to their salaries at the top end of remuneration. I do not want to see a situation where we end up with two Australias: one part of the country enjoying boom time conditions while the rest of the country takes the pain of tougher financial circumstances.The financial pressures on Australia's working families have been made worse by the policies of those who preceded us. The threat of rising inflation did not arise overnight; it has been rising for some years. In fact, there were 20 consecutive warnings by the Reserve Bank in previous times, each of which was ignored by the previous government when it came to dealing with capacity constraints in the economy, particularly when it comes to skills and infrastructure. But, if you look at their most recent record in government, Work Choices has in fact savaged the ability of working families to manage with decent wages and to balance the family budget. AWAs ended up slashing the wages of many Australians. Remember that the member for North Sydney said:When I took over the job I don't think many ministers in cabinet were aware that you could be worse off under Work Choices and that you could actually have certain conditions taken away without compensation.Well, hold the phone. I would have thought that the former minister, as a member of the government and the cabinet at the time, would have looked carefully at what the bill that he introduced as law actually contained. You only need to look at the facts. According to the ABS, workers on AWAs work more and earn less per hour than those in the same jobs who have been employed on collective agreements. Then there is the impact of Work Choices on women. Women on AWAs earn less per hour than those on collective agreements. ABS data shows that Australian women on AWAs who work full time earn $2.30 less per hour on average, or $87.40 less per week based on a standard 38-hour week, than those on collective agreements.We have before us now the Liberal Party with its newfound tradition of compassion. This is the same Liberal Party which should reflect on the impact of its legislation, namely Work Choices, on working families. If the Liberal Party want now to become the party of compassion, they should stop trying to slow down the passage of the government's workplace relations transition bill so that all Australians can be protected from AWAs. But still they cannot help themselves. We had the Leader of the Opposition making this statement on Meet the Press last Sunday:_ it's not that we are supporting Labor's changes - we are not opposing them.Let me repeat that in terms of a crystal clear position of absolute policy clarity on the part of the loyal opposition:_ it's not that we are supporting Labor's changes - we are not opposing them.This was clearly intended as a clever piece of coordinated confusion between himself and the deputy leader, who on Insiders a few moments later had this exchange with Barry Cassidy. Barry Cassidy asked: 'But you are supporting the abolition of Work Choices?' The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said: 'No, we are not opposing it.' Here we have the party opposite putting itself forward as the alternative government of Australia, an alternative government of Australia which says it has this newly discovered tradition of compassion alive in its every being. Here is the first task of compassion: let the bill go through the parliament - let it go through the Senate - so that working families can be protected from your AWAs. - Yes. - Yes.</DOC>

 - It did not take until the third question for compassion on the part of those opposite to expire. Our position is that working families deserve a decent outcome, a fair and balanced outcome, from this upcoming case. The government's position in response to the case has yet to be determined. When it is, the country will know about it.</DOC>

 - Can I echo the words of the Prime Minister in answer to the earlier question from the member for Bendigo. Of course working families rely on decent minimum wages. They also rely on a decent safety net at work; that is, a safety net that cannot be stripped away from them. Today I am in a position to outline some further information about the way in which working Australian families had the safety net ripped away from them by the Liberal Party in government, the party of Work Choices.I want to put these statistics in context. It is very difficult to get statistics about the impact of Australian workplace agreements on Australian working families, and that is because the former government - the Liberal government, the party of Work Choices - knew that Australian workplace agreements were hurting working families and they deliberately wanted to cover that information up. They therefore went through no systematic analysis of what was happening with Australian workplace agreements. They kept them in the black box. They did not want them looked at. They did not want them scrutinised. The amount of information that has been in the public domain has been limited. There was some at Senate estimates. There was some that leaked. There was the ABS data that the Prime Minister referred to in the House earlier today.Of course, there were two systems that the former government operated in relation to Australian workplace agreements. The original Work Choices system meant an Australian workplace agreement was valid provided that it passed just five minimum conditions. Then last year, under acute political pressure, the then government in the lead-up to the election lurched for a so-called fairness test. Beyond that point, Australian workplace agreements were only valid if they were assessed against a set of protected award conditions. In order to understand the statistics that I am about to give to the House, people need to understand that transition point. This is an analysis of agreements that were filed in the two months from May last year. - These are new statistics. What we need to understand about these statistics is that, in that time period, employers may have been broadly aware that there were some changes to the workplace relations system, because the government had had a press conference and had bought some advertising. We can assume that in that period when they could get no hard information about the operation of the fairness test, because no hard information was available, employers were continuing to file with the Workplace Authority the kinds of workplace agreements they had been filing prior to that time. What do we find when we look at those Australian workplace agreements? 
An opposition member - They've all got jobs! - They've all got jobs - the party of Work Choices speaks! Thank you very much. That is a big tick for Work Choices from the Liberal Party backbench. The party of Work Choices is once again revealed as the party of Work Choices, using exactly the same arguments it used in the lead-up to the last election. But looking at this sample of 670 Australian workplace agreements filed in this period, which were assessed against the protected award conditions and would have been examples of the kinds of agreements that used to be filed prior to the fairness test, what do we find? These statistics are truly startling. Approximately 45 per cent of these AWAs provided between $1 and $49 per week below the required rate of pay for the protected award conditions - that is, they ripped people off for between zero and 50 bucks a week. That was approximately 45 per cent of them. When we go further, we find that approximately 50 per cent provided from $50 to $199 per week below the required rate of pay - 50 per cent provided less than people should have got by a margin of $50 to $199 dollars. Approximately five per cent provided $200 to $499 per week below the required rate of pay, ripping people off by that amount week after week. Approximately 0.5 per cent - half a per cent - provided more than $500 per week below the required rate of pay.In the last few days, we have heard a lot in this House from the Liberal Party about so-called compassion. I would ask Liberal Party members in this House to look at these new statistics which would be indicative of the kind of Australian workplace agreements which were filed under the previous government. -  - They were perfectly legal under those laws and are indicative of the kinds of agreements that used to pass their Australian workplace agreements test, ripping working families off for $100, $200, $300, $400 or $500 a week. I would ask members opposite to consider what they have done to working families and to try and square that with their new-found rhetoric about compassion. This is laughable hypocrisy from a party that not only authorised the rip-off of working families but delighted in it - and they continue to do so.</DOC>

 - I am always taken by a tactic employed by those opposite when they cannot get off the railway tracks; that is, we will have a series of questions on carer bonuses and pensioner bonuses and, when they get the answers they would prefer not to get, they will just keep sailing on over the cliff. As I said before, when it comes to the question of bonuses for carers and pensioners, they will not be a single dollar worse off. It will be a one-off payment within the financial year, as I have indicated before. As a consequence of that, you have a set of assurances to the country at large and to the parliament which were never in the life of this parliament provided by those opposite when it came to the provision of bonuses to carers and pensioners - not once!I go back again to the sterling policy pronouncement by those opposite. The party of compassion was so definitively committed to ensuring that carers and pensioners had absolute certainty going into the election in November last year that, if they elected a coalition government, they would definitely get their payments. Here is what the coalition had to say to them:If re-elected the Coalition will consider continuing to pay these bonuses, depending on the economic circumstances at the time.In terms of the construction of weasel words, this actually deserves the Nobel prize. You have escape clauses writ large from the beginning of that sentence to the end. That is what carers and pensioners went to the last election with by way of assurance from those opposite. What they have from the government as an assurance going into the next budget is precisely that bonuses for carers and pensioners will not result in them being a dollar worse off. They will be paid within the financial year. They will be a one-off bonus. I would suggest that you consider carefully how much longer you are going to continue on this particular set of railway tracks.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. This nation does face a skills crisis which is adding to inflationary pressures. We have been warned about it, and the former government was warned about it by the RBA on 20 occasions. I know that in this place there are members opposite who simply do not understand the dimensions of this crisis. I refer them to the words of Suncorp Chairman and Tabcorp Director, John Story, who is also the Chairman of the Australian Institute of Company Directors, who delivered this damning assessment of the former government's approach to skills shortages:We should have been addressing infrastructure issues. We should have been addressing skills shortages five years ago. I mean, we talked about it. These issues were discussed around board tables like this for the past 10 years, and the chickens are coming home to roost and there is no short-term fix.That is a message from business about the dimension of skill shortages. Whilst business is delivering this message, members opposite live in denial. We have had the shadow minister for training saying that skills shortages were 'just a matter of where we are in the business cycle' - a denial that there is even a skills crisis. And the shadow Treasurer has been quoted as saying:The truth is ... Australia does not have a chronic skills shortage ...This is the opposition in denial about their legacy and in denial about a contemporary problem facing the Australian community and its economy. Today's Grant Thornton survey shows that 58 per cent of the businesses surveyed identified skill shortages as the biggest constraint to their growth. Whilst the former minister for vocational education and training may not have done much about it, at least he was prepared to acknowledge that there was a skills crisis when he said:We have got a problem with skills shortage. I mean, we knew it was coming, but it has arrived with force and, you know, it is only going to get worse.How were these skill shortages created? If we look at where the former government put investment in skills development, we see some remarkable things. We saw $3 million invested in the provision of training and qualifications in nail technology. Mr Speaker, you might well think to yourself: 'That's good. Hammering nails into wood, building things - skill shortages in the construction industry - $3 million into skills training for nail technology.' You might be thinking that that is a good thing. It is not those sorts of nails that we are talking about. We are talking about fingernails. We are talking about $3 million being invested in skills training so that people can have manicures - a file and paint, a set of acrylics. That is what the former government invested in: $3 million in nail technology. - Really, Prime Minister. I accept that the Leader of the Opposition is a man of the world and he probably understands the merit of a manicure. He probably particularly understands the merit of a manicure in a party room that is beset by claws that are unsheathed and out. But I would ask the Leader of the Opposition and those that sit on the opposition front benches: when in government, how did they come to the conclusion that with skill shortages besetting the Australian economy the most important thing we needed was 1,232 more Australians qualified to provide manicures and 700 more Australians qualified to apply make-up and cosmetics - a total cost of $3 million for the manicures and $1.5 million for the make-up and cosmetics? This was their investment in training.Whilst the mining sector and the construction sector were calling out for skilled workers, you might not have been able to get a house built but you could always go down to the beauty parlour and make yourself feel better about it. That was their contribution to training in this nation - hardly meeting the needs of working families, who need the real skill shortages in this economy fixed. - I am not denigrating the occupations of providing manicures and providing make-up services - but I am suggesting that Australia's skills shortages are in areas where the former government did not invest. Part of Labor's strategy is to broaden and deepen our investment so that we can meet the skills shortages in the economy. We will be addressing that with our 450,000 training places. We will be addressing that with skills investment at certificate III level and beyond. We will be addressing that with urgent investment in skills shortage areas. The former government neglected the skills crisis; the present opposition does not even realise it exists. We will be investing to fix it, to make sure that working Australians can upgrade their skills and unemployed Australians can get access to training, and to make sure we take inflationary pressures out of this economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Of course they will, consistent with my previous answer. I really think that, when the Leader of the Opposition asks questions in this place, he should do so accurately. The question which was put to the Leader of the House in the interview - I have the transcript here - says: 'The commitment is that the $1,600 carers allowance and the $500 pensioners bonus will be paid as cash this financial year' - that is where you stopped. The actual question goes on to say 'and for how many years ahead?' to which Albo responds, 'That's not the commitment.' Then he goes on to say, 'That any carers and seniors payment -  - Three or four lines later, the member for Grayndler, the minister for infrastructure and Leader of the House says, 'I've given you the commitment, Steve, which is that, when it comes to the carers and seniors bonus payment, carers and seniors won't be a dollar worse off and, secondly, that any carers and seniors payment the government makes this year will be paid up-front.' They are the commitments that there are. That is quite clear-cut. If the Leader of the Opposition is going to stand at the dispatch box and misrepresent a transcript when putting a question to the parliament, frankly, I think he should hang his head in shame. When it comes to the certainty which is required by carers and pensioners with their bonus payments, we will make sure that those carers and pensioners will not be a single dollar worse off and, beyond that, that that payment will be made in a lump sum within the financial year.What I find remarkable about this entire exchange is that the newborn party of compassion, which lodged its birth notice last Friday, registered its death notice with its earlier remarks, when the member for Wentworth said that working families do not deserve a decent outcome when it comes to the minimum wage. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. What this government is doing is modernising our economy. What this government is going to do is invest in the drivers of productivity - because, the higher our productivity, the faster our economy can grow and the lower will be the inflation we receive. But that is not understood by those opposite, because they never invested in the drivers of productivity. What we have seen in recent times is that average -  -  - Over the last five years, average annual productivity growth has been lower than at any other time in the last 16 years. We learnt from the national accounts last week that in the last year it was zero. Of course, strong productivity growth is the key to wealth creation and to job creation. Precisely at the time that productivity growth was declining, inflation was going up. So improving productivity is the key to job creation in this economy. Also, because of that, we have put in place our investment in skills, our investment in deepening the skill base of the workforce - 450,000 new training places - and, of course, when it comes to infrastructure, political leadership. We know the previous government had no concern for investment in this area, and the result was the highest underlying inflation rate in 16 years.An extraordinary thing happened today: the member for Wentworth went out and said that he was going to mount a vigorous argument. Do you know what the vigorous argument was? It was against having a plan to fight inflation. Can you believe that? More disturbing still, the member for Wentworth said that there was no such thing as a skills crisis in Australia. What planet is the member for Wentworth from? You cannot go out and talk to a business in this country without finding them talking about skills shortages, and that is the problem.The member for Wentworth will say anything and do anything, but he does not have a plan to fight inflation. He has a plan to take the Leader of the Opposition's job but no plan to fight inflation, and that is risky for this country. We need a government to put policies in place which will fight inflation and create jobs for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. He has taken an active interest in issues of health and ageing on both sides of House, and I am sure that he will be very interested in the fact that our Health and Hospitals Reform Commission had its first meeting today. I attended that meeting this morning and met with not all 10 of the top-quality people who we have appointed to provide us with high-level advice on how to create a modern health system for a modern Australia.The National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, as people would know, was appointed two weeks ago by the Prime Minister and has responsibility for developing a long-term health reform plan for the country. We on this side of the House know that a long-term reform plan is needed. Of course, those on the other side of the House spent 11 years denying that there was any required reform in our health system. In fact, the previous Minister for Health and Ageing used to proudly declare himself to be anti reform, while a whole range of issues bubbled along in the health sector with no attention being given to them. There was the ripping of money out of the hospital system, allowing preventable hospital admissions to grow and 60 per cent of the country being affected by areas of health workforce shortage - something both the Leader of the Opposition and the former minister for health have acknowledged was the responsibility of early decisions of the Howard government. There was also a nursing shortage, and we are facing a whole range of other demographic changes which will affect the burden on our health system.So, at the first meeting today of the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission, part of the agenda was to further the work on performance reporting that this government has committed to. This was a Rudd Labor election promise and it is being delivered by a Rudd Labor government. Today the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission is meeting with the Institute of Health and Welfare, private hospitals, insurers and the states and territories to further this national reporting, which will apply to all hospitals across all states, across both sectors, and will involve reporting by the Commonwealth as well. This reflects the dual-tack approach that we are taking to health: both immediate reforms that are needed to our system now - elective surgery funding and getting nurses back into our hospitals and aged care facilities - and planning for the long term.I am very pleased that, in stark contrast to the previous government's anti-reform approach, the appointment of the Health and Hospitals Reform Commission was welcomed by the Leader of the Opposition. I am very pleased that he was able to support that initiative. I am concerned, however, that at the same time the Leader of the Opposition has called for a rural doctor to be added to the commission. We of course are very concerned about the health needs of the rural community, but I trust that the Leader of the Opposition is not letting his past medical background blur his vision as a leader. One of the appointees to the commission is a rural area health nurse. I trust that the Leader of the Opposition is not suggesting that a rural area health nurse would not know anything about rural health. I know there are a lot of issues on the other side between the National Party and the Liberal Party, and I know that the members of the National Party understand how important rural nurses are. I hope that this is not an attack on the very experienced person who has been appointed, Sabina Knight. She is an experienced nurse and a teacher, based in Alice Springs. I would hope that the Leader of the Opposition will clarify that he does not think that a rural area health nurse is not able to represent the views of rural communities. - It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition is so determined to have a say on who we put on our health reform commission, when his government was refusing to be involved in any sort of health reform for 11 years. Now he wants a say on who the people should be. I actually do not think the Leader of the Opposition has any idea of what is going on anymore - he is confused about whether he supports it or whether he does not. To deliver on these significant changes to our health system requires leadership. It requires vision. That is leadership and vision that have been provided by this government, and it is going to deliver long-term reforms for a modern health system for a modern Australia.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to receive a question from the member for North Sydney, a member of the party which axed the Commonwealth dental scheme. I find it remarkable that he would have the audacity to stand at the dispatch box and ask any question about dental health whatsoever. Literally hundreds of thousands of Australians out there -  - were without any access to effective public dental care over years and years and years, going back to the cruel decision in 1996 to axe that program, leaving so many people in the lurch. Frankly, it is breathtaking that the Liberal Party could put forward a question on this.We have committed ourselves to re-establishing the Commonwealth dental program. We have committed ourselves to establishing a new teen dental program, which will assist teenagers to obtain a $150 subsidy effectively each year to assist them with getting a proper dental check each year. Why? Because dental health is fundamental to total health - something which those opposite when they were in government seemed not to grasp.When it comes to the overall structure of our dental programs, we take the needs of working families seriously. That is why we have restructured programs we inherited from the previous government which, on balance, were not being effective, and have introduced instead a series of additional health programs targeted at working families, targeted at those who need public dental care and targeted at those who need teen dental care. We stand by the commitments we made before the election and will honour each one in full.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. It is a very important question, because it goes to the crisis that besets this nation. Of course, that is the skills crisis, a crisis that the opposition seems to ignore - indeed, to deny. The yet to be released paper from the National Centre for Vocational Education Research states: 'Unemployed people are being recycled from welfare to work and back to welfare.' It also refers to the courses that are undertaken by job seekers who are seeking to get back into the workforce as 'mickey mouse courses'. I take these concerns very seriously. I look forward to the final report being released.This report confirms what this government already knows - that is, that the former government's short-sighted policies have contributed to one of the greatest skills shortages our nation has ever faced. The previous government, as has been said by the Deputy Prime Minister and indeed by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, ignored 20 separate warnings from the Reserve Bank. They also ignored the views of the Business Council of Australia. They were willing to take the money of the Business Council of Australia; they should have taken their advice and ensured that the skills crisis in this country was attended to, but they failed to do that. They also failed to take account of not only that employer body but other employer bodies and other parties who time and time again reminded the previous government of the concerns that were being experienced in many industries and by many employers. Last month, the Age's economics editor quite rightly said: 'The Howard government dropped the ball on skills training.'Unfortunately - and it is unfortunate - the evidence of skills shortages is everywhere. The MODL list - that is, the Migration Occupations in Demand List - indicated, in 1999, 18 occupations where there was a shortage. That has blown out, from 1999 to 2007, to 95 occupations that are now in demand. That is a 400 per cent increase in the demand for particular occupations. It underlines the point that the previous government failed to attend to this particular issue.For almost 12 years, the opposite side squandered opportunities. Under the former government, referrals from the Job Network to apprenticeships and traineeships fell dramatically. For example, in 1998 there were 32,000 apprenticeships commenced as a result of Job Network placements. By 2005, they had dropped to 7,000 - that is, apprenticeships under Job Network placements dropped from 32,000 to 7,000. Yet those opposite, including the shadow Treasurer, remain in denial that there is a problem. Indeed, recent media reports have indicated that the shadow Treasurer does not believe that there is a skills crisis in this country and does not believe there are chronic shortages in skills, and I am here to tell him that he is wrong. The shadow Treasurer is wrong and the opposition are wrong if they think that this is not a major problem for this country. It does not surprise me that the shadow Treasurer does not think that there is a skills crisis. The only skill crisis he is concerned about is with the Leader of the Opposition. The only skills crisis he is concerned about is the failure of the Leader of the Opposition to articulate a response. - We know we need to change the employment programs to provide job seekers in this country with appropriate skills. We know we have to change the programs so we can attend to those skills. We have received 250 submissions. That review is being undertaken because we need to change the way in which we seek to assist jobseekers. The problem with the current programs, without prejudicing the review, is they did not attend to the changing demographic of those people not in work. By that I mean those people who were confronting non-vocational and vocational problems were not being addressed by the programs and we will seek to fix that. We know that the previous government failed. The Rudd government will not fail in this regard. We have made a commitment to ensure that there will be 450,000 VET places over the course of the next four years - 175,000 of which will be for those people who are seeking to find work or are marginally attached to the workforce, 20,000 of which will be available from April. There is no doubt in the government's mind that this is a critical matter, a matter that was ignored by the previous government, but the Rudd government are building a modern economy that is confronting the challenges of the 21st century. The opposition on the other hand is stuck in the past, not knowing where it stands on any particular area of public policy.</DOC>

 - Once again we have evidence of the party of compassion! The party of Work Choices are trying to flap back into life again with a bit of compassion. They had 12 years in office, and what did the previous government do when it came to dental care? If you travel around the shopping centres of Australia, as I and members of the front bench did so much in the course of last year, and talk to people -  - The party of newfound compassion, the party of Work Choices, has not discovered one core fact: right across Australia people are crying out for proper attention from public dental care. That is why we committed ourselves explicitly before the election to fund the re-establishment of the Commonwealth dental health care program. That will cost us a considerable amount of money, $290 million, which is estimated to help 650,000 people currently on waiting lists. You would know this if you had bothered to speak to some of those people on waiting lists and to examine carefully the degree of pain and discomfort they found themselves in from these dental conditions, which have lasted for years without attention. The attitude of those opposite was simply to walk away, to say, 'It's not my problem,' and to blame the states. That is not the attitude of this government. This government stands by working families who need that sort of assistance and, particularly, by those who need assistance from the Commonwealth dental health care program.Beyond that, we also committed ourselves to what we would do with teen dentals. Teen dental care is critical. I notice that the member for North Sydney sneers at this. When it comes to preventative dental care and ensuring that our young people are merged into the workforce with the best state of physical health possible, dental health care is absolutely critical. Time and time again working families under financial pressure asked us, 'What can you to do to help us with our kids' basic dental treatment?' Our response is to provide $150 towards an annual preventative check for teenagers aged between 12 and 17 in families receiving family tax benefit part A. Around one million teenagers will be eligible for these dental services. This is extraordinary. If you obtain a check like that, with proper scaling and cleaning, it does a huge amount in terms of reducing the impact of future dental health problems. On top of that, payments will be made by Medicare Australia through a new dental benefits schedule. The entire premise of the member for North Sydney's question collapses at that point - not to mention the rest of the argument the opposition have put forward, which is that they are somehow the party of compassion, born with a sudden application of defibrillators last sitting Friday. It lasted until Monday, when the shadow Treasurer stood up and said to working families that they do not deserve a decent outcome from the national wage case. And now, again, the party which abolished within their first year in office the Commonwealth dental health care program are standing up and pretending to Australian families that they are serious about it. Well, frankly, nobody believes you.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. Few people in this place could match his expertise or longstanding interest in defence matters. I was very pleased to learn that, I think, only today the member for Brisbane was elected Chair of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. There could be no better choice, and I know he will do fantastic work in that new role.Last week the government made what might be one of the toughest decisions it will take over the course of this parliament. The National Security Committee of Cabinet had to decide whether to continue to throw money at a project not likely to ever succeed or to bite the bullet and scrap the former government's infamous Seasprite helicopter project. Unfortunately and tragically, on this occasion biting the bullet means flushing $1.36 billion of taxpayers' money down the drain. That is a lot of money in anybody's language. But the decision was not just about money, as important as that is. It was also about the safety of those in uniform who fly our aircraft. The new government wants to make sure that future capability meets the highest possible standards in the 21st century.The Seasprite helicopter project is already seven years late. Think about this: if the government wanted to do what the former government was doing - take another gamble, take another punt - the capability may be brought on-stream in the not-too-distant future. The reality is that it would have been another three years before that capability was delivered. That means that in total the project would have been 10 years late. I said during a press conference last week that that would be like taking a 2008 Commodore to the 2018 Bathurst 1000. Given that we do not know where vehicle technology is going or how fast it is moving, maybe the better analogy would have been taking a 1998 Commodore to the 2018 Bathurst race. The government is determined to bring sound economic management to defence procurement to ensure that the Australian Defence Force gets the capability it needs to do its job efficiently, effectively and in as safe a manner as is possible and that taxpayers get value for money. The Seasprite helicopter project is probably one of the worst projects that we inherited from the former Labor government. -  - The former government! -  - Yeah, yeah: big point! I will wear the faux pas. -  - I hear the interjections. Can I just remind the House that the Seasprite helicopter project - the Leader of the Opposition is agreeing it was the worst - was a project that was signed by the Howard government in 1997. It is true that the Keating government had an idea of placing a new helicopter on what was to be the offshore patrol combatant, a project in partnership with the Malaysian government which never transpired. When the Howard government were elected, and the combatant project was scrapped, they decided they would buy it anyway. They went to tender, chose the contractor - Kaman - and proceeded with the contract, which was signed in 1997. It was very much the project of those who sit opposite.But I was trying to say that, while the Leader of the Opposition agrees it is the worst project, it is just one of many nightmare projects we have inherited from the former government - in fact, the list is very long indeed. But what are the others? I hear the shadow minister for defence, Senator Minchin, regularly these days denying these projects exist. He is in some form of denial. He knows only too well that these projects are very real. I am happy to brandish the folder - this catalogue of waste and mismanagement running into the billions and billions of dollars. 
Opposition members - Table it! - They invite me to table it but they know it is commercial-in-confidence, they know it is secret and they know how irresponsible it would be and indeed how -  - The only person on that side not calling upon me to table that folder is the Leader of the Opposition, because the Leader of the Opposition knows exactly what is in that folder! - How disingenuous was that request, coming from the bloke who knows better than anyone that I am in no position to table these commercial-in-confidence and, in some cases, secret documents. He knew he was on very safe ground. -  -  - Of course, the Leader of the Opposition knew he was on safe ground asking that question because he knows better than anyone in this place what is in that folder and that it is impossible for me, as much as I would like to, to table that folder. - The member for North Sydney says, 'What's in the folder?' Let me just mention a couple of things that have been well and truly covered in the press that I can talk about briefly. What about the Adelaide class FFG upgrade? What about the $3.5 billion Wedgetail project? What about the lightweight torpedo project? The Leader of the Opposition is familiar with all these projects. Prior to the election, we made a promise that, if we were elected, we would review these projects as a matter of priority - and we are carefully, thoroughly and as quickly as we can working our way through each of these projects.In the case of Seasprite, we have shown a willingness to make the tough decisions when it is necessary, something the former government was not prepared to do. We will do so especially when the security of the nation and the safety and capability of the Australian Defence Force are at stake. The consequences of the decision not to proceed with the project are very complex, and discussions with the project contractor regarding the legal and financial arrangements have commenced. Indeed, a negotiating team from the DMO went to the United States just last weekend. I will provide further details about the arrangements once those negotiations are complete.Of course, the Navy will still need the capability that the Seasprite helicopter would have provided. These matters will be more fully investigated as part of the government's new defence white paper process, something the former government should have done some time ago. In the meantime, Defence will look at how best we can provide that additional capability using our existing fleet of Seahawk helicopters. The government is determined to ensure that the capability gap created by the former government's incompetence is filled as quickly as is possible.I acknowledge that the cancellation of this contract may affect up to 55 industry employees in the Nowra region. The opposition might want to listen to this point, Mr Speaker. Thankfully, the skills those employees hold are heavily in demand in the Australian economy. In addition, the government is committed to ensuring that the investment we have made in their skills will not be wasted, and we have engaged a local human resources company to assist those employees in being re-placed. Of course, effective Defence Force personnel will be repositioned or redeployed into other helicopter activities.Defence helicopter activities across the Nowra region are set to expand, and the government remains committed to the expansion of those projects. -  - The member for Gilmore, I suspect, will be interested in this, if those who sit on the front bench are not. The decision to cancel the Seasprite helicopter project is one that should have been taken by the former government years ago. They had the same facts and figures available to them as we now have available to us, but the reality is they put their own political interests in front of the national interest. You will recall that sitting on the former national security committee were the now Leader of the Opposition, the former Treasurer, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs and the former Attorney-General. Since the NSC, under the Howard government, last made the decision to proceed with the Seasprite helicopter project, some $26 million of additional taxpayers' money has been spent on that project - a $26 million gamble with taxpayers' money by the former National Security Committee of Cabinet. -  - Interestingly, the response of Senator Minchin, the now shadow minister for defence, to the government's announcement of last week was to say: 'That's all good. We agree with the decision.' The former government now agrees with the government's decision. But it was interesting that he was forced to point out that the Leader of the Opposition fought to have the project scrapped in that national security committee in around April or May last year. What was his defence of the now Leader of the Opposition? 'He was rolled.' He was rolled by his own cabinet colleagues. It is about leadership. This issue now and all these failed capability projects will be about leadership. - The responsibility now falls to the new government to sort this mess out. We are determined to show leadership on the Seasprite question and on these other capability projects. We will ensure that the Defence Force gets the capability it needs and that taxpayers get value for money.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. I do recall visiting his electorate with him some years ago on this, as I do recall meetings with many wheat farmers right across the country at that time, as I recall meetings with representatives of rural industry organisations most recently on this matter. The first point is this: why are we in this mess on the wheat industry? It goes back to something called AWB. -  - That is the truth. The reason we have our wheat marketing arrangements in disarray comes down to three letters: AWB. And it goes back to the wheat for weapons scandal, which members opposite do not wish to be reminded of but which fundamentally torpedoed amidships the credibility of our then existing international wheat marketing arrangements. That is why the entire wheat industry, including the 24,000 good and honourable people out there growing wheat as a crop as their livelihood, have had their future international wheat marketing arrangements placed in jeopardy as a consequence of the inaction - and, some would say, worse than that - on the part of the previous government.Secondly, therefore, we as the incoming government have had to confront the realities of, 'How do you best deal with the situation in a way which maximises the interests of growers right across the country?' It is no secret to those opposite; it is no secret to the National Party; there is a huge division of opinion among wheat growers, depending on what part of the country you come from, when it comes to exactly the right approach to take. In Western Australia you have a huge deregulation constituency. In parts of New South Wales you have a huge non-deregulation constituency. In various other parts of the country it splits right up the middle. Take, for example, Wilson Tuckey, the member for O'Connor. 
A government member - Where is he? - When he is onshore, we know full well where the member for O'Connor stands on this, which is a no-holds-barred, complete, total deregulation of the industry. We know that. We also know that there are huge divisions within the coalition, within the National Party and between the National Party and the Liberal Party on this matter.To go back to the direct answer to the honourable member's question, 'How do you best plumb the depths of what actually is the best set of opinions coming forth from the industry?' what I can say - and I fully acknowledge what the honourable member has said - in response to that is, dealing with the realities that we have had to deal with, coming into office, the minister for agriculture has been out there, on the ground, right across the nation, consulting wheat farmers, I think it is fair to say, in every state of the country on what is the best set of arrangements for the future. Those arrangements have been reflected in the bill that we are putting forward for consultation with the industry very soon. We believe it represents the best balance for the future. But I will not say to all members here present that it will be to the universal welcome of every wheat farmer in the country; it will not. As those who are honest opposite will recognise, there was no alternative set of wheat marketing arrangements which would have met with the universal accord of wheat farmers. You know that as well as anyone else in this place.Can I conclude where I began: none of this would have happened had the previous government discharged its responsibilities in ensuring that Australia's important $4-billion-a-year wheat crop was marketed to the rest of the world in a non-corrupt fashion. Instead you allowed $300 million worth of bribes to be paid to the Iraqi dictator, which were then used to buy bombs, guns and bullets for deployment against Australian troops. On this question, the government as it existed at the time has no credibility.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Werriwa for the question. Mr Speaker, you would recall that three weeks ago I reported on the government's commitment to fiscal responsibility and ensuring that the regional programs that we put in place are consistent with that commitment. I referred to this report of what I called 'the Nationals Audit Office' into the Regional Partnerships program, which showed that this program had:... fallen short of an acceptable standard of public administration.Today I can report that the Nationals' mismanagement was not confined to just the Regional Partnerships program. In May 2005, the former government gave a $426,962 grant under the Dairy Regional Assistance Program to the Indigo Cheese factory in the electorate of Indi. It was to help them manufacture:... locally handmade specialty cheeses from locally sourced cow, goat and sheep milk.Some might say, 'A worthy cause.' But it was not to be, because the cheese factory actually shut its doors on 14 March 2007.But here is the catch: as part of the grant, the former government paid an instalment of $22,135 of taxpayer's money on 28 June 2007 - three months after the factory had closed its doors. I asked my department what the legal advice was on this, and the extraordinary thing is that Indigo Cheese were deemed to have complied with their contractual obligations. Just think about that. The factory shuts in March 2007, but they still get $22,000 of taxpayers' funds just before the end of the financial year, in June 2007, because, under the contract that they signed, under the former government's regional arrangements, you could get the money - you did not have to actually produce any cheese. The factory did not have to stay open. It was just like the Gunnedah ethanol plant that did not produce any ethanol. One could have thought, perhaps, that Indigo Cheese might have just been an isolated mistake. But under the Regional Partnerships program an astounding 16 projects were terminated because they failed to get off the ground.I am not going to inform the House of all 16 projects today. But one of them jumped off the pages at me when I looked at the list, and that was a project appropriate for the National Party: the Tailwaggers Essential Pet Food Pty Ltd project. We know that the National Party tail often wags the Liberal Party dog when it comes to regional programs. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has put his leadership, strong as it is, on the line over the amalgamation of the National Party and the Liberal Party. We know that, if that happens, we will get a two-headed dog. But we also know that Tailwaggers Essential Pet Food will not be providing any food to either of the heads of that dog, because they have not produced one bit of actual food.When you look at the project, it gets even worse, because the project was in Walgett. Walgett was in the seat of the then member for Gwydir, who was the Leader of the National Party and happened to be the minister for regional services at the time that the grant was given. -  - I am asked if he had a dog - we do not know, but I understand he is supporting the two-headed dog at the moment. In spite of this, the parliamentary secretary thought it was okay to give them $246,477 in approved grants in June 2004. The good thing was that with this particular grant, unlike the previous examples of the cheese factory that did not produce cheese and the Gunnedah ethanol plant that did not actually exist, the money did not actually come forward because, after two years of protracted negotiations, Tailwaggers were forced to admit that they could not deliver the pet food to either end of the dog.</DOC>

 - I am unaware of the remarks that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has referred to. Can I say this about child abuse: wherever it occurs, whether it is in Indigenous communities or non-Indigenous communities, I think all of us in this place are united around one basic precept and it is called zero tolerance. Any kid anywhere, whether they are in an Indigenous or a non-Indigenous community, should be fully protected. When it comes to Indigenous communities in the Northern Territory, the reason we on this side of the House, amidst a whole lot of controversy at the end of last year, supported the Northern Territory intervention was the findings of the report Little children are sacred. As I said at that dispatch box on the day that the Prime Minister at the time announced the government's intended intervention, my response was entirely shaped by the extraordinary findings within that report about the incidence of child abuse. That drove our support for the Northern Territory intervention. That drives our continued support for that intervention. It drives our determination to review the outcome of that intervention by the 12-month point. - As I said before, I have not seen those reports, but I state on behalf of the government and, I believe, of the opposition: from our point of view on this question there is zero tolerance and we will deploy every resource necessary in the Northern Territory and elsewhere to combat at every level any incidence of child abuse, including child sexual abuse, because it is repugnant to all decent human beings.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ballarat for her question. Cartels are the undermining of the market economy to rip consumers off. This government is serious about promoting competition to ensure that consumers receive the benefits of the market economy. On 11 January, I released draft legislation to introduce jail terms for cartel conduct in Australia. The legislation provides for jail terms of up to five years for serious cartel conduct. I also released a memorandum of understanding between the ACCC and the Director of Public Prosecutions about how prosecutions under this new regime would operate. In addition, I released a discussion paper dealing with the more controversial and vexed issues in relation to this matter - most particularly, whether dishonesty should be included as a necessary element for the ACCC to prove in serious cartel cases and whether the Federal Police should be given telephone tapping powers on behalf of the ACCC in investigating serious cartel cases. Interested parties have now made their submissions to the government and we are working through the issues before determining how the draft legislation could be best improved.Nobody said this reform would be easy or that it would be without its challenges, but these issues should be worked through in an open and transparent manner, and they are not a reason for sitting on your hands and doing nothing. In opposition, we indicated it would be our aim to pass this legislation within 12 months of taking office and we are working towards that commitment.I was asked by the honourable member for Ballarat why this reform is urgent. This reform is urgent because the previous government failed to act. This reform is urgent because it is consumers and small businesses who suffer from cartel conduct. This reform is urgent because it was recommended to the previous government in 2003 by the Dawson committee of inquiry. The former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, indicated in February 2005 that the previous government accepted the recommendations. This reform is urgent because the previous government reneged on its commitment and the previous Treasurer went back on his word, and they did not introduce this legislation. That is why this reform is urgent.The honourable member for Ballarat also asked me how the current policy relates to international best practice. I can report to the House that Australia is one out. Almost every OECD country - and countries we normally compare ourselves with - have acted on this necessary reform. The United Kingdom has jail terms of five years. The United States has jail term of 10 years. Norway, Taiwan, Brazil, Israel, Canada and France all have jail terms for serious cartel conduct. The Slovak Republic has jail terms for serious cartel conduct. I am sorry that our esteemed colleagues from Estonia have left the gallery. They could have confirmed for the House that Estonia has jail terms for serious cartel conduct. If you operate a cartel in Kenya, you go to prison for three years.This reform escaped Peter Costello's Australia. They were asleep at the wheel and they neglected this important pro-competition reform. This reform is urgent because the previous government received 15 warnings from their own regulator, the ACCC, that this reform was necessary. It sounds familiar, does it not? I table these 15 warnings at the request of the Leader of the Opposition - 15 warnings from their own regulator, the ACCC, saying this reform was urgent and necessary to ensure that consumers are not being ripped off. The member for Higgins sat on his hands and let it rot, and refused to act. No wonder the chairman of the ACCC welcomed the new government's steps to introduce this measure. He said he was:... absolutely delighted. I think this is a significant step forward for the prosecution of competition policy as far as Australia's concerned. This is my high point for 2008. It is fantastic. I have been waiting for this for a very long time.It is a pity he had to wait so long. It is a pity he had to wait for the member for Higgins to lose office before a government came into office which actually cares about competition and consumers in this country. It is a pity Australian consumers had to wait for so long to have the benefit of a government which cares about them and cares about competition. We will continue to implement these reforms - reforms the previous government and the previous Treasurer did not have the wit to do.</DOC>

 - What I know for a fact is that when the government was elected it inherited the highest inflation rate that this country has had in 16 years - fact 1. What I know for a fact is that when the government was elected this country was suffering from the second highest interest rates in the developed world - fact 2. What I know for a fact is that, as of the December quarter last year, this country was experiencing zero productivity growth - fact 3. What I also understand -  - Talking things down, Member for North Sydney, in terms of recent remarks by you on prospects for the economy? I think the member for North Sydney should reflect on that. - Fact No. 3 is that, as of the December quarter, when the government was elected, we were experiencing productivity growth which had plummeted to zero. Here's fact No. 4: if you look at the influx of capital which came into the public revenue as a consequence of the resources boom - hundreds of billions of dollars - and look for a single substantive item whereby those opposite, when they were in government for 12 long years, invested anything of substance in the long-term productive capacity of this economy, you will be hard pressed to find anything. That is as demonstrated by the most recent report by the Business Council of Australia, which the last time I looked was not a subunit of the Australian Labor Party, particularly given their funding activities for various campaigns prior to the last election, I seem to recall.And fact No. 5 is this. Despite record terms of trade, and despite the fact that these terms of trade have now been registered for something in the vicinity of five years, what we have seen is something like 65 consecutive monthly trade deficits, a current account deficit running at seven per cent and a foreign debt which has ballooned out by a factor of three to $530 billion - and those opposite stand at the dispatch box and say that they handed the economy to the incoming government of Australia in perfect order. You've got to be dreaming!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Isaacs, who in fact brings considerable legal expertise to this parliament and makes a most welcome addition; he has a lot of ability. Before the election the government committed to holding an independent judicial inquiry into the case of Dr Haneef. As I announced this morning, we are honouring that commitment by establishing an inquiry to be conducted by a former New South Wales Supreme Court judge, the Hon. John Clarke QC. An independent inquiry is needed to establish the facts to ensure public confidence in Australia's counterterrorism arrangements.I should say that since becoming Attorney-General I have formed the view that our agencies are operating to a high standard but that Australians are entitled to be assured that our national security agencies are functioning the best they possibly can be, in terms of both individual agency expertise and also collectively and cooperatively. I note that this has been recognised by at least some members of the opposition. For example, according to AAP this morning, Senator Birmingham has said that the nation needs to have faith in its security services. To quote the senator:If an inquiry is required to ensure that faith is maintained in the community then that's important.With respect, he is absolutely right.The Clarke inquiry will be an opportunity to obtain a factual account of the matter from an experienced and independent former judicial officer. Mr Clarke will conduct a rigorous and independent inquiry to enable informed consideration of the lessons to be learnt from the Haneef case and of any potential improvements to how our national security and law enforcement agencies work and cooperate in counterterrorism matters.Mr Clarke has indicated he will conduct the inquiry in a way which ensures the protection of national security information, ongoing investigations and upcoming overseas trials. But he has also indicated he will ensure that there are opportunities for the public to input into the inquiry, including by advertising for submissions and conducting public forums on the operation of our counterterrorism laws and arrangements.Australians are entitled to know what really happened in the Haneef case. I see the opposition has taken the position that the inquiry into the Haneef case should be conducted by the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. The problem with that proposal is that the commission is only able to investigate corruption; it cannot investigate non-corruption issues. It is also unable to look at all of the agencies that were involved in the Haneef matter. With respect to shadow ministers, such an inquiry would be totally inadequate. National security should be above politics, and I would hope and expect that all members would fully support the inquiry. I repeat: it is important to ensure faith in our security agencies after the Haneef matter and to ensure that our agencies are operating as effectively as they possibly can be, individually and collectively. The government has asked the Clarke inquiry to report by 30 September this year. Mr Clarke has been asked to present a report that can be made public and which, if necessary - because of national security considerations - may be supplemented by a confidential report.In conclusion, the establishment of the Clarke inquiry will enable all the information about the Haneef case to be properly assessed in an independent manner and for the considered recommendations to be made to improve the functioning of our security agencies individually but, most importantly, collectively in the interests of a whole-of-government approach to national security.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Unfortunately, in the way she has premised her question, she has misled the House. And she would be aware that she has misled the House, because the Econtech report that she refers to - a copy of which, I presume, was taken from government offices when the former members of the government left and was released to a newspaper - which appears in the newspapers today, does not model Labor's industrial relations policy. -  - Isn't it interesting that we are getting cries of 'release it' from across the chamber, when this was a report prepared for the former government and they did not release it - presumably because when they were in government their standards were a little bit higher and they knew how laughable it was. But in the short walk from this side to that side, their standards have slipped lower and now they want something released which they obviously viewed as so laughable that it was not worth releasing. I say again to the member who misled the House: the Econtech report does not model Labor's policy on its own terms. Are you going to apologise for misleading the House? - The report was received by the former government, which did not release it, presumably because they were of the view that it was laughable - and it was laughable because it did not model anybody's industrial relations policy. The former government, in pursuit of their Work Choices campaign - a campaign they are still pursuing now - decided to deliberately feed in stupid and incorrect assumptions in the hope of getting out of the process something that they could politically use. Interestingly, when they were in government, they decided that this report could not be used by them even for that purpose. On the question of the impact of Labor's laws -  - The member opposite who is interjecting might like to listen to the answer. It would seem to me passing strange that, if the member genuinely believes that Labor's laws are bad for jobs, she is not opposing them - and when she went into her party room saying that she wanted to oppose them she was repudiated at the highest level of her party. On the question of the impact of Labor's laws, can I say that Labor's laws are calibrated to be good for productivity, good for collective bargaining -  - Productivity increases are good for the economy. They feed into a cycle that is good for the economy, including all economic indicators. Labor's policy is of course about fairness at work - something members opposite never understood when they sat on this side and do not understand now when they sit over there. They do not understand that there is nothing fair about people going to work and having pay and conditions ripped off them. The member for North Sydney interjects: 'There is nothing fair about people losing their jobs.' Absolutely. That is why we are fixing the unfair dismissal laws. It was possible under Work Choices - your laws - and it is still possible under Work Choices today for an excellent worker who has done nothing wrong, who works in a business with fewer than 100 employees, to be dismissed without any reason and get no remedy. So do not sit there and tell me that it is good for jobs that an excellent worker who supports a family could be dismissed without reason or remedy - your laws; your industrial relations extremism; and more nonsense from the party of Work Choices.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for her question. The House would be aware that we are experiencing a period of major instability -  -  - The House would be aware that at present across the global economy we are experiencing considerable instability in global financial markets. There is great uncertainty across the global economy, and it is uncertain still in terms of how circumstances will evolve. We have very tight credit circumstances in financial markets, weaker stock prices and global commodity markets. But, on top of that, we have had recent significant moves on the overall price of petrol. Overnight crude oil prices reached a historic record high of $US110 per barrel on global markets. The soaring crude oil price reflects a strong global demand against what, of course, continues to be limitations in global supply.These factors compound the cost of living pressures for working families. When working families are dealing with interest rates going higher and higher, 12 on the trot - when they are added to the cost of child care, added to the cost of groceries and added to other cost pressures affecting the family budget - it is important that government does everything within its power to assist working families under financial pressure.When you look specifically at petrol prices, the numbers are significant in themselves. Petrol prices have risen 14.3 per cent in the past year. That is four times the rate of inflation. In the five years to December 2007, the official measure of automotive fuel prices recorded an increase of 50 per cent. That is why the government is absolutely committed to taking every reasonable step to boost competition within the petroleum industry in order to ensure that motorists do not have to pay a single dollar more than is necessary at the bowser. -  - I find it interesting, again, to see the mock outrage from those opposite, from whom we saw such action, such commitment and such passion on how to enhance the powers of the competition regulator in this space. The member for Higgins knows precisely what I am talking about, since this week he has emerged from his laptop. That is, he had 11Â½ years to give proper powers to the competition policy regulator to conduct proper investigatory arrangements when it came to the petroleum industry and failed to do so - until Labor in opposition indicated that we were about to appoint a petrol commissioner. Then, hold the phone, suddenly we had a plethora of activity on the part of those opposite; 11Â½ years of inaction, inertia, nothing, then - six months before an election - whoops, we have the alternative government recommending the establishment of a petrol price commissioner. Then, hold the phone, the member for Higgins says, 'I've suddenly got an interest in the area.'This government has announced the appointment of a petrol commissioner to oversee the monitoring of fuel prices and report annually. We have nominated Pat Walker to fill this role. The petrol commissioner will be responsible for overseeing the ACCC's monitoring of fuel prices in Australia, including LPG and diesel. He will also provide an annual report on the ACCC's findings. The ACCC's recent inquiry into the price of unleaded petrol raised several matters that the petrol commissioner will be reviewing as part of his role, including, firstly, a detailed examination and ongoing monitoring of biocell arrangements; secondly, an audit of terminals suitable for importing refined petrol into Australia, covering terminal capacity, use and leasing and sharing arrangements; and, thirdly, ongoing monitoring of the use, leasing and sharing of terminals suitable for importing refined petrol into Australia. These are all factors which will have an effect on competition in the retail petrol sector and on prices at the pump.The government has also directed the ACCC to monitor the prices, costs and profits relating to the supply of unleaded petrol products in the petroleum industry, including imports, refining, wholesaling and retailing. The government is actively considering all of the ACCC's recommendations, including options to increase retail price transparency. Once we have worked through those options exhaustively we will have more to say.I can say, on behalf of the government, that in three months we have acted on these matters. After 12 years, from the party opposite, we had nothing more than a litany of inaction and lack of interest. And, added to the other cost-of-living pressures on working families, we had a party opposite which had simply lost touch with the interests of working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. No, I do not accept that at all. I absolutely do not accept that. We have a plan to modernise this economy. We have a plan to deal with the legacy that was left to this government by the previous government - the highest inflation in 16 years. Inflation just did not suddenly commence at 9 am on 26 November, as the member opposite would pretend. There is an inflationary problem in this country and, when we see a problem, we have to correctly identify that problem and we have to deal with it, and that is what this government has been doing. We have been dealing with the inflationary problem left to us by those opposite by putting in place our five-point plan, by reining in reckless expenditure. We had the report from the Treasury the other day which identified the fastest increase in spending in any four years in the past 16 years. Of course, the member for Wentworth, as usual, went into denial. The member for Wentworth is in denial about the inflation rate. He cannot agree with the ABS. He cannot agree with the RBA. - This country does face serious challenges - the highest underlying inflation in 16 years, and predicted by the Reserve Bank to stay there for two years. This government will not stick its head in the sand like those opposite. We had the member for Wentworth some weeks ago say that inflation was a fairy story. Tell that to the people who have had eight interest rate rises in the last three years. It is not a fairy story. Last year we had the member for Wentworth say that interest rate rises had been overdramatised. He does not have a clue about what life is like around the kitchen table - because inflation is the enemy of working Australians; it erodes their savings and it erodes their living standards.This government has put its hand up from day one to tackle the inflation challenge that was left to us by the member for Wentworth and the member for Higgins. The member for Higgins said in July last year that inflation was right where he wanted it. Well, heaven help us if inflation was right where he wanted it. It was at a near 16-year high, as it turns out, when he made that statement. So we have put up our hand to accept responsibility. Everyone on this side of the House accepts responsibility for dealing with the inflation legacy left to us by those opposite. We have put up our hand to accept responsibility; why won't they just put up their hand and accept responsibility for creating it?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, because the jobs figures today are good figures. -  - Everybody on this side of the House celebrates the jobs figures today, but they cannot understand why the member for Wentworth and the member for North Sydney have been talking about a recession. We say that these figures are certainly welcome. -  - We are getting the 'me too'. Will you put up your hand for the highest inflation in 16 years? Will you put up your hand for the worst productivity performance in 16 years? -  - The figures are good news, particularly for those Australians who have good jobs. We all celebrate that. We are the party of jobs. It goes to the very core of our existence. We would never do what those opposite do, which is put in place legislation like Work Choices, which ripped away wages and working conditions. We on this side of the House have some core beliefs - unlike those on that side of the House, who have no core beliefs anymore. So we celebrate. We celebrate the jobs figures today. An extra 36,700 jobs were created in February - a very solid increase in full-time employment and very good as well in the states of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. We celebrate those outcomes.But there are challenges. If we want to continue to have strong jobs growth we have got to control inflation; we have got to lift our productivity. We can have strong growth if we can lift our productivity and control inflation - and that is what we on this side of the House are doing. It means fighting inflation, it means investing in the productive drivers of growth and it means dealing with the skill shortages.Only yesterday we had the member for Wentworth give a speech - a spectacular speech. There were 4,000 words in that speech but not one positive alternative policy or solution - not one. There were 4,000 words in that speech, but he could not come up with one positive policy alternative - and we know why: he does not have a plan to control inflation. He has not got his eye on what is going on with inflation. He has not got his eye on what is going on with productivity. He has not got his eye on anything. He has one plan. It is a plan for the Leader of the Opposition - a question of when. Put him out of his misery and take him out.</DOC>

 - As I said in response to a question in the House yesterday, the government is entirely mindful of the most recent findings in the consumer confidence index. I referred to that extensively yesterday and to the contributive factors to it, one of which of course is the rolling impact of what we have across the global economy, and Australia is not immune from that impact. The subprime crisis is unfolding in terms of consumer credit. It has had ramifications in revisions downwards in growth in the United States, in the United Kingdom, in the rest of Europe and in part in Japan, and Australia is not immune from that in terms of overall economic consequences and, flowing through that, consumer confidence as well. Of course there is a second factor driving all that as well, and that is the rolling impact of having inherited very high inflation rates vis-a-vis the last 16 years, and the second highest interest rates in the world. If consumers therefore have to pay 12 interest rate rises in a row, it has an effect on the way consumers feel. That is a consequence of previous policy settings, which this government inherited.The question, however, is: what do we do about it? As I have said before, we need to embrace a program of action for the future which is robust in terms of the proper management of public finances, is designed to enhance private savings and is intended to invest in proper skills formation across the economy to deal with capacity constraints in the economy and to invest also in infrastructure bottlenecks - which have been the subject of 20 separate warnings from the Reserve Bank over time, ignored by all those opposite in the period in which they occupied the Treasury benches - as well as to boost participation in the workforce. This is a framework of action, but, if you look at each subset of that as it has been applied over the last 12 years by those who preceded us, you see instead inaction and inertia on every count.We have been in office for three months, to identify where precisely the previous government took the capital available to them from the public revenue - hundreds of billions of dollars over time - and where that money was landed. It was not landed in investment in skills. It was not landed in investment in infrastructure. It was not invested in the long-term productive capacity of the economy. Instead, that government effectively pushed it to one side into various forms of consumption. That is no evidence of any forward planning at all.What we intend to do is to take the responsibility of national economic management seriously and realise that we simply should not reside here as beneficiaries of a terms of trade boom, coming off factors which we nationally have no control of in the future, but instead should carve out a long-term future for the Australian economy based on productivity growth, based on improving our infrastructure and based also on what we do to boost workforce participation. That is a strategy for this country's economic future, rather than standing or sitting idly by, carping from the sides and pretending that somehow, as a consequence of that, something materially changes.I remind all those opposite that they had 12 long years to act on this - 12 long years to act on these fundamental capacity constraints in the economy, 12 long years therefore to act on what turned out to be cumulative pressures on inflation, 12 long years to act on how that impacts on rates and how in turn it impacts on consumer sentiment. Instead, they sat on their hands and did nothing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question, because the Rudd government has set about modernising the economy, increasing its capacity so it can meet the challenges that lie ahead, including international turbulence. Despite the welcome job figures today, the economy is shackled by very poor productivity performance. It is also shackled by high inflation. But of course all of those over there are in denial. If you cannot acknowledge the size of a problem, you cannot be part of the solution. The member for Wentworth wants to stick his head in the sand. It is a dangerous and very risky attitude. Do you want to know why? Because it has produced eight interest rate rises in a row, and that has put Australian families under tremendous financial pressure.We on this side of the House acknowledge the enormity of the challenge. We have put up our hand to tackle it, and we are working very hard at it. But those on the other side of the House will not acknowledge the problem. The member for Wentworth disagrees with the Australian Bureau of Statistics. He disagrees with the fact that their inflation figure is so high. He disagrees with the RBA when they have their measurements of underlying inflation. He disagrees with the Treasury when it analyses the reckless spending spree that the previous government went on. He disagrees with the Business Council of Australia when it comes to their criticisms of the previous government's failure to invest. And, of course, he disagrees with the Australian Industry Group as well. Everyone else is wrong, and the only person right about these basic economic facts is the member for Wentworth. Everybody else is wrong. His uncontrollable arrogance is a risky thing for this country - to have such an irresponsible opposition, in denial about the basic facts of economics. We on this side of the House take our responsibilities very, very seriously, and we will put in place a modern agenda to drive productivity, to bring down inflation, to create wealth and to create jobs.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member's question: we on this side of the House understand the real challenge of grief counselling for those who have, tragically, lost a baby. In the period 2003-05, there were 6,281 perinatal deaths. In 2005 alone, there were 2,213 perinatal deaths. The government currently provides Lifeline with $38.5 million, over the 2004-11 period, for national telephone counselling services which offer counselling for people in distress. The government is also providing $48,000 to the Australia and New Zealand Stillbirth Alliance in the 2007-08 period for raising awareness and resource development for this sector.We are also currently undertaking a broader review of maternity services to ensure national coordination of antenatal and perinatal services. Funding for grief counselling would be considered within this context. I note also that, prior to the election, the then government was approached for funding support by Bonnie Babes but also by a number of different organisations, including the Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Support organisation, or SANDS. Support for these other organisations was not provided by the previous government. When this review of antenatal and perinatal services is conducted and concluded, proper funding for a range of counselling services across the spectrum, including all non-government organisations, will be properly considered and determined.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question, because it is widely recognised by economists that capacity constraints in our economy do contribute to inflation and do slow growth. I note, however, that in a speech yesterday the shadow Treasurer told CEDA that infrastructure bottlenecks 'have little to do with inflation'. Why would the shadow Treasurer say that? So desperate is the shadow Treasurer to distance himself from the inflation legacy that the Howard government left - the highest level in 16 years, caused by inaction on productivity issues such as infrastructure and skills - that he is prepared to argue that this is not an issue with regard to inflation at all. We have a shadow Treasurer who is simply in denial, and this shows just how out of touch the opposition is, because, whether it be a need for dedicated freight lines or tackling urban congestion or delays at ports, all of these do have an impact on economic -  - The question, of course, asked about Australia's infrastructure bottlenecks and their impact on inflation. Those on this side of the House think there is an impact on inflation. Those on that side of the House are not only in denial about the linkage; they object to it even being spoken about.Let us have a look at who does recognise that there is a link between these two economic facts: Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, the Business Council of Australia, CEDA, the Australian Industry Group and Engineers Australia. All of these groups have called for the national coordination of infrastructure planning and development. So many people are singing the same tune but the coalition are simply in denial and not listening. They are not even listening to themselves. The member for Barker gave an interesting speech in the parliament yesterday about Infrastructure Australia. Of course, I always pay attention to what those opposite say on legislation, because from time to time it is pretty clear there is no discipline in terms of them getting their speaking notes checked by those who run the opposition - well, who knows who runs the opposition at the current time. This is what the member for Barker said yesterday in parliament about infrastructure:Infrastructure Australia is not actually an original idea. It was the Howard government that in 1996 conceived the idea of a national infrastructure council.And I thought to myself, as someone who was elected to this great chamber in 1996: I cannot recall any legislation about Infrastructure Australia being created by those opposite; I cannot recall any motions in the parliament about these issues. I cannot recall it because they did not even bother to have an infrastructure minister or an infrastructure department, let alone an infrastructure council. I went back and had a look at what their pre-1996 election statement said. John Howard said this:I have been struck by the need to improve the coordination of infrastructure policy at the Commonwealth-state level.So they identified the issue in 1996. They are claiming credit for our legislation in 2008, saying they thought of it in 1996; they just did not get around to introducing it into the parliament - not in 1997, '98, '99, 2000, '01, '02, '03, '04, '05, '06 or '07. Not in any of those years did they get around to introducing the legislation into the parliament.They sat on their hands and they did nothing. They sat on their hands in spite of the fact that every year budget submissions were made by the business community calling for national coordination of infrastructure and despite the fact that on 20 separate occasions the Reserve Bank of Australia called for coordination of infrastructure. We have done more for advancing the cause of national coordination of infrastructure in 100 days than they did in 12 years. Now they say, very interestingly, that Infrastructure Australia - the body chaired by Sir Rod Eddington, which will coordinate the three tiers of government and have direct private sector representation to coordinate our national infrastructure - is just setting up a committee. It just shows how out of touch they are. They have lost their way. They have no idea what they stand for. They are trying to claim credit for the initiatives that are taking place under the Rudd Labor government after 12 years of neglect of these issues, because they have simply been in denial.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. We on this side of the House are fully supportive of the activities of all those entrepreneurs out there risking capital, working hard and doing their bit to raise an income for their families and to boost the long-term growth of their businesses. That is really important. I will tell you what crushes the confidence of small business, however: when they have to confront one interest rate rise -  -  - after another because a previous government unnamed allowed inflation to get out of control. It is a simple fact that, if you have upward pressure on inflation, what follows is that you get upward pressure on interest rates. That is what has happened - one rise after the other. If you consider the impact on running a business of 12 consecutive interest rate rises on the cost of capital to finance a business's operation, this has a significant effect on the way in which they view their future operations. When it comes to dealing with this challenge for the future, this is why the government has placed front and centre the need to confront the challenge of inflation - something which the shadow Treasurer regards as being a fairytale and something which various other members opposite -  - On the question of confidence, it is fundamentally dealt with: when you have a challenge of rolling interest rate rises, it affects the cost of capital and therefore your future plans for your business. There is a second thing which affects confidence when it comes to small business, and that is a government which sat there for 12 long years and did nothing on the business deregulation agenda. - For 12 years, they had the ball at their feet to do something about deregulation. They had the ball at their feet when it came to doing something about the complex interplay of federal, state and local authority regulatory impacts on operating a business. They had 12 years to actually produce an outcome on this. Instead there has been a red-tape explosion across this country under the 12 years of political tutelage of those opposite. If you are running a small business and have to deal with a mountain of red tape on the one hand and 12 interest rate rises in a row on the other, it affects the way in which you plan the future operations of your business. I would suggest that those raising any substantive question about small business in this parliament should reflect on what opportunities were presented to them over the last 12 years and ask themselves this question: 'Why did we do nothing about it?' Instead, embrace a course of action with us to fight the fight effectively on inflation, to put downwards pressure on interest rates and to act decisively on the question of deregulation as it impacts this critical sector of the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for the question. Labor is the party of responsible spending and quality investments in the future. This disciplined approach is central to our five-point plan to fight inflation. We have already begun cutting wasteful spending from the previous era, and we are identifying further substantial cuts beyond the $10 billion of savings we have already announced. But, under the member for Wentworth and the Liberals, across a range of programs it was raining money - literally! When Australian families needed restraint from their government and downward pressure on inflation, the member for Wentworth in particular was treating the public purse with disdain. We know that, a few weeks before the last federal election, he was advised reluctantly by his department to spend at most $2 million investigating supposed rain-making technologies.This supposed environmental project, called ATLANT, being promoted by a newly formed company called Australian Rain Corporation, was presented to the National Water Commission in August last year, just three months before the federal election. The ATLANT technology, you will be pleased to learn, Mr Speaker, proposed creating a high density of negative ions at ground level, on the assumption that this cloud of ions would float into the atmosphere and enhance cloud formation and therefore rainfall. Unfortunately for the commercial backers of this scheme, evidence presented to the commission cast a serious scientific cloud over their claims. To quote from the scientific review of this negative ion technology:In our view there is not convincing evidence that the ATLANT technology operates as believed by its proponents, and independent scientific measurements quite a long time ago cast doubt in particular upon the reality of the vertical ion wind.I have to say that, as a lay scientist I am inclined to agree with that view. They went on to say:Despite explicit questioning, we have not seen any experimental evidence to support the ATLANT viewpoint. Since this is the presumed way in which the technology operates, this is an important omission.In addition, the company relied on untranslated documents in the Russian language to back their case! Despite these reservations and a considerable language barrier, and no doubt under some ministerial pressure, the commission reluctantly agreed to conduct further trials and recommended Commonwealth funding of $2 million for this purpose. I would have thought $2 million was a stretch, but the former minister for the environment knew better. He overrode the $2 million and instead sought prime ministerial approval of $10 million of taxpayers' money to be spent on this project - a ministerial tick-off of $10 million two days into the last federal election. This was a 500 per cent increase in funding for a pet project at ministerial whim. It was simply reckless spending. And with inflation at a 16-year high it shatters whatever claims to competency this opposition and this member have.The member for Wentworth told working families that they were 'overdramatising' rate rises. It reminds me of one of my favourite songs, with a slight pun in it: 'That was a fraction too much fiction.' The member for Wentworth was a cabinet minister in a government that gave families interest rate rise after interest rate rise in three years -  - In relation to the point of order taken by the member for North Sydney -  - All I can say is that perhaps it was not a pun - perhaps there is a fraction too much friction over there. I will conclude by saying that theirs was a government that gave families interest rate rise after interest rate rise in three years and delivered the highest underlying inflation in 16 years. Under the Liberals it was raining money. And in this case the member for Wentworth was the irresponsible rainmaker.</DOC>

 - I am laughing at the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but I do thank her for her question. Can I make it very clear to members opposite that of course we value the work performed by all Australians. As I joked with the Leader of the Opposition before question time started, I have certainly valued the services of people who give manicures. And, as a matter of public record, I am very fond of hairdressers - one in particular! So I very much value the contribution of small businesses to the Australian economy.Let me tell you what small businesses want when it comes to the Australian economy. They want a sense of being included in government policy making. And what is this government doing? We are including them in government policy making. My colleague the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy is doing this generally, but we are specifically doing it in the delivery of our fair and balanced alternative to the extremism of Work Choices. We are working with small businesses in a small business working group so they can give us the benefit of their expertise on questions that they are concerned about and have a view on, including of course unfair dismissals but also the burden of red tape that they object to in Work Choices. Let us remind ourselves that the self-styled advocates of small business over there gave small business an industrial relations system that means they are waiting months at the back of queues hundreds of thousands of agreements long -  - I am explaining to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that this is a government that is including small business in policymaking because we value their views. When we listen to the views of small business about policymaking, what they tell us is they did not appreciate being at the back of a queue hundreds of thousands of agreements long, waiting five, six or seven months for an answer as to whether or not their agreement had been passed by the Workplace Authority. This was the administrative shambles that the former government left to this government to resolve in industrial relations, and resolve it we will by delivering a fair, balanced and flexible system that will work for the needs of small business, which will mean that they are not caught up in endless red tape. But it will do something that members opposite do not understand, never will understand and never have understood: it will extend fairness to Australian working families.We know that the opposition are opposed to a fair industrial relations system. We know that they are still, with every statement they make, entering into an ode of love to Work Choices and that, whatever they pretend, however they position, they are now and always will be the party of Work Choices and industrial relations extremism. Australian working families who voted last November rejected them because they did not want it. They do not want it now and they will not want it in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. When it comes to Australia's higher education system, the Rudd Labor government wants to make sure it benefits from a higher education revolution as part of the education revolution. In order to deliver that - and I am glad that the member has raised the important question of higher education - the first steps are to deliver on our election commitments. On this side of the House, we believe in delivering on election commitments; on that side of the House, they are brushed away as non-core a moment after they are made. But we are delivering on our election commitments. We are of course delivering on our commitment to commence the phase-out of full-fee-paying places. I will be very interested when the new shadow minister for education can answer this question about higher education: do the Liberal Party still stand for the ability of Australians to buy a place in university over a student of merit? Do they still stand for that fundamental unfairness? - Was that no? Actually, your government introduced that fundamental unfairness, and you might want to clarify that question: whether you stand for that unfairness -  - and whether you stand for the ability of university places to not be allocated on the basis of merit. We are also delivering our policies for more places for nurses and early childhood educators. We are doubling the scholarships available to undergraduates. We are committed to rebuilding student services, and we are of course committed to incentives for maths and science, because they are enabling disciplines where we are in such short supply as part of the skills shortage. But, to deliver a full higher education revolution to this country, we will need to do more. This is a government that not only believes in delivering its promises; it believes in delivering on reform - reform that is necessary to make sure that this is a modern nation ready to meet the challenges of the future.It is interesting to me that when one moves around the higher education community they still talk about the Dawkins reforms. They are still debating and still talking about the Dawkins reforms. There are views in favour, views against, but Dawkins's name has become synonymous with higher education reform in this country. There will never be a day when higher education policy people will talk about the Nelson reforms or the Bishop reforms, because they never did anything profound to improve our higher education system. Instead, they had years of neglect interspersed periodically by ideological meddling, the high point of which was the imposition of Australian workplace agreements, their industrial relations extremism, on Australian universities. The sorts of things they stand for are extremism in all places. Reform, promise delivery? Never.In order to deliver the rest of the higher education revolution, we want to be guided by a review that includes the sector. -  - Whilst the opposition of course are catcalling, this is part of their historic trend of denigrating all things to do with universities. The Leader of the Opposition, when Minister for Education, Science and Training, used to make it an art form, pretending that universities were ivory castles disconnected from the rest of society. On this side of the House, we believe our universities and our higher education system should be treated with respect and we believe what happens in those universities matters to all Australians. What the Leader of the Opposition never understood when he engaged in that denigration of our universities is: you cannot take a kid to the doctor without a university system. Your child in school cannot have all the subject choices they would like without a university system, and you cannot have global research efforts like the invention of the cervical cancer vaccine without a university system. But what did the Howard government do? Denigrated our universities over 12 long years.Today, to guide us in the delivery of the higher education revolution, I have announced a wide-ranging review. It will be guided by Emeritus Professor Denise Bradley. Professor Bradley is the National President of the Australian College of Educators and a former Vice-Chancellor and President of the University of South Australia - exactly the sort of person that the opposition would denigrate because she is from the higher education system. - This review will be overarching and will inform the formation of our compacts with universities, which will value their unique mission in our university system. Delivering on our promises is the first step in our higher education revolution. This review will guide the next steps in our higher education revolution. It comes from a political party that puts education at the forefront, which values it from preschool all the way through school and vocational education and training and through to university. The opposition is led by two people with a track record of failure as ministers for education. They were never associated with profound reform. We are going to get on with the job of making sure our education system, including our higher education system, is ready for the challenges of the future.</DOC>

I am on the record outside the parliament, inside the parliament, prior to the last election and since the last election as being opposed to forced amalgamations at a local authority level. That has always been my position and always will be my position. That is why we backed the proposal by the previous government to test local community sentiment on these questions. I have seen the results of that. Those good people reflect the view which I have, which is that forced amalgamations should not proceed. On this question, my position is in complete opposition to that of the state government of Queensland - has been in the past and is so today - and that position does not change.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for her question. The Department of Health and Ageing oversees more than 2,870 accredited nursing homes right across Australia. It is an honour and a privilege to care for and protect our nation's most vulnerable citizens, the frail and the aged. As minister, I have met with residents and providers and visited aged-care facilities in all states and territories to get firsthand knowledge. One thing has become very clear: for the last 12 years, the previous government neglected the concerns of residents and their families. Shortly after becoming minister, I asked the department to review ways to improve aged care. On 21 February, I announced changes in the area of police checks. I have asked the department to begin reviewing aspects of the Aged Care Act and the activities of the Aged Care Act and the activities of the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency. This agency was set up in 1997 to accredit aged-care facilities.I have already found quite a few surprises. For example, the Aged Care Standards and Accreditation Agency has advised me that it is not an offence to mislead it. That is right: it is not an offence to mislead the accreditation agency. I find this absolutely breathtaking. How could the previous government create an accreditation body and then limit its powers? On another matter, last week I was told that a minister for ageing could not visit a nursing home without the permission of a provider or being invited. This means a minister, if they were concerned about residents or wanted to see firsthand what was going on in a facility, would have to give advance warning -  - As I was saying, I have been told that, if a minister for ageing wanted to visit a nursing home, they had to get the permission of the provider or be invited in. This means that, if a minister were concerned, they could not go to a nursing home without giving any sort of advance warning. When I approached the department about this, they were very, very surprised by this inquiry. They said this was highly unusual. Why did they say that it was unusual? The reason they said it was unusual is that previous Liberal ministers only wanted to see nice nursing homes. That is right: previous Liberal ministers only wanted to see nice nursing homes. What this shows is that the previous government was so out of touch it only wanted to see smiling faces and ribbon cuttings. That is all it wanted to see. I can tell you from my experience as a police officer that sometimes life is not just a sweet-smelling bouquet of flowers. Sometimes it is tougher. Sometimes you just have to roll up your sleeves, go in there and see what is going on firsthand. But the Liberals did not do that in aged care, not at all. - They lost touch and they were happy not to know what was going on. This is not just good enough -  - and I intend to change that. As the Minister for Ageing, I have asked my department to urgently examine these measures and report back to fix it. For 12 long years, the Liberals did nothing in terms of aged care. It is time to change that, and that is what I intend doing.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I am -  - You've not had a good week, Joe; you've had a very bad week, Joe - a very bad week, and so has Brendan and so has he. -  - Too right you have. -  - There was a comprehensive answer given to that question by the Prime Minister at the beginning of question time, but I am happy to take it because this side of the House is extremely concerned about the cost of living and what we have to do - The member for Dickson then left the chamber. - Those opposite were the ones who said working families had never been better off. That is what they said, and they said it at a time when inflationary pressures were unleashed on the Australian economy. We have seen today that they have no plans to tackle inflation, none whatsoever. The Liberal Party is the best friend inflation ever had, and we saw it from the member over there - the former Treasurer. - I certainly will, Mr Speaker, because on this side of the House we are very concerned about cost-of-living pressures. That is why we have put a whole lot of reforms into the system to assist working families: the tax cuts from 1 July, our initiatives when it comes to child care - all of these things go to the very core of living standards of families. - I am more than happy to talk about petrol prices because we have put in place, through the ACCC, a petrol commissioner. -  - Too right we have. We have put it in. When those opposite were in power they did not see the need to do anything. If motorists were ripped off for an additional cent a litre, they did not care, and there was no cop on the beat to supervise the petrol companies at all. We have put that in place. We are extremely concerned with the cost of living, and we will do everything in our power to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates and to look after the interests of working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. A recent report of the Australian Industry Group found that the slump in Australia's productivity growth has not been confined to mining, as had been claimed by the previous government, but has actually occurred in 11 out of 12 industry sectors. This prompted the Australian Industry Group to conclude in its report:The productivity retreat since the late 1990s has been widespread.The report goes to the same point again when it says:A retreat from a past period of superiority is thus widespread throughout industry - that is, in 11 out of 12 industry groups. In answer to the question asked by the member for Corangamite, the Australian Industry Group says:It is sometimes said that events in mining alone can explain the aggregate productivity pattern _ that claim is a nonsense.That is the claim that those opposite were making about the productivity performance of this country under the previous government. The report goes on to describe the productivity performance in Australia during the late 1990s as 'scintillating'. The report attributes that performance to Labor reforms - Labor reforms in the shape of enterprise bargaining, Labor's reforms to tariffs and Labor's reforms in terms of the National Competition Policy.Productivity growth in the service economy has stalled. Eight out of 11 of the sectors where productivity growth has stalled are service economy sectors. That has been a massive squandered opportunity. Money has been pouring in that could have enabled the previous government to invest in modern sources of productivity growth, but it squandered that opportunity. It did not invest in skills formation, which is a modern source of productivity growth. The previous government ignored 20 separate Reserve Bank warnings about the skills crisis that was developing in this country for over a decade. The previous government could have invested in a national broadband network, but it did not. Rather, it criticised our national high-speed broadband network. In the area of infrastructure, the broadband initiative is designed to lift productivity growth in the service economy, particularly for small businesses.The previous government shirked the task of regulatory reform. It commissioned two reports, one in 1996 and one in 2006, whose recommendations were virtually identical, indicating that over a period of a decade the previous government did nothing to cut back on the accumulation of red tape; yet through areas such as the business activity statement and a whole raft of other regulations it presided over what the Business Council of Australia has described as the creeping re-regulation of the Australian economy. So what happened to productivity growth in the last year of the previous coalition government? The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures confirm that productivity growth was not slow, it was not low - it was zero. It was absolutely zero - flat as a tack. Yet the previous Treasurer twice came into this parliament, in late 2006 and again in mid-2007, and declared that productivity growth at the time was at or even ahead of the previous productivity cycle. It was zero. It was flat.A coalition government that denied that Australia had a productivity growth problem was never going to do anything about it - and it never did do anything about it. The Rudd government will restart productivity growth in this country by investing in the new sources of productivity growth. In doing so, it will fight the inflation rate that it inherited from the previous government, which is at a 16-year high, as well as the second-highest interest rates in the developed world - 12 successive interest rate rises on the trot. We will invest in skills, we will invest in infrastructure and we will invest in regulatory reform. The Rudd government will invest in these forms of productivity growth. We are building a modern economy to meet the challenges of the 21st century for the nation and for the working families of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The members of the cabinet, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, the Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister, I and a whole bunch of others have been pretty busy in the last three months dealing with some of the challenges left to us by those who preceded us. We have been engaged in solid policy responses to the major challenges of the nation. But here is what the honourable member for Wentworth has been engaged in during the same three months: a campaign to bring down the Leader of the Opposition. - On the question of the strategic budget review committee, the ERC, these meetings roll on continuously - there was one last night. I have to disappoint the member for Wentworth. The Treasurer was chairing the meeting last night. It went for four hours and was a very successful meeting. Can I suggest that, when it comes to real engagement in the debates of the nation, the member for Wentworth would be better advised to engage in these debates rather than the other activities in which he is engaged at the moment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I am pleased to inform the House that one of Australia's most enduring maritime mysteries has now been resolved, at least in substantial part. Last night the final resting place of the missing Royal Australian Navy cruiser HMAS Sydney was confirmed. In 1941 HMAS Sydney, the most famous of the RAN ships at the time, was sunk as the result of a naval engagement with the German raider Kormoran. The Sydney had already returned from the Mediterranean, where it had been engaged gallantly in action, including most significantly against a more heavily armed Italian cruiser, the Bartolomeo Colleoni. In the Indian Ocean, however, the engagement with the Kormoran resulted in both the Kormoran and HMAS Sydney going down. In the case of HMAS Sydney, tragically we lost all 645 members of the crew.This was the largest loss of life in a single naval incident on the part of the Royal Australian Navy. Until yesterday the families of those crew members did not know the final resting place of their loved ones. Now they know. But that knowledge reminds them of a loss and, though more than 60 years have now passed, that loss is still keenly felt. On behalf of the government, and I believe on behalf of the parliament, we convey our condolences to all surviving family members of those who tragically lost their lives in the service of their country on board HMAS Sydney. 
Finding the location of the German raider HSK Kormoran was the key to finding HMAS Sydney. The Kormoran was found approximately 112 nautical miles off Steep Point, in Western Australia, and it is lying in about 2,500 metres of water. The Australian government has advised the German government of this find. The Sydney was found around 12 nautical miles from the wreck of the Kormoran, and it is also lying in 2,500 metres of water. The government's advice is that the location of the wreck and its dimensions give certainty to the fact that HMAS Sydney has indeed been found. The debate, however, will now continue as to the precise circumstances surrounding the sinking of the Sydney. That debate will now be aided by undersea photography that will emerge as a result of the discovery of the wreck site. It is important that we have now moved to protect the site of the wreck of HMAS Sydney. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has used interim orders to declare both sites to be historic shipwrecks under the Historic Shipwrecks Act, thereby preventing any removal or disturbance of the shipwrecks without formal approval.I wish to thank all of those involved in the search for HMAS Sydney. The Finding Sydney Foundation has done research work over many years to identify the most likely location of the wreck, and it has organised the current search. The crew of the SV Geosounder, the ship that conducted the search, are to be congratulated for their fine work, as is the Royal Australian Navy for the excellent support they have given to the search foundation. I also thank the governments of New South Wales and Western Australia and the former Australian government for the financial support that they committed to this project.This is a historic day for the nation and it is a sad day for the nation. It is a historic day for the Royal Australian Navy and it is a sad day for the Navy. It is also a deeply sad day for the families of those who lost loved ones on the Sydney. Today in this parliament we honour the memory of those who served their country with courage and with pride. We honour also their families, who now suffer a renewal of acute loss and grief.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The Australian government remains deeply concerned about developments in Tibet and neighbouring areas. The government greatly regrets the violence and deeply regrets the loss of life. These are significant developments, and they have been the subject of comment not just by Australia but by the international community. I reiterate the call I made on Saturday, 15 March: that Australia of course recognises China's sovereignty over Tibet - that is not in question - but China should act with restraint in these matters and should deal with protesters peacefully and peaceably and should allow the peaceful expression of dissent. The Australian government again calls for restraint - indeed, restraint from all parties - and calls for the violence to end quickly and without further casualties.I raised the Australian government's concerns about human rights, including human rights in Tibet, directly with the Chinese foreign minister, Mr Yang, during his visit to Australia on 5 February. Australia regularly raises these issues with China, including through its regular human rights forum dialogues - the next of which is proposed for later this year.The Australian government believe that China's best interests are served by implementing policies that will foster an environment of greater respect and tolerance. We remain concerned about serious inadequacies in the protection of Tibetans' civil and political rights. Australian officials, both in Canberra and in Beijing, have discussed these developments with Chinese officials, both in Canberra and in Beijing, in recent days. That discussion will continue. I said that not only Australia but also the international community had made public remarks. In recent days the French foreign minister, Mr Kouchner, said:We asked for restraint on the part of the Chinese authorities. We asked for human rights to be respected.The United States Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, has called for dialogue and for all sides to refrain from violence. The United Kingdom foreign minister, Mr Miliband, said that he believes there are two important messages:One is the need for restraint on all sides, but secondly that substantive dialogue is the only way forward. We obviously see that there are real strains there but they need to be addressed in a way that balances restraint and dialogue.I very strongly agree with the sentiment of that remark; it reflects the Australian government's position. Members would be concerned to be assured about the welfare and safety of Australians in the area, particularly in Lhasa. My most recent advice is that some 14 Australians were in Lhasa or thereabouts. They have all been contacted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. They are all safe and arrangements are being made for some of them to exit the area. The department's travel advice for China was updated overnight, on 17 March. It continues to advise Australians to reconsider their need to travel to Lhasa and advises Australians to exercise a high degree of caution in the rest of Tibet, particularly in areas adjoining provinces bordering Tibet, following demonstrations there. I conclude where I started: the Australian government remains deeply concerned about developments in Tibet, and I am sure that concern is reflected by all members of the House.</DOC>

 - The first point is: I am not certain who that individual is. Secondly, during the visit to Sudan I had no meetings whatsoever concerning telecommunications of any description, nor was I in Sudan with any representative of that company. Furthermore, on the broad question of why members of parliament use sponsored travel, particularly when they are in opposition, if you had been shadow foreign minister for as long as I was, you would know there is no travel budget provided through the parliament. As a consequence, you rely upon private sponsorship. The way to maintain public accountability in this is to make sure that your pecuniary interest register declares all such sources of sponsored travel and is done so in full conformity with the laws of the country. That is my response to the honourable member's question.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The parliament would be aware that financial markets in the United States and around the world are going through a period of great turbulence and severe uncertainty. This instability began last August, when we saw the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. The losses as a result of the subprime market now are estimated to be in excess of some $140 billion, and it is expected that the final losses will be substantially higher. As a consequence, financial institutions have become more reluctant to lend money to one another, and this in turn has led to a general tightening of credit markets. Credit has become less available and, as a result, credit has become more expensive.The United States Federal Reserve has taken action in two areas to deal with the challenges currently confronting their own financial markets. Firstly, it is making more liquidity available to a wider range of financial institutions. Over the weekend, the Fed provided capital through an intermediary to Bear Stearns, a major US financial institution exposed to significant subprime related losses. Secondly, the Fed is reducing interest rates. This morning the Fed cut the discount rate on the funds it lends directly to financial institutions from 3.5 per cent to 3.25 per cent. In the six months since September last year, the Fed's key interest rate has been reduced from 5.25 per cent to three per cent. This tightening of liquidity in financial markets has had a significant impact on US equity markets as well, causing steep falls in share prices - and not just in the United States. Now we see an impact on the real economy in the United States; more than 85,000 jobs have been lost since the beginning of the year.Working families in Australia - and the Australian economy more generally - are not immune to developments in global financial markets. Turbulence in global financial markets is putting upward pressure on interest rates through rising credit spreads, at a time when Australian interest rates are already rising as a consequence of domestic inflationary conditions in our domestic economy. This is a double whammy when it comes to the impact on working families dealing with their mortgages. The government will take hard decisions to help Australia achieve long-term low inflationary growth, and that means taking the measures necessary to boost productivity growth on the one hand while on the other hand taking some of the pressure off inflation by ensuring that public demand is kept under control.Of course, there are some voices in the Australian parliament and in the public debate now who do not believe that inflation is a problem. The member for Higgins contributed last year, saying that inflation was just about right in terms of the level it had reached then. We have had the member for Wentworth describing inflation as something of a fairytale. But the bottom line is this: we have to deal with inflation because higher rates of inflation, fuelled by higher rates of government spending - which we saw in times past - in turn push interest rates up. When the Liberal Party was in government, on the question of expenditure, on the question therefore of contributing to inflationary pressures, it directly contributed to overall upward pressure on interest rates, and the people paying that price today are working families. Of course, on the question of overall inflation and the causes of it, the Reserve Bank of Australia Governor, Glenn Stevens, said last week:... aggregate demand in the Australian economy rose strongly through 2007 _ at a pace well above the economy's likely growth of potential supply.On the supply side, our response, as the Leader of the Opposition would be aware, is to act on skills and infrastructure. On the demand side, what we are dealing with - through the finance minister, the Treasurer and others - is a record of profligate government spending which we inherited from our predecessors. If those opposite do not believe that, read carefully the biography on the former Prime Minister and the record it contains of the member for Higgins's views about the profligate spending habits of the former Prime Minister - not out of our mouths but out of the Liberals' own mouths.These things require a concrete course of action, pursuing prudent fiscal policy to moderate demand, and that is the sort of budget we will be delivering when we get to May. This is our response - a five-point attack to deal with inflation, the core of which is to make sure that we restrain overall demand by producing a conservative budget outcome.Global financial markets are in a state of turmoil. As a consequence, Australia cannot be made immune from the wash-over effect of those financial markets. We, through the government, through the Treasury, are maintaining close contact with the regulators of Australia's financial institutions. But, when it comes to the impact of fiscal policy on the overall economic wellbeing of this country, we will be pursuing a rigorous, robust and conservative approach to the management of this country's public finances when it comes to the upcoming budget, unlike the government which preceded us.</DOC>

 - I do not have the details of the trip to Sudan on me, but my recollection is that, through the High Commission in London, I sought assistance in obtaining a visa to visit Sudan. My reason for going to Sudan was to investigate circumstances in western Darfur. I then travelled to western Darfur. My reason for so doing was that the situation on the humanitarian front in western Darfur at the time was deteriorating grossly. At that time there was not a lot of evidence of activity on the part of the previous government on that. I went there with the single objective of trying to shine a light on that problem, and I did so. As a consequence, I had discussions with relevant representatives of the government in Khartoum and relevant Darfurian representatives, most particularly on the state of circumstances in western Darfur.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, because inflation is one of our most pressing domestic challenges. It hurts working families, it puts upward pressure on interest rates, it erodes living standards and it threatens future growth and job creation. In order to fix the problem you need to be up-front and honest about it. As the Prime Minister has indicated again today, inflation is at a 16-year high - and, of course, the member for Higgins last week accepted full responsibility for that 16-year high. These inflationary pressures have been building in our economy for some time. They are the product of a lack of investment in capacity and the product of a previous government that was engaging in reckless spending.Last week in Canberra the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia gave a very important speech about inflation to Treasury officials. He made three very important points. First, he repeated the bank's view about inflation being elevated and that it will remain elevated for a considerable period of time. That was point No. 1. Second - point No. 2 - he said that inflationary pressures were broad based. Third, he made the very important point that the surest way to higher average interest rates is to accept higher inflation.Of course, not everybody agrees with the Governor of the Reserve Bank - most notably the member for Wentworth. He is so out of touch with Australians he does not think that there is an inflation problem in this country. He does not have a clue what life is like around the kitchen table. The pretender from Point Piper does not understand that inflationary pressures are eroding the living standards of working families. Last year, he said inflation and interest rates were overdramatised - that was simultaneously with him supporting Work Choices, which was ripping away the wages and working conditions of many people in our community. - Mr Speaker, I am talking about the contribution to inflation from the reckless spending of those opposite. In fact, the member for Wentworth admitted last week that he multiplied a grant application by a factor of five, from $2 million to $10 million - yet another example of reckless spending. There are numerous examples of reckless spending, as the Treasury pointed out only last week. Last week the member for Wentworth gave a 4,000-word speech arguing against fighting inflation. He argued against it. He also denied that we had a skills crisis in the economy. He went on to say that we were heading for a recession and then accused this side of the House of talking down the economy. What a record! Of course, he was then severely embarrassed when he claimed the Treasury had recommended a figure to the government when it came to the minimum wage. He was severely embarrassed about that and, when he was repudiated by the head of Treasury, he attacked the integrity of the head of Treasury. You cannot believe anything the member for Wentworth says. He never lets the truth get in the way of his political ambition. He will say and do anything. Thankfully, this side of the House understands the size of the inflationary problem and the need to deal with it. Those on that side of the House are the best friends that inflation ever had.</DOC>

 - The governor is comprehensively right and the member for Wentworth is comprehensively wrong, because what the governor talked about was elevated inflation - pushing up interest rates. The approach of the member for Wentworth is very simple - if people put their heads in the sand about elevated inflation, they condemn this country and householders with a mortgage to permanently higher interest rates. That is the recipe of the member for Wentworth. He has an approach which is dangerous. He has an approach which will condemn people to paying permanently higher interest rates because he will not deal with the causes of inflation and has no program to do so.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - The government has inherited economic circumstances that are challenging. We have a major inflation problem in this country - upward pressure on interest rates and government spending that is growing currently at 4Â½ per cent in real terms. The government is committed to tackling the inflation challenge both in the short term and in the medium term. The critical part of the medium-term attack on inflation is getting better productivity - getting it up from near to zero, where we have inherited it - and ensuring that we have greater pressure on red tape, which will get deregulation moving in this economy so that businesses are unbound and able to create more jobs, greater wealth and higher economic growth. The attack on red tape is a critical part of the government's agenda to bear down on inflation in the medium term.Red tape imposes costs on business, it reduces innovation and, in some cases, it is designed to protect individual businesses against prospective competitors, against innovation and against attacks from outsiders. There are a number of things the government plans to do. Some of these are already in train. The first and perhaps most obvious is that the government has appointed a minister in the cabinet - me - as Minister for Finance and Deregulation. This was a recommendation from the former government's Banks inquiry, which it chose not to proceed with. We have also appointed Dr Emerson, the member for Rankin, as the assisting minister. Secondly, we have established a working group as part of the COAG process to accelerate and intensify the process of pursuing harmonisation of regulatory arrangements across the states and territories. There was an agreement on this at COAG last year but, unfortunately, there has not been a huge amount of progress in the intervening time. We have turbocharged that process in order to get some outcomes, and that will be reported at the COAG meeting later this month. We are also pursuing internal red tape within the bureaucracy. My department is chairing a working group within the federal bureaucracy which is designed to deliver cuts in red tape within Commonwealth processes, which will indirectly benefit business and the wider community.Finally, we are developing a culture of continuous improvement in regulation. We should not need to have reviews once every 10 years like the former government did. We should not need to have a Banks inquiry or a Bell inquiry into red tape, because our regulatory system should be delivering feedback all the time so that we can build in a process of continuous improvement. This is crucial to reviving productivity in the Australian economy. I am pleased to see that a number of early decisions have been taken by this government to unleash business and to unleash competition. For example, the government decided to get rid of the monopoly wheat export marketing arrangements that we inherited from the previous government - and the opposition still cannot make up its mind whether or not it supports the government's initiative - and to liberalise arrangements in aviation between Australia and the United States in order to provide greater competition and greater opportunities for business in the United States.The previous government talked a lot about removing red tape. It talked a lot about reducing the burden on business. It said when it took office it would cut red tape by 50 per cent. Does anybody believe that red tape was even reduced, let alone by 50 per cent? The answer of course is that very little was achieved - just two reviews, one of which disappeared without a trace, and with the second we are doing our best to follow through with some of the recommendations.I note that the Business Council of Australia is about to release another report which, amongst other things, will deal with these issues. I would commend that report and the views of the Business Council to the members of this parliament. The Business Council has played a very important role in putting pressure on governments on these issues, and I applaud its efforts. I hope that the opposition's response to this report is a little more intelligent than its response to the most recent Business Council report about government spending. The member for Wentworth, in response to the Business Council's claim that there is serious excessive spending and that the government needs to reduce spending, said, 'They are just the voice of the big end of town.' I have news for you Malcolm: you are the big end of town! And the big end of town does not even agree with you. You cannot even get your own mates to agree with you. - I apologise, Mr Speaker. The government are serious about pursuing economic reform and we applaud the contribution to the debate of organisations like the Business Council. Deregulation is central to our agenda - tackling inflation problems, tackling productivity and tackling the barriers to greater wealth creation, greater job creation and greater innovation in our economy. The former government talked a lot about doing something about red tape, but they did very little. We are not on about wild promises; we are on about delivering some outcomes. We are rolling up our sleeves and getting down to work.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The Environment Protection and Heritage Council, including all state and territory governments, previously committed to the phase-out of free single-use plastic shopping bags by 1 January 2009. This commitment was made by the previous Howard government, and that position has been supported by this government. Voluntary measures have been trialled but have not been as successful as governments of both persuasions had hoped. This government is still working with states and territories to analyse options for phasing out plastic bags. The Environment Protection and Heritage Council expects to discuss this issue at its upcoming meeting on 17 April 2008. The government has not decided on its preferred option, but let me tell you this: we will not be imposing a Commonwealth levy on plastic bags. Action on plastic bags should not be used as a government revenue raiser. On the broader question of the impact on working families' budgets, the best thing that we can all do to improve the lot of working families is to get rid of Work Choices. The best thing we can do to help working families is to make sure that their penalty rates cannot be ripped off them, that their overtime rates cannot be ripped off them and that their basic, most elementary payments cannot be ripped off them. That is a set of laws that you imposed on working families, and you still stand by them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for that question. I know she has a deep concern about the impact of Work Choices on working families in her electorate. During the last few sitting weeks, we have revealed a number of statistics that, to coin a phrase, members of parliament need to 'really understand'. One of the statistics that members of parliament need to really understand is the dimension of waste of taxpayers' money that was engaged in by the former government on Work Choices propaganda: $121 million, which we know, and as has been revealed in this parliament, caused a plague of mousepads, leftover pens, fridge magnets, pamphlets and all sorts of other paraphernalia. The members over there might think that that is moderately humorous, but let us remember that money was ripped out of the purses and wallets of hardworking Australians in order to pay for the propaganda that the former government, the Liberal Party, engaged in in the run-up to the election. A second statistic that members of the House need to really understand relates to the dimension of rip-off of working Australians by Work Choices. I have had the opportunity in this parliament over the last few weeks to confirm that 89 per cent of AWAs sampled removed at least one protected award condition, 83 per cent excluded two or more and 52 per cent excluded six or more. On the question of rip-off -  -  - I see that they are interjecting about salary. Listen to these statistics about salary. On the question of the dimension of the rip-off of Australian working families engaged in by the Liberal Party, by the members who sit opposite, I referred in the parliament last week to a sample of Australian workplace agreements that showed approximately 45 per cent of the AWAs provided between $1 and $49 per week below the required rate of pay for protected award conditions, 50 per cent provided from $50 to $199 per week less, approximately five per cent provided $200 to $499 per week less and approximately half of one per cent provided for more than $500 per week less than the required rate of pay - statistics that members opposite might need to really understand. Maybe when they come into this place pretending that they care about the future of Australian working families they should start by actually explaining how it is that in government they supported extreme laws like Work Choices and they continue to do so.Today I can reveal new problems that are confronting the Australian community because of Work Choices. These are problems particularly confronting Australian businesses. I can reveal that there are new statistics from the Workplace Authority about the backlog of Australian workplace agreement processing. There was, of course, an initial backlog of 54,000 agreements that was created because of the shambolic way in which the former government introduced the so-called fairness test into law. It announced a test it had not formulated, it legislated retrospectively for the test and there were weeks when agreements were backlogging up and no-one knew how to process them. The initial backlog was 54,000 agreements. I can indicate that, to the end of February 2008, approximately 298,524 agreements have been lodged for assessment. Approximately 160,154 of them have been finalised, which means there are approximately 138,000 backlogged agreements waiting to be finalised. At the average rate of processing countenanced by the Howard government, processing this backlog would take 8Â½ months - 8Â½ months when employers and working Australians would have no idea whether or not the agreement that they were working under was lawful. - The party of Work Choices, right on cue! They have never met a rip-off they are not prepared to defend, even when the people they are ripping off are businesses who are caught in this processing nightmare. Now, at the average rate of processing countenanced by the Howard government, these agreements would take 8Â½ months to process. Let me tell you who needs to be apologising to Australian businesses. It is conceivable that, after five, six, seven or eight months of delay in processing, a small business in this country could be told that its agreement had failed. If you were told that your agreement had failed a fortnight after it was made, you would pay up the back pay. It might be a bit inconvenient, but you would deal with that. If you were told it had failed eight months after it had been made then that quantum of back pay could break a small business. That is the shambles that was Work Choices, brought to this country by the Liberal Party of Australia.They sit there and pretend that they care about Australian business when they are responsible for this red-tape nightmare. Like other messes left by the Howard government, we will clear this up. We are accelerating the rate of processing so at least employers and employees know what is going on. Of course, today we have passed the legislation which ends the making of Australian workplace agreements - the first step in getting rid of Work Choices, which failed working families and failed businesses.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As you know, deeming has been a policy which has been in operation now in this country for more than 15 years. When the previous government were elected, I understand they put in place new deeming arrangements from 1996. There are a range of changes for pensioners that come into effect from this Thursday, 20 March. They are as follows: (1) the first $125 payment of the increased utilities allowance, which pensioners will get every quarter; (2) the first payment of the increased telephone allowance, increased by $11 a quarter for those with a home internet connection; (3) indexation increases to the pension of 1.7 per cent or $9.10 per fortnight for singles; and (4) the deeming rates will increase by half a per cent, as the honourable member referred to before. Previous deeming rates have been changed over time by the previous government - both up and down. Let's not try to gild the lily, shall we?The net result on the pension rate will therefore depend on individual circumstances. If pensioners' assets have reduced in value due to volatile share-market activity, this will be taken into account in their pension assessment. If the value of shares has decreased, Centrelink recognises that therefore the total value of an individual's asset has also decreased, so the income able to be derived from that investment will be reduced. Deeming has been around for a long time. It was applied by the previous government at approximately this time each year to adjustments for those who are on the pension. These adjustments have been made consistent with the previous timetable.I conclude where I began: in terms of these additional payments which will be made for the first time to those on the pension - in particular, the first of the $125 quarterly payments of the utilities allowance - our intention is to try and make the financial circumstances of those on these fixed incomes a little bit better. It is very tough out there, given the cost-of-living pressures they are under with groceries, petrol and a whole range of other things as well. This is intended as a modest measure to assist those who are finding the cost-of-living pressures from their weekly basket of goods difficult to handle, but a new $500 utilities allowance should help at the margins.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. He is a man who you can always hear in this parliament, no matter what the circumstances. Of course, today this House took the step of passing Labor's transition bill, which will go to the Senate later this week. This bill will end forever the making of new Australian workplace agreements. From its passage by this parliament and from its proclamation, Australian workers will no longer have to worry about walking into work only to be confronted by an Australian workplace agreement that rips away their basic terms and conditions. When that debate was finalised in this place, there was a remarkable scene. This was the issue that was at the heart of the last election campaign, the issue on which members of the Liberal Party fought for many months and the issue about which government ministers day after day under the Howard government used to walk to this dispatch box full of brimstone, fire and defence of Work Choices, yet when it came today in this parliament to deal with the bill that would end the first part of Work Choices, what did we see? We saw the Deputy Leader of the Opposition here as the relevant spokesperson. We saw the member for Warringah here, presumably on duty. We saw the member for Cowan sitting on the back bench. Apart from that, we saw nothing. They no longer have the courage to come into this place and defend what they believe in. What they believe in is Work Choices.When it came to dealing with this legislation, which is of so much importance to Australian working families, there was one honest man on the opposition side in that debate, and that was the member for Fisher. I would like to quote the member for Fisher, because I believe it is important in indicating what will happen in the future should the Liberal Party ever be re-elected. He said:I have a little difficulty with the position of the coalition - which he described as meaning that 'we are not going on to oppose Labor's bill' - While the government does have an obligation to bring in this bill, on the other hand I would like to have been able to vote in the parliament on the basis of the principles on which I stood for re-election on 24 November_ 
There is one honest man on the opposition benches. Apart from an absence of passion and defence of Work Choices as they cowered in their offices, not supporting and not opposing the legislation, there was one other remarkable thing that was missing from the chamber. Members of parliament might have thought they heard the corridors resounding to a shout of 'Miranda' during the debate in the parliament. They might have thought that Picnic at Hanging Rock was on the TV again. But it actually was not a shout of Miranda; it was a shout of 'Malcolm' as the member for Wentworth did not turn up for his allocated speaking spot in the debate. When called upon -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I will conclude shortly. The only hallucination in this parliament was the prospect that the member for Wentworth would come in and stand up for anything, because he is obviously leaving his options open on Work Choices for later leadership ballots within the Liberal Party. - On the question of the workplace relations legislation, the bill has cleared the House of Representatives. There will be a Senate inquiry that reports later today. We will, of course, be mindful of what has occurred in the Senate inquiry, but there is no reason why this bill will not clear the parliament by the end of this week other than a desire by the Liberal Party to keep Work Choices staggering on.</DOC>

 - I am particularly grateful for the intervention by the member for North Sydney, because he was the minister at the time. When these matters came to the public debate, he was the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Insofar as I can work out, the minister in that capacity referred these allegations to a range of different investigative bodies. He referred these matters to (1) the Australian Electoral Commission, (2) the Australian Taxation Office and (3) the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The Workplace Authority and the Australian Industrial Registry also undertook inquiries - that is five. Referring matters to specialised areas of government at both a state and a federal level ensures that the body with the appropriate legislative responsibilities and investigative powers can undertake a thorough examination of the issues. The appropriate course here is to allow these investigations, which are on foot, including that of the AEC, to proceed.On the statement by the national secretary of the Labor Party: I will check where that is up to and whether his investigations have concluded. I say again that I encourage anyone who has any information relevant to these matters to submit it to the relevant authorities, of which there are a large number conducting investigations based on the actions by the minister when he exercised a ministerial office on this side of the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for her question. Australians have been dealing with increases in the cost of living and financial pressures for some time. Families and individuals with a mortgage have been dealing with 12 interest rate increases in a row and the highest underlying inflation in 16 years. Within those inflation figures there is cause for concern. The price of everyday, unavoidable purchases for working families has been going up even more than the average inflation rate. Inflation is concerning, of course, but, when the price of basic purchases which cannot be avoided is going up more than the average inflation rate, that is a cause for particular concern.Since 1996 in Australia, food inflation has increased by 43.6 per cent. The price of food has gone up by 43.6 per cent. - The comparable figure in the United States is 25.1 per cent. The figure in the United Kingdom is 11.6 per cent, while the relevant Canadian figure is 22.1 per cent. So food inflation in Australia has been much higher than in countries that we normally compare ourselves with. Of course, the response of the previous government was to shrug their shoulders and say, 'Well, Australian working families have never been better off; therefore there is nothing we could or should do,' but this government has a different approach.Whilst recognising that there are a range of factors which lead into increases in grocery and food prices, it is appropriate that we ensure that the grocery market in Australia is as competitive as it can be. There are a range of factors leading to these increases, as we have always said. Whether it is the drought or the growth in demand for food from Asia, there are a range of factors. But the fact that Australia has had the highest food inflation amongst the major OECD countries is cause for concern and presents a good reason for further examination to get all the issues on the public record and all the policy proposals on the public record.We believe that competition is the best way to put downward pressure on grocery prices in Australia. That is why, on 22 January, the government instructed the ACCC to commence a formal inquiry into grocery prices under part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act, implementing another election commitment of this government. This has been supported by a diverse range of groups, from Choice, on the one hand, to the National Farmers Federation, just today. I endorse the comments of the National Farmers Federation, which in its release earlier today said:CONSUMERS  -  increasingly attuned to rising food bills  -  are justified in wanting to know what is driving higher food prices. Likewise, Australian farmers are just as eager for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to get to the bottom of where the money is going, the National Farmers' Federation (NFF) said today.I also endorse the comments of the vice-president, Charles Burke, who said:_ The truth is farmers only ever receive a small portion of the price paid at the check-out _ There appears to be an increasing gap between farm-gate and retail prices, therefore, this is a good opportunity to find out exactly what is happening in the supply chain.I also note that the Leader of the Opposition has called for the terms of reference for this inquiry to be expanded. I am not sure whether he supports it or opposes it or neither supports nor opposes it, but he has clearly called for the terms of reference to be expanded, so presumably he supports it.The closing date for submissions to the inquiry has now passed, and there will be a range of hearings across the country in every state and territory, covering both rural and metropolitan areas. The inquiry has wide-ranging terms of reference and will examine competition and cost pressures at every point in the supply chain, from the farm gate to the checkout counter.In addition, one practical measure the government can take to assist families in dealing with cost-of-living pressures is to give them more information about supermarkets in their area and which is generally cheapest. This will assist in a modest way to correct the imbalance between retailers and consumers and to bring more transparency -  - to the grocery-pricing process. The ACCC is working with the government on developing a basket of goods which can be surveyed to give consumers more information about which supermarket in their area is generally the cheapest. This information will be included on a dedicated website linked to the ACCC website, implementing another election commitment of the Rudd Labor government. Consumers will of course then be able to make their own decisions, based on their own experience, and will compare quality, service delivery and price, based on their own experience and the information available on the website. Of course, it will not be possible to have the price of every good in every supermarket in Australia, but it is important to remember that, the more information consumers have, the more transparency and information we have in the grocery market in this country.Another unavoidable expense for many Australians is, of course, petrol. The House is aware of the steps that the new government has taken since its election to introduce more transparency and competition into the Australian petrol industry. The community is particularly concerned about petrol prices in the lead-up to long weekends and holiday periods. In the lead-up to Easter, the increased investigatory powers that the new government has given to the ACCC will be particularly important. On Friday, the ACCC chair, Graeme Samuel, after consulting with the government's nominee for the office of petrol commissioner, wrote to petrol companies seeking any advance information available to explain any divergence between the Singapore price of oil and the price of petrol in Australia over the Easter period. Honourable members will recall that the divergence between the price of oil in Singapore and the price of petrol -  - He clocks on about 11 years too late. That is when he should have clocked on - you should have done it 11 years ago. - I will. Thank you, Mr Speaker. Honourable members will recall that, on the last occasion the price of oil in Singapore diverged from the price of petrol in Australia, the ACCC exercised its powers given to it by the Rudd government. After those powers were exercised, the divergence disappeared and the difference between the price of oil in Singapore and the price of petrol in Australia returned to more normal levels. The House can be assured that the ACCC will not hesitate to use its formal investigative powers over the Easter period. It also can be assured that this government will take every step -  - In conclusion, the House can be assured that the government will take every step to put downward pressure on the prices which cause concern for everyday Australians - something the previous occupiers of these benches abjectly failed to do for 11 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question; it is a very important question. We have experienced regulators in this country. They are first-rate and there could not be a period in our history when they have been more important. We are talking to them daily about international financial turbulence. We have talked to them about their budget. For the next two years, we have rescinded the proposal that we took to the last election for very good reasons - because our regulators need to be as strong as they possibly can be. They need to receive the full support of the government. They are receiving the full support of the government and the full financial commitment of the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. With the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, I acknowledge the service, bravery and sacrifice of the 645 men, several of whom were from Air Force, that went down with the Sydney and, of course, the 78 personnel who were lost from the Kormoran. I think it is important that we offer congratulations to the Finding Sydney Foundation and their search leader, Mr David Mearns, who is an internationally renowned shipwreck investigator, who has added another two incredible finds to his reputation this week. He previously found Her Majesty's ship the Hood and refound the Bismarck.Today, further sonar work is being conducted around the wreck of HMAS Sydney and the debris field at increasingly higher resolutions. The Finding Sydney Foundation also hope to collect additional high-resolution images of the bow of the Kormoran. The Geosounder, which is the vessel they have leased from Singapore, will be heading back to Fremantle Port later this week to collect a remotely operated vehicle with video filming capabilities that is able to operate at a depth of 3,000 metres to further examine the wrecks of both the Sydney and the Kormoran. Defence will be conducting extensive analysis of the imagery of the HMAS Sydney wreckage to see whether it is possible to determine what may have caused her to sink, with such a tragic loss of life. The outcome of that analysis will inform us as to whether or not any further inquiry might be appropriate.I should make it clear here that the wrecks - both the Sydney and the Kormoran - will not be disturbed in any way, and only recorded and photographed. These sites of both nations' war dead will be treated with absolute respect. Already the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has declared both sites as historic shipwrecks, as the Prime Minister pointed out, with a protection zone of 200 hectares around the wrecks under the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976. It is important that we understand that this declaration will give legal protection to these vessels, their crews and the relics, from damage, disturbance and removal. Under the Historic Shipwrecks Act there will be significant penalties for anyone who engages in underwater activity within 200 hectares of the protection zone. This penalty is a fine of up to $10,000 or five years in jail. I will also be asking the environment minister to consider further levels of protection for these wrecks such as Commonwealth heritage listing, which will require the development of a management plan for the wrecks. Further actions and a management plan will also involve consultation with other Commonwealth agencies such as the commemorations and war graves area of the Department of Veterans' Affairs.As we care for the wrecks, what must not be forgotten are the families of those men who lost their lives so long ago. The government will examine the possibility of conducting a formal commemorative service on the anniversary of the sinking of HMAS Sydney in November of this year. We will also be setting up for those family members a 1800 number so that families can make a call to the Department of Defence to get information that may be available. In the first instance, the Department of Defence will be attempting to contact those family members for whom we have records to inform them of the progress. The hotline service will provide up-to-date information on the status of the search. The number will be released along with updates in coming days. In addition, the Department of Defence will also maintain an up-to-date website to inform the general public about ongoing developments.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. He would be well aware that he is slightly misrepresenting the South Australian minister here. Maybe members who are not from South Australia would not be aware that there is a GP Plus healthcare strategy in South Australia, which is a strategy about investing in primary care where centres are run by the South Australian government - some have doctors and some do not. Those that have been -  -  - In South Australia, the South Australian GP Plus clinics - some have doctors and some don't. The 31 -  -  -  - The 31 GP superclinics announced by the federal government will all have GPs in them, as our commitments have made clear. The South Australian government and the federal government will be working together on a number of sites. A number of those sites are going to be jointly funded by the state government and the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will require that the parameters set for our superclinics will be met by any state government.I think that it has been quite mischievous of the member to be raising this issue when he knows full well that the South Australian strategy, although complementary to that being supported by the Rudd Labor government, is not the same as that being initiated by the Rudd Labor government. These superclinics we are very proud of. They are an opportunity for the federal government to use their substantial contribution to ensure that we do get doctors, nurses and allied health professionals working together for the benefit of the community, providing better chronic disease care management - making sure that parents of young children can go to the one place to get the assistance of a doctor, a dietitian, a physio and others. These are an opportunity for us to make a real difference to the services that are provided in these regions.I know members on this side of the House - including, I am sure, the member for Makin, where the Modbury superclinic will be established - are very pleased that there is a Commonwealth government prepared to invest in health services across this country, prepared to put money into health services in communities where they are needed, and make sure that the Commonwealth investment is used to make sure that we can attract, in particular, doctors to a number of places where there are shortages and where we can work with state governments to complement the money that they are going to put into these sectors as well. In the member for Makin's electorate, there is going to be a superclinic in Modbury. There are going to be 31 other superclinics, and they will be designed -  - to make sure we can deliver the best possible high-quality services to those communities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. There is a wide dimension of dangers of inaction in relation to addressing climate change: regional security, our environment, the economy and our society. At the last election the Australian people made it clear they wanted a government that was prepared to rise to the tackling of climate change. Since the election, the Rudd Labor government has set about delivering on our commitments - commitments to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions to some 60 per cent of 2000 levels by 2050; a commitment to ratify the Kyoto protocol as the first act of the Rudd government; and a commitment to implement a $500 million national Clean Coal Fund and a $500 million Renewable Energy Fund.Through my own department, we are implementing a range of commitments that will change the way the Australian community goes about energy and water efficiency. These include low-interest green loans for household energy and water efficiency improvements, along with customised home energy audits, expansion of the Solar Cities program with new solar cities in Perth and in Coburg in Victoria and grants of up to $50,000 from 1 July this year to make every school a solar school. Crucially, these initiatives are intended to complement emissions trading, which sits at the heart of our efforts to reduce emissions, and today the government have announced a detailed timetable for the design and implementation of emissions trading. We have set out a detailed timetable, which will see emissions-trading schemes commence in 2010. We will take a careful and methodical approach to finalising the design of emissions trading. An exposure draft of emissions-trading legislation will be released in December 2008 but community and industry, I must stress, will be invited to have their say on a green paper to be released in July 2008 outlining key design issues and options.Emissions trading is a significant undertaking and it has been introduced in response to a significant challenge. Reports that some members may have seen today from the United Nations Environment Program suggesting that the rate at which some of the world's glaciers are melting has more than doubled are very troubling and concerning indeed. For those of us that have followed closely the science of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change these reports are yet again a very clear symbol, a very clear sign and now very clear evidence of the urgency with which we must address climate change. The member asked me about the dangers of inaction. It is a danger we see almost daily when people engage in a confected debate which raises the spectres of the costs of action without ever recognising the implications of unabated climate change for our economy, for our environment and for our society. It was a debate that was engaged in by the member for Barker in this place last month, when he said:If we are going to have problems as a result of climate change ... I think the most sensible approach would be to adapt.He then said:In the end, some of the other suggestions that have been put forward are going to come at a great cost to the Australian economy.We heard another contribution to this debate from the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, on 5 March in Washington, when he referred to discussions of climate change science as 'intellectual bullying and moralising'. He said, when he was introducing these remarks:The left liberal grip on educational institutions and large, though not all, sections of the media remains intense.The government is getting on with the job of addressing the great challenge of climate change. It is not caught up in false, arid and ancient debates. This government is not scaremongering about the costs of acting on climate change whilst never acknowledging the dangers to our economy and our way of life from soaring greenhouse gas emissions. And, if there is a danger in climate change debate, it is the danger of 11Â½ years of delay, inaction, scepticism and scaremongering by members on the other side on this issue. I will just make this final point. When the Assistant Treasurer came to the box and produced what I thought was a compelling answer in the House, the Leader of the Opposition said to him in an interjection, 'We'll be back to get you when we get a price on carbon.' - And he has just confirmed those comments. This underscores the different approaches between a government on one hand and an opposition on the other whose only approach to climate change is to scaremonger on the costs of action to deal with this issue. The fact of the matter is that it is the costs of inaction that outweigh the costs of action, something the government understand. We are getting on with the job of taking responsibility for securing Australia's long-term sustainable prosperity, unlike those on the other side.</DOC>

 - I find it remarkable that the opposition asks questions about housing, given that for 12 years there was, firstly, no minister for housing, secondly, no department of housing and, thirdly, no housing policy on the part of those opposite. When it comes to practical measures to assist those who are seeking to buy their first home, the first obstacle they are up against is high interest rates. The party of new-found compassion, those opposite, seem to overlook the fact that interest rates rose 10 times in a row in their period of office. The reason interest rates rose 10 times in a row and have risen twice since then is, in large measure, that the previous government allowed the inflation genie out of the bottle. When we took over office, inflation was running at a 16-year high and we had interest rates that were the second highest in the developed world. - To further my answer to the question, if you look at the measures, therefore, which deal effectively with the housing challenge facing working families, No. 1 is dealing with the inflation challenge. Let us actually look at the logic here. If you allow inflation to become uncontrolled in the economy, if you allow inflationary pressures to rise without acting on them, what happens is that upwards pressure occurs on interest rates, and then interest rates go up and then you squeeze people out of the housing market. There were 10 interest rate rises in a row - the world's second highest interest rates, when we assumed office, as far as the developed economies are concerned - and then on top of that inflation was running at 16-year -  - The core of the challenge for working families and those struggling with interest rate pressures now is a result of this: a previous government which did not contain inflation and which put upward pressure on interest rates, and this, as a consequence, flowing through to cost-of-living pressures for working families. This is why inflation remains the core article of our response to the economic challenges which face Australia today. Inflation and interest rates affect working families.On the substance of housing policy, in response to -  -  - If those opposite think that housing policy can be addressed in the absence of inflation and interest rates, I find that a remarkable departure from core economic logic. Why those opposite seem to respond so audibly and with great agitation to the logic I was pointing out before is that they were responsible for inflation getting out of control, beyond the three per cent margin, and they were responsible, as a consequence, for upward pressure on interest rates. Therefore, they are responsible for the extraordinary mortgage rate pressures which are currently being experienced by working families.Prior to the election, we undertook to implement three core sets of housing policies. One is the first home saver accounts. The second relates to what we do for affordable rental accommodation. The third relates to -  - These policies - a total funding commitment of about half a billion dollars and in toto about $1.6 billion - represent one key fact: $1.6 billion more than those opposite provided for public investment in the housing challenges of working families. The housing policy they took to the last election adds up to this figure: one big, fat zero. On the pre-election commitment -  - On the whole question of housing affordability, which the NATSEM report goes to, you have to deal with the inflation-interest rates challenge and you have to deal with the other housing policy settings. We have put forward one such policy. On the question of the pre-election commitment which we made on the first home saver accounts, we stand by everything we put to the Australian people, including the eligibility criteria that we outlined there. We believe this is a good piece of public policy, and the reason is that it is the first time it has been embraced in this country. For 12 years, those opposite sat silently, idly by while so many working families, so many Australians, dealing with the mortgage challenge they faced as a consequence of successive interest rate rises were simply left to languish. The response by those opposite, the party of new-found compassion, was in these words: 'Working families have never been better off.'Let me conclude by saying this: our pre-election commitments on housing, which are $1.6 billion more than those opposite - the new-found party of compassion - will actually be honoured. We do not divide them into core promises and non-core promises. One of those commitments was the first home saver accounts. The criteria for the first home saver accounts were articulated clearly before the election. We have a mandate to implement them in the manner in which they were put to the people, and implementing them we are.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. The national interest in and response to the discovery of the final resting place of the HMAS Sydney and her crew of 645 have been overwhelming. This discovery and the tragic loss of life need to be marked in a manner befitting the significance and importance to this nation. The Navy is planning a commemorative ceremony in the near future, possibly in the next two weeks. The ceremony, while low-key, will include the laying of a suitably worded plaque and a wreath over the Sydney site. We are also planning a national memorial service to be held in Sydney on 24 April, the day before Anzac Day. This will provide an opportunity for families and other members of the public to commemorate the tragic loss of Sydney and its crew. We will be releasing further details about a venue and timing shortly.In addition, a national commemoration will be held on 19 November, on the 67th anniversary of the loss of Sydney. Options being considered include a memorial service at the HMAS Sydney memorial site at Geraldton and a commemorative onboard service on the current HMAS Sydney over the wreck of the Sydney. Of course, family members will be invited. Simultaneously on 19 November, we are planning a memorial service at the Australian War Memorial here in Canberra.We are liaising with the German government regarding appropriate recognition of the loss of their sailors at the HSK Kormoran site. As I announced yesterday, Defence is setting up a 1800 number for families to call to make sure that they are being kept informed. The number will be released as soon as the hotline is operational. In addition, the Department of Defence is developing a website to keep the public up to date about developments. We are also looking at other ways, including fact sheets, to provide appropriate information to family and friends.The SV Geosounder will be returning to Geraldton late this week and is scheduled to arrive on the evening of Thursday, 20 March. The SV Geosounder is expected to return to Sydney's site to carry out video and photographic examination of the wreckage from this Sunday. Similar examination of the Kormoran site will also be carried out once protocols to dive over the wreck have been established between the Australian and German governments. Specialist add-on remote operating vehicle camera and video equipment is being airfreighted in from Norway. This will provide enhanced capability for taking high-definition photographs. Specialist lighting equipment that can be attached to the ROVs is already on standby on the SV Geosounder.Five specialist ROV operators are currently being mobilised from within Australia and will join the Geosounder once she has returned to port. The remotely operated vehicles will not interfere with the vessels in any way or retrieve any objects or artefacts from the seabed. Once we have gathered the data, the Chief of the Defence Force will convene a commission of inquiry to determine what facts can be established about the loss of the Sydney.</DOC>

 - Members will be aware that US monetary authorities have recently been acting in relation to the challenges which now present themselves on global and US financial markets. This presents real challenges for US monetary authorities and for monetary authorities around the world as financial institutions are encountering various ranges of liquidity shortfalls. In the last week, the US Federal Reserve has taken a series of important actions to reassure financial markets. First, over the weekend the Fed approved a $30 billion loan to assist JP Morgan to help finance the acquisition of Bear Stearns; second, it has expanded its role as an emergency lender to include investment banks as well as commercial banks; and, third, it has cut the discount rate - the rate at which banks borrow money from the Fed - to 3.25 per cent from 3.5 per cent. In the six months since September last year, the Federal Reserve's key interest rate has been reduced from 5.25 per cent to three per cent, and today the Federal Open Market Committee will meet in Washington to consider further monetary policy adjustments.The Australian government welcome the Fed's efforts to stabilise markets and, through our own monetary authorities and other authorities, we are closely monitoring the situation as it unfolds. Australia must, as a consequence of developments in the global economy, continue to pursue a prudent economic strategy in the face of these challenges abroad but also in the face of the domestic economic challenges we face at home. That includes, of course, the inflation challenge.The Reserve Bank has repeatedly warned that Australia faces inflationary challenges. Inflation is elevated because Australia's productive capacity has not kept pace with growing demand. The lessons for all of us on these questions are very clear. First, it is impossible for any responsible government dealing with responsible economic management to ignore the inflation challenge. You need to deal with the inflation challenge. Second, it is impossible for any responsible government dealing with the challenges which now present themselves across the economy to continue to support policies of profligate spending, contributing to unsustainable growth in demand. Third, it is not responsible, particularly given the last 20 sets of warnings which emerged from the Reserve Bank, not to invest on the supply side of the economy in skills and infrastructure. These are the lessons which we take to heart, and they underpin the approach we take in the overall management of the economy.On the question of dealing with the inflation challenge that we are presented with, it is important that the House be seized of the fact that, when this government took over, inflation was running at a 16-year high. As a consequence of that, and the inattention to it by those who preceded us, we have the second highest interest rates in the advanced world. So the challenge that we face in framing the upcoming budget is to make sure that we are attending to these emerging pressures across the global economy - which are real, significant and substantial and should not occasion laughter on the part of those opposite - and that we are dealing simultaneously with the challenges of domestic inflation.High inflation, if left unaddressed, is an enemy of working families because of the roll-through effect of interest rates on disposable family income, not the least of which is people's ability to pay their mortgages. That is why, in our overall approach to the economy, acting on inflation remains key. That is why, from January this year, within six weeks of taking office, we embraced a five-point strategy for dealing with the threat of inflation, hinging on, firstly, what we do by way of producing a responsible budget which maintains a responsible surplus, given the circumstances that we now face; secondly, dealing with the challenge of boosting private savings; thirdly, dealing with the challenge of skills; fourthly, infrastructure; and, fifthly, enhancing productivity and dealing with the challenges of workforce participation. What now unfolds in the global economy is of real moment to the nation and every working family in the nation. I would strongly recommend to all members of the House, including those who regard this as a matter of rolling humour and interjection, that these are serious matters, requiring the serious attention of Australia's monetary policy authorities and other economic authorities as we seek to ensure that this economy has a robust future. That means being attentive to the inflation challenge. That means pursuing a policy of prudent economic management. That means ensuring that we do not sustain the profligate levels of spending inherited from those who preceded us.</DOC>

 - Dr Nicholas Gruen is not my adviser, as was stated in the question from the member for Dickson. That is yet another thing that is wrong in a question from the opposition. We had it from the member for Wentworth all last week - factually incorrect statements in questions. Dr Gruen is not my adviser. I have indicated in a speech that I will be seeking to get assistance from him on the matter of deregulation -  - Exactly. And your point is? -  - I hope you can do better than this in the last five or six questions in question time, folks. Dr Gruen is not my adviser. As a person who is a respected columnist in a number of journals, he is entitled to express views on other matters as he sees fit, as indeed any other consultant who works for government, be they from KPMG or Deloitte or whoever, is entitled to express views or to work for clients as they see fit.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. We have just come from about an hour and a half debate in the federal parliamentary Labor Party on what various members of the party have found in their local communities on the homelessness front. They have been out visiting shelters for the homeless. Also, what is now an emerging development is the fact that homeless shelters are having to cope with people who are falling out of the housing market because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages. This was a most serious debate and discussion that we had. Those who have traditionally provided shelter services are now having to deal with a whole group of families who, for the first time, are having to rely upon various charities across the country to provide them with transitional accommodation and in some cases crisis accommodation because affordability has become such a real problem.Some of the statistics referred to in the report by AMP and NATSEM released today are worth recording for the House. I note that these were not referred to in the earlier question to me. The report describes the 1995-96 to 2005-06 period as a decade of dwindling hope. What are the actual figures when it comes to housing affordability? This is a figure which I think should sear itself into people's attention. In 1995-96, according to this report, purchasing a typical home cost less than five times annual income. In 2005-06 that ratio had blown out to 7Â½ times annual income. Therein lies the core definition of the housing affordability problem. Whatever increases occurred in the disposable income of households in that period of time have not kept pace with the extraordinary explosion in overall housing costs. That is the absolute core of the housing affordability problem.In response to an earlier question I ran through our responses on housing affordability generally: firstly, a half billion dollar program, the first home saver account; and, secondly, a half billion dollar program to provide affordable rental accommodation which is designed to bring into stock 100,000 additional units of affordable rental accommodation for the nation over time. Thirdly, we want to deal with the real challenge which local authorities and state governments have brought to our attention nationwide, and to that of the development industry, which is: how do you bring down the level of infrastructure charging on new housing developments? That is why we have also put forward our proposal for a half billion dollar fund to deal with housing affordability, with the object of bringing down local infrastructure charging, with the participation of local authorities, by as much as 20 per cent.This is one part of the problem. The other is when it flips over into actual homelessness. Here the data becomes so compelling. In the presentations I received from so many of my backbenchers today - and 38 of them spoke in the debate in the parliamentary party - they reported that in the various centres that they visited right across the nation, from electorates spanning Fremantle to Launceston, the constant reply was that there is such a huge and growing turn-away rate for homeless shelters across the country. There are turn-away rates of 40 per cent, 50 per cent or 100 per cent, depending on where you are. This means that we have a problem in the physical availability of crisis accommodation stock in the country. This is a big problem.The attendant problem is that, with people who are using homeless shelters, the recurrence of the problem - that is, people who use a homeless shelter but, through the inadequate provision of associated health facilities, dental facilities, mental health facilities, become return visitors to homeless shelters - is huge. This problem has not received sufficient ventilation in the national debate. It must do so. It is a crying shame for Australia that, according to the census data, we have 100,000 people classified as homeless. It is a crying shame for Australia that, according to the data, we have some 10,000 people who are sleeping rough each night. The reports from individual caucus members about individual stories of distress, discomfort and plain financial disaster are disturbing deeply. That is why the first white paper commissioned by this government is on homelessness. We as a nation have to get this right not just in boosting the physical supply of stock for homeless across the country but also by dealing with it in a way where we actually bring down the number of people who use these services on a repeat basis. It is a core hallmark of whether we are a decent society or not. It therefore commands our attention. These days it doubly commands our attention because of the data contained in the report released today by NATSEM and the AMP, which points to this ballooning housing affordability problem for working families everywhere, placing all of them at risk of one day having to contemplate the possibility of needing emergency accommodation themselves. That is why this government is determined to act in this area. It is of fundamental relevance to all working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. No, I do not regret it for one moment. It is not more reliable than the CPI. It is not more reliable than the Reserve Bank's underlying rate of inflation. It is not as reliable as the Reserve Bank's underlying rate of inflation. That is the situation in economics. - Because that is the view of the Treasury and that is the view -  -  - So we are going to question the honesty and integrity of the Treasury again, are we? Are you going to put your foot in your mouth again? The truth is that anyone who understands the consumer price index in this country, anyone who understands inflation, knows it is the consumer price index and the Reserve Bank measures of underlying inflation -  - They are the ones that are showing that inflation is at a 16-year high. - The sound effects man up the back is going to put his hand up again! A 16-year high! The member for Wentworth came into the House last night and gave a speech on inflation. Do you know what he had to say here last night? - Because it is not a more reliable measure. Here we have another fiction from the member for Wentworth. He came into this House last night and gave a speech on inflation. Do you know what he had to say? Listen to this. He said in the fight against inflation it was 'mission accomplished'. Can you believe this guy? What planet is the member for Wentworth living on? He does not sit around the same kitchen table as the average Australian. They know inflation is high. - The member for Wentworth was in the House. It was about 5.30 last night. He gave a long speech about the Australian economy. In it he declared the battle against inflation was 'mission accomplished'. All that was missing was the banner, the jumpsuit and the aircraft carrier. - I would be absolutely delighted, Mr Speaker. What is this all about? This is about covering up the legacy of those opposite - the highest underlying inflation in 16 years. The member for Wentworth will say anything and do anything in his quest to get rid of the Leader of the Opposition, to get a cheap headline, to tell a lie about a particular figure, to distort and attack the head of the Treasury. He will do anything. Last night in the House he declared that the battle against inflation was 'mission accomplished'. - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. Those opposite do not want to front up to their legacy, a legacy of incompetence, which produced the highest underlying inflation in 16 years - recognised by the IMF, the Treasury and the Reserve Bank - and they cannot live with their dreadful legacy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. This government is committed to delivering strong surpluses, getting government spending back under control and targeting investment to increase the productive capacity of our economy, because that is what is required in the fight against inflation - a fight the opposition do not recognise. They argue that inflation in this economy commenced on Monday morning, 26 November last year. The truth is that it did not. It has been on the march for a couple of years. That is what the Reserve Bank says, that is what the Treasury says, and they certainly cannot live with it. Part of the reason is that spending got out of control. Spending increases under this government have been at the highest level in any four-year period in the last 15 years. That is the legacy of the member for Higgins, who complained to Mr Howard's biographers that he could not control the previous Prime Minister. The result of that has been eight interest rate rises in the last three years. That is their legacy. We are determined to put in place our five-point plan to tackle inflation and to look after Australian families who need some relief.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question because we do take cost of living pressures very seriously on this side of the House, unlike those opposite who did not take them seriously for 11 years, which is why we have a petrol commissioner in place in the ACCC. It feeds into inflation; there is no doubt about that. That is why we on this side of the House will take every possible action that we can take to put downward pressure on prices and make sure that markets are competitive.The member for Aston then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - Inflation is at the highest level that Australia has experienced in 16 years and it is being fuelled by government spending, which is running at a 4Â½ per cent increase in real terms in the current financial year. Treasury analysis published last week gave us some indication as to why this is the case. It showed that over the past four budgets the former Liberal government virtually had no savings initiatives at all. Only about five per cent of the total new initiatives in the budget over the past four years constituted savings. In other words, in the budgets for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007, roughly 95 per cent was new spending and five per cent was savings. The Treasury document shows, when you get to the 2007 budget, that the savings bar on the graph is so tiny you can barely see it. That is one of the key reasons why we have an inflation problem in this country, and that is one of the problems that this government is committed to tackling.Unfortunately, not much has changed on the other side. They do not believe that this is a problem. They do not believe there is an inflation problem. The member for Wentworth has said it is all a fairytale. The Leader of the National Party thinks the solution to the problem is to increase spending. And they are still advocating further increases in government spending. Recently we got a very interesting proposal for a new piece of very substantial government spending from the member for Mayo, the last of the Bourbons, in an article in the Adelaide Advertiser headed 'Build us a beacon', in which he put forward his view about what the government should be spending its money on. He called on the government to build:... the most innovative, unique, attractive art museum in the southern hemisphere - in Adelaide, with:... a 1000-seat concert hall - designed by Frank Gehry or Norman Foster; a building that would:... excite the world in the way presidential monuments like the Pompidou Centre or the Quai Branly museum do in France.And, of course, he suggested that it should be built in the hills, to keep the riffraff out, as well! The member for Mayo did raise some concerns about the cost, and I quote: - The member for Mayo did express some concern about the cost. He said:OK, it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars ... maybe $300 million. That's a lot. And I'm not a big government advocate by any means. ... The State and Federal governments could both contribute and the cost would be spread over several years.It must have been a very, very long lunch. And this is not the only profligate lunch that has been occurring recently. I understand that a number of members of the opposition were spotted having lunch at Timmy's today while the Leader of the Opposition was actually giving his speech. The member for Indi, the member for Mackellar, the member for Hume, the member for Dickson -  - I am not sure if the member for Wentworth was present at the lunch, Mr Speaker -  - He was certainly there in spirit, as the Prime Minister indicated. I have been critical of the National Party's attitude to government spending in this place on odd occasions, but -  -  - It's about government spending! -  - Mr Speaker, I have been critical of the Leader of the National Party for his attitude to government spending in recent times, but I would have to say this in his defence: at least his monument, the Fishing Hall of Fame, was only going to cost the taxpayer $3 million. The member for Mayo's monument, the one that he is proposing, is $300 million. His answer and the Liberal Party's answer to all of those Australians who are out there suffering higher prices in groceries, higher rents or higher mortgage payments and who are worried about inflation is, 'Let them eat cake.' That is the position that the Liberal Party and the member for Mayo put in this bizarre spending proposal.That is not the position of the government. We accept there is a serious challenge here for the Australian government to get inflation back into the Reserve Bank target band. We accept that there is a serious challenge for this government to get government spending down to a reasonable level, not at a 4Â½ per cent real terms increase per annum. And most particularly, we accept that it is critical that government spending is directed to investments that will build the economic capacity of this nation for the long term, for our children - the infrastructure and skills that will generate high levels of productivity, economic growth and wellbeing for future Australians.</DOC>

 - I am very pleased to get a question from the shadow minister opposite. And I am particularly pleased to get a question about the Tree of Knowledge -  -  - in Barcaldine in Queensland because indeed it was the former Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell - rest his soul - who listed the Tree of Knowledge on the National Heritage List on 26 January 2006. I can understand that they did not check with former Senator Campbell before they asked the question, but maybe they should have checked with the member for Flinders, because this is what the member for Flinders, who knows his history, had to say on 28 January 2006:Heritage and Environment parliamentary secretary Greg Hunt said the 150-year-old tree, 1000km northwest of Brisbane, had played a major role in Australia's political and regional history - 'a major role'!But there is more. They could have spoken to the local member, the member for Maranoa, about what he thinks about the project, because the member for Maranoa said that he was pleased to see the historic symbol awarded such an honour. He said: 'The Tree of Knowledge reminds' -  -  - I bet he is not supporting the amalgamation. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. This was a good question. The National Party is full of deadwood, but we do not worry about it. We do not say that you should not be represented here. - We think that is fine. There is more. This is what Senator Campbell had to say about the killing of the tree. On 21 May 2006, with appropriate respect for an iconic heritage listed site, he said:We condemn the action and we will work closely with the Queensland Government to make sure this site - wait for it - is properly protected and the history properly commemorated.I understand why we, on this side of the House, have 117 years of proud history and know what we stand for. Those on the other side of the House do not even know the name of their amalgamated party. The National Party is full of deadwood. The Liberal Party is all over the shop. We understand why they object to the commemoration of this historic site. But this historic site is important not just for the local community as an important tourist attraction but also to all those who want to understand the important history of this nation. That is why Labor has committed funding to support the ongoing protection and establishment of a memorial at the site, the interpretation of the Australian Tree of Knowledge story within the Australian Workers Heritage Centre, and the creation of a theme pathway to enable visitors to walk to the memorial and to facilitate access to the museum and town. We stand by this project and our history. You stand for nothing.</DOC>

 - I think it is interesting that this question should come in a context where members opposite are trying to feign some interest in the effectiveness of government spending, because when they were in government apparently it was entirely appropriate, as far as they were concerned, to waste $121 million on Work Choices propaganda - money ripped out of the purses and wallets of hardworking Australian taxpayers in a desperate attempt to try and pay for their re-election campaign. It is true that we do have left 97,898 mousepads. We do have that many left.We have put out a call to the Australian people about the best way of using these surplus Work Choices mousepads like the one I am holding up here. We have received some very interesting suggestions. One member of the public has suggested that they would be good under-floor insulation for public buildings. You lay them face up, pour concrete over the top of them and then you walk on them. That is one suggestion we have had, and I think it is a pretty good one. Another is that they could be cut up to make feet for chairs and stoppers for cabinets because of the spongy nature of the material. A third suggestion is that you could use the back, decorate it and then use it as a placemat - also a very good suggestion. We have had mothers suggesting that they could take a cookie cutter, cut out a shape and spray paint it to make a good decoration for a child's bedroom. We have had schools and craft groups approach us for using mouse mats for a comparable purpose.For all those Australians who detested Work Choices, who wanted to see it gone, who believed it was an offence to Australian values and that the Liberal Party's extremism should not be allowed to stand, there is the suggestion that we stamp 'cancelled' over them, and they could be a good piece of memorabilia. The suggestions from the public do not end there. We have had suggestions for mudflaps, stubby holders or putting mousepads together so that you could have enough to make a yoga mat. -  - I am at least assured that, if I happen to accidentally break this one, there are plenty more where it came from. - Then of course there is the suggestion that they be used as the bottom for green shopping bags, something the minister for the environment would approve of, giving you a nice firm surface at the bottom of your green shopping bag. We have had the suggestion that they could be used for notice boards, shin pads for soccer, innersole pads for shoes, doormats or, my personal favourite, floor liners for portaloos - a good use of Work Choices surplus mousepads.I am reassured, having sought advice, that, under the provisions of the Financial Management Act, an official or a minister can make a gift of this property on the basis that it was acquired as a gift. Well, it was not really a gift, was it, when Australian taxpayers paid for it. But we are in a circumstance where we can provide mousepads to those who ask for them. On that basis we will be providing 5,000 mousepads to the Mental Health Activity and Learning Centre, who are planning to cut them up because of the colours and use them in a large mural. We will also be forwarding a large number of mousepads to two schools who have requested a bulk number, no doubt to use in art and craft classes.We are continuing to collect expressions of interest from members of the public. We have a lot of mousepads to get rid of, so we are going to need a few more good suggestions - so please send them in. We are also asking for suggestions about what to do with the 77,000 pens and the 100,000 plastic folders we have left over from the excess of the extremists in workplace relations who sit opposite.</DOC>

 - When it comes to the needs of women in these terrible circumstances and their families, suffering miscarriage, suffering from still births, of course every level of humane service should be provided. These are very difficult and awful times for families to go through. There are a range of services out there in the community that provide services to women and to families, one of which is Bonnie Babes - I will come back to that in a minute - another of which is Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Support Australia, SANDS. Then there is SIDS and Kids and the Stillbirth Foundation. When it comes to the application which was made to the previous government for funding by the organisation Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Support Australia, SANDS, no support was forthcoming from the previous government. That is just a fact. -  - Secondly, on the question of the Bonnie Babes Foundation, let the record again speak for itself: this organisation, which I am absolutely confident does great work, was not funded by the previous government in previous budgets. The previous government made a pre-election commitment on it but there was no flow of funding to the organisation by the previous government during its period in office. Therefore, the challenge that we are presented with is: how do we effectively ensure that women who need these critical services are provided with proper counselling and support across the range of agencies that exist? The responsible course of action, both in these areas and also when it comes to postnatal depression, is to ensure that we have a proper examination right across the sector. The minister has already announced a way to do that. And, in the context of that examination, the minister will be actively consulting with Bonnie Babes and with the other organisations - SANDS, SIDS and Kids and the Stillbirth Foundation - to make sure that we get the best set of services possible for women who are dealing with these extraordinary challenges.We are talking about an amount of money that has been put forward by Bonnie Babes, and there are requests by others as well. I find it remarkable that those opposite, when it comes to the overall balance in the allocation of government funding, could have happily spent $120-plus million on taxpayer funded advertising on Work Choices. When it comes to that $121 million my strong suggestion to those opposite is that it would have been much better spent right across public health, right across dental health. Instead of abolishing the Commonwealth Dental Health Scheme, why did you not dedicate those funds to the proper delivery of dental services, to the whole raft of perinatal and postnatal services, to the health sector in general? Instead, the former government invested $121 million in an area of spending which could only be described as political propaganda.In addressing these areas of need, community organisations, non-government organisations and organisations that deliver important services, such as Bonnie Babes, are to be commended. The minister will be consulting with these organisations during the course of her review. We will make sure that the proper delivery of funding to support these critical services for women experiencing these distressing circumstances is met into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. He, like so many others in this House, really understands that problem gambling wrecks so many lives. People who are addicted to gambling know, unfortunately, that it is a very dangerous and damaging drug. It wrecks families and it wrecks workplaces. So many people in Australia are suffering from it. It is hard to believe that, on a per capita basis, Australia has roughly five times as many gaming machines as the United States. We certainly know that there are no easy solutions. There is a mountain of challenges that we have to address when confronting this difficult area.Just today, the Prime Minister met with Tim Costello to discuss some of the ways in which this very difficult issue should be tackled. Key to tackling this problem has to be working with a very wide range of stakeholders. I will be convening a meeting of the Ministerial Council on Gambling. Those opposite might be aware that the council was originally established in 1999. It is made up of state and territory gambling ministers and is chaired by the Commonwealth. When this council was originally established, the then Prime Minister said that the council would 'focus on stopping further expansion of gambling in Australia'. It is amazing then that the council has not met since 2006. I say to those opposite: how on earth can a council stop the expansion of gambling if it does not meet?Unfortunately, it is the case that the Howard government's inaction on gambling did not stop there. In fact, its record reads like an expose of how little the previous government cared about this very, very serious social and economic menace. Let us go through some of the things that the Howard government said it would do. It said that it would establish a national advisory body and it then disbanded it in 2003. In addition, a ministerial working group to consider access to cash in gaming venues was dissolved in 2006. It is hardly surprising that the state governments in South Australia and Victoria gave up waiting on the Howard government to do anything and had to act on their own accord to limit access to cash machines in gambling venues. You would think that the previous government worked overtime not to do anything about problem gambling.However, it does seem that there was quite a spurt of activity back in 2003. Back then, the Howard government did think about running a national campaign on problem gambling. Just one example of its thinking was the $1.1 million it spent on getting an agency to develop storyboards for another creative content campaign. An amount of $1.1 million was spent on these creative storyboards. I am sure that the Minister for Health and Ageing is very interested in what the previous government spent $1.1 million on. This is what it actually spent the money on. The Minister for Health and Ageing rightly says, 'And then what happened?' Absolutely nothing. The former government wasted $1.1 million on these pictures and presentations about possible ideas for an advertising campaign to help encourage people to stop gambling, and nothing came of it - a waste of $1.1 million with zero to show for it. It just goes to show that this previous government did absolutely nothing to deal with what is a very, very serious social and economic menace in this country - and we intend to do something about it.</DOC>

 - As the member opposite knows full well, the reason he has those dates and the reason he has that information is that it was all declared in due time in the appropriate course on the public register. As the former minister also would be fully aware, it being my first term in parliament, there would be no public money available if I were to do any overseas travel relative to my portfolio. To have private sponsorship was the only way that that was able to be done. -  - I noticed the interjection from the member of the Nationals just then as I was saying that. The member of the Nationals would remember seeing me at the Boao conference, which he attended with me. We were both there at the Boao conference on Hainan Island in China. Of course, the Leader of the Nationals was at that conference with me, paid for by the Australian taxpayer. But I was there at the same conference, attending the same meetings, listening to the same speeches from the world leaders who were present. I do not begrudge that the taxpayer paid that, but obviously, as a shadow minister, the only opportunity in my first term to be able to attend those meetings -  -  - The question asked about the meetings. I am letting you know. Why don't you just ask Warren? - The Leader of the Nationals would also know a fair bit about that company, given that they have sat on the main table at National Party fundraisers next to him.Also, when the trips were detailed then, I noticed that the trip to Manila was not referred to. I think that is just as important to mention on the public record. When I travelled through Manila, that was disclosed as well. The reason for that, of course, was that that was the opportunity to meet with the 55 remaining members of the stateless Vietnamese who had been waiting for a durable solution for some 20 years at that point. Other meetings that took place during that time included meeting Henry Tang, of Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong office of Fragomen, the largest immigration business in the world. Obviously I had some significant interest in trying to get to the bottom of some very significant rorts in immigration that were coming out of China at that time with respect to the 457 visa. The list of meetings goes on from that, but, as I say, this is all available and on the public record. That is why you are able to ask the question. That is why it was disclosed according to the rules of the parliament each step of the way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I note that we have now had more than 200 questions in this House, and we are yet to get a single question from that side of the House, including from the Nationals, about anything to do with agriculture - more than 200 questions, and not one about anything to do with agriculture. It is not as if there are not significant issues out there - for example, the issue that I was just asked about by the member for Kingston.Look at the impact of climate change. I know there is a consensus that has emerged over the last 10 years for those opposite, and it is essentially this: climate change has definitely been happening for the last three months. That is about the level of consensus on climate change. You talk to anyone in South Australia at the moment working the land. They are living climate change. The heatwave that has just been endured has been described and reported today by one scientist as a one-in-3,000-year event. - The member for Kalgoorlie says, 'Ah, it's just the weather.' Member for Kalgoorlie, come in spinner, because the scientists around the world have acknowledged what I thought the members opposite had at least understood for the last three months.I had the opportunity to talk to Wayne Cornish, the President of the South Australian Farmers Federation, shortly before question time. He took me through some of the devastation which is being felt through this heatwave. Let us make no mistake: we have just had in South Australia 15 consecutive days at more than 35-degree heat. Wayne Cornish took me through the impact on various industries. There has been significant sunburn on salad vegetables, lettuces and leeks. Because of the nature of that produce, the turnover tends to be quick enough that they will not be as hard hit as others. From the apple and pear growers, for the crops that were still available in that part of horticulture, the image was given of granny smith apples that should at this stage be completely green but, after the last fortnight, are completely brown on one side. But no area has been harder hit than viticulture. The member for Kingston is very much aware of the impact on viticulture in her seat. The wine grape growers who had not yet found space to get to the crushing plants have either seen the crops wither on the vine or are now facing critical sugar levels which they are having to continue to monitor.Virtually every industry in agriculture is affected. Because the areas affected have already been declared for exceptional circumstances payments, farmers in the worst affected regions are eligible for EC support. They should contact the National Drought Hotline on 132316, and the South Australian Rural Financial Counselling Service is also available.I met with senior officials from my department today to work out how we can do more to work through not just adaptation but better preparation. We know that on climate change there has been much discussion -  - I acknowledge the member for Flinders - there has been much discussion as though climate change is only about water. It is not just that. An important part of it is an increase in the severity and frequency of major weather events. That is what is happening right now in South Australia. It is tremendously important that both sides of the House live up to the rhetoric that we heard at the National Press Club today and acknowledge that climate change is real and that we as a parliament and we as a government have an obligation to help people working the land to prepare for the future.</DOC>

 - On this visit: as I said yesterday, it was to deal with the matters that the honourable member raised. First of all, in the case of Sudan, it was about the crisis in western Darfur. The itinerary I had for that visit has the following: arriving Khartoum 5.35 in the morning; head off to the United Nations mission; then off to the United States embassy; call on the Charge d'Affaires,Cameron Hume; depart the United States embassy for the National Assembly; call on key National Assembly figures, including the Speaker; then head off to the World Food Program compound; then head off to an informal dinner with representatives of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Federal Police. There are about 20 of them on deployment there, in an important continuing peacekeeping operation. That was the first day. The following day, I have here: meeting with World Vision project officer. Then I had dinner with the then visiting Irish Ambassador, Richard O'Brien, who had recently been appointed here in Canberra. Then there was a visit - and I do not have the page for that - to western Darfur itself. The host organisation was World Vision. In fact I mentioned it briefly in my discussion with Tim Costello today. This is completely normal and, as I said before, if the then government seriously have reservations about the sponsorship from this company, why does the now opposition contain within its ranks the National Party, who received $100,000 worth of funding? - If the now opposition and then government have reservations about sponsorship from this particular company, why is it that the now opposition and then government, including the National Party within that government, were perfectly happy to receive $100,000 worth of political donations? - The document is confidential.</DOC>

 - As members of this House and many members of the public who have been contacting us about the announcement made by the Prime Minister last week would be aware, the Rudd Labor government have committed $53 million to tackle teenage binge drinking. We have in this House previously outlined three components of that initiative, including further details that were provided last week when the Prime Minister, the Minister for Youth and Sport and I met with the heads of several of Australia's major sporting codes. What I would like to address today, going to the question the member for Page asked - and I know that many of my colleagues on this side of the House have a particular interest in this - is this: what are the ways that local communities can get involved and be part of the solution to this significant problem? We have allocated $7 million of the $14Â½ million that we are investing in community level initiatives to support a range of local solutions to these problems. I would like to invite and encourage all members to start talking within their local communities - whether it is to P&amp;C committees, whether it is to the local police, whether it is to clubs, schools or maybe even local councils or to others who have ideas - about ways that local community solutions and projects could be supported in order to tackle this problem and get a good strong message through to young people that this is something that is harming their health, harming the community, causing a lot of grief and suffering and if permanent damage to their health is done it will not be able to be undone in the future.It is interesting. We were very pleased that, when we announced the policy, the Leader of the Opposition supported it. The Leader of the Opposition was very clear in saying that he thought we were living in a society where we have to do everything we can to educate young people, to educate our children, about the dangers of binge drinking. But this morning, two weeks later, I noticed that the Leader of the Opposition no longer believes that young people binge drinking is an issue. He was on the radio this morning saying that he is concerned that there is a risk that we are in some way assigning blame to young people in relation to their binge drinking. This is not an issue just about blame - although I do accept that, if anyone was going to recognise blame, it would be those on that side of the House, who constantly want to blame others for their inactivity. This is not about blame, but it is about responsibility. It is about explaining to young people that they need to take responsibility for their actions, that they do have consequences. It is about making it clear to them that we are here to help but that they too need to make good choices in their lives. We need to be working with local communities and those who can take leadership roles - whether it is sportspeople, whether it is the local principal, whether it is the local school captain or even some of the local clubs and public sector - and want to be involved in providing decent solutions to these problems. We have put money on the table so that local communities can actually apply for some funding to support their initiatives. I am not sure why the Leader of the Opposition would have changed his tune in two weeks and decided that this is a bad idea, just when I would have thought everybody in this parliament would have been pleased to know that as local members they can start talking in their communities.There will be an application process for local initiatives. If the member for Indi has a good idea for Wangaratta, the member for Corio has a good idea for Geelong, the member for Page has a good idea for Grafton or the member for Newcastle has a good solution for her community, those ideas will be considered, and funding can be applied for to provide good, strong initiatives in our communities and set an example for young people. This is a community-wide problem. We do not pretend that the government has all of the answers, but I feel pretty confident that, out there in all of our communities, there are people who do have some of the solutions. We want to be able to provide a mechanism for them to apply for funding so that they can use their initiative to make sure that they have an impact for young people. - Actually, I was sure that the member for Dunkley was going to say that he would welcome this sort of funding in his electorate. I am sure in Frankston there would be a lot of community groups that would be worried about this issue. There is a busy pubs-and-clubs scene down there, and I am sure that he, along with other members of the backbench, will be applying for this funding. But, unfortunately, you will need to encourage the Leader of the Opposition to back these initiatives. It is important for us to take action, and we hope the whole House will be behind this initiative.</DOC>

 - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition appears to be referring to a collective agreement made under Work Choices. And, yes, I agree that Work Choices is a dreadful set of laws that have hurt the Australian community. You are absolutely right. The laws that you brought to the Australian community -  - I am endeavouring to explain to the Leader of the Opposition the way in which the Work Choices laws that he supports operate. Let me explain to him the way those laws operate. An employer can make a greenfields collective agreement and just impose it on people unilaterally. That can happen under the laws that he supports. An employer can present an employee with a take-it-or-leave-it AWA which strips away basic award conditions for no compensation or no proper compensation. They are the laws that he supports. People can make collective agreements under Work Choices and, because the benchmark for those collective agreements is the so-called flawed fairness test, which the member for North Sydney spent $121 million of taxpayers' money advertising -  - They do not like to hear about Work Choices, do they? - I will continue explaining the nature of flawed agreement making under Work Choices. For a collective agreement under Work Choices, the benchmark is the so-called 'protected' award conditions, which means that things can be lost without any proper compensation. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, if she is aware of anyone who has a complaint about a collective agreement-making process, they should refer that matter to the Workplace Ombudsman. But I also say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that what they will find when they go to the Workplace Ombudsman is that the Workplace Ombudsman will say to them, 'All I can do is apply the laws' - and the laws allow working families to be ripped off. The Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for North Sydney, the member for Warringah et cetera - the list goes on and on - sat around a cabinet table and imposed these laws on the Australian community knowing that they could rip people off. - Let me just say again that the Work Choices laws that were supported by the Liberal Party - the party of Work Choices - allowed people to be ripped off. In respect of the matters that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has raised in her question, can I just say that the opposition have not got one fact right today. I am not accepting that the so-called facts in her question are anywhere near accurate, because everything they have said today has been wrong. But I would say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and to people in the Australian community generally that, if they do have a complaint about a collective agreement-making process, they should raise that matter with the Workplace Ombudsman. If the Workplace Ombudsman says to them, 'I'm really sorry, but you can be ripped off because of Work Choices,' they should ring the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about it.</DOC>

 - The cost of groceries and the cost of petrol both play a very significant role in the family budgets of Australians. Ensuring transparency and competition in these two important sectors have been important priorities for this government. That is why the government have introduced enhanced investigatory powers for the ACCC when it comes to petrol, and that is why we are putting in place Australia's first ever petrol commissioner, who I am pleased to inform the House will commence on 31 March, now that the consultation process with the states prescribed by the law is complete.On the issue of groceries, the House is well aware that the government has instituted an inquiry into grocery prices by the ACCC under part VIIA of the Trade Practices Act, an inquiry that will examine every part of the supply chain from the farm gate to the checkout counter. There has been a very significant community response to the government's grocery price inquiry. This underlines the importance of this inquiry to the general community. One hundred and thirty-eight submissions were received by the ACCC on the closing date. They are from a wide range of groups, from groups as diverse as the Australian Chamber of Fruit and Vegetable Industries; the Consumer Action Law Centre; the Australian National Retailers Association, who represent big retailers; the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union; the Cancer Council of New South Wales; Metcash; and the Australian Beef Association. Of course it would be inappropriate for me to comment on any particular submissions - that would pre-empt the results of the inquiry - but they do cover a wide range of topics and are very substantial, each one of them. The inquiry has also been welcomed by a wide range of groups, ranging from Choice to the National Farmers Federation, which shows there are concerns about the operation of the grocery sector from both ends of the supply chain, from the farm sector to the community sector and consumers.In addition, the ACCC has also required information from principal parties in the industry, using its formal evidence-gathering powers under section 95ZK of the Trade Practices Act. It is important to note that these are powers the ACCC did not have until this inquiry was called. The inquiry was called in order to give the ACCC these powers to seek all relevant documents and all relevant information and evidence which go to the supply chain in the grocery industry. Using this information will allow the commission to commence its public hearing processes, where witnesses will be called upon to give more detailed answers. The Chairman of the ACCC will be outlining in coming days the exact location of the hearings. But, as I have reported to the House previously, there will be a hearing in every state and territory, and they will range across metropolitan and rural areas.The people who will be called upon to give evidence will include senior executives from every significant participant in the grocery industry supply chain. The inquiry will enable the ACCC on 31 July this year to provide the government with advice on all aspects of the grocery market and policy recommendations where appropriate. This will be the most rigorous analysis of the Australian grocery industry which has been undertaken in recent years, certainly in the last decade. This is an inquiry which will put on the table the concerns of Australian working families and seniors. This is an inquiry which will get to the bottom of what is concerning Australian consumers. It takes more than a pathetic speech at the National Press Club - a speech devoid of substance, devoid of content, with a meaningless five-point plan - to represent the needs of Australian working families and seniors; it takes a government concerned about the needs of consumers, a government prepared to act, a government in the mould of the Rudd government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. When the honourable member came into the chamber a couple of days ago, he asserted from the floor of the parliament that I had accompanied this company to Sudan. That was untrue. He asserted further that I had made commercial representations in Sudan on behalf of this company. That was untrue. I have made it very clear in my public comments that I have known Mr Ian Tang, of this company, for two or three years - for several years - and all travel of mine that Mr Tang and his company have supported has been fully declared, as has been that of my colleagues, on the pecuniary interests register.Coming from opposition, I simply make this point: in opposition, as shadow foreign minister for five years and shadow minister for foreign affairs and trade for a further year, there was no budget allocated for travel; we were required to depend on private sponsorship for overseas travel. Perhaps it is one of these things we should look at in the future in terms of how it might be changed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. Today in this parliament we have declared dead and buried Australian workplace agreements. We have declared dead and buried in this parliament a set of industrial laws which made it possible for workplace agreements to strip working families of basic wages and conditions. Our attitude, which we took to the last election - was that AWAs had to be scrapped lock, stock and barrel - and that is what the legislation which has been put through this parliament by the Deputy Prime Minister has done.Let us look at the AWAs we have got rid of. These are the AWAs that required longer working hours and paid less per hour than collective agreements. These are the AWAs that, in their thousands and tens of thousands, have taken hundreds of thousands of dollars out of the pay packets of working men and women. These AWAs stripped away rest breaks, penalty rates, overtime pay and shift loadings. These AWAs, according to the Bureau of Statistics, made workers endure industrial arrangements which took, on average, $87 per week out of their pay packets compared to collective agreements. These are the AWAs and the industrial relations regime which those opposite were so proud to support.On our side of the chamber we stand proudly by the fact that, in our legislation, we have honoured to the letter what we committed to the Australian people before the election. We have honoured to the letter the abolition of AWAs. We have honoured to the letter our commitment to Australian working families to construct in place of AWAs a decent, fair and balanced set of industrial relations arrangements for the future. 'Decency' in the Australian way of life means that everyone in the workplace gets a fair go, not just some. Looking to the future, I therefore find it extraordinary - absolutely extraordinary - that, on this day when we declared dead and buried Australian workplace agreements, when it was put to a vote in this parliament in a motion just before question time, those opposite could not bring themselves to support the part of the motion that read as follows:In order to ensure the decent and fair treatment of Australian working families that statutory individual employment agreements should never again be reintroduced into Australian workplace relations laws.The Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia opposed that. The Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia are therefore saying to the nation at large that they hold open the prospect - the intention - of reintroducing AWAs should they ever regain the Treasury benches. We on this side of the chamber made clear prior to the election our commitment to abolish AWAs. The Liberal Party and the National Party have made it clear today their intention to reintroduce AWAs.</DOC>

 - As I said in a press conference earlier today, I met Mr Tang some time in November or December for 10 or 15 minutes for a cup of coffee in Brisbane. The nature of the conversation was: 'Hello, how are you? I haven't seen you for a bit.' -  - It is true; I would be very interested, given the level of interest on the part of those opposite and given that this company, which the opposition now has great concerns about, has contributed not $100,000 - I misled the House the other day! - but $150,000 to the National Party. If there is a concern about this, what discussions occurred between this company and the former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, other senior National Party ministers or others? What was the content of those discussions? If there is a concern about the nature of this company or its relationship with members of parliament, I would be very interested to know from the shadow foreign minister whether there are concerns in that regard given the nature of the financial support given to the National Party by the company concerned. All these facts, for my part and the part of my colleagues, have been declared fully on the pecuniary interests register.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. Today has truly been an important day in the workplace relations history of this country. Today this parliament passed Labor's transition to Forward with Fairness bill. This is the beginning of getting rid of Work Choices. This is taking handfuls of dirt and throwing it in the grave of Work Choices because we want to bury it.From the coming into operation of Labor's new laws, there will not be a working Australian who will have to fear that they will walk into a workplace only to be confronted with an Australian workplace agreement which strips away basic pay and conditions for no proper compensation. That was the essence of Work Choices: Australian workplace agreements and the ability to strip the safety net away. When Labor's fair, balanced and flexible system is in full operation on 1 January 2010, there will be no new statutory individual employment agreements of any nature. There will be a safety net on which working Australians can stand and, standing on that safety net, they will be able to bargain with their employer, either collectively or for a common-law contract, but a common-law contract that always must give them the safety net.Working Australians are entitled to know whether this reprieve from Australian workplace agreements and Work Choices is enduring or whether it is the policy of the Liberal Party that, should they ever resume government, they will reintroduce Australian workplace agreements and Work Choices. This is the simple question that they have always refused to answer. In their rhetoric about not supporting whilst not opposing Labor's legislation, they never answered that simple question. What do they stand for? If re-elected to government, do they stand for the re-introduction of Work Choices and Australian workplace agreements? Or have they finally heard the voice of the Australian people, and are they truly going to respect it, as the Leader of the Opposition suggested yesterday?We need to know the answer to this question, because working Australians are entitled to know it, and working Australians know that the Liberal Party is a political party with a track record of deceit on workplace relations - a track record of going to an election and deceiving working Australians about their intention after the election. That is what they did in 2004. Australians are entitled to know.Today we got the answer. Indeed, we got 62 answers from those who sit opposite. Today, when asked to vote whether or not they were planning to introduce new statutory individual employment agreements, they revealed their hand. We put to them a very simple proposition: would you agree with us that never again will we see in this country the reintroduction of individual statutory employment agreements? Will you agree with us to never again reintroduce Australian workplace agreements? Will you agree with us to never again reintroduce Work Choices? And they voted no. We now have the Liberal Party's policy revealed. Should they ever become the government again, they will reintroduce Australian workplace agreements, they will reintroduce Work Choices. We flushed them out. We know they were running up and down the corridors, trying to work out how they were going to vote; we know that they played all sorts of procedural tricks in this parliament to give them the maximum amount of time to work out how they were going to vote, but ultimately they voted for the reintroduction of Work Choices. That is all any Australian will ever need to know about the values of the Leader of the Opposition and the party he leads. Everything working Australians need to know about the Liberal Party has been revealed today.Today the Liberal Party had the opportunity to put their signature on the death certificate of Work Choices and, instead of doing that, they sought to revive it. Australians will judge them on that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question. Inflation is now at 3.6 per cent, and that has been putting upward pressure on interest rates. The government is committed to clamping down on government spending, which is rising at 4Â½ per cent in real terms, and getting better value for money out of Australian taxpayers' dollars and greater efficiency in government spending. One particular area where we are committed to doing this is with respect to individual grants, or discretionary grants, that are made by the government to individual organisations for a variety of purposes.Recently my department gave me some data on developments in that area of discretionary grants, and it makes very interesting reading. In 2000 the then Liberal government handed out a total of 3,941 discretionary grants at a cost of $579 million. In 2002 the figure was 6,141 grants at a cost $451 million - the number of grants went up; the amount of money went down. By 2006 the number had gone up to 14,539 grants at a total cost to taxpayers of slightly over $2.7 billion. And in 2007, last year, the number leapt dramatically to 49,060 grants at a total cost to the taxpayer of over $4.5 billion. So, within the space of five years, the total amount being spent by the Australian government on discretionary grants had multiplied tenfold, from $450-odd million to $4.5 billion. The increase in the amount of money involved in 2007 alone - last year, the election year - was 67 per cent.It is also worth noting that, of the 49,000 individual grants handed out by the former Liberal government last year, 30,700 were for figures below $5,000. Indeed, when you look at the list of the smallest grants, it is an interesting picture. The smallest individual grant handed out by the Howard government last year was for the grand total sum of $70. That is not a unique figure by any means. When you look at the list from smallest upwards, the next largest is $79. Then there is an $85 one, another $85 one, another $85 one, a $90 grant, a $96 grant and a $98 grant. There is a very long list of very, very small grants. That explains why there are 30-odd thousand of them under $5,000 and why such a huge leap occurred.My department advises that the cost of administering many of these grants would have been significantly higher than the actual amount of the grants themselves. It advises that the cost of $4.5 billion to the taxpayer does not, of course, include the cost of administering the grants, which perhaps explains the blow-out in the total cost of government and the size of the Public Service over the past few years. It advises that many agencies are failing to use the central register of discretionary grants to ensure that we do not get double dipping - individual grant recipients doubling up on grants. And it also advises that we have over 150 separate grant-processing IT systems in the Commonwealth at present.Many of these grants are worthwhile. However, there are a few that are a bit dodgy - for example, the rainmaker. The member for Wentworth had a recommendation of $2 million on a grant for a bit of cloud seeding and he decided that he would make that a $10 million grant. Others are for cheese factories that get money after they have closed their doors, historic railways where no trains run or ethanol plants that never produce any ethanol - and the list goes on.The former Liberal government converted the Australian government into a giant vote-buying machine. It presided over an appalling misuse of Australian taxpayers' money. This government, the Rudd government, is committed to introducing strict rules to ensure that we get genuine benefit for taxpayers from the application of these grants and that they are handled in a proper and prudent way. The rules we have already introduced include: no minister can make a decision about a grant that applies in his or her own electorate; no minister can make a decision about a grant without getting departmental advice; no minister can unilaterally override departmental advice; and ministers are required to announce decisions on grants promptly. We have a detailed further review underway to analyse all aspects of delivery of discretionary grants to ensure that the taxpayer gets value for money, that there is genuine probity and accountability and that we ensure, in overall terms, that the value that is delivered to the Australian economy and Australian society justifies the amount of money that is spent.The reason for this is simple. The Rudd Labor government is committed to delivering value for money for Australian taxpayers, greater efficiency in the way the government spends its money and greater benefit to the Australian community because we understand that, of that $4Â½ billion, every last dollar is coming from working familys' budgets and we have a very serious obligation as a government to ensure that we do not fritter it away in the way the former government did.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for the question. I have travelled overseas, both in my capacity as a member of parliament and as shadow Treasurer, on numerous occasions in the three years leading up to now. As the member is very well aware, the moneys available to shadow ministers for international travel are not great; we just have the basic entitlement that every member of parliament has for one three-year period. So if you want to do your job as a shadow minister, if you want to get out there in the big, wide world - whether it is going to the United States, whether it is going to China or whether it is going to Britain - then you have to have some assistance.I met this company some time ago. They did sponsor some of my travel. All of that has been disclosed. When I was travelling I was doing my job both as a member of parliament and as a shadow minister. Given the importance of China to the economy of this country, that is what I should have been doing. All of those matters have been disclosed. If the member has some allegation to make, let him make it and let him come clean on all the sponsored travel on the other side of the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I know of his deep concern for the working families in his electorate, who do not want Work Choices. We have seen the opposition today vote in favour of the continuation of Work Choices. People might find it hard to imagine how you can come into the parliament, do that and at the same time say, as the Leader of the Opposition does, that you respect the views of the Australian community, who voted against Work Choices at the last election. What chain of reasoning puts these two things together? What would you have to believe in order to conduct yourself like that? Fortunately, we know what the opposition believes. We have got a very good source for knowing what it believes. That source is the member for Warringah, one of the most senior members of the opposition, formerly one of the most senior members of the Howard government, having served in this place as Leader of the House and minister for health and in other capacities. The member for Warringah was asked today, at a press conference, about the bill that bans AWAs, which passed in the Senate last night:Is Australia today a better place?He said:Well, Australia will be over time a different place as a result of the change of government.He went on to say, and this is the important quote:So the Howard government's industrial legislation - it was good for wages, it was good for jobs and it was good for workers, and let's never forget that.The member for Warringah, on behalf of the opposition, one of its most senior members, said:So the Howard government's industrial legislation - it was good for wages, it was good for jobs and it was good for workers, and let's never forget that.The political party of Work Choices speaks. It has so lost touch with the Australian community that it believes that Work Choices was good for workers. The Liberal Party has so lost touch with ordinary working Australians that it believes Work Choices was good for workers. - I would ask the member for Warringah, the member for Mayo, who is interjecting, and the rest of the opposition, who today have voted for Work Choices and described it as 'good for workers', to explain to the 70 per cent of workers who lost their shift loadings in AWAs whether it was good for them; to the 65 per cent of workers who lost their penalty rates through AWAs whether it was good for them; and to the 61 per cent who lost their substitute days for public holidays whether it was good for them. Was it good for the 50 per cent of people on Australian workplace agreements who lost public holiday pay? Was it good for the 31 per cent who lost rest breaks? Of course, the statistics of shame that relate to Work Choices go on - they are just the start of the statistics. Does the Leader of the Opposition agree it was good for workers for them to lose amounts of up to $500 a week, as I have disclosed in this House? Was that good for workers? Is that what you mean by 'good for workers' in the Liberal Party these days? - The view of the Liberal Party of this country is that Work Choices was good for workers. Every statement it has made since the election about Work Choices being dead, about respecting the decision of the Australian people, about listening to their voice, about having a changed view - every statement made by any member of the opposition since the election - was a false statement. It has shown it today by how it voted to continue Work Choices. The member for Warringah has helpfully laid bare, for every working Australian to see, that it believes being able to be ripped off is good for workers. It believes being able to be sacked for no reason and with no remedy is good for workers. This is a political party that has lost touch, lost its way and understands nothing about the circumstances of working Australians. As we have seen from today's vote and today's statement by the member for Warringah, it never will.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can confirm that I travelled to China from 28 March to 3 April 2005 while I was shadow minister for industry, infrastructure and industrial relations. In accordance with the procedures which bind all members of this House, I declared that travel in the register of parliamentary interests. That has been a matter of public record since May 2005. While I was in China, I visited Guangdong province, Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai. I have also declared on that parliamentary register - and this declaration has been there since May 2005 - that as part of that trip I received hospitality and other service provision from Beijing AustChina Technology. That has been declared. I also received a gift of a Chinese tea set, which has been declared. Whilst I was in China I had a meeting with Mr Ian Tang, where we discussed matters about China and Australia and the important economic relationship between our two nations. Since that time I have had, I think, one meeting with Mr Tang, when he came to Canberra. It was a short meeting where we wished each other well. Mr Tang requested to see me at the beginning of this year or late last year upon my becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs. I was happy to see him. In the event, I was not available to see him at the required time. I saw nothing inappropriate with that meeting.As the Treasurer has made clear, any number of the members in this place, on your side or on this side, have been the recipients of sponsored travel. The important thing here is: was that sponsored travel declared? In my case it was, and it has been on the public record since May 2005. If the member is making any suggestions of impropriety or any allegations, just make them - just make them. You might also, if you propose to make any such baseless allegations, cough up on all the sponsored travel on your side.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The government understands that the cost of inaction on climate change is greater than the cost of action - for all Australians. That is why the guiding principle for the government's response to climate change is 'least cost'. We are deeply committed to addressing climate change by reducing domestic emissions at the very lowest cost that is possible. I think most Australians will appreciate that the cost of climate change inaction is far greater than the cost of action. This was acknowledged even by the former Prime Minister, who is a climate change sceptic. He said reducing carbon emissions will mean higher energy and petrol prices. Australians need to understand that. When it comes to climate change, we on this side of the House will look after working families. We will provide the leadership and the foresight that is required to deal with this properly by bringing in an emissions-trading system. This is terribly important in terms of business investment and to deal with this problem in the long term. That is why the government was so pleased that the Minister for Climate Change and Water was able to publish her timetable for the development of an emissions-trading system. We support a comprehensive response which protects the interests of working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. His electorate is home to RAAF Base Amberley, so naturally he has a deep-seated interest and is very active in the area of defence policy. This morning the Prime Minister and I had the pleasure of announcing that Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston will be reappointed as the Chief of the Defence Force. We were also pleased to announce a number of other senior Defence appointments. Lieutenant General David Hurley will be appointed as the new Vice-Chief of the Defence Force, Rear Admiral Russell Crane will be appointed as the new Chief of Navy, Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie will be appointed as the new Chief of Army and Air Vice Marshal Mark Binskin will be appointed as the new Chief of Air Force. I know the House will agree that these are all very fine appointments. I wish them all well and acknowledge in this place the very fine work of those people who they will replace.The single biggest challenge facing the Australian Defence Force is its people and skills shortage. This will be a key focus for the new service chiefs. I am tasking this new Defence leadership team with an increased emphasis on one of their existing responsibilities. In addition to training and sustaining their respective services, each service chief will be directly responsible for ensuring that sufficient trained and skilled personnel are available. Every three months, or more often if necessary, the service chiefs will spell out in detail the progress they have made in meeting the exacting requirements of their respective services for skilled trades and professions. This is a tough challenge they face in an era of almost full employment and at a time when the mining industry is booming. But succeed we must.Our people challenge is just one of the challenges the new government has inherited in the Defence portfolio. The defence budget is in a mess and many of the capability projects we have inherited are in crisis. The cost of sustaining capability has been alarmingly underestimated and underfunded. The Howard government had been committing to new capital projects without taking proper account of their ongoing funding requirements. As I said in a speech last night, it is like factoring into the family budget the cost of a new car but not accounting in that same budget for the fuel, the insurance, the rego and the maintenance - or, in the case of the member for Wentworth, the chauffeur!The government remains committed to growing the defence budget by three per cent in real terms out to 2016. This is a big call, given the inflationary environment we have inherited from the former government. But it will do so because, as the Prime Minister says, it is core business for any government. But, given the mess we have inherited from the former government, we will need three per cent real growth and more. The waste and mismanagement in defence procurement must end and internal efficiencies will need to be found so that the money saved can be reinvested into defence. Every dollar spent in one area of defence capability is a dollar that is not available to be spent in another. We have an obligation to get it right. We cannot afford to waste a cent. Labor is determined to clean up the mess we have inherited from the now Leader of the Opposition, who was gambling not only with taxpayers' money but, indeed, with national security. In partnership with our new leadership team, the government is determined to put the defence budget back on track. We will fill that $6 billion hole we have been left with in net operating costs. We will put the defence procurement system back on track and we will develop a plan to address Defence's people and skills shortage.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The Council of Australian Governments languished under our predecessors. It has been in the past a core vehicle for national microeconomic reform. For the last 12 years it languished and in effect did very little. Our intention as a government, reflected in the pre-election commitments we made to fix the federation, is to put COAG - the Council of Australian Governments - back onto the centre stage when it comes to delivering effective long-term microeconomic reform. If you look at the overall challenges of productivity growth, what we invest in terms of human capital, what we invest in infrastructure and what we do on the deregulation front, so much of that is bound up with the actual state of our federation. The federation has become somewhat sick in recent years with functional duplication and overlap, and a plethora of regulatory regimes which affect businesses trying to earn a living, as well as the impact on working families as they seek to deal with various levels of government to consume basic health, education and other services.At the end of last year, within six weeks or so of the government taking office, we convened the first meeting of the Council of Australian Governments since the new government had assumed office. We outlined a comprehensive program of action for the year 2008 covering education, health, business deregulation, climate change, water and the rest. That is important because, if you are going to achieve real outcomes for the nation, you need to work in cooperation with the states and territories. If you simply want someone to blame on the way through then you play a political tactic, as our predecessors did for 12 years, because COAG is either a vehicle for change or it is an alibi for inaction. Our predecessors demonstrated a strong predilection for the latter approach. When it comes to the upcoming COAG, to be held in Adelaide at the end of next week, we have a substantial agenda of work on our plate. We intend to work methodically, carefully and with diligence through the agenda of microeconomic reform which we have put to the Australian people.One of the areas where the Commonwealth and the states can work better together is in dealing with the challenge which was the subject of a question in this place yesterday - and again I go to the whole challenge of homelessness. This is an important matter. All families across the country are concerned about housing affordability. Many families across the country are concerned about homelessness. After 16 years of economic growth, it is unacceptable that any given night we have 100,000 Australians who are homeless and, on average, between 10,000 and 14,000 who are sleeping rough. Before the election we committed to halve the number of people turned away from crisis accommodation within five years. That is a very big commitment. We committed to a policy called A Place To Call Home, which is a $150 million investment to build or purchase 600 new homes for people in crisis accommodation.Today in the parliament I am pleased to confirm that we have reached agreement with the state and territory governments on the implementation of this election commitment. For the first time, the new accommodation will be delivered in those areas where homelessness problems are most acute and the funding will now start to flow. This scheme will provide a permanent home so that families will no longer have to uproot and move from crisis accommodation to crisis accommodation.One of the great feedbacks we got from the community sector on this, reflected in the discussion we had as a parliamentary party yesterday, is that, when someone goes into crisis accommodation, within a short period of time they are often relocated to crisis accommodation or transitional accommodation elsewhere, which means that kids have to be ripped out of school, which means their school performance goes through the floor - and that, in turn, creates a whole series of other problems as well.What we are seeking to move towards is a situation and a set of policies and programs across the country where we deal with the homelessness challenge in situ, so that when we relocate someone to a crisis accommodation centre, a crisis accommodation home or a rented apartment, it has a reasonable prospect of being their long-term place to live. This is a first step - and I emphasise it is a first step - in this government's new approach to homelessness, which also includes our commitment to deliver the first white paper of this government, which will set out a comprehensive plan of action for the decade ahead. On this side of the parliament we believe in putting an end to the blame game. Homelessness is about decency -  -  - I find it remarkable that those opposite laugh about homelessness. I would have thought a mark of decency is a program of action to deal with homelessness. It may be of surprise to many of those opposite that there are homelessness crises and problems in each of their electorates. It may be invisible to them but it is not invisible to the government. We intend to prosecute a program of action to deal with this challenge. Rather than just blame the state and territory governments, we have a cooperative program of action with the states and territories to enable people who find themselves in these desperate circumstances to at least have that level of basic human decency and support.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Bonner for her question. We know that housing affordability in Australia is at an all-time low. We had more figures yesterday from AMP.NATSEM showing that 62 per cent of first home buyers are now in housing stress, and at the other end we have got more older people also in housing stress. The number of older Australians in housing stress has doubled, according to this report.A working group on housing was established by COAG in December 2007 to develop implementation plans for the housing affordability policies that Labor took to the last election - the Housing Affordability Fund, that $Â½ million fund to bring down the cost of building new homes; the National Rental Affordability Scheme, initially a program to support the building of 50,000 - now 100,000 - new affordable rental properties; our plan for 600 new homes for the homeless, A Place to Call Home, and the new and innovative approach of leaving people in place and moving services around them rather than forcing homeless families to move from pillar to post; our National Housing Supply Research Council to make sure that the dire straits we find ourselves now in when it comes to housing affordability do not recur in the future; and our proposal to release surplus Commonwealth land for housing and for other community uses. I am very pleased to chair the Housing Working Group established by COAG. It has representatives from state central agencies and, of course, from state housing departments, and I am very happy to be able to report that those implementation plans and policies are ready to roll.Of course, that is not the end of the challenge. We do not imagine for a moment that the work on housing affordability is complete. After 12 years of substantial neglect in this area we have got a lot of problems to overcome. We know that demand began to outstrip supply seriously in 2004. We saw this semitrailer hurtling down the highway at us as a nation and the previous government never lifted a finger to address some of the issues that were contributing to the shortfall of housing that we now face. The reason housing, rental housing in particular, is so unaffordable is that we have a serious supply problem, a supply problem that we saw coming and that the previous government did nothing about.The COAG implementation plans, when agreed, will see these policies, and also our first home saver accounts, ready to roll. They will be available in the second half of this year. Local government will be able to look to the Housing Affordability Fund for help to bring more affordable blocks of land onto the market and use the Housing Affordability Fund to support the rollout of e-processing - development application processing - to reduce the holding costs of land. The applications for the National Rental Affordability Scheme will open in June-July this year, and we will see the first 3Â½ thousand incentives available in the next financial year.The building of new homes for the homeless will start within months. In 3Â½ months the government has agreed an agenda with the states and territories that the previous government was not able to come to in 12 years. In fact, a large part of the reason for that is that we had no real understanding or interest from the previous government when it came to housing affordability and, indeed, when it came to homelessness. This morning we heard the member for Warringah criticising Labor members of parliament for visiting homeless services. Why would you talk to Mission Australia about homelessness - or St Vincent de Paul or the Salvation Army or Wesley Mission! Why would you talk to any of these people about homelessness or, indeed, to any of the people living in those shelters who have the firsthand experience of becoming homeless and living as homeless people in our community! Why on earth would you talk to those people, Member for Warringah?We have committed $150 million already to building new homes for the homeless. We have committed to extra support for organisations like RecLink, which engage homeless people with support services and are the originators of the Choir of Hard Knocks. Any of this could have been done in the 12 years of the previous government. There was no action. After 16 years of record growth we saw record numbers of homeless people and record numbers of homeless families with children. I am very pleased to be able to report to the House and to my Labor colleagues that our implementation plans, worked on by the COAG Working Group on Housing, are proceeding apace and that COAG has become a real vehicle for change, not an excuse for inaction.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the Leader of the Opposition. I would have thought the first responsibility of a government of any political persuasion is to ensure that our principal foreign relationships are in good working order. Therefore, one of the first decisions undertaken by this government, within a week or so of taking office, was to travel to Indonesia. For what purpose? To ratify the Kyoto protocol, something which I seem to recall it took you a long, long time not to do.The second decision that the government took was to visit Dili in East Timor. That was important because, when it came to the challenges of security for that country and the further deployment of military personnel and police personnel, it was absolutely the responsible thing to do to assist our nearest neighbour in need. Then it came to our neighbourhood - that is, the South Pacific - which the honourable member for Mayo has displayed such a comprehensive lack of interest in for the last decade or so. -  - And I can report to the honourable member for Mayo that he is deeply missed across the South Pacific. They were constantly inquiring after the honourable member's wellbeing. When you arrive at an extraordinarily unsustainable situation of a ban on ministerial contact between Australian government ministers and Papua New Guinea, our nearest neighbour to our north - and that ban had proceeded for virtually a year - it is not the way in which this government proposes to do business with its neighbours.The purpose of a visit to Papua New Guinea and to Goroka and to the Solomons, where we still have several hundred troops and police deployed, was to rebuild bridges with our principal partners within the South Pacific and also to look firsthand at what was necessary to deal with the challenges of development in the South Pacific, where most of the development indicators are headed in the reverse direction. That answers the first part of the question about what official travel has been engaged in by me as Prime Minister since the change of government.As far as upcoming travel is concerned, as soon as I became Prime Minister, the Ambassador of the United States came to see me and said that the President would like me to pay an early visit to Washington. We then began negotiations with the United States about when that could occur and the dates were arranged. In addition, our friends in China - our largest trading partner - discussed dates and suggested that we would need to ensure that a visit was undertaken well short of the Olympics because there would be a crowd of visits as they got near to the Olympics.The third element in the equation was a decision relating to our troops deployed in Afghanistan. That goes to NATO strategy for the deployment of troops in Afghanistan and the upcoming NATO summit, which is to be held in Bucharest. That has a fixed date; it occurs early next month. If you put the three together, it defines the architecture of the visits abroad. That is why they are being undertaken.As for the final part of the honourable member's question, concerning our friends and partners in Japan, in the period that the government has been in office Japan has been the kind host of visits by the foreign minister, the trade minister, the minister for industry and the minister for resources. There have been four ministerial visits. I do not think that any of these ministers have yet travelled to China. I may be wrong.The priority we attach to our relationship with Japan is underpinned by the fact that these ministers have seen an absolute necessity of making early contact with their Japanese ministerial counterparts. Furthermore, the Japanese have been in contact with us over a long period of time about an invitation for me as Prime Minister to attend the G8 meeting to be held in Tokyo in July. They have indicated that they want to have bilateral discussions and meetings with me on that occasion. On top of that, we are in continued negotiations and discussions about a further bilateral visit by me to Japan.Where does all this come together? If honourable members opposite have paid close attention to the state of the global economy, they will know that we are travelling in uncertain economic times globally. It is of deep importance, therefore, that at the level of Prime Minister of Australia we have direct dealings with the Americans, who are currently engaged in very difficult decisions concerning the health and robustness and state of US financial markets and upcoming actions both by the US Treasury and the US Fed. Similarly, developments in the City of London, affected by decisions undertaken by the Bank of England, are important in terms of our current global economic circumstances, as are the upcoming economic developments in China, our principal trading partner, with whom we have a deep and vested interest to ensure that that export relationship is expanded further. It is because the economic interests of this nation are at the forefront of the government's attention that we have embarked upon this visit, and I am actually surprised that the Leader of the Opposition would choose, in a partisan nature, to engage in an attack on it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for his question and his understanding that payments like the baby bonus are intended to serve the interests of children. If that is not happening, the government needs to act to make sure that it does. I want to draw the House's attention to what a caller had to say on the Alan Jones program yesterday, talking about the baby bonus:I am a recovered drug addict - a caller said - I exploited the system. It was heaven for me with an extra $5,000 bonus, mate, and I'm telling you right now I wouldn't spend one - I didn't spend one cent of the bonus. I just took it off my missus.He went on to say:I know hundreds of people who have no intention of getting work who are on methadone and drugs and everything else and it's heaven when they get the bonus. I don't see any new prams or extra clothes for the kids, mate. I'm telling you that right now.That is appalling. It is appalling that this misuse of government support is going on, and it cannot be allowed to go on any further. So that is why the government are intent on delivering on our election commitments to ensure that payments like the baby bonus serve the interests of children and are not spent on gambling, drugs or alcohol. That is why we have already begun the work that is necessary to develop a national child protection framework. One aspect of this national child protection framework will be to give the state and territory child protection authorities the power to recommend to Centrelink that family payments, including the baby bonus, are able to be income managed or quarantined so that those payments are spent in the interests of children, on things like food, rent or clothing for children, and are not spent on drugs or gambling.Most parents do the right thing. Most parents spend family payments or the baby bonus in the interests of children. Unfortunately, some do not. Where parents are responsible, then the baby bonus will continue to be paid in the normal way. But where they are not responsible, where they neglect their children, it is time that we made some serious changes.Those changes are underway already in the Northern Territory. One of my first decisions as Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs was to implement income management in a number of Northern Territory communities. Decisions such as this mean that the baby bonus is quarantined; in fact, 100 per cent of the baby bonus is income-managed in these communities. We have made a commitment also to income-manage the baby bonus in the Cape York welfare trials, and the same will take place in the income management trials that we will undertake in the Kimberley with the Western Australian government. It is true that these are not easy decisions to make, but they are decisions that should be made to protect children.I might remind members that the extension of income management to these payments, like the baby bonus, would not have happened if the Howard government had continued in office. They did copy Labor's policy - the policy that we put forward in opposition - but, unfortunately, they did nothing to fund the measures in that policy. There was no money to fund them. There was a lot of talk from the previous government, and even the passing of legislation, but no money put into the budget and no action taken to make sure that these changes were made. This really is not good enough. This government is getting on with the job, making sure that family payments, including the baby bonus, are there to be spent in the interests of children, not squandered on drugs or gambling.</DOC>

 - I begin this answer by repeating how I concluded my last answer, which is that I am disappointed that the Leader of the Opposition, as the alternative Prime Minister of the country, would choose to be partisan on questions that go to our principal foreign relationships. When it comes to the organisation of itineraries with foreign governments - those of the United States, those of China, those of Japan and those of the United Kingdom and elsewhere - as the Leader of the Opposition would know from his experience as a minister, these are complex negotiations which involve complex questions of scheduling between and across multiple governments.When it comes to the visit to Japan, already dates are under discussion for a further visit on top of the July visit. I look forward very much to undertaking that visit to Tokyo. I have visited Japan on number of occasions in the past; it remains for us a principal economic and foreign policy partner for the future. I look forward very much to visiting Tokyo.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flynn for his question and I note his strong interest in agricultural issues. I also acknowledge the level of enthusiasm for the subject that has come from across the chamber. I have to say that I thought there might have been a question from the other side about this issue. Clearly, there is a lot of passion coming through the papers on this. However, what we need to understand with the legislation that is to be introduced in the budget sittings is: what happens if nothing changes? What happens to certainty for wheat growers if that legislation does not go through?If nothing changes, on 30 June this year the veto power of the minister will disappear. That is what will happen under the legislation that was left to this government. However, the second thing that will happen is that growers will be exposed with no protections - no protections, which otherwise will be provided by the legislation being brought through by the government. First, there would be no probity test to make sure that a buyer of wheat is in a financial position to carry out the purchase, and, secondly, there would be no guaranteed access arrangements - no arrangements to make sure that we do not end up with monopoly situations being abused at the ports.How can growers be given certainty? How can we make sure that we send a message to growers that goes beyond the old National Party policy that growers will not be allowed to choose who they sell their wheat to? That is the guts of the Nationals policy on this. They will not allow growers to choose who they sell to. Certainty can be given very simply. It is for the Leader of the Nationals - not in his role as the Leader of the Nationals but in his role as a coalition frontbencher - to declare a coalition position in support of reform of the current wheat arrangements.There is a reason why he cannot do that. Quite simply, the relationship between the Liberal Party and the National Party has broken down entirely. On 10 March, the Manager of Opposition Business in this House made a comment to the media, referring to the Nationals:_ they now have lost their unique identification with the country.That is his position. Interestingly, that is the position also of the member for North Sydney - and in a moment I will get to the affinity that North Sydney has with the Nationals. However, before I do that, it was also put well today by another Liberal MP from out Goulburn way, the member for Hume. He commented:There's two options - the Liberal Party can sit back and wait for them to die and contest their seats, or the remnant -  - The concern that we have is to make sure that we can provide growers with certainty. The Senate numbers being what they are, certainty is only going to be provided by a unified coalition position. That is how it becomes possible to give certainty to the growers. While the member for North Sydney clearly understands the concerns and why that certainty is not being provided, the New South Wales Nationals are holding their next state conference in his seat. Here is the brochure for the next New South Wales conference of the National Party; they are going to be at the Kirribilli Club. The Nationals, 'the party of the bush', now make the Kirribilli Club their place to meet. - The threat of the legislation being defeated in the Senate by the coalition failing to have a unified position creates a real threat to every wheat grower in Australia. I remind the Leader of the Nationals of comments he made in this House last week where he objected to some of the approvals of permits which had been made, without recognising that, when I did not exercise veto with respect to those permits, after 30 June my veto power will be gone and they would have been automatically registered anyway. Those individual ones would have been automatically registered. The Nationals do not seem to understand the problem that the legislation that is currently in place faces. You only have to walk past the office of the Leader of the Nationals. You see his photo there in the corridors of parliament; it has the sign 'Deputy Leader of the Nationals'. - I said 'Deputy Leader of the Nationals' and I should correct that to 'Leader of the Nationals'; the word 'Deputy' has got green sticky tape over it. For wheat growers to be given certainty, the legislation that we currently face has to be taken into account. The legislation that we currently face was given clear sunset provisions, which expire on 30 June. Any debate, and the need to make sure we have sensible arrangements from 1 July onwards, needs to take that into account.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Oxley for this question because he, like everyone on this side of the House, knows the importance of energy market reform. Energy market reform is clearly about microreform in Australia. It is not just about the bottom line for consumers and the business community. It is also about us putting together a national energy market that is central to our ongoing debate about climate change in Australia. In that context, I am pleased to say that the ministerial meeting was held in December last year, less than two weeks after the appointment of the Rudd Labor government. This important meeting focused not only on further progress in microeconomic reform but on putting together an ongoing process which guarantees proper attention to reducing energy costs in Australia through the establishment and finalisation of our national gas laws. It was also about locking in, once and forever, the establishment of the Australian energy market operator.In the context of this ongoing energy reform, can I also report to the House that, following a cost-benefit analysis prepared for the Ministerial Council on Energy, not only are we now in the process of finalising the minimum functionality for smart meters so as to guarantee the best possible consistency across all state and territory governments but, perhaps more importantly, state governments are now giving consideration to the commencement of the rollout of the smart meters. This process is exceptionally important because the cost-benefit analysis prepared for the ministerial council says that the rollout of smart meters can effectively represent savings to the Australian economy as high as $4 billion. When you think about the cost pressures on Australian consumers at the moment, because of the failures of the other side of the House, you can understand that better consumer information on the use of energy can assist them in managing the pressures that they confront as ordinary households. It is about better education and opportunities to use energy more smartly.It is also smart for business in Australia. One of the biggest challenges to energy providers in Australia in the generation of capacity is the pressure put on the Australian community in terms of peak power. It effectively means that at particular times of the year we have energy requirements far in excess of what is required for the greatest part of the year. By way of example, in some parts of the network about 20 per cent of infrastructure capacity is used for less than one per cent of the year.So, with the growing demand for energy in Australia, if we can actually assist in rolling out smart meters and locking in once and for all the national energy market, we can take the pressure off investors in Australia for additional energy capacity. Interns of the COAG process, which is about state and federal governments not only working together but also working in cooperation with the private sector, the ongoing work of the Ministerial Council on Energy is exceptionally important.In conclusion, we will commit, in cooperation with the state and territory governments and the private sector, to put in place these smart meters. They are not only smart for consumers but also good for industry and for climate change and the ongoing requirement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. On the overall challenges facing working families regarding the cost of living, petrol is right up there - it has been going through the roof - and so is the cost of groceries, rents and mortgages and, on top of that, the cost of child care. Therefore, our challenge as a responsible government, in touch with working families, is what you can do to assist the overall family budget. First of all, you can deliver on tax cuts - and that is what we intend to do as at 1 July. The second is to make sure that, when it comes to child-care costs, you make that easier for families as well. That is why we are committed to increasing the rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent.When it comes to the other costs impacting on the overall family budget, we have taken action since coming to office to ensure that we have a cop on the beat on petrol prices right across the country. After 12 years of inertia on this subject, I find it remarkable that those opposite could raise a clamour of discontent on it. The cop on the beat, the petrol commissioner, will come into force very soon. The Chairman of the ACCC, Graeme Samuel, has indicated through his correspondence with the major oil companies that he is watching carefully what the companies do in the days ahead. On top of that, I refer particularly to reports in today's papers about alleged practices on the part of certain petrol retail outlets. I am very, very concerned about whether these activities are consistent with the application of Australia's proper competition laws and arrangements. Therefore, if complaints are to be made about what happens in the upcoming weekend, let me tell you that the ACCC will be there to receive those complaints, to make sure that maximum downward pressure is placed on petrol prices so that Australian motorists are not slugged an additional dollar other than they should be paying for petrol - and that after 12 years of inertia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Solomon for his question. Here in this parliament barely a month ago we engaged in an important symbolic act: an apology to the stolen generations. As a consequence of that apology, we as the government have been seeking, through a new attitude of mutual respect, mutual obligation and mutual responsibility between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia, to embark upon a national program, Close the Gap -  closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The national apology was a necessary first step. Bridging the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians could only begin when there was an attitude of mutual respect between us. Having achieved that, in part through the actions undertaken in this chamber, we can now embark upon a critical piece of national action in closing the gap in adult life expectancy, infant mortality, health attainments in general for Aboriginal people and children as well as education outcomes.Currently the 17-year gap which exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous life expectancy is unacceptable for a country as wealthy as ours. That is why today the government signed a statement of intent to ensure that we bring down this gap within the next generation, consistent with the 'closing the gap' arrangements which have been put together by various Aboriginal advocacy groups over the course of the last year. These are by way of our national goals, our national aspirations and our national targets. The challenge now is: what practical action now ensues? That is why the government has already funded $260 million to assist further with child and maternal health services and also to improve literacy and numeracy outcomes in the early years for young Indigenous kids across our country.Today, in signing the statement of intent, I confirmed two further courses of action on behalf of the government. The first relates to how we tackle the challenge of chronic diseases. Chronic diseases are contributing hugely to the current life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Within that, 20 per cent of this health gap is because of smoking. The incidence of smoking in Indigenous Australia is roughly double that in non-Indigenous Australia. This is a huge contributor to the problems with overall life expectancy. That is why $14.5 million over four years will be funded for a very practical program to bring down the smoking rates and particularly to work on other forms of tobacco intervention and tobacco control within communities.Secondly, there will be $19 million to strengthen the Indigenous health workforce. The Indigenous health workforce is in the front line of helping local families in Indigenous communities improve their overall health standards. As the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Education would be aware, there is a real challenge across the country - it has been there for a long time - about how you boost the number of trained Aboriginal doctors, nurses and those in the allied health professions. This $19 million is of fundamental importance in ensuring that we get the right number and distribution of doctors and nurses from Indigenous communities trained and deployed. This will be done with the active support of the Indigenous Doctors Association and we will be working in close partnership with them.In this overall challenge of closing the gap, we would like to thank Tom Calma, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, for the work that has already been done. On top of that, we acknowledge the strong advocacy from Catherine Freeman and Ian Thorpe, who have taken this on as part of their mission for the country in the years ahead. I congratulate them on their efforts, using their sporting profiles to get behind this very important program.Closing the gap now becomes the hard bit. The national apology has occurred. We have built a bridge of respect between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. That still has a way to go. Close the Gap forms the practical framework for action for this government in the years ahead. We have to be serious about it. The announcements of funding commitments today represent one small but practical step in the direction of ensuring that all Australians have equal life opportunities.</DOC>

 - The ACCC, through Graeme Samuel, has already indicated what course of action he has embarked upon. First of all, he has written to the oil companies, acting in a manner which is effective under existing Australian competition law, to ask them this simple question: to justify to him whether excessive petrol prices in variation of the Singapore base price are in any way sustainable over the Easter period. The ACCC Chairman, Graeme Samuel, asked for replies from the petrol companies as of a couple of days ago - I think the night before last. The ACCC will have its own telephone hotline service operating over the Easter period to take incoming complaints from the public as to whether they experience exploitation at their particular local petrol outlet. That is what I call effective action on the ground.Does this guarantee that there will not be any exploitation in any given location? Of course not. But does it represent a positive advance in where we have come from after 12 years of inaction? Let me tell you it does. Once this period is through, of course the petrol commissioner will assume office. There would be no petrol commissioner were it not for the pre-election commitment of this government. One has been appointed, with considerable experience of these matters in the state of Western Australia. He will assume office soon and with powers underneath him unparalleled relative to those which the previous government ever extended to anybody to assist working families suffering from the impost and impact of unfair prices at the browser.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question. I know he takes a great interest, as most members over this side of the House do, in what we are doing to close the life expectancy gap for Indigenous Australians. The Prime Minister has already taken the House through some of the details of the initiatives that have been announced today, but I think that it is important to go through how these initiatives are meshing with the other initiatives of the Rudd Labor government to make absolutely clear that our vision for Indigenous Australians in a modern Australia is that they have equality of health status, educational status and life expectancy. We are going to do everything we can, whether it is through the health portfolio, the education portfolio, the community services portfolio or elsewhere, to make sure that we turn the ambitious statement of intent that was signed today by the government, by the opposition and by Indigenous leaders into a reality.We know that the announcements today are targeting and complementing announcements that we made during the election and have already started rolling out. We of course have a $260 million package on the table for early childhood education and health. We know that this is going to make a huge difference to Indigenous babies who are being born today and that that will have a long-term impact on the life expectancy gap.But the announcements made today by the Prime Minister, particularly our investment in cutting smoking rates, are targeted towards adult Indigenous people. We know that we need to cut the smoking rates of everybody who is smoking today. We need to try to bring the smoking rates in Indigenous communities down to those rates that we experience across the rest of the country. We know it is going to need a targeted strategy. The strategies that have been successful but that still need to be repeated in the broader community have largely gone over the heads of the Indigenous community. They have not been targeted in a way that the Indigenous community have been receptive to. This financing will make it possible for us to make sure that the message about smoking and the damage it can do to your long-term health actually is heard by the Indigenous community.We really look forward to working with Indigenous health specialists. Those who are involved in social marketing targeted towards particular groups will be able to devise a very sharp message which we hope will make a difference for Indigenous communities. I might also highlight something that our partners in the Indigenous health sector are very supportive of but which does put an obligation on them as well. Part of this initiative is to ensure that health workers in Aboriginal health services are also able to quit smoking and will lead by example. This is a particularly difficult issue for many health workers. As anyone in the House who has been a smoker would know, quitting is difficult for everyone. But we need to be able to turn around and make a big impact in Indigenous communities, and we will need those health workers to lead by example. We are setting aside a specific part of our funding to ensure that we assist them in that process of quitting and setting that example to the community.I want to also make clear that we are making both short-term and long-term investments. The long-term investment in an Indigenous workforce is going to be a really important part of our solution for the future. If, across all of our electorates, Indigenous health services cannot find Indigenous people to work as nurses and doctors, we know that we will continue to have these complex problems. So, as for investing in the workforce, we know it will take a long time but it must be done if in 10, 20 and 30 years time we are going to meet these targets and actually change the status and life expectancy of Indigenous Australians across the country. Our vision as a government is to close that gap. That is what we want to become a reality, and some of the down payments that have been announced today are very important steps to turning that statement of intent into a reality.</DOC>

 - The company concerned obviously has dealt in the past with technology trade, as would be suggested by its title. I notice also, on the question of what the company does, what the shadow minister for foreign affairs himself said today. When asked, 'What about this company?' Mr Robb said:That's not the point. We, we, we don't know about this company. We know nothing really about this company. - And I have answered that part of the question. On the question of this particular company, it seems that the previous government knew a lot indeed about this company. I have here a letter from the Australian Embassy in Beijing to the mayor of Beijing which is along these lines - this is from 2007, I understand:I am writing in regard to the Beijing Friendship Store redevelopment project located on Jianguomen. The project has significant investment by an Australian company, AustChina Investment and Development Pty Ltd. - This letter from the embassy to the mayor of Beijing continues:I understand that the project may be experiencing some delays and the Australian Trade Commission (Austrade) office of the Australian Embassy, Beijing, would appreciate any assistance that the office of the Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government is able to provide so that the project can move forward in line with project timelines.It goes on:The Australian government has maintained an ongoing interest in this high-profile project in the centre of Beijing. As you may be aware, the Australian Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon. Mark Vaile MP, visited the project during his December 2006 visit to Beijing. The project - and this goes to the question - involves the provision of products, services and facilities supplied by both Australian and Chinese companies to what will be a landmark project of cooperation between Australian and Chinese businesses.That is a letter from the Australian Embassy in Beijing seeking the cooperation of the municipality of Beijing in support of this particular company and invoking the Deputy Prime Minister as a keen supporter of the project, he himself having visited the project at that time. Of course, the honourable member said in his statement this morning that his government knew nothing of this particular company. I would suggest that letter suggests that his government in fact knew quite a lot about this company and what it was doing. The question was: what did the company do? I have referred to what the company did. - So we had the then Deputy Prime Minister visit this project in support of the company concerned, the company about which the member for Goldstein is now objecting so vociferously. Remember of course that the then Deputy Prime Minister is from - which party? 
Government members - The National Party! - He is in office at the time in a party which have received $155,000 in donations from the company which they are objecting about. But the member for Goldstein says the government - referring to himself - knows nothing about this company. This letter says that in fact the government was actively intervening on behalf of this company in relation to a specific project in Beijing, the company having directly donated to the party to which the then Deputy Prime Minister belongs. But let us just leave the National Party alone for a bit. Let us move on to the Liberal Party. Remember that the member for Goldstein said, 'We know nothing about this company.' The National Party say they know nothing about this company, so what about the good old Liberals? Here we have another interesting letter which is along these lines to the Executive Director, Beijing Australia Technology Ltd:Thank you for your letter of 13 June. The government is a strong supporter of the ICT industry and has introduced a number of initiatives to encourage development of the ICT industry.It goes on to say:Companies such as Beijing AustChina Technology Ltd greatly facilitate this task - that being the company they are complaining about - by representing Australian companies trying to gain access to the enormous Chinese market and by promoting Australian ICT products and services. This benefits not only individual firms but also the Australian economy. I look forward to Beijing AustChina Technology Ltd achieving great success in its endeavours and would encourage you to continue your close working relationship with the government.It is signed: 'Richard Alston, Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.' So there we have a couple of interesting pieces of correspondence, which, Mr Speaker, I am happy to table. - I just said I was happy to table them, Joe. I am sure you and the member for Goldstein will find these pieces of correspondence particularly interesting. On top of all that, there are multiple additional letters from Austrade. I am happy to table this one as well from 2002, saying what a fine company this Beijing -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Liberal government's paeans of praise for this company go on. We have one from 27 March 2006 to Mr Ian Tang himself, again from the Australian Embassy in Beijing, advising Mr Tang what a wonderful job that company was doing. I table that one as well. From all of these documents we see a clear pattern. Whether it be the National Party, which is the recipient of $155,000 worth of political donations and whose Deputy Prime Minister in government was in Beijing actively supporting the project of Mr Ian Tang, or whether it be the Liberal Party, through the communications minister, Senator Alston - given the technology focus of another part of this company's operations. All along they have been actively supporting this company's operation and, through Australia's agencies in China - namely, the Australian Embassy and Austrade - they put on the documentary record not just the nature of this company's activities but how much this government actively supported it. Therefore, I think we have a case of someone's credibility - namely, the member for Goldstein - collapsing in a heap.Let me go through what the member for Goldstein has said this week. On Tuesday of this week he said that my particular crime against humanity was that I had travelled to the Sudan in the company of a representative of this company. That was untrue. He went on to say that, while I was in Sudan, I was there representing the commercial interests of this company in the technology field. That was untrue; I was visiting western Darfur. Then today he had the audacity to go on the national media and say, 'We don't know about this company.' Honourable Member for Goldstein, the government of which you were a part knew a flaming lot about this company. The National Party-Liberal Party got 155 grand on the kick. I would suggest that we have here a modest case of double standards. If there is a fundamental problem of supported commercial travel, let the member for Goldstein come to the dispatch box now and announce on behalf of the opposition that they do not wish to receive any supported travel of a commercial nature in the future.</DOC>

 - When we look at the challenges faced by working families right across the nation, these families are being impacted by developments in the global economy and in the national economy. Across the global economy, the rolling impact of the subprime crisis means that we have had an increase in the cost of credit arising from the increased cost of lending, particularly between financial institutions. The US Federal Reserve recently sought again to act on this matter in its decision the other night to reduce its rates by 75 basis points. The Fed having reduced its benchmark interest rate for the sixth time since August, rates have fallen from 5.25 per cent to 2.25 per cent in that time. This is of direct consequence to every family in the country. The sheer size of the American economy and the impact of American actions on global financial markets means that the wash-through effect in terms of the private credit markets and the cost of home mortgages is going to be felt across the world. That is why we have an active interest in this parliament - as has the government - in monitoring very closely all actions being taken by the United States regulatory authorities, their monetary authorities, in their response to the ongoing impact of the subprime crisis.The inflation challenge that we face in this country compounds the difficulties which our own regulatory authorities face. For the benefit of the House, I repeat: when the government was elected, interest rates in this country were the second highest in the developed world, courtesy of the previous government; and, secondly, we had inflation running at a 16-year high. This compounds enormously the task of those charged with the responsibility of economic and public financial management in this country. High inflation complicates the task of economic policy, particularly at a time of global economic uncertainty. That is why it is important that we embark upon a responsible course of action to deal with these challenges, to ensure that we have a budget balance and a budget surplus - hence the target that we have announced - to ensure elsewhere on the demand side of the economy that we are boosting private savings and also to pick up the slack left by those who have preceded us by investing in the supply side of the economy when it comes to skills and infrastructure. Of course, where the rubber hits the road with these global economic developments and the uncertainty of global financial markets, as well as the domestic inflation challenge, we have this real problem on our hands - namely, housing affordability for working families. The Age newspaper today reveals that, for the first time since records began in the early 1980s, rental vacancy rates are at a new record low of 0.9 per cent in Melbourne. -  - I notice those opposite find this very amusing. Those around the country who are experiencing an enormous shortage of affordable rental accommodation at the moment are not finding it amusing at all. It is very tough out there. In our caucus room the other day we dealt with a frightening number of stories of many people participating in auctions to obtain access to rental premises. The impact on working families' disposable income is huge. The most recent data, published in the Age today, adds to that.As members, at least on this side of the House, are aware, this problem is not confined to Melbourne; it is right across the country. The Real Estate Institute of Australia reports that rental vacancy rates have now slipped below three per cent in every capital in the country. So it is no wonder that average rents for three-bedroom homes have risen by 82 per cent since 1996. Housing affordability, in all its categories, including rental accommodation, has fallen through the floor over the last decade.If you look at the ratio between household income and the cost of purchasing a new home on the one hand, and the relationship between household income and the cost of rents on the other hand, you will understand why working families are under so much financial pressure. The Real Estate Institute of Victoria states what is required by way of action. I quote from the CEO of the REIV, Enzo Raimondo, who said about today's alarming figures:_ it increases the urgency for governments to take action to increase public and private investment in rental stock.That is precisely the course of action which this government has embarked upon. Rather than ignoring the housing problem, rather than not having a minister for housing, rather than not having a department of housing - which was the case on the part of those who preceded us - and rather than not having a housing policy at all, part of our $1.6 billion-plus programs on housing goes right to creating, over time, 100,000 affordable rental properties, charging, we hope, some 20 per cent below market rents by encouraging private sector investment in this field.There is an acute shortage of affordable rental stock across the country. We have policy lined up to act in this area. Those opposite were inert on this issue. I say to those opposite: it is important that we see for the first time, as we break for the prebudget recess, one positive policy from the opposition on what to do with the housing affordability crisis which their inaction on inflation and interest rates has left for working Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for that question, on the five-year anniversary of the commencement of the Iraq war. The Australian government is committed to improving the capacity of the Iraqi government and the wellbeing of the Iraqi people. We are currently giving consideration to additional non-military assistance for Iraq, including humanitarian relief and training in critical capacity-building areas. For example, Australia is already delivering training in law administration and the rule of law to Iraqis, in partnership with the Iraqi and United States governments and the United Nations.So far as military support is concerned, members would be aware that the government has confirmed its election commitment that Australian troops in southern Iraq, the Overwatch Battle Group, will be withdrawn in the middle of 2008. This is being done in consultation with our allies - the United States and the United Kingdom - and the Iraqi government. These plans continue to be on track.I was asked about consistency. The government have always been absolutely consistent in our approach to Iraq and that election commitment. Regrettably, this clarity and consistency has not been evident elsewhere. Before the election the previous government, the now opposition, said that such a withdrawal - the implementation of such an election commitment - would be an enormous victory for terrorism. Before the election the then Minister for Defence, the now Leader of the Opposition, said that such an implementation of an election commitment would be a 'disaster of mammoth proportions'. Regrettably, there is no longer any consistency or clarity on the part of the opposition - as we now find, for example, reported in the Melbourne Age on 7 December last year:Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson has backed Labor's plan to withdraw Australia's combat forces from Iraq by June, breaking from his past insistence that it would be dangerous to set a timetable for troop withdrawals.There is no consistency there but also no clarity. In the same report, some of Dr Nelson's new frontbench team appeared to be caught off guard by the move. New shadow foreign affairs spokesman, Andrew Robb, yesterday urged caution over 'Labor's plan for a premature withdrawal of troops'. He argued that arbitrary dates for withdrawal did not take proper account of whether the Iraqi government could prevent a return of genocide. So before the election it is 'Troops stay there'; after the election, so far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, it is 'Troops out,' but not if you are the shadow spokesperson for foreign affairs. This goes right to the heart of the matter. Neither the Leader of the Opposition nor the opposition themselves actually know what they stand for. They have, again, completely lost their way. They do not know what they stand for.One element of the question was: how is Australia engaging with the United States on this matter? We are engaging very well with the United States administration on this matter. We have made it crystal clear that that will be our approach, irrespective of which United States administration we are dealing with. So far as we are concerned, our relationship with the United States, through our alliance, transcends whatever administration might be in power in the United States, whether it be Democrat or Republican. Regrettably, that is not the view of members opposite. In February 2007 the then Prime Minister, John Howard, said:If I was running al-Qaeda in Iraq, I would ... pray, as many times as possible, for a victory not only for Obama, but also for the Democrats. - In February 2007 the then Prime Minister, John Howard, said, effectively, to the Australian people and to the American people that the Democrats are the terrorist candidates, and this was backed up 110 per cent by the Leader of the Opposition. The following day he came to the dispatch box and backed up the Prime Minister, saying that so far as the then Australian government was concerned - the Liberal and National parties - Obama and the Democrats were the terrorist candidates. The Labor government will deal professionally with whatever administration is in charge in the United States, unlike the Liberal and National parties, who say that the Democratic Party in the United States is the candidate of the terrorists. And some of those opposite talk about judgement in foreign policy matters!</DOC>

 - The first part of the honourable member's question we have answered. On the second part of the honourable member's question, which concerns how individual applications for foreign investment in Australia are to be treated: they will be treated by the normal Foreign Investment Review Board processes, which would involve, of course, judgements to be made in the national interest. In the case of foreign government owned entities, judgements will be made against the new guidelines which were released by this government in recent times. The reason for doing that is that we have a growth of sovereign wealth funds. National interest needs to be defined. It has been in our guidelines. The previous government failed to do that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. This Easter will be the first time that the ACCC has had formal power to monitor petrol prices - the very first time the ACCC has had these formal powers. It is very important, because there has been some alleged activity by some petrol stations over the last few days. There are serious allegations that consumers are driving into petrol stations that are advertising cheaper unleaded prices only to find that the pumps are out of order and that they are forced to buy more expensive petrol. I can report to the House that over recent days almost 50 inspectors from the ACCC and state governments have been out there to ensure that activity such as that is not occurring and there will be inspectors on the beat over the Easter period. We now have a watchdog with teeth, and they will be out there. Today I urge Australians who feel they are being ripped off by any of the practices that were mentioned before to call the ACCC on 1300302502.Those opposite might think that financial pressure on Australian families is a laughing matter. Could you have a better example of a group of people who are more out of touch than those over there? This is the crew who have a spokesman for Treasury who said when he was questioned about the highest inflation in 16 years, 'Mission accomplished.' He was proud of it. What did he say when productivity hit zero? He said: 'Don't worry. Mission accomplished.' What did he say when there were eight interest rate rises in three years? He said: 'Don't worry. Mission accomplished.' - Competition in petrol retailing is a very serious issue. It goes to the core of the financial pressures on Australian families. I am sorry that the rabble over there does not appear to understand. This Easter, the ACCC have said they will not hesitate to prosecute and fine those involved in misleading conduct, and that can happen now because this government has given the ACCC some teeth.</DOC>

 - The government takes seriously its relationship with the Australian business community. The core of the question from the member is the extent to which this government has been having extensive contact with the Australian business community. I would say, if I looked along the ranks of the front bench, the number of senior Australian business leaders who have been to see us about all manner of matters since the election only three months ago is huge. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has engaged in extensive consultations with the business community on the transition bill on industrial relations - which I think the opposition supported yesterday, but I am still a bit unclear about the precise outcome of the vote. The Treasurer is in active consultation with the business community, both with the financial community and elsewhere. And so it goes on, through the minister for finance, the industry minister, the minister for agriculture and other ministers including the minister for resources, the minister for trade and the minister for infrastructure. The minister for infrastructure has been meeting with members of the business community right across the country, who have been scratching their heads as to why those opposite could possibly have conceived of opposing a body such as Infrastructure Australia. Our contact and engagement with the Australian business community is fundamental business for the government. We have been actively engaged in that consultation since the election. I have to say that one of the common refrains that we have received is, 'After 12 years in office, we never got the sort of access we have to this government to the previous government.' The simple reason for that is the opposition were completely preoccupied in seeking to attend to matters not relevant to the economy, matters not relevant to Australia's long-term economic wellbeing - just themselves.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Port Adelaide for his question. It has become clear over the first session of this new parliament that there are some members of the opposition who do not accept the government's critique of the record of economic and financial management of the former government. In fact, some members of the opposition still hold dear to the nostrum that the former government was Australia's best ever economic and financial manager. -  - It is very good to see that some of you stand for something! We, of course, do not agree with them. We think there are one or two facts that kind of get in the road of this assessment, like: 10 interest rate increases in a row; inflation at a 16-year high, government spending increasing at 4Â½ per cent real; money squandered on things like $457 million in government advertising in the space of the 16 months; grants soaring from $450 million in 2002 to $4.5 billion in 2007; huge blowouts in defence spending; enormous increases in Public Service employment, particularly at the SES level; millions squandered on regional rorts; productivity growth down to zero; a current account deficit above six per cent; and so the list goes on. But some in the opposition discount these inconvenient facts and hold true to the belief that the former government was the best economic and financial manager that Australia has ever seen - like the true diehard and ultimate Howard supporter, the member for Warringah, who last night demanded that the Rudd government honour the former Liberal government's promise to spend $9 million upgrading the Brookvale Oval, the home of the Sea Eagles. He finished his speech with these immortal lines:We are all Australians. We all deserve a share of government largesse.That tells you everything you need to know about the Howard government. But at least the member for Warringah stands for something; at least he has got a position. On the recent economic and financial management performance of governments, at least some in the opposition actually take a stand. Sadly, we cannot say the same about the Leader of the Opposition. No-one could ever accuse him of being a true believer about anything. When he is asked the big questions about economic and financial management, he refuses to answer. He pleads the fifth; he takes the fifth. Does he support Work Choices? He will not say. Does he believe that government spending needs to be cut? He will not answer the question. It was put to him at the Press Club the other day, and he would not answer. Does he believe there is a need to tackle the spending blowouts in defence? He could not possibly comment.The moment of truth is coming for the Leader of the Opposition and it is coming quicker than he believes. In fact, it is coming this weekend. There is a matter of enormous significance, of enormous importance to many Australians, happening this weekend. The question he has to face up to is: which footy team does he barrack for? He has told the Australian people over the years that he barracks for two teams - the Swans and the Saints. He barracks for both - just as he is in favour of Work Choices when he is in the boardrooms in Sydney but is against Work Choices when he is out in regional Queensland; just like he opposed an apology to Indigenous people in December and supported it in February; just like he spent half his adult life in the Labor Party and half in the Liberal Party -  - The moment of truth is arriving about what the Leader of the Opposition stands for on a number of issues. What does he stand for on industrial relations and on economic management? What party does he want to belong to? What is he going to do about the amalgamation? - I will bring my contribution to a conclusion, Mr Speaker. The moment of truth arrives on Saturday night at Telstra Dome because the Swans are playing the Saints. Who is the Leader of the Opposition going to barrack for?</DOC>

 - The challenge we have is inflation running at a 16-year high. It is a fact. Those opposite may rail against the fact, they may find it politically uncomfortable, but it is a fact. It is not a production of ALP publications; it is a production of national statistical data. The challenge for responsible government and responsible economic management is: what do you do about this 16-year high inflation record? That is, if you leave it unattended to, it continues to do what inflation has been doing for some time, which is punish working families by causing upwards pressure on interest rates. That is the economic equation: if you leave inflation unaddressed it rolls through to interest rates pressure, which rolls through to working families.Here is where the rubber hits the road for those opposite. By failing to act on inflation so consistently, they sat there and allowed interest rates to go up time and time again and thereby punished working families. That is what happened as a consequence of the previous government's inertia on inflation. Our response to dealing with the inflation challenge is to look at the total equation on the supply side and the demand side. On the demand side of the equation, if you make sure that through responsible budget management you have a decent budget surplus by way of a target then you bring down public demand as part of the overall demand equation. We are mindful of the fact that, when it comes to private consumption and private demand, we are delivering tax cuts. That is why it is important for us to show restraint as far as the overall architecture of public demand is concerned. Furthermore, the government continues to examine measures which assist in boosting private savings on the way through. That is half the inflation equation.The other half is dealing with the supply-side measures. And it is there, after 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank of Australia, that those opposite failed to act on skills and failed to act on infrastructure, resulting in all sorts of capacity constraints. Frankly, if you have a situation where you have demand exceeding supply over a long period of time, you get inflation and interest rate pressures go up. We will act responsibly on this, as those preceding us did not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. At the last election the Rudd Labor government argued that an education revolution was necessary to boost the productivity of our economy and lift workforce participation. We argued for productivity at work, with a fair and balanced workplace relations system, and we argued for the building of productivity for the future, with an investment in education and training, which had suffered 12 long years of neglect, including under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.Of course, we know that people who acquire skills and qualifications beyond the basics of schooling will earn more, they will contribute more, they will have longer working lives, and they will have access to more opportunities. And we know that investment in the early years and help for parents with childcare costs and schooling costs are very important to making sure people have the access to education that they should have. We have committed to investing billions of dollars in schools and in the development of trade training centres.We are keeping our commitments in education, as we are keeping our commitments across government, because the Rudd Labor government believe in honouring our word - something not known to members opposite, who invented the term 'non-core promise'. We have concluded that a different way of approaching reform is necessary if we are to deliver an education revolution right around the country. We need to have Commonwealth-state cooperation if we are really to make a difference.Last December, the Prime Minister held a meeting of the Council of Australian Governments, and it agreed to make sure seven working groups drove the new reform agenda for the Commonwealth and the states. I chair one of those seven working groups, the productivity working group. It has met three times since the December COAG meeting. It has noted that in February 2007 the Productivity Commission found that early childhood education, education generally and skills and workforce development could boost participation by 0.7 per cent and productivity by up to 1.2 per cent by 2030. In percentage terms, this may sound fractional, but in dollar terms it is truly startling. This corresponds to an increase in GDP of around 2.2 per cent, or around $25 billion in today's dollars - an amazing dividend from investing in productivity and participation by investing in education, from the education of our youngest children right through the spectrum of education.Of course, we know when we look at the country today that educational opportunity and educational disadvantage are associated with local communities. We can all think, across this great nation, of communities that continue to experience disadvantage despite more than a decade and a half of economic growth, communities where, on current statistics, we know that, unless we act to make a difference, it is far less likely that children will successfully complete school and it is far less likely that they will have a successful working life. Indeed, it is quite likely that they will slip into disadvantage or have a working career with only a marginal attachment to the labour force, with periods of either unemployment or underemployment or cycling through unskilled jobs.We do want to make a difference to that disadvantage. We have been working on making a difference to that disadvantage in the COAG productivity working group that I chair. We know that we are not well served by the lack of consistent national data on the distribution of disadvantage and its impact on schools. I hope and I expect that next week's COAG meeting will agree to an unprecedented new agenda for raising educational outcomes and boosting productivity and participation in this nation. The agenda to be discussed at COAG will form the basis for the development of funding agreements and national partnerships designed to lift productivity and participation.I would like to take this opportunity, on the parliament's last sitting day before the COAG meeting, to thank my colleagues in the states and territories for the effort and commitment they have shown in contributing to this agenda.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his first question to me. The Rudd Labor government is committed to supporting small business in this country. We took to the last election a range of policies that we will implement and implement in full. They include the provision of one-stop-shop advisory services to small businesses. They include revisions to the Trade Practices Act that will ensure that small businesses get a fair deal and can operate in an open, competitive environment with more powerful businesses. Our policies also extend to the area of industrial relations. In the industrial relations area we have witnessed, under the previous government, the accumulation of enormous amounts of red tape. For example, as at November last year, 150,000 agreements were awaiting approval from the Workplace Authority. - That is why this government, the Rudd government, will ensure that small businesses can not only survive but thrive in an open, competitive economy, not choked by the red tape that was tied around their necks by members opposite when they were in government. - The red-tape burden on small business has been enormous. It has been a result of 10 years of squandered opportunity from the members opposite. Back in 1996, before this member came into the parliament, the then government commissioned a report from the late Charlie Bell on reducing business red tape. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am speaking directly about the red-tape burden imposed by Work Choices, the legislation that dare not speak its name. All those opposite in here are really and truly champions of Work Choices. For politically convenient reasons they have now said that Work Choices is dead. But what is the truth? - As a result of Work Choices this regulatory burden was dramatically increased. The Rudd Labor government is reducing -  - the red-tape burden through a comprehensive program of microeconomic reform, cutting red tape and ensuring through the Council of Australian Governments that we have a seamless economy, as called for by the Business Council of Australia, which is in the interests of small business. By reducing that regulatory burden, by simplifying life for small businesses, by rewarding effort, risk-taking and entrepreneurship, we will ensure that small businesses are made better off in this country so that they are not weighed down by this compliance burden that was imposed by this mob opposite.A decade after the report to which I referred was first commissioned, a second report was commissioned. That was produced by Gary Banks, the head of the Productivity Commission. And what did the Business Council of Australia say as a result of the 10 years of neglect of this mob? It said that they had presided over the 'creeping re-regulation of Australian business'. So, don't come into this chamber asking, 'What's Labor going to do about easing the burden on small business?' when for 10 years you did nothing. You re-regulated the Australian economy. You reversed the reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments. - Shame on you for reversing those reforms, re-regulating the economy -  - Small business can thrive and survive and go well in this country. -  - </DOC>

 - As the House is aware, Labor is actively engaged in cutting wasteful spending from the previous era and particularly in exercising the necessary disciplines in response to the economic circumstances that the country faces. But, in the lead-up to the last election, the member for Wentworth had ministerial responsibility for the Community Water Grants program. This program provided community organisations, schools and Indigenous communities with the opportunity to apply for grants worth up to $50,000 for water saving, recycling and treatment projects. Round 1, announced in March 2006, had approximately 5,000 applications from across Australia. The member for Wentworth approved 1,750, amounting to a cost of approximately $61 million. Round 2 funding, announced in late 2006 and early 2007, was approved for 1,611 projects totalling $66.7 million. But in May last year the member for Wentworth announced $200 million to help communities save water, and the funding was proposed to extend the program until 2012-13. Round 3 grants were announced on 22 October last year, during the federal election campaign. With his eye firmly on the federal election day, the member for Wentworth funded 4,661 Community Water Grants projects, worth $174.8 million over the next year. This was six years of funding in one financial year - clear evidence that the member for Wentworth is incapable of balancing any budget. A funding blow-out of this nature represents almost double the combined amount of funding approved for round 1 and round 2.So let us be clear. The member for Wentworth took it upon himself to try to assist the re-election prospects of the former Howard government by extending the Community Water Grants program for six years and then spending all that money in the period leading up to the federal election. - This country cannot afford old-style reckless spending anymore. But last week the House heard about the performance of the member for Wentworth in unilaterally rejecting expert scientific advice to fund the rain-making technology being touted by the Australian Rain Corporation to the tune of $2 million. As the House heard, the minister instead wrote back to the Prime Minister and then insisted on heaping $10 million of taxpayers' hard-earned money on this private enterprise - but that figure was five times more than the member for Wentworth was advised of and this was at a time when inflation was brewing.But today I can reveal that, one year earlier, the member for Wentworth wrote to a scientific expert, telling him that intentional weather modification simply does not work. That correspondence states:By and large, these trials have produced results that were inconclusive at best. Furthermore, the American National Academy of Science also concluded, on October 2003, that convincing scientific proof of the efficacy of intentional weather modification efforts were still lacking.The letter continues:The CSIRO has largely abandoned its active research effort after more than 30 years due to inconclusive results.It further says:The CSIRO has concluded that cloud seeding is unlikely to be effective during winter and spring over the inland plains of southern and eastern Australia and similarly inconclusive during summer over eastern and north-eastern Australia and immediately in the north of Perth.Mr Speaker, can you imagine how much of taxpayers' money the member for Wentworth would have spent on this project if he had actually believed in it? - As I said before, Australia simply cannot afford any old-style reckless spending any more. The member for Wentworth had no plan to fight inflation. Worse, he dismissed the inflation problem that families were confronting every day as just a fairy story. But, when it came to reckless spending, the member for Wentworth was the key part of a government under which spending grew faster in the last four years than at any time in the last 35 years. When it comes to reckless spending, the member for Wentworth is the best friend inflation ever had.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kennedy for his question but, unfortunately, I am not given the leniency that he is given, in terms of time, to answer that very detailed and lengthy question. Having said that, I say that, like the member for Kennedy, the government is seriously concerned about alternative fuels, and ethanol is one option. But our responsibility is to put in place an alternative fuel strategy that is not only environmentally smart but also economically smart. I say that because we, as a nation, are potentially on the verge of having serious problems in terms of the import of oil and refined products. By way of example, in 2006-07, Australia's annual oil and refined products net deficit was $4.8 billion. Unfortunately, this deficit is potentially set to grow to $28 billion by 2017.For that very reason, in addition to ethanol, the government is trying to explore a range of alternative fuels in association with also giving proper consideration to vehicle technologies as the potential means of reducing Australia's oil reliance and, in doing so, also paying proper attention to the issue of reducing greenhouse emissions in Australia. In that context, I thank the honourable member for the question. We will give serious thought to his ideas, because we always welcome practical ideas from the member for Kennedy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wakefield for his question. I note his interest in having wheat growers in his electorate who are involved both in selling to the domestic market and in selling as exporters. There is a serious danger for wheat growers post 30 June. If the current legislation remains in place, there is serious uncertainty and a disastrous economic mechanism that gets left by the old legislation post 30 June this year. The only way that certainty can be delivered for wheat growers is for us to be given an opposition position - their attitude - on the draft legislation. The problem we have here is that the shadow minister in the other place who is represented here by the Leader of the Nationals has been unwilling to put forward a position on behalf of the coalition. This leaves wheat growers with no level of certainty at all.I acknowledge the comments from the member for O'Connor in an article by Michelle Grattan in the Age today in which he said he was sure the government will accept technical amendments. Certainly we are serious about having discussions on that. That is the reason why we have put forward an exposure draft. That is the reason why we have an independent expert group that has put out a discussion paper - to make sure that those technical amendments can go through a constructive conversation. I also acknowledge that there was a genuine attempt yesterday by the opposition to try to resolve this issue. They held their joint policy committee meeting. They held what they call the opposition infrastructure rural and regional affairs committee. Senator Heffernan sat there as the chair, but the problem was the Nats did not turn up. They sat there waiting to arrive at a joint position, to have the conversation, and the Nats did not bother to turn up. It reminded me of the comment made by the member for Mallee only today in question time when he said, 'I do not make a lot of contributions in this place.' Unfortunately, that is a pattern. - Normally we have a process where we are able to have a conversation with the shadow minister and know that that represents the opposition position. I do not know if they did not attend the meeting because they were off checking out their Kirribilli conference that they have got planned. Normally we have a process: the Democrats have a spokesperson, so we consult with them; the Greens have a spokesperson, so we consult with them; the opposition has a spokesperson, Senator Scullion, and we consult with him. Unfortunately, the National Party have been unable to put forward a position on behalf of the opposition. - Please! We just have had from the Manager of Opposition Business that Senator Scullion is not even a member of the National Party. - But guess what -  - Normally we would go to Senator Scullion for the position on behalf of the opposition. Senator Scullion is a member, and runs as a member, of the Country Liberal Party and yet he is the Leader of the Nationals in the other place. - Without the capacity to negotiate directly, I have written today to every member of the opposition in both houses and offered them all individual briefings. We cannot deal with one person to provide a position on behalf of the opposition so that we can say to wheat growers that there is certainty for the new crop. We cannot provide that until the opposition declares a position. If the only way we can go forward is to allow public servants to provide confidential briefings - and we will not release who accepts them and who does not - for every member of the coalition, then that is available and we will go forward with that. The Leader of the Opposition could fix this now by standing up and declaring that the Liberal Party, at least, will take a sensible economic decision - what they know is a responsible, competitive position - and give wheat growers certainty. If the National Party is not willing to do it, some leadership should be offered and there is one person who can offer it.</DOC>

 - This government is committed to building a modern Australia capable of meeting the challenges of the 21st century. That means securing a future for the nation and securing a future for working families. What we have done in prosecution of that agenda is decide to pull together the nation's brightest and best in what we have called the 2020 Summit. We on this side of the House, unlike the government which preceded us, do not have the view that politicians have some monopoly on wisdom. When you roll across the country and speak to small businesses; large businesses; people in the regions; people in rural communities right across the nation; non-government organisations; academics - a term which seemed to be treated with absolute derision by the previous government; and those out there in the think tanks, you find they are all people of good mind and good heart who are concerned, with passion, about the future of our nation in an uncertain world. We welcome their ideas. We believe it is time to shake the national tree and invite all the talents and abilities from across the nation - including those opposite, led by the Leader of the Opposition - to participate, to bring forward new ideas and to together help shape the nation's future.We are not in the business of saying when you go out and consult the whole nation that there are right and wrong answers. If you wish to enliven people's participation in the national debate, you have to be welcoming of it and not say that these views are welcome and those are unwelcome. People of good mind and good heart should be encouraged to come forth to the nation's capital and participate. That is what we intend to do. That is why the summit will be on 19 and 20 April. So far we have decided to convene a gathering of 1,000 of the nation's brightest and best. We have already got in excess of 8,000 nominations from across the country. Nearly 1,000 individual policy submissions from people out there right across the country have already been lodged with the 2020 website, www.australia2020.gov.au.This, therefore, is going to make for a difficult challenge for the non-government committee which has been appointed to select 1,000 of our nation's brightest and best to come forward. That committee will bring together 10 working groups, each of about 100. The leadership of those committees should be a matter of note and record here in the parliament. We have Warwick Smith, a former Liberal minister, teaming up with the Deputy Prime Minister on economic infrastructure, the digital economy and the future of our cities. We have Dr David Morgan - most recently of Westpac and, prior to that, of the Reserve Bank - teaming up with the Treasurer on future directions for the economy. We have Roger Beale AO and the minister for climate change on population, sustainability, climate change and water. We have Tim Fischer AC teaming up with Tony Burke on future directions for rural industries and rural communities. -  - I would have thought that those opposite may have a positive contribution to make on these matters, not least of which perhaps on the future direction of our wheat industry. - Maybe that is the forum where we will hear a view from those opposite. Professor Michael Good will team up with the health minister, Nicola Roxon, on a long-term national health strategy. Tim Costello will be teaming up with the housing minister - we have one; our predecessors did not - Tanya Plibersek on strengthening communities, supporting families and social inclusion. Dr Jackie Huggins will be teaming up with the minister for Indigenous affairs on options for the future of Indigenous Australia. Cate Blanchett will be teaming up with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts on building a creative Australia. - John Hartigan from News Ltd will be teaming up with Maxine McKew on the future of Australian governance, and Professor Michael Wesley from Griffith University will be teaming up with the foreign minister on Australia's future security and prosperity in a rapidly changing world. - This is an exciting agenda for the nation's future. - We believe in being positive in our engagement with the nation's expertise, not rejecting of it. That is why we want the nation's brightest and best to team up with us. That is why we have decided to embrace an approach which is demonstrably bipartisan, inviting two former coalition ministers to be party to this overall exercise. The overall program that we have put together will also be supported by a youth summit, which will be convened by the Minister for Youth on the previous weekend, when we will have 100 of our young people come to Canberra. It will be co-chaired with Hugh Evans, formerly of Oaktree. The really exciting thing is that, across the nation in the few weeks leading up to then, we now have more than 500 schools holding their own school summits - 500 schools, from Christmas Island to Esperance to Geraldine and down to, I am told, a little town called Snug in southern Tasmania; I like the sound of a town called Snug. Those young people in their school summits will be feeding into the youth summit. The youth summit will be feeding into the 2020 Summit.This will be a great event for the nation. We believe in harvesting the nation's talents and abilities to bring forth the best ideas for the nation's future, given the huge challenge that we in Australia face. Once the summit has convened, if we can from its gathering shake out of the tree another dozen good ideas for the nation's future, it will be a well-invested weekend. By year's end, we will respond to each and every one of the submissions which have been made to us by the good people of Australia and those participating in the summit. This is a good exercise in open government. I am surprised that those opposite react to it with such cynicism. Is it another case of flip, flop, flap? The Leader of the Opposition, who has been objecting vociferously about this and who, within 30 minutes of my announcing this some time ago, stood up and said he welcomed it, now two months later says he doesn't really welcome it. We have seen a bit of that today. We are very excited about what can come forth out of this. We will not solve all the nation's problems, but we intend to engage the good people of Australia, and all their talents and abilities, to make sure that we help craft a modern Australia, capable of meeting the challenges of the 21st century and securing a future for working families.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. When it comes to evidence based policy and taking proper advice from departments and sounding things out, those opposite should reflect on the lead-up to the decision by this country to participate in the invasion of Iraq, but let us leave that to one side. - Public Service departments were not consulted on a solemn decision to take the nation to war. The decision had already been taken politically and ideologically by members still present on the benches opposite.On the question of the Medicare surcharge, when those opposite introduced the Medicare levy surcharge back in 1997 they indicated that $50,000 represented a high income. They said that that was their benchmark for a high income. Furthermore, in the period since then, despite multiple representations from the community at large to do something about the indexation of that figure, in budget after budget those opposite declined to do so - including the then Treasurer, who seems to have burst out of the blocks again this morning with some rolling commentary on the upcoming budget week, which I thought was an interesting development. By any person's definition, $50,000 is not a high income today. Working families and working Australians are under financial pressure. Therefore, for those opposite to continue to argue that that represents an acceptable benchmark for the future is remarkable. We believe that this is necessary to provide some relief to working families under pressure. That is why we are proposing this measure, and we intend to implement it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. This cyclone hit Burma with devastating force on 2 and 3 May. Burma's state media has put the death toll at 23,000, with 37,000 unaccounted for. The United Nations by contrast estimates up to 100,000 deaths and 1.5 million people left homeless. The cyclone has caused massive damage to property, infrastructure and communications. The concern now is that a population that is already weak and vulnerable will face a very real risk of the spread of disease and of starvation.It is hard to get a clear picture of precisely the impact on the ground in Burma because of the attitude and posture adopted by the regime. It has been appallingly difficult to get assistance into Burma and, once in, to have any guarantee of its proper distribution. The response of the regime in Burma to this crisis has been absolutely callous. Those paying the price for this callousness have been the long-suffering Burmese people.I am pleased to inform the House that we are making some very modest progress. Some relief supplies from international donors have been getting through, although it is estimated to be only about one-tenth of what is needed. I am pleased to say that this morning a Royal Australian Air Force C17 Globemaster arrived in Rangoon and unloaded much needed supplies. At our request the Burmese government agreed to let our military aircraft land to deliver its supplies. On board the C17 are around 31 tonnes of supplies from Defence and AusAID. It includes water containers, water purification tablets, bedding, blankets, tarpaulins and medical supplies.Thus far we have announced that we are providing $25 million in assistance to Burma, the largest contribution of any country to date. - The honourable member opposite has intervened to say that that amount is pathetic. I have here a list of some 25 nation states; we are the largest contributor. Of the $103 million committed to Burma globally this government has contributed one-quarter of that amount, and those opposite describe that amount as pathetic. This is a gross partisan intervention in a humanitarian intervention of which the government and the country should be proud. Half of that money will go to the United Nations flash appeal; the other half will be for the Australian non-government organisations and UN agencies in Burma.The supplies that have been distributed into Rangoon through the RAAF flight will of course be distributed through the Burmese authorities, as is happening with the humanitarian supplies delivered by other countries right now. We would have preferred them to have been delivered by the UN and by NGOs; that has not been possible. In a crisis like this you have to deal with the cards that you have got. That means working with the Burmese authorities. As the situation becomes clearer we will consider further assistance, including for the reconstruction phase.We will continue to work with our friends and partners around the region, and to work to press the Burmese government to improve on their response to the crisis which to date has been demonstrably inadequate. On Friday, on this matter, I spoke to the United Nations Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon. He expressed to me and has said publicly that he is immensely frustrated at the exceptionally slow response to the crisis, because getting access to Burma is so difficult. Over the course of the weekend I have spoken also to the Prime Minister of Singapore, the current chairman of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations - which Burma is a member of - and to the President of Indonesia about how we can work together more to get more assistance into Burma. The Minister for Foreign Affairs discussed our responses with the Japanese minister for foreign affairs in Tokyo last week and has also been in contact with the UK Foreign Secretary. We have also been liaising closely with our friends and allies in the United States, and also with Thailand and other partners in the region. And we are using every available diplomatic channel, including calling in the Burmese Ambassador here in Canberra to urge the regime to allow greater access, as we have urged also through our representative in Rangoon. We are doing what we can to assist these people in Burma who are suffering most grievously from this natural calamity.Natural disasters have affected our region on a wider scale, as we have seen from events overnight in China. We have now reports of a major earthquake in south-western China that has caused massive damage and significant loss of life. Communications and roads have been cut off in the worst affected areas. There are reports of up to 80 per cent of housing in some areas being destroyed. The death toll is still not known; it is regrettably very high. Media reports are suggesting that it could be 10,000 or more. This is already the highest death toll in an earthquake in China since the Tangshan earthquake of 1976.On behalf of all Australians I extend our sympathy to those affected by the earthquake in China. I have written to Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao this morning expressing this and offering Australian assistance, including search and rescue capabilities of the states and territories of Australia through Emergency Management Australia. This has been followed up directly with Chinese officials. Australia stands ready to offer assistance.These crises remind us afresh of the importance of developing effective regional mechanisms, and to have those in place to respond to major natural disasters across our vast region where, regrettably, natural disasters on a massive scale are becoming far too frequent. With this in mind we will be working closely with our ASEAN and other partners in the region to enhance the region's natural disaster monitoring, coordination and response mechanisms because I have great concerns for the future should disaster strike again, particularly in the region's more remote parts. In the meantime, on behalf of the government, the parliament and the nation we express our sympathy for those who have suffered immensely and whose lives have been lost as a consequence of these recent calamities in our region.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The key thing when it comes to industrial relations is whether you have in place an industrial relations system which rewards productivity. The hallmark of the industrial relations reforms that we are introducing as a government is that they drive productivity. Whether it is the elements which are contained within the proposed modernisation of awards, whether it is the elements contained within the future of enterprise bargaining, whether it is the elements contained in the future arrangements which will govern common-law agreements, productivity must be at its centre and its core. For those reasons, we believe that this is the right way forward to build long-term productivity growth.If you are concerned with the war against inflation, you must not only have an effective strategy to build productivity through your workplace relations system but also do so across the instruments of government policy. You must make sure that you have got a decent supply of labour, a decent supply of skilled labour and a decent supply of trained labour. These are areas of gross and continuing neglect on the part of those who had 12 years to act in this area and failed to do so. Another driver of long-term productivity growth and fighting the fight against inflation is to ensure that your capacity constraints in infrastructure are being dealt with. Once again, we find that those opposite -  - Therefore, if you are concerned about how you ensure that you are fighting an effective fight against inflation through the industrial relations system, through the proper provision of skilled labour and through the proper provision of effective infrastructure across the country, you require a long-term strategy for the nation. - I thank the member for Menzies for his encouragement in the direction of moral improvement. Can I suggest in response to the -  - For the benefit of the House, I will withdraw. The question at issue goes to what industrial relations systems we have in this country and how we will be reforming it. - The policy challenge for the House, for the government and for the nation is: how do you bring about an industrial relations system which builds non-inflationary productivity growth? On the question of advice to governments, I find it quite interesting that the member opposite and those responsible for the previous industrial relations system were always so frank and forthright in the provision of their advice, to wit: modelling prior to the introduction of Work Choices! I find that remarkable. On the general question of access to information contained within government, could I also say this: those opposite used and abused the freedom of information system. We have put forward a program to reform FOI. We made it in direct response to the 'right to know' campaign led by media organisations in the lead-up to the election. We have made those commitments quite plain, and during the period ahead we will be implementing them.</DOC>

 - I find the interjections from those opposite interesting, given that as they exited office they were sitting on levels of expenditure growth on the part of government which are almost right up there with the Australian Guinness Book of Records: 4.5 per cent real at a time when we needed to be reining it in. Instead those opposite were saying, 'Here's another bucket of kerosene. Let's throw it onto the fires of inflation,' and, of course, pretending all along that there was no problem with inflation to start with.As we approach this budget, what this country has been plagued with for far too long has been short-termism: governments delivering one budget after another driven by the short term rather than the long term, one budget after another driven by the electoral cycle rather than by the decade ahead and one budget after another - as we have seen over the last 12 long years - where we have seen repeatedly the triumph of politics over policy.The mood of the nation and the need of the nation now demand that we change. Therefore, we are about to embark upon a new period of responsible economic management - an era that places the budget squarely in the centre of a framework for long-term economic reform for the nation. This is not simply a budget-eve series of bribes, a series of handouts, all with an eye to the next election but, instead, we are taking seriously the long-term fundamental requirements of economic reform - 'economic reform': words which barely crossed the lips of those opposite as one budget after another was delivered from this dispatch box.In framing the budget, the government has confronted difficult economic times: a global financial crisis which is now impacting on real levels of economic growth in North America, across Europe and into our own East Asian hemisphere. While those developments unfold abroad, we are faced also with the challenge of inflation at home. This, however, has not deterred the government from embarking upon an approach to the framing of the budget which has three core pillars - firstly, responsible economic management, given the need to fight inflation; secondly -  -  - They jeer about inflation. - Inflation is a real challenge for working families dealing with rising mortgage rates - 12 rises in a row - dealing with rents going through the roof and dealing with petrol prices, grocery prices and what is happening with childcare costs, and those opposite say that inflation is a fairytale, that it does not exist. They say that inflation is a charade, that it does not exist. Well, we have news for those opposite. We have news for the Liberal Party. Inflation is real not just for businesses; it is real for working families, which demands therefore a responsible approach. That is why as we embark upon this budget our first responsibility is to fight the fight against inflation, and we will not resile from that. We will make sure that those who are impacted by this budget know that the overall long-term wellbeing of this economy is being properly attended to. When we assumed office, we inherited an inflation rate running at 16-year highs. - The Leader of the Opposition says 'rubbish'. Sixteen-year highs - that is in fact the truth. We had in the March 2008 quarter 4.2 per cent inflation. Anyone around the world looking at the emergence of the inflation genie from the bottle has to ensure that they deal with a problem before it becomes much bigger and begins to plague the totality of the economy. That is where responsible economic management lies - and, can I say, the International Monetary Fund is of a similar view. Presumably those opposite, who have a higher wisdom than the IMF, a higher wisdom than most economic commentators in the country, a higher wisdom than the Treasury and others, believe that inflation is purely a fairytale and a charade. The member for Higgins, I am sure, had much to say about this in his intervention in the budget debate today, joining the three-ring circus of the Liberal Party leadership race.Then we go to the second pillar of this budget strategy. We are fighting the fight against inflation through bringing about a responsible government surplus and attacking government expenditure, despite the fact that those opposite have argued there is no economic case for cutting government expenditure - that is their bottom line, that there is no economic case for cutting government expenditure. We will in fact take, by contrast, a responsible course of action. The second pillar lies in helping working families under financial pressure - about whom those opposite said, 'Working families have never been better off.' Those opposite happily supported that proposition. That is how you describe working families, and you add to that by saying that working families do not have an inflation problem. Well, they do have an inflation problem, and our responsibility in the framework of this budget is to ensure that those families get relief through the tax system, get relief through the childcare tax rebate system, get relief when it comes to education costs and health costs endured by families and get relief when it comes to the challenge of housing affordability.Then there is the third pillar. The third pillar is this area of systemic neglect on the part of those opposite. How do you invest in this nation's long-term productive potential? What do you do about the enormous backlog in infrastructure, the skills deficit and, right across, the needs of our health and hospital system? Responsible governance, presiding over the revenue windfall that those opposite had off the back of the resources boom over the last half-decade -  - The third pillar of our approach to economic policy is to deal with these areas of long-term neglect for the future. If you are in receipt, as the previous government has been, of significant revenues flowing from the resources boom, the responsible course of action would be to invest that in the long-term capacity needs of the economy, in infrastructure and in education and also to deal with the chronic problems in our health and hospital system. This, therefore, is a necessary additional discipline which we will apply to the budget and economic policy process.In framing this budget, these are our three pillars: firstly, responsible economic management - cutting government expenditure and producing sizeable government surpluses to fight inflation; secondly, helping working families under financial pressure; and, thirdly, assisting with the long-term provision which we need to invest in of education, infrastructure, climate change and, of course, health and hospitals.We were elected on a platform of governing as economic conservatives, and we intend to govern as economic conservatives when it comes to the question of ensuring proper custodianship of public finance. We take seriously the responsibility of producing a sizeable government surplus. Those opposite, apparently, by saying that there is no economic case to cut government expenditure, do not.On top of that, this government is committed to an activist approach to microeconomic reform policy. We will ensure that the overall task of productivity growth is advanced through the policy instruments available to government. This is the architecture which underpins our approach to the important fiscal document which the Treasurer will release tonight. This underpins and underlines the government's overall long-term economic strategy - all about the long term, not about the short term.</DOC>

 - The government appointed Mr Pat Walker as Petrol Commissioner and announced a national fuel watch scheme, which is to come into force later this year. The commissioner will oversee the ACCC's formal monitoring of unleaded petrol prices as well as providing an annual report on the ACCC's findings. The government has directed the ACCC to monitor prices, costs and -  - The government has directed the ACCC to monitor the prices, costs and profits relating to the supply of unleaded petrol products in the petroleum industry, including imports, refining, wholesaling and retailing. Furthermore, the commissioner will also be responsible for a renewed focus on the informal monitoring of LPG and diesel and will advise the government on whether any further powers for the ACCC are necessary in this area as well. The national FuelWatch scheme is to commence on 15 December 2008. FuelWatch will apply to unleaded petrol, premium unleaded petrol, LPG, diesel, 98 RON and biodiesel blends.We believe that this is a positive step forward. It does not represent a silver bullet when it comes to petrol prices; it does, however, represent a government which (a) recognised that petrol prices were hurting working families and (b), rather than sitting on its hands, directed the competition policy regulator to act in this area. Therefore, we believe long term that this will assist overall in dealing with the challenges of higher fuel prices faced by Australian motorists. I contrast that with a statement by one of those opposite. Peter Dutton is the shadow minister for what? - Thank you. He said:I think Brendan Nelson would have a greater capacity to deliver lower petrol prices for families ...Given that the shadow minister for finance - the alternative minister for finance - has said that Brendan Nelson would have a greater capacity to deliver lower petrol prices, I simply ask: by what means?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Of course, responsible economic commentators are all talking about the skills crisis that this nation is going through and its pressure on inflation. I refer particularly to the Australian Industry Group-Deloitte national CEO survey, which was released in April. That estimates that as many as a quarter of a million full-time employees are necessary to satisfy current skill needs. It also found that current skills shortages are severely impeding Australia's innovation performance. The survey found that almost 70 per cent of the firms involved claimed that skills shortages had impacted on their business over the past year. This is CEOs telling us what is impacting on their business today.Of course, we know this is a crisis that has not grown up overnight. The Reserve Bank has produced more than 20 warnings about the skills crisis and its impact on inflation. These warnings went unheeded by the former government. Indeed, the member for Goldstein, who at that stage was responsible for vocational education and training, made the stunning admission:... we've got a problem with skill shortage ... I mean we knew it was coming but it has arrived with a force._Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _And you know, it's only going to get worse.That level of lack of understanding and concern about the skills crisis and its upwards pressure on inflation is shared by the opposition generally. They do not know anything about inflation any more, apparently. We have contradictory statements every day. On one day, the Leader of the Opposition will come out and say, 'There's no case for budget cuts because there's no inflation problem. It's a charade.' Then the shadow Treasurer will come out and say that there is a case for budget cuts. Then the Deputy Leader of the Opposition will come out and say that she is concerned about wages inflation, but there is no analysis from the opposition, let alone solutions, about the truly inflationary impacts that their policies left on this nation. There is no greater inflationary impact than the current skills crisis.Mr Speaker, I think we should note that, when it comes to the current skills crisis, the current Leader of the Opposition and the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition bear unique personal responsibility - having been the last two ministers for education in this country - for the generation of this skills crisis because they did not invest in education and training. We have been treated today to an unusual press conference by the former Treasurer, who is floating around like Banquo's ghost. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Returning to the question: the press conference by the former Treasurer bears on the question of the skills crisis and investment in education and training because, when he gave this press conference, he said:Now, I set up the Higher Education Endowment Fund, which would be investing that money to build world-class education.Here is the former Treasurer taking personal credit for the only major education initiative of the Howard government in its last term - nothing to do with the Leader of the Opposition, nothing to do with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but out of the mouth of the former Treasurer, who is there rattling around like Banquo's ghost, giving his commentary on the budget, whether or not anybody is interested in it. Whilst their track record is one of indifference and neglect and their current contribution to the economic debate is inconsistent gibberish, day by day the government is getting on with the job of resolving the skills crisis. Amongst the important investments being made by the government, we are investing in 450,000 new training places, the first 20,000 of which were available in April. We are delighted by the interest of registered training organisations in the delivery of these places. Already with these training places students are enrolled in areas of skill shortage. Whilst the places go right across the skill shortage spectrum - including mining, construction and other areas - I think it will be of interest to working families who are concerned about getting aged care for their elderly relatives and child care for their children that amongst the skill shortage areas that have had good take-up are childcare and aged-care packages. That means we will have new workforce in our aged-care centres and childcare centres, which desperately need them.These are the kinds of interventions which were not made by the previous government, which buried its head in the sand when it came to the skills crisis - did absolutely nothing, left a legacy of the highest inflation rate for 16 years - because it never understood the need to invest in future skills training for Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Here is some evidence for you. The 2005 Australian Secondary Students Alcohol and Drug Survey noted that, by the age of 14, around 86 per cent of students had tried alcohol; by the age of 17, around 70 per cent of students had consumed alcohol in the month prior to the survey; in any given week, approximately one in 10, which equates to about 168,000, 12- to 17-year-olds reported binge drinking or drinking at risky levels, defined by the NHMRC as seven or more drinks for males and five or more for females; and, for 16- and 17-year-olds in any given week, one in five drank at risky levels. Rather than reduce the excise on these drinks, as those opposite did, we have decided to act responsibly.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The budget to be delivered tonight has been framed in extremely challenging circumstances. One of those circumstances in particular has been the fact that the government has inherited a rate of government spending growth running between 4Â½ and five per cent in real terms, which is putting serious upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. The budget we inherited from the former Liberal government was awash with wasteful, inefficient, short-term, vote-buying initiatives. For example, in the last 16 months of the Howard government we had $457 million spent on government advertising - they go a little bit quiet when they hear that statistic, don't they, Mr Speaker? - $350 million spent in one year on the infamous Work Choices scheme; $417 million spent over a number of years on the now completely discredited Regional Partnerships scheme; Public Service numbers soaring, most particularly a 44 per cent increase in the SES level, the fat cat level; and virtually no serious savings initiatives in any budget since the 2003 budget, so for four budgets in a row.It is against that backdrop that the government has adopted key targets to deliver a surplus of a least 1Â½ per cent of GDP, requiring $3 billion to $4 billion in savings and no revenue windfall being used to deliver that outcome. We are pursuing these targets for three key reasons, which were outlined by the Prime Minister earlier: to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates, to move the focus of the budget from short-term wasteful, vote-buying expenditure to investment for the long-term future of this nation and to protect the living standards of working people, particularly those who are struggling to make ends meet in the face of rising prices on a variety of fronts. I have learnt to expect almost anything in Australian politics but it amazes me that these objectives appear to be highly controversial. The objectives I have just set out - downward pressure on inflation and interest rates by cutting government spending, moving from short-term vote-buying to long-term investment, and protecting the living standards of working people - are apparently controversial.The Leader of the Opposition has followed in the footsteps of the member for Wentworth by dismissing the inflation problem that this nation faces as a charade. He said before that it was rubbish that we have the highest rate of inflation for 16 years - when that is a simple statistical fact. The Leader of the National Party and his party have refused to disown the infamous Regional Partnerships and other regional rorts programs that were used by the former government for vote buying. The Leader of the National Party seems to think that the biggest issue in Australian politics this year is the defunding of the fishing hall of fame by the Rudd government. That is the big event that has occurred during his time as Leader of the National Party.No-one from the opposition has disowned the extraordinary expenditure on government advertising over those past 16 months of the Howard government. Some of the opposition also seem to think that working people in this country should be paying taxes to fund welfare for millionaires. Half of the opposition appear to think this and the other half are not quite sure. We are not quite sure which side of the argument the member for Wentworth is on on any particular day. He swaps from one side to the other depending on which day it is.You can guarantee that, come tonight and come Thursday night, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Wentworth will be nitpicking about individual savings measures, complaining about specific budget cuts and refusing to acknowledge that there is a need to cut government expenditure. The Leader of the Opposition was very aptly described by a journalist a couple of weeks ago as a 'piece of emotional blotting paper' - he feels everybody's pain. Whenever anyone has a complaint about a decision taken by government, you can guarantee the Leader of the Opposition will be there feeling their pain. He feels everybody's pain. If a little kid falls off his bike and grazes his knee, Brendan will be there feeling his pain.You have to take tough decisions in government. This budget will involve tough decisions, but it will be a Labor budget. It will be a tough budget, but it will be a fair budget that looks after the living standards of working people. We will be making the decisions that are required in order to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates and look after the interests of the working people of this nation and invest for the longer term future of this country's prosperity.</DOC>

 - If we are to build long-term productivity growth in Australia, we need an education revolution. If we are going to have an education revolution, we have to make sure we have digital classrooms, which means that every kid across the country has access to the tools of the new economy. It does not matter whether you are in a private school or a public school, in regional Australia, rural Australia or metro Australia - we want every kid to have a decent start in life. That is why in opposition we gave an undertaking that we would introduce our computers in schools policy.In order to provide Australian students with the best job and life opportunities in the future, the Commonwealth government is investing $900 million through the National Secondary School Computer Fund to provide new, upgraded ICT for students in years 9 to 12. The first $100 million from the fund will be directed to the most needy schools by June 2008. However, the Council of Australian Governments has also agreed that, to the extent that there are any legitimate and additional costs to the states and territories as a consequence of this commitment, the costs will be considered by treasurers in the final determination of the new specific purpose payments arrangements at year's end.We believe in investing in the future and investing in education's future. If you are going to have an education revolution and position our young people as world-beaters in the 21st century, this is what you have to do - not spend 12 years raking in the money from the mining boom and not investing any significant quantity at all in the future educational needs of young Australians and Australia's workforce of the future.</DOC>

 - There are indeed many examples of wasted spending in the Regional Partnerships program that were identified in the report done by the National Audit Office - or, as I like to call it, 'the Nationals Audit Office'. These examples include wasting money on ethanol plants that did not exist, cheese factories that closed down, rail lines that burnt down and pet food factories that never opened. That is why I was most intrigued this morning when the shadow Treasurer did a doorstop about reckless spending. This is what the shadow Treasurer said: 'Every program and any program that is inefficient or is not delivering value for money should be changed, revised, removed.' That is a very clear commitment from those opposite that stands in stark contrast to the way that they presided over the 'regional rorts' program during their period in office. When I saw these comments I wondered what the shadow Treasurer would have to say about the case of Coonawarra Gold. - It was a waste of spending. - They have been asking for evidence all day, Mr Speaker. I am about to give them some and they might like to listen. - Coonawarra Gold was a grape seed oil company in South Australia. On 20 June 2005 the former government approved $433,000 of taxpayers' funds for this company. It was to put odour control filters into the company - a worthy objective to assist with the odour that would otherwise go out to the local community. As part of my duties as a diligent regional development minister I visited Coonawarra in January this year and I looked for the Coonawarra Gold factory. I could not find it anywhere.I began to think that the only odour that was around was the stench from the Regional Partnerships program. Indeed, that was the only odour that was around because it turns out that the company went bust on 11 November 2005. But just one month earlier, they got $433,000 of taxpayers' funds even though they were going bust. You might think that perhaps the National-Liberal Party did not know about this company going bust - you cannot expect them to know every company that exists in their electorate. But the general manager of Coonawarra Gold was Mr Pat Trainor - he is known to those opposite. He was the Liberal Party candidate for the seat of Florey in the state election that was held at that very time. That is the stench that comes out of this program.The opposition are not interested in producing results for regional Australia; they are interested in producing votes in regional Australia. But this is not the only cruel hoax being played on regional Australia because, on the one hand, you have taxpayers' funds going to organisations that do not exist but, on the other hand, you have pledges of taxpayers' money that are never realised. For example, $1 million was approved way back in January 2004 for a program and, four years later, there was no contract, not a single dollar. I have yet another example: the Dalby Wambo Event Centre in the electorate of Maranoa put in an application in May 2005, three years ago, for $2 million. It was approved in March 2006 but there was no contract and no money - just a cruel hoax.Regional Partnerships was a program designed by the National Party to secure votes so that they could run around prior to election campaigns and say, 'Everything is fine; the cheque's in the mail.' But it did not actually get delivered. They do deliver money where nothing exists, but they do not deliver on their commitments. The same opposition today cannot be believed when you hear the comments of the shadow Treasurer and compare them to how they acted in government with their wasteful expenditure and their wasteful pork-barrelling.</DOC>

 - Anyone around the country will tell you that we have a real problem in terms of management of the nation's water resources. Anyone will also tell you that in the 12 months or 14 months which elapsed between when the previous Prime Minister stood at this dispatch box and announced his national plan to take over the Murray-Darling nothing happened. That integrated body for the management of Australia's greatest inland water system did not come to fruition. We had one series of negotiations after another and as a consequence of that by the time we came to the election there was no body. It took this government - in fact, at its second meeting of COAG - to strike a deal with the states to bring about a single authority for the proper national management of this nation's inland water system. This is a reform which stared the nation in the face for the better part of a decade. Of course, at one year to midnight the then government decided they needed to do something about it; they did not bring it off and, after three to four months in office, we actually achieved that outcome.Managing effectively the nation's water resources is going to be difficult but buying back water entitlements is part and parcel of the process of responsible management of the inland water system as well as ensuring that it is on the basis of providing proper compensation for those who wish to sell those entitlements. We believe that this is an essential part of properly dealing with our national water crisis both rural and urban. Secondly, the long-term manner in which you deal with the water crisis for the nation must also embrace a proper response to climate change - another area of long-term systemic neglect on the part of those opposite.Therefore, what I would say to those opposite - the Liberal Party - is: if there was a serious commitment at all on the part of those opposite to deal with the huge challenges of water scarcity in Australia, where did we see the evidence of this in the 12 years in which they were in office? We saw nothing. What we have done within four to five months of taking office is create a national mechanism to preside over the better management of our inland water system, and we intend to get on with the business of doing it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. It was just a few months ago that a ceremony was held in Sydney to mark the 30th anniversary of the bombing of the Hilton Hotel in Sydney, an event often described as the first act of terrorism on Australian soil. Images of that time shocked the nation - the scene of devastation that left three dead and a public in disbelief that it could happen here. Following the bombing, former commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police Sir Robert Mark was engaged to report on Australia's national policing needs, and the result was the formation of the AFP in 1979. There is an often quoted statement from the Mark report:Arrangements for the governance of States which were adequate for trade, public order and the social requirements of the nineteenth century are not appropriate for dealing with serious wrongdoing which transcends State jurisdictions and affects the interest of the Commonwealth as a whole; terrorism, narcotics, and organised crime being perhaps the three most obvious examples ... There is today an undoubted need for one federal agency to coordinate the efforts of all police forces against interstate crime and terrorism.On the AFP's first day of operation, drug liaison officers were attached to Australian embassies in Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, London and Wellington. Officers were also attached to Interpol and Scotland Yard. And, a month later, the AFP's first headquarters opened in Canberra. Australian peacekeeping duties in Cyprus became the sole responsibility of the AFP, marking the beginning of its International Deployment Group, which has now got 385 people deployed in eight countries.Over the past few years, against the backdrop of September 11 and the Bali bombings, the AFP has had to adapt. Like all law enforcement agencies, it has had its share of fierce criticism, but it is fair to say that a lot of the AFP's quite extraordinary work and success has often gone unnoticed and little reported. For instance, after the 2002 Bali bombings, the AFP with Indonesian police coordinated identification of more than 200 victims, and it did the same in 2005 at the time of the tsunami and after the plane crash in Yogyakarta where officers had to identify two of their colleagues. In 2002, there was no model for disaster victim identification. Today, the process developed by the AFP, learnt by trial and error and dedication, is contributing with Interpol to the development of an international benchmark. - I should say that the AFP has also cemented its reputation in Asia through the operation of the Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation, known as JCLEC, which aims to improve counterterrorism capabilities in the region. Since 2005, more than 2,000 participants from 33 countries have been trained at JCLEC in intelligence, forensics and other disciplines.This year is also the 30th anniversary of the AFP's world-class Australian Bomb Data Centre. That bomb centre has provided early advice in the event of very significant overseas incidents, not least when it identified the explosives used in the London Underground bombing - information which informed key agencies in the United Kingdom. -  - I must say that those opposite have spent very little time actually explaining the important role of the AFP to the members of the Australian public. It is my belief that they have been so busy in the past playing the politics of fear that they did not feel it appropriate to describe successful initiatives to deal, for instance, with counterterrorism in South-East Asia, which I will come to.There is no doubt of the importance of the role of the Australian Federal Police in that respect. Just recently I was speaking to Dr Rohan Gunaratna, the very well known head of the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research at the Singapore technological university. And this, Mr Speaker, whatever those opposite might think, will be of great interest to others. He said to me -  -  - I reiterate that Australia's offshore counterterrorism policies and strategies have been spearheaded by the AFP, and if it was not for Australia's assistance to South-East Asian countries, and particularly Indonesia, the threat of terrorism would have increased considerably since the Bali bombings. That is why the government are pleased to be delivering on our election commitment to boost the AFP's numbers by 500 to focus indeed on the AFP's domestic investigations including drug trafficking, organised crime, fraud and money laundering. Five hundred new officers will build on the excellent work being done by those dedicated police professionals.</DOC>

 - I find the conclusion to the question by the Leader of the Opposition interesting indeed. The Leader of the Opposition has made a number of comments about the importance of the budget and the disciplines associated with the budget. On one day he says that there is an inflation problem; on the next day he says that there is no inflation problem. If people were to be confused, one would be reasonable to conclude that there is a fair bit of confusion lying on the part of those opposite. But this is the one that I particularly like in terms of consistency of policy position on the part of those opposite. It goes to the framing of budget -  -  - The question goes to the coordination and coherence of government and budget policy. In January this year we made it very plain what our approach to the fight against inflation was - five points. First, we have got to deliver a substantial budget surplus so that we can draw down public demand so as not to fuel the fires of inflation, because fighting inflation is a critical part of the economic challenge. Second, we said that we would be in the business of investigating necessary measures to increase private savings in the economy, again to draw down overall total demand in the economy, which again fuels overall demand in the economy and then fuels inflation.Third, you then go to the question of the supply side constraints - firstly, on skills policies and, secondly, on infrastructure policy - and act decisively in those areas to boost the supply side measures, because if you fail to do so then you are failing to act on the 20 sets of advice which the previous government received from the Reserve Bank and failed to act on. And through all these measures you need to make sure that you have a coordinated approach to fighting the fight against inflation. That is what we have said since January. We have taken it as the right way through.By contrast, what we have from those opposite is this: an argument which says that there is no - repeat no - inflation crisis, that inflation is a charade, that inflation is a fairytale. I say to those opposite: say that to the mums and dads in Australia tonight who are confronted with the inflationary impact they face, the consequences of which flow through to their mortgages, to their rents, to the prices they have to pay, to childcare costs and the rest. Secondly, they not only say that inflation is a charade; they further advance this argument - this is the economic credibility of those opposite: there is no economic case to reduce government spending. - There is their argument that not only is there no inflation crisis; inflation is a fairytale and a charade! Furthermore - and this is the ultimate underlining of their economic irresponsibility - they say there is no economic case to reduce government spending. That is what the alternative Treasurer of the country said barely a week or so ago. I have not heard any recanting of that yet - that there is no economic case to reduce government spending. This from the Liberal Party - the Liberal Party attacking this federal Labor government, from the left, with a single argument saying: 'You should be spending more on government spending.'I find it remarkable that their third point is this - this is the trifecta of their new economic orthodoxy: we should preserve welfare payments to Australia's wealthiest. That is their orthodoxy: firstly, there is no inflation problem; secondly, there is no case to cut government spending; and, thirdly, we should preserve welfare payments for the wealthiest.But when it comes to consistency, I conclude with this on the question of revenue - and revenue measures were touched on specifically by the Leader of the Opposition himself in question time today - and it goes to the excise on alcopops. Brendan Nelson on 27 April said:The proposed increase in the excise on alcopops is something that will be supported by us ...Brendan Nelson on 1 May said:What we've learnt is that they spin a few things out into the newspaper like the outrageous half a billion dollars tax binge on ready-mixed drinks ...I presume that means you are now opposed to it. What a long time a week constitutes in politics. Supporting the introduction of this tax one week, opposing it the next. And the opposition has the gall to ask the government about consistency of economic policy! The opposition needs to take a long hard look at itself. It is no longer articulating any credible economic policy position in the lead-up to this budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for this question. As a member who represents a resource-rich seat, he understands and appreciates the importance of this United Nations decision. The decision flows from the ratification by the previous Labor government of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea. Giving credit where credit is due, I would also like to compliment my own agency, Geoscience Australia, which, in partnership with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General's Department, pursued an extension of Australia's continental shelf over a period in excess of a decade. For Geoscience Australia this amounted to work at sea over a 10-year period, including two years full-time seismic work. They are to be complimented on the dedicated manner in which they pursued this application on behalf of Australia, the most successful application to date by any nation through the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. It effectively represents an extension of our continental shelf of 2.5 million square kilometres. That is a great achievement, the application being for 2.8 million square kilometres.It is an area that is potentially resource rich for Australia, a potential bonanza for this nation not only in terms of scarce oil and gas reserves but also potentially for biological resources such as micro-organisms that could be used in medicines. The area is effectively five times the size of France, seven times the size of Germany and 10 times the size of New Zealand.It is now our responsibility as a government building Australia's foundations for the 21st century to work with industry to put in place a modern 21st-century incentive regime which enables us to explore these opportunities. That is not going to be easy because we are talking about deep sea drilling - highly risky and extremely expensive. On behalf of the government I simply say that we are going to go forward with this challenge in partnership with the private sector. It is exceptionally important for resource and energy security not only for Australia but also for the region in which we live. Just think about this: why do we need to succeed on this front? Australia will potentially have a $25 billion trade deficit in petroleum products by 2015. So it is our responsibility to work with our agencies to try to secure a new Bass Strait. That is about a proper focus on the exploration industry's attention to new deep sea frontiers.In conclusion, I simply want to say that this is about enhancing our nation's future energy security. It is one of the prime responsibilities of government. Just as we are building the foundations of a sound economic future for Australia in the budget pro-cess this evening, we will also pursue energy security - one of the key concerns of Australia and the global community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I am delighted to confirm for the House that, fortuitously, I was able to recently visit the injured troops in Taran-Kowt. I was fortunate to be in the region, travelling through Dubai on my way home from Gallipoli, where I delivered the dawn service speech and other speeches. I went to Taran-Kowt also, of course, to pay my respects to Lance Corporal Jason Marks, who lost his life only days before.It is true that I visited the wounded troops in the hospital and it is true that I did so twice - for a very, very good reason. I spoke to the injured soldiers once and then received a phone call from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister asked me to extend his best wishes to the injured soldiers. As you would expect, I returned to the hospital and extended, on his behalf, the Prime Minister's best wishes. I am very surprised that the opposition would seek to make political capital from the defence minister's visit to a fallen soldier and to other soldiers severely woun-ded defending our country in the most dangerous of circumstances. Shame on them!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have already said today, we honour a select group of Australians who, 40 years ago, did their duty by our country at a very difficult time in our history. The funding that has been provided to support a range of commemorative activities has come from my department, the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I acknowledge the member for Dunkley, the previous minister, for the work he did in a bipartisan fashion with respect to ensuring that these matters are properly commemorated. A veterans committee, set up under Don Tait and Garry Prendergast, has done what is I think, as those who know Vietnam vets well would know, a difficult job. It has ensured the provision of proper commemoration in a manner for which there has been broad support within the veterans community. I pay tribute to them and their organising committee for the work that they have done.A series of functions have been held. On a public basis we had last night, as was mentioned, a ceremony here in the Great Hall where some 1,400 to 1,500 veterans, their families and next of kin were present, as well as many members of parliament from both sides of the House. Comments were made on behalf of both sides of the House and respects were paid to those who had lost family members in that particular battle. Some 26 young Australians died at that time.Today I was joined by the Prime Minister, the member for Mackellar and the Governor-General, amongst others, at a commemorative ceremony at the Vietnam Forces National Memorial on Anzac Parade. It was a very moving occasion - but a bit more sombre than last night - where, again, respects were paid to the many who were lost so long ago. Tomorrow there will be a function on Mount Pleasant at the Artillery Memorial for the 102nd Field Battery where the title of 'Coral' will be bestowed by the Governor-General. It is a specific honour title and is the first time it has happened to an Australian battery. It acknowledges publicly and clearly the very serious role that they played with respect to the battle of south Coral. We then move on to Townsville later this week, where there will be a dawn service and further com-memorative activities on the weekend and an opportunity for even more of those who were involved to get together with their mates and share some memories about what occurred 40 years ago.Spending some time last night talking to the families of those who lost loved ones so long ago was a particularly moving experience. It was a difficult time for those who lost, in some cases, their sons, brothers or hus-bands. The good thing about last night was the overwhelming sense that this was a commemoration which needed to occur and an opportunity for many people to have some closure. There were beers last night, there were tears last night and there was an opportunity for many to catch up with people they had not seen for a long time. As other people have said, we need to remember at this time the courage and sacrifice of those who fought on our behalf so long ago. As well, we remember today what our forces are doing overseas, which was also part of what was said earlier today in question time. - I thank the member for Dunkley. There is no doubt that the work of the Department of Veterans' Affairs has been an important part of ensuring this has worked well. I would particularly like to mention Brigadier Bill Rolfe, the Repatriation Commissioner, who, from the military side, has played a very important role in getting this together. He should be congratulated for his work.I would urge all members to remember on this occasion the sacrifice of those so long ago. Remember their families. Remember their mates. What happened 40 years ago is an important part of our military history. It is something we should honour our veterans for, as we honour them on all other occasions.Honourable members - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I want to say a couple of things at the outset. Every single member of this House is horrified by the revelations in the Mullighan inquiry. Unfortunately, they are not new revelations. They are revelations that have been known to many people for a long time. They are revelations that, unfortunately, are being replicated in other parts of Australia. We are all very well aware of what is happening in the Northern Territory, the Kimberley and Cape York, to name just a few places where we have shocking levels of child abuse. The new Australian government have taken the view that we should provide some leadership and develop a national child protection framework, which we are doing. We intend to release a discussion paper on this issue very shortly. I look forward to contributions from all members of the House on the whole question of what the national government -  -  - These are very serious issues and very difficult issues to resolve. I hope and expect that all of us can work together to address what is a critical issue for everyone: protecting children. Last week, when the Mullighan inquiry report was tabled by the Premier of South Australia in the South Australian parliament, this government here in Canberra responded immediately by committing an additional $19 million for both additional police facilities and homes for additional police officers and child protection officers so they can finally be located on the APY lands. We are also putting additional money - $2.8 million, in fact - into additional places at boarding colleges in Adelaide so that children from the APY lands can come to Adelaide to continue their education. There is additional money for mental health services.I have asked the South Australian government to move swiftly so that we can proceed to build the $25 million worth of housing that is urgently needed on the APY lands. The South Australian government has created a taskforce to respond as quickly as possible to the Mullighan committee of inquiry recommendations. They have already had their first meeting. Just today I asked that a senior member of my department join that taskforce. I have asked the South Australian government and the minister to respond as quickly as possible to every one of the recommendations in the Mullighan inquiry report.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He knows the significance of improved trade opportunities for his state and his electorate. Let me deal with the second part of the question first: why is it important? It is important to improve trading opportunities because world trade grows at three times the rate of world output. The message is pretty clear from that. If countries want to secure their economic future, they not only have to engage with trade but have to do what they can to liberalise and open more markets so that that trade opportunity can happen.It is also the fact that after each successful round in the multilateral trade forums there has been an important boost to trade opportunities. That is why getting another boost is important in the current context in closing out the Doha Round. It is also important in the current economic circumstances because in times of global economic uncertainty it is important to inject an amount of certainty. It is also significant that a conclusion to the Doha Round can be a key component in solving the high food price problem that many countries are facing.As to the likelihood of an outcome, that has been significantly improved because of the more active engagement in the multilateral round by the Rudd government. This is something that should not be underestimated. We have recalibrated the focus of trade policy to put primacy of focus on the Doha Round and not have the predominance of the focus on the bilateral agreements - the free trade agreements. We have engaged a new level of activism, not only in Geneva but through the Cairns Group, through the regional architectures and through bilateral arrangements. It is true to say that, since the political will injected in Davos in January of this year, there are now new frameworks to conclude this round in - a framework that has laid out the basis for dealing with sensitive products and domestic support, a framework for goods and a framework for services. We still do not have the framework for dealing with special products from developing countries. This is something that we are actively engaged in at the moment.The truth is that we are closer now than we have ever been to getting an outcome in the Doha Round. Problems do remain but, in a funny way, the problems exist because we are making this sort of progress. I only make the point because this is a huge opportunity for this country. But it is a vital opportunity for global prosperity. This government will leave no stone unturned in trying to find and secure an outcome to the Doha Round.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. This budget begins an era of responsible economic management in Australia. The reason is that we have generated in this budget a surplus which is the second highest in a decade. It is also a significant budget in Australia's recent economic history in terms of the surplus rendered. The reason that we delivered this sort of economic outcome was that we needed to take on the fight against inflation. That meant ensuring that when it came to our handling of government outlays we did not perpetuate the spendathon of those opposite. As we have seen in recent years, government expenditure has mounted and mounted. Instead, we had to send that back in reverse direction. Now we have landed at a point where government expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product is lower than anything delivered by those opposite in their entire period in government.Turning to the tax side, tax as a proportion of GDP has gone down as a consequence of this budget. That comes on the heels of our predecessors having run a series of tax outcomes for the Commonwealth which imposed larger and larger taxation burdens not just on families but also on businesses. All these measures were necessary to place downward pressure on inflation. When it comes to the alternative put by those opposite, their alternative as articulated by the shadow Treasurer is this: there is no economic case to cut government spending. That is the core characteristic of the economic strategy offered by those opposite. It is a recipe for economic disaster, because those who bear the inflationary burden are working families. We have acted responsibly for them in the fight against inflation and we have delivered at the same time a package of measures to support those working families under financial pressures, a package of which the government is proud.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. Last night, this budget began a new era of investment in the future, something that every member on this side of the House can be proud of. It is a budget that delivers for working families and invests in the future. It is a budget in which there is some real spending restraint for the first time in a very long time. Every single dollar of new spending was more than matched by savings elsewhere in last night's budget. We have begun a new era of responsible spending after 11 years of recklessness from those opposite, and particularly from the former Treasurer, who went on a spending spree in the run-up to previous elections, which put upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates. That is why this government has tackled the inflationary challenge.It is also why we have decided to make the investments in the future that we announced. We have announced three multibillion-dollar funds to invest in the future. The first one is the $20 billion Building Australia Fund. It has the strong support of everybody from this side of the House - after decades of neglect from those opposite. We have announced the $11 billion Education Investment Fund, which will pay for ongoing improvements in our TAFEs and universities as part of the education revolution. That is what we support. Thirdly, the $10 billion Health and Hospitals Fund will pay for better hospitals, better health care generally and important medical research. That is what this side of the House supports.What does the other side of the House stand for in the middle of all of this? The Liberal Party has lost its way on the economy. What they are is the party of welfare for millionaires. They are the high-inflation party. They are the same old Liberals who neglect hospitals and neglect the education system. We on this side of the House are the only ones who are fair dinkum about fighting inflation and investing in the future. That is what last night's budget proves.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As we have seen the unfolding of the global financial crisis and its impact across North America, across Eastern Europe and across the East-Asian hemisphere, the impact on growth across the world has been drawn down. As a consequence, that has impacted also on Australia. Secondly, if we are looking at impact on growth, one of the things which does have an impact on economic growth is 12 successive interest rate rises. What we have had as a consequence of economic mismanagement on the part of those opposite and their failure to address the supply side challenges in the Australian economy is the Reserve Bank acting time and time again. Ultimately, that has an impact on domestic activity; hence the projections for growth and employment that you see in the budget papers. On the question of tax, we have delivered an outcome which represents a decrease in tax as a proportion of gross domestic product, in contrast to what we inherited from those opposite. It is a record of which we are proud. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame.</DOC>

 - Australia has begun, through this budget, a new era of responsible economic management, because we have delivered a big surplus of $21 billion plus. It is a budget surplus which is the second highest in 35 years. It is a budget surplus of which this government is proud. Furthermore, we have done so by bringing down government outlays. We have generated one per cent growth in government outlays in contrast to the 4.5 per cent real increase in outlays inherited from our predecessors. And, before they talk about what they were planning to do in the future, look at what they projected for the year ahead, 2008-09, in terms of their own outlays when they were last in government - an increase in outlays of nearly three per cent. Even against that measure we represent one-third of what those opposite were proposing to spend. This is not just a comparison in reflection; it is a comparison in anticipation of the clear plans outlined by those opposite.So in terms of delivering a responsible outcome on outlays we have delivered an outcome with expenditure as a proportion of GDP being the lowest since 1989-90 - lower than any of the budget outcomes delivered by those opposite. On top of that we are reducing the overall taxation burden as a proportion of gross domestic product, which is consistent with our pre-election promises, and we do so having inherited economic circumstances whereby those opposite delivered to this nation the highest inflation rate in 16 years.Therefore, within that framework, the government has brought forward an economic strategy which does three things. Firstly, it fights against inflation by delivering a responsible economic outcome with a significant budget surplus. Secondly, it does not accept the proposition advanced by those opposite that working families have never been better off - that was their boast and they never contested it. We believe that working families are under pressure. That is why the centrepiece of our budget strategy is a $55 billion support package for working families, of which we are proud.On top of that, as the Treasurer has just outlined, we have brought down a nation-building budget for the 21st century. We have brought down three investment funds for the future totalling $40 billion. We have brought forward the $20 billion Building Australia Fund, the $10 billion Health and Hospitals Fund and the $11 billion Education Investment Fund. We have done this because these have been areas of systematic neglect on the part of those opposite who year after year have taken budget surpluses and squandered them through unprofitable consumption.We in contrast have a different economic strategy, which is to invest in the future. If you take infrastructure alone, CEDA reports that, as a result of underinvestment, the backlog in infrastructure investment for water, energy and land transport is alone around $25 billion. That is costing around 0.8 per cent of GDP a year in lost production - that is $8 billion a year. That is a stunning statistic given that those opposite had 12 long years to act on that underinvestment.Well, we have decided to act. We have established the Building Australia Fund and we therefore will be acting on these key areas of challenge - challenges that the Reserve Bank of Australia presented those opposite with multiple warnings on during their period in government: skills constraints and infrastructure bottlenecks.Look at the specific projects that we will investigate, with the states, in the 12 months from here, before the funds flow from the Building Australia Fund, from 1 July 2009: the western metro rail link and the eastern section of the M5 in New South Wales; components of the east-west transport corridor and the Western Ring Road in Victoria; key sections of the Bruce Highway and the Gateway Motorway in Queensland; a transport master plan for Perth airport; a transport sustainability study for Adelaide; and other projects as well. -  - I hear interjections from opposite about these being state responsibilities. If you look at the cost of any one of those major projects for metro Australia, whether we are talking about Sydney or Melbourne or other transport projects for elsewhere across Australia's capital cities, these are megaprojects. The response of those opposite is to say: 'Not our problem. Buck pass to the states - blame the states. Not our job.' Our response is: let's be part of the national solution, not just be part of a carping national problem, which those opposite seem to specialise in.We are proud of our investment plans for the nation's future. The money invested in these funds for the future - $40 billion - is not our money; it is not the Liberal Party's money; it is taxpayers' money. What we have decided to do through this budget is invest their money back into the priorities which they themselves identified: transport infrastructure, ports, roads, broadband, as well as the needs in our TAFE system, our university system and our health and hospital system.We believe this is the right way forward. It will take time to do, but we are determined to embark upon this course of nation building for Australia's future and we are proud of this plan; it is core to the government's budget strategy.</DOC>

 - I will be pleased to answer that question because I think the member for Wentworth is playing with the figures as usual. - And the numbers of course - he knows the numbers. The ones in the party room, they are the ones he knows.Spending in this budget as a share of GDP is the lowest for any budget since 1989-90 - lower than any year of the Howard government. And so is the tax to GDP ratio. I do not expect those opposite to take my word for it but I tell you what I think they should take the word of. They should take the word of Goldman Sachs and their budget review today. This is what they had to say:After 2 years of notable conflict, finally we have fiscal policy that is pushing in the same direction as monetary policy.That is what Goldman Sachs had to say today in their economic monitor. This is what they also had to say:A clear picture of the restrictive nature of the budget emerges from the expenditure estimates which suggests that the reduction in new policy decisions is equal to the coalition's first and only attempt at fiscal restraint.End of story.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for that question. This side of the House does not believe that the wealthiest Australians need welfare from the government. Paying transfer payments to millionaires is simply impossible to defend. We believe we need to put transfer payments onto a more sustainable footing to help us with the fight against inflation. That is why we took the tough decisions in last night's budget to means test family tax benefit part B and the baby bonus. That is a decision we made; it is a decision we stand by. Unfortunately, those on the other side of the House do not appear to have any idea about where they stand on this issue.The Leader of the Opposition was interviewed this morning. He was asked on ABC TV, 'Is that reasonable - $150,000?' Dr Nelson said, 'Of course we, well - just have a look at this.' Chris Uhlmann asked Dr Nelson, 'You have not got an opinion on that?' Dr Nelson said, 'Well, let's just have a look at the fine print.' That is really decisive, isn't it? Of course, we have the shadow Treasurer. Last week, he said there was no case for spending cuts; this week, there is a real case for spending cuts and he wants more. They do not know whether they are Arthur or Martha. The Liberal Party have lost their way.</DOC>

 - It is a bit rich getting that question from the Liberal Party. They are the best friend inflation ever had. A 16-year high - that was the legacy to this country. It has fallen to the Labor Party in government, the Rudd government, to take the decisive action that is needed in cutting spending: $7 billion worth of spending cuts, $7 billion worth of savings in the 2008-09 year and $34 billion over the forward estimates. That is our contribution to the fight against inflation. Those opposite do not have a policy to tackle inflation at all. Before this week and before the budget, the Treasury spokesman said there was no need for spending cuts. Today he is out there saying there is a need for substantial cuts. He does not know what he is doing. - The whole budget is tackling inflation. The forecasts are there.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Of course, I do wait every day to be asked a question by the shadow minister for education, but it never happens. The Marcel Marceau of Australian politics, he still cannot quite work his way out of that imaginary glass box. But one of these days we might see him actually spring out to the dispatch box and ask a question.The member for Hasluck has asked an important question about the future of this nation and what was delivered for productivity in last night's budget delivered by the Treasurer. Productivity is a concept that the Liberal Party has never understood. It never understood that you needed a fair and balanced workplace relations system to deliver productivity and it never understood that you need a world-class education system now so that we can have productivity, participation and prosperity in the future. Our government, the Rudd Labor government, is committed to delivering a new era for our education system: the education revolution that we promised the Australian people. An important thing to recognise in this budget is this is a government that delivered what it promised at the last election. Across the suite of education - from the education of our smallest children in preschool through to our university system, through schools, through vocational education and training - this is a government that is delivering on its commitments. That was a foreign concept to the former government, which, of course, invented the terminology 'non-core promise'.This is a government that takes its promises seriously and is delivering them through this budget. I do not have the time to take you through every education measure in this budget but it is important to recognise that the earliest education of our youngest children - where the world research undoubtedly says that if you can invest in the education of children between the ages of zero and five it is the most prudent sort of investment - is an area where Australia, courtesy of the Howard government, radically underperforms by world standards. In this area, in this budget, the government has committed $2.4 billion to early childhood education and care initiatives, including our commitment to universal preschool for all children in the year before schooling.And, of course, this budget delivers on the substantial investments we want to make in schools: on our digital education revolution, our trades training package, national curriculum, Asian languages - and the list goes on. This is a budget that invests in the future of Australian schooling. It is a budget that assists families, through the education tax rebate, to enable families to have some assistance to afford that expenditure that they want to make to facilitate their child's education. So whether it is with broadband at home or a textbook at home, there is relief for working families with the education tax rebate. Then, in vocational education and training, this is a budget that delivers on the government's promise to address the skills crisis left to it by the inaction and neglect of the former government. It is a skills crisis entirely of its making, on the watch of the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, because they did not invest in skills.This budget delivers on the government's promises to bring on 450,000 new training places within the next four years to enable that investment in skills and to make sure that people have the skills they need to be in work and be able to progress in work. We are investing in the skills and future of the Australian community. And, in universities, we have not only delivered on our promises; we have delivered more. We have delivered on our promises to phase out full-fee-paying places. We have delivered on our promises about scholarships and the like. I understand the opposition think education is boring. They manifested that in government through their neglect and lack of investment. I know they think it is boring. They do not care about education, and that is why their shadow minister never speaks.Apart from that, we are a government that has not only delivered our promises to universities but delivered more - including a $500 million investment this year in our universities. I am sure the member for Hasluck would be interested to know about the $50 million which will be delivered to Western Australian universities before 30 June this year. I am sure the member for Rockhampton will be interested to know about the $5.5 million to be delivered to Central Queensland University. I am sure that the member for Kingston will be interested to know about the $8.9 million being delivered to Flinders University. I am sure the Tasmanian members of this parliament will be interested to know about the $11.5 million being delivered to the University of Tasmania. And I have no doubt that the member for Lindsay will be interested in the $15.9 million being delivered to the University of Western Sydney - a down payment on making up for the decade of neglect of our university system by the Howard government.We have also made special provision for educational investments in the future - an $11 billion fund to bring renewal to our higher education institutions and vocational education and training institutions. For the first time ever, this money will be delivered in accordance with a strategic plan. This is a government that believes in the future of universities and charting their course for the next decade, and in the future of our vocational education and training system, and charting its course for the next decade. This stands as a stark contrast to the former government, which used to abuse university academics, micromanage their affairs and impose extreme industrial relations on them. It is a stark contrast to their failure to invest in vocational education and training, which has created today's skills crisis, putting upwards pressure on inflation and interest rates. This is a budget that lays the foundation stones for the government's education revolution. It is part of ensuring we have a world-class education system - something valued by every member on this side of the House, and something dismissed as irrelevant by every member on that side of the House.</DOC>

 - Seniors and carers are doing it tough in Australia, and that is why the government has sought to provide some assistance through this budget package. We are committing $5.2 billion in additional funding for seniors in this budget. That is 3Â½ times the amount pledged by the previous government in the 2007-08 budget. The implementation of Labor's election commitments in this budget will provide age pensioners and seniors with an additional $900. To put this in perspective, the average gains of age pensioners over the last six coalition budgets was around $327 and, for seniors, $400. Today we introduced into the parliament a bill to pay age pensioners and seniors a $500 bonus; 2.7 million Australians will benefit from this measure. This bonus will be paid from the end of the current financial year, 30 June 2008.These bonuses come on top of an increase in the utility allowance from $107.20 per year to $500 per year, and this is locked in. We have already paid out the first quarterly instalment to age pensioners and seniors in March, and we are working to deliver our commitment to index pensions by the highest of the living cost index for age pensioner households, consumer price index or male total average weekly earnings. These important financial measures come on top of an extension to the telephone allowance, new dental funding for concession card holders and petrol vouchers for volunteers who use their own transport. - I also note that these measures that are contained in the budget for seniors and other related measures for carers, from our point of view, represent barely a start. Seniors and carers have real challenges in terms of cost of living pressures. We recognise that. That is one reason why the question of future financial support by the Commonwealth for seniors and carers will form part of the overall commission of inquiry conducted by the Secretary of the Treasury which looks at the totality of tax, welfare and retirement incomes policy. On top of that, could I just remind those opposite that in every budget where the previous government indicated that it would make a one-off payment at the conclusion of that financial year it made no forward provision for that bonus in the out years, and they know it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. I am sure that everybody on this side of the House will be very interested to hear of the investments that the Rudd Labor government is making in shaping a health system for the future. It is interesting that the members opposite do not want to hear about investments that are being made across the health sector - across the public and private sectors - because when they were in government they neglected the public health sector. The previous government did not accept that in a modern Australia the modern health system that we need needs a strong public and a strong private health system. That is what our budget has delivered, and after 11 years of neglect by the previous government we have started the important work of rebuilding the health system.We are investing $3.2 billion in a range of health programs which I will take you through, but that $3.2 billion will bring health expenditure next year, for the first time ever, to over the $50 billion in one year threshold. It is something that we are very proud of. When we add the $10 billion Health and Hospitals Fund announced last night by the Treasurer - the single biggest investment in health infrastructure ever made by a Commonwealth government in the history of the country - we are very proud that we are spending and investing in our future and in the health needs of the country. This fund is going to support the future health infrastructure priorities which will include health and hospitals facilities and equipment, medical technology and equipment, and major medical research facilities and equipment, including projects and facilities which will support links between hospital based clinical research and high-quality clinical practice. In short, this is a major step towards building a modern health system for the future.What I think is also important to announce today - and I am sure that, even if the members opposite are not interested, the members on this side will be - is that, despite the very difficult circumstances in which the Treasurer framed this budget, I am very proud to announce that for the first time ever a Commonwealth government, the Rudd Labor government, will be providing funding for insulin pumps for type 1 diabetes in children. For the first time ever, up to $2,500 -  - The shadow minister just comes right in after 11 years of doing nothing. All that the previous government can say is that they promised it. They never delivered it. All they did was promise it. - It might not have been a point of order, but it was right. We are delivering when you did not. That is the difference. You had 11 years, and we are delivering in our first budget up to $2,500 for children who have type 1 diabetes. This is an important initiative. I would be very surprised if the member for Flinders does not think it is a good idea to support children with type 1 diabetes but, if he does not, that is fine. He will probably stand alone as the one person in this House who does not think that this is a good idea. - Other measures that are very important in the health area include an extra $1 billion -  - I withdraw. I am pleased that the member for Flinders and other members on the other side of the House support our initiative to fund insulin pumps for people with type 1 diabetes.What I am sure that many members in this House will also be relieved to know is that an extra $1 billion is flowing to our state hospitals, our public hospital system, an area neglected year after year after year by the previous government. We add to that $600 million for elective surgery, $780 million for dental care, $275 million for GP superclinics in local communities and, as I said, bring to an absolute historic high Commonwealth funding for health and ageing, topping $50 billion for the first time in the coming financial year - something we are very proud of.</DOC>

 - I do welcome that question because it is a partial reading of the transcript, which is what you always get from the Leader of the Opposition. What I said was that the exceptional circumstances were continuing - that is what I said. Interest rate relief is part of exceptional circumstances. And I said I would get further detail - a perfectly reasonable and responsible thing to do. - If the Leader of the Opposition wants to talk about transcripts, let's have a look at the transcript that he issued last night at 9.30 pm - a transcript which was actually doctored from earlier in the day. - At 9 pm last night the Leader of the Opposition issued a statement -  - The Leader of the Opposition, in the doorstop transcript issued at 9 pm last night, said this: 'Our economic analysis is that one quarter of one per cent will be' - The member for Mayo then left the chamber. - At 9 pm last night the Leader of the Opposition issued a transcript which said: 'Our economic analysis is that one quarter of one per cent will be added to the consumer price index.' Then at 9.30 pm he issued a revised transcript which said: 'Our economic analysis is that 0.4 per cent will be added to the consumer price index' - a doctored transcript from the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for that question. The creation of the Building Australia Fund announced last night, together with the establishment of Infrastructure Australia, once again reaffirms that it is Labor that is the nation-building party for this country. It is an unprecedented overhaul of the way that we think about infrastructure coordination for the nation. The Commonwealth government is back - we are back - in the business of nation building. We are setting about repairing years of neglect by those opposite. We all know that capacity constraints at our ports, on our roads and in our rail lines all add to inflationary pressures in the economy. Congested roads and rail lines add to the cost of moving freight from the farm gate to the kitchen table and from the mines to the ports. It adds to the cost of doing business.That is why the business community, including the Business Council of Australia, ACCI even and other organisations such as Engineers Australia, have all applauded the Building Australia Fund, just as they all supported the creation of Infrastructure Australia - because they know that the previous government did not invest for the future, did not build for the future and did not plan for the future. The only thing they had a plan for was the next election. Of course, the infrastructure failure of those opposite does not have just an economic cost; there is a social cost. Urban congestion means that many working families spend more time in their cars commuting to and from work than they spend at home with their kids.Last night, the Rudd government proudly began the long process of reversing 12 years of neglect. By establishing Infrastructure Australia, we established the way forward. Yesterday we provided the means to back up that commitment. The $20 billion Building Australia Fund will secure investment in Australia's infrastructure. It will enable the Commonwealth to attack infrastructure bottlenecks in regional Australia that are restricting our export potential. It is also a loud announcement that the Commonwealth is back in the business of our cities and that we will engage in infrastructure in our cities, including public transport. It comes on top of the establishment two weeks ago, as we announced, of the Major Cities Unit, which will work with Infrastructure Australia.But we are not sitting back waiting for the $20 billion to come online. We are investing $75 million, as announced last night, to do the planning now on important projects for Australia's future. As part of our commitment to end the blame game, the states will kick in a further $57Â½ million dollars, bringing the total to $132.5 million. In Melbourne, we will look at improving the east-west road and rail connections through the recommendations of the Eddington report, and we are looking at advancing planning for the Western Ring Road. In Brisbane, we are planning the Gateway Motorway missing links. In north and Far North Queensland, we are planning for the $2.2 billion that we have committed to fix up the Bruce Highway - improvements in Cairns, Townsville, Mackay and Gladstone. In Sydney, we are looking at the western metro line, a visionary urban public transport plan that would not have been touched by those opposite. There is the M5 duplication, which will assist in getting trucks to the port and off our urban roads. In Adelaide, there is a transport sustainability study. In Perth, we are looking at the airport transport master plan, including a rail link.Doing this work now means that we will be ready to go when the $20 billion fund comes online. This comes on top of the government's commitment to invest $25.8 billion between now and 2013-14 under AusLink. It was also added to in the budget last night by bringing forward $560 million in funding to get early starts on our election commitments: the Ballina bypass, the new Perth to Bunbury Highway, the Northern Expressway in Adelaide and the Townsville port access road. We are getting on with the job.But those opposite continue to criticise this plan for infrastructure, and maybe there is a hint as to why they do that in the Leader of the Opposition's comments on ABC radio in Queensland last month. Those comments highlight a big difference between the Labor approach and the approach of the Liberal and National parties, because this is what the Leader of the Opposition said:In terms of infrastructure the Federal Government is primarily responsible for airport infrastructure. That's it.That is their approach to nation building and infrastructure. The Rudd government will end the neglect that occurred under those opposite over 12 years. It is no wonder that the business community has been unanimous in its support for the plan announced by the Treasurer in last night's budget.

 - Here we have the once great National Party deserting the people of rural and regional Australia yet again - because, if you travel through rural and regional Australia, what is lacking most? Effective infrastructure. And where does the lack of infrastructure start? It lies in the absolute lack of effective broadband services right across rural and regional Australia. For 12 long years, those opposite had an opportunity to address that constituency's need for broadband services, and they did practically absolutely nothing. All we had was one fund after another, with nothing really happening. As a consequence, there are second-rate, third-rate or fourth-rate services out there for rural and regional Australia, and they are unacceptable.If you go to rural and regional Australia, you find the other thing that those there legitimately object to is the state of many of the roads. When you look at major roads for which there is a particular responsibility here, including the Bruce Highway, the response that we get from people in rural and regional Australia is, 'Where is an effective long-term plan for dealing with these critical infrastructure and road transport needs?' It is for these reasons that this government has decided: 'Enough of the buck-passing; enough of the blame game. Let us get on with the business of building the nation.' That is why we have established a Building Australia Fund, as the minister for infrastructure was just outlining in response to the previous question. We believe the national government has a responsibility to lead.When I look at those opposite, particularly those representing that once great National Party - the party of Jack McEwen, the party of Doug Anthony and now the failed rump that it has become - it is time they stood up for the requirements -  - Stop laughing, Alby. It is time they stood up for the interests of rural and regional Australia. That begins with infrastructure. Our fund delivers on that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. The budget last night delivered in full on the Prime Minister's January commitments to macroeconomic management. It delivered a surplus of 1.8 per cent of GDP - $21.7 billion - over 1.5 per cent of which was not reliant upon a minor revenue surge; $3.8 billion in spending cuts, on top of the $1.6 billion in spending cuts that were projected prior to the election during the campaign; and $1.9 billion in revenue measures, totalling savings of approximately $7.3 billion. Government spending growth has gone from about five per cent in real terms in the financial year that is about to end to one per cent in real terms, a significant contraction of fiscal policy in order to assist the Reserve Bank and to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates.Honourable members may have noticed that Budget Paper No. 2 this year - which, of course, is the statement of all the measures in the budget - is a little bit thicker than it usually is. It is actually quite a bit longer than it usually is. In fact, it is 104 pages longer than last year's Budget Paper No. 2. There is a simple explanation for that, and that is that there are 106 pages of savings measures in the budget in Budget Paper No. 2. The reason why the two figures are almost exactly the same is that there were virtually no savings measures at all in the 2007 budget - and, in fact, in the last four budgets there were virtually no savings measures at all.The government has done the hard yards not done by the previous government. But, inevitably, some commentators say that we should have done more. To be fair, some of those people have been consistent in this message over a number of years. But imagine my surprise last night when, casually watching The 7.30 Report, I saw that they had been joined belatedly by the member for Wentworth, who described this budget as 'a high-taxing, high-spending budget'. As I was watching this I asked myself, 'Is this the same member for Wentworth who, on Meet the Press only 10 days earlier, said that there was no need to cut government spending, that inflation is not a problem and that inflation is merely a fairytale?' Somehow, within the space of 10 days, the member for Wentworth has moved seamlessly and shamelessly from saying, 'Don't do anything,' to saying, 'You haven't done anything.' Somehow or other, he has slipped from one to the other with nothing in between. This, of course, is a great mystery to me. I have racked my brains for an explanation for this blatant contradiction. The only explanation I have been able to come up with is that somehow the member for Wentworth has managed to clone himself and that there are actually two Malcolm Turnbulls out there. He has managed to clone himself - and there is no truth in the rumour that he used his ego as the stem cell either, by the way. - It would appear that, commenting on the budget, out there we have somewhere a soft Malcolm and a hard Malcolm. We have got two Malcolms: one is out there with his leader feeling everybody's pain, protecting the millionaires' baby bonuses and ensuring that every child gets a prize; and then there is hard Malcolm, off with the big end of town, off with his mates, hurrumphing about middle-class welfare, demanding big cuts in spending on poor people and promising big tax breaks for the wealthy. No doubt this comes in useful in his manoeuvrings within the Liberal Party, because soft Malcolm can have dinner with the wets and hard Malcolm can have dinner with the dries both at the same time. - I will conclude with an observation about a specific budget matter that the opposition has commented on and criticised the government on, claiming that we are high taxing, notwithstanding the fact that, of course, all the data shows the contrary. That is that yesterday the opposition managed to put out two different calculations of the implications of tax changes in the budget - two different figures. On the basis of what we have had from the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Wentworth, it is absolutely clear that they cannot even add up. They cannot even add up their own assessments of the tax impact of the budget, because they put out two different figures.The true picture is that government spending for the forthcoming year will be one per cent lower as a proportion of the total economy than it was in 2007-08. It will be the lowest that it has been for nearly 20 years and, importantly, it stays significantly lower - substantially lower - than in the previous financial year across the forward estimates, and broadly the same thing has happened on the tax front as well. There is a substantial reduction in the tax take as a proportion of the overall economy, and that is broadly preserved over the forward estimates.Whichever Malcolm was on The 7.30 Report last night, it is clear he had not read the budget papers, because the Rudd government's budget has delivered a substantially bigger surplus, substantially larger savings and a much tougher fiscal positioning in order to put the budget in the right position to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates and protect the working people of this country.</DOC>

 - Based on my advice, the answer to the honourable member's question is no.

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. This budget is delivering a $55 billion package for working families, implementing our election commitments and investing for the future. Working families know that these are very, very challenging economic times, putting families under very significant financial pressure. Whether it is increasing mortgages, increasing prices or other cost of living pressures, families know that inflation is their No. 1 enemy. That is why this budget is, at its heart, about fighting inflation.By contrast, the opposition really do not seem to have any idea. I certainly cannot figure out what it is that they believe in on these issues. The member for Warringah just a little while ago instructed the government to -  - The opposition does not have any policies, so there would not be any point in asking that. What we certainly know is that the opposition cannot figure out whether they are for or against making cuts in this budget. What the government is about is targeting support -  - Going to the specifics of the benefits that this budget is delivering for working families, first and foremost it is delivering more than $46 billion of tax cuts to working families over the next four years to really help take the financial pressure off family budgets. We are delivering to working families with assistance with child care, which certainly is something that so many working families facing increasing costs of child care will welcome. We are going to increase the childcare tax rebate from the current level of 30 per cent to 50 per cent - so half of working families' out-of-pocket childcare costs will be met as a result of this budget.We are going to double the Commonwealth financial counselling scheme to provide more assistance for those families who get into financial difficulty. The Minister for Health and Ageing has delivered for working families a new teen dental health plan, something that so many working families will benefit from as their children grow older. The education tax rebate is something else that will help working families with the increasing costs of education.The Minister for Housing, of course, has delivered for working families with a $2.2 billion package of housing affordability measures that will help with the very serious pressures that families are facing with the cost of housing. Most importantly from my point of view, for 19,000 carers who are really doing it hard we are delivering almost $300 million to help carers of profoundly disabled children. The eligibility rules for carer payments at the moment are far too restrictive and insensitive, and under this government they will change.Unlike the former government, this government is about making sure that it delivers the support and certainty that families need and making sure that funding is responsibly targeted to those who need it. That is why we are also introducing as key measures in the government's fight against inflation two new income tests, one to family tax benefit part B and the other to the baby bonus, making sure that these benefits go to those families who need it most. What is important is that these measures alone deliver $900 million of savings over the next four years to help in this government's fight against inflation.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to answer that question. The government is doing what we said we would do. We said we would put a Petrol Commissioner into the ACCC to make sure we had a competitive market out there and to make sure that people who were buying petrol were not being ripped off at the bowser. This FuelWatch scheme, which will be coming into operation through the year, will be a very important measure to give consumers access to information so that they can access cheaper prices. I simply cannot understand why the opposition would oppose it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. I know that it is an area that she has been concerned with, being particularly interested in the health of young women in a range of different areas. We believe that binge drinking is a community-wide problem and deserves a community-wide response. We think that young people are particularly at risk and we know that alcopops are used to hook them on drinking when they are young. In fact, research shows that many young people cannot detect the taste of alcohol when it is combined with either sweet mixers or milk, which we know is exactly how these products are used to get young people interested in drinking and hooked for a long time. We are not prepared, as a government, to stand by and just let the increase in alcohol consumption in the community continue.The Rudd government is taking a range of steps to tackle this problem through the implementation of our $53 million National Binge Drinking Strategy. This is going to involve parents, community organisations, sporting clubs and an advertising and education campaign, which we know and hope will make a significant difference in slowing the growth of alcohol consumption amongst young people.We have also, as the House is aware, moved to close the previous tax loophole on ready-to-drink products. This was a loophole that was opened up in 2000 by the previous government. It is a loophole that makes no sense because it treats alcopops differently to other spirits and it has led to an explosion in young women in particular drinking these products. I was initially pleased to hear, when we announced this measure, that the Leader of the Opposition was going to support it. On the first day that the measure was announced, the Leader of the Opposition - we welcomed it; he was out of the blocks - said:The proposed increase in the excise on alcopops is something that will be supported by us _Only days later the Leader of the Opposition changed his mind and called this an outrageous tax binge on ready mixed drinks. Last night, the Leader of the Opposition confirmed, his U-turn obviously complete, that the Liberals will be opposing this measure in the Senate. Even though he knows 20,000 young women under 15 every week are now drinking to risky levels, the Liberal Party want to stand by and not do anything about it. There has been a lot of discussion in the parliament and elsewhere about this measure over recent days. I think there is an important bit of information that this House should have. - The Leader of the Opposition would like some facts. I will give him a fact. Our modelling and the modelling from Treasury show that our measure will reduce consumption by 43 million 375-mil bottles every year. If the Leader of the Opposition thinks that it is not a good thing for us to have 43 million fewer bottles being drunk - mostly by young people - every year, then he should stand up and say that. It means that the Leader of the Opposition, who is actually a former AMA president and who was a well-respected health professional, now stands totally alone, not just in his party but amongst the health community, in not recognising that this is an important health measure. He will stand condemned for that. This is going to have a positive impact on reducing consumption and, of course, with money that is raised from this measure, as we have already made clear, we will be able to contribute to the biggest commitment to prevention that a Commonwealth government has ever made. - If the Leader of the Opposition is no longer interested in reducing consumption by 43 million bottles per year then he should stand up and tell the Australian public.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. On the question of binge drinking, we in the government are responding to the evidence that we have been presented with. If you go to the study Alcohol consumption patterns among Australian 15-17 year olds from 2000 to 2004, a research report commissioned by the Department of Health and Ageing in 2005, it says that between 2000 and 2004 the percentage of female drinkers aged 15 to 17 reported that they had consumed RTDs on their last drinking occasion, an increase from 14 per cent to 62 per cent. That is the first point. The second point is this: in addition, between 1999 and 2005 the proportion of teenage girls aged 12 to 17 who chose RTDs as their preferred drink rose from 23 per cent to 48 per cent. That is in the Australian secondary school students' Â  
 use of alcohol in 2005 report. What is extraordinary about these two pieces of data is that those opposite actually choose not to act on them. We have looked at this data and said that we have a responsibility to act. It is very difficult not to go around Australia today without being confronted by the nation's police commissioners in the various states to be told that binge drinking is a huge problem in inner metro Australia, particularly with girls, and that RTDs are part of the challenge. Therefore, we need to act in this way in order to reduce the growth at which they are consuming.On the question of the overall integrity of budget measures on how these funds are used, the challenge of preventative health care is going to require a large injection of funds on the part of the Commonwealth. Preventative health care under the previous regime represented some 1.7 per cent of the nation's total health budget. If we are serious about dealing with the problems of alcoholism and the problems of other chronic diseases emerging in the community, we are going to have to invest hugely in this area. That is why this government is committed to a significant new partnership with the states and territories to ensure that we have a proper funding and policy response to the emerging health needs of the community. Our overall strategy on the budget is to make sure that we properly invest these funds in the future while at the same time producing responsible economic outcomes for the country.In terms of responsible economic outcomes, I would just say this to the Leader of the Opposition: it is important that those opposite decide where they stand. Within a week the Leader of the Opposition said that he fully supported the extra taxes on RTDs, a measure that we are going to introduce, and then he backflipped completely. This is part of a pattern. The Leader of the Opposition one day says that there is no inflation problem - it is a complete charade - and then we are told, of course, that there is a problem because it is now not sufficiently an anti-inflationary budget. We see the same conflicting position emerging between the Leader of the Opposition and the alternative Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, on the whole question of cuts. Remember that the member for Wentworth says, 'No, we do not think that there is any economic need to cut it,' meaning overall -  - The answer goes to the overall question raised by the Leader of the Opposition about the integrity of budget finance and how it is deployed and it goes to the consistency of the Leader of the Opposition's position on binge drinking, on inflation and on the need for expenditure cuts. Then, of course, we go to this extraordinary debate that we have had in the last 24 hours between the Leader of the Opposition and the alternative Leader of the Opposition on whether the baby bonus should be means-tested. On and on it goes. Should there be a $150,000 means test? We have a question that goes - Whilst I have not used this ruling before in this parliament, it has been understood that both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have been given longer lengths of rope than other members of the House. So this particular occasion probably was not the greatest example to bring into this debate about points of order. In that context and given that this is the question time after a budget, when people are perhaps a little testy, that is where we are really at.With regard to other matters, it would be helpful if answers were shorter. It would be helpful if they were not interrupted as much with points of order that are fairly obvious but are not points of order that I can agree with and rule on. In relation to the way in which relevance has been conducted in this parliament for quite some time and answers, since the election, which I think have been consistent with previous rulings, there has been a slight improvement in the way in which questions have been couched, to make sure that they do not give us an opportunity to have debates when we should not be having debates during question time. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. To recap where we were on the question of alcopops, I ran through before the evidence upon which the government is acting. These are sober reports indeed about the impact of these particular ready-to-mix drinks on young girls. I think all responsible members of this House would wish to act in an appropriate way to deal with this challenge, which families are concerned about right across the country and which the police forces are concerned about right across the country. As the Minister for Health and Ageing said in terms of the impact of the quantitative consumption of alcohol overall in this category, it is a measure worth backing. My concluding point is this: this debate would be much more focused if we had a consistent position on the part of the opposition. As the Leader of the Opposition said on 27 April:The proposed increase in the excise on alcopops is something that will be supported by us _Then he went on to say on 13 May that, 'There are a number of measures,' referring to tax measures, 'that we are now particularly concerned about,' referring to the action which has now been referred to by the minister for health: that they intend to use their numbers in the Senate to obstruct this measure. It is important for the Leader of the Opposition to have a consistent position when it comes to this important public health policy matter, a consistent position on inflation, a consistent position on whether there is an economic case for cuts in government spending and a consistent position on whether in fact we should have a means test at about the $150,000 point. He says there should not be; the member for Wentworth says there should be. It is very difficult to work out these days where the opposition stands on any core question of economic policy or social policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. The government provided an important opportunity for regional Australia where we were able to deliver on the commitments we had made, where we were able to provide a long-term vision and, in particular, where we were able to take on the war against inflation, to which rural communities are particularly sensitive. A centrepiece of the preparation for that future is the program Australia's Farming Future, criticised by the opposition spokesperson for being too focused on climate change, yet welcomed by others. I am pleased to note the following comments with respect to Australia's Farming Future:The $130 million under 'Australia's Farming Future' begins the shift towards the NFF's call to better prepare our agricultural productive base for less water, increased climate variability and the possibility of longer periods of drought.It's about long-term management, preparedness and planning.I am pleased to have seen from both the National Association of Forest Industries and the NFF an endorsement of the policies contained within the budget. A criticism went out with respect to what the budget did in drought relief. The criticism was fairly scathing. It came from the Leader of the Nationals. The only problem with his critique of what was contained in the budget is that his media release criticising it went out on Monday, before the budget, on the basis that:There are extremely strong rumours coming out of the public service that this much-needed assistance is in the firing line in Labor's first Budget.Then the budget papers come out, and what is the system being used? The same as under the previous government. What is the system used to assess whether or not people should remain on exceptional circumstances assistance? The same as under the previous government. Not only that, the decisions and the determinations will be conducted by NRAC, all of whom were appointees by previous National Party ministers, without exception.I heard the scoffing before about whether regional Australia should be concerned about the fight against inflation. May I make clear to the House that, if anyone in the bush is concerned about inflation, it is because they are concerned about fertiliser prices and because they are concerned about fuel prices. You do not end up with debates about interest rate subsidies unless there are concerns about inflation.The thing that concerns me about the scare campaign being run by the Leader of the Nationals is that, if he wins, if he actually persuades people as he goes from regional radio station to regional radio station claiming benefits are being slashed, the best he could achieve is to end up having farmers who are 100 per cent entitled to support not claiming it. That is the sort of irresponsibility that the Leader of the Nationals is willing to go ahead with.It is not only that. While they want to airbrush any memory of inflation, they also want to airbrush transcripts that refer to it. I say to the members opposite: you can airbrush your transcripts but you cannot airbrush away inflation. Yesterday the shadow Treasurer put out a printed press release where he said that the measures will add 0.4 percentage points to the CPI. That was at 8.30 pm. At 9 pm the Leader of the Opposition said in his actual doorstop that, 'Our economic analysis is that one-quarter of one per cent will be added to the consumer price index.' That is what he said - one-quarter. But when the Leader of the Opposition released his actual transcript, the figure of one-quarter was gone. It had disappeared entirely because the transcript had been airbrushed to match the words of the shadow Treasurer. You might be able to airbrush your transcripts but you cannot airbrush the previous government's record on inflation.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. This budget is anchored in economic responsibility. This government believes that the first responsibility of government is to ensure macroeconomic stability. In our current economic environment, that means producing a fiscal policy which delivers effective downward pressure on inflation, which in turn flows onto downward pressure on interest rates. The reason we have had to do that is that we have had 12 successive interest rate rises in a row, and we have had this on the back of not just a lax fiscal policy on the part of those opposite but a failure to act on the other fires which fuel inflation; that is, the supply-side constraints in the economy - namely, a skills shortage and infrastructure bottlenecks. These have been the subject of 20 consecutive warnings by the Reserve Bank of Australia to the previous government which resulted in no action.So what we have done, given the circumstances we have inherited, is to produce a responsible budget with a surplus of $21.7 billion - the biggest surplus in nearly a decade; the second largest surplus as a percentage of GDP in 35 years - to assist in the overall policy settings which are brought to bear on interest rates policy. That is the responsible course of action.The second thing that we have done through this budget is to ensure that, for working families who are under financial pressure - and they are, whether it is through rents, increased mortgage prices or the impact of groceries or fuel - we deliver a series of tax undertakings, a series of measures on childcare tax rebates, a new education tax refund and further measures on housing affordability. When you put them together, these add to a significant additional benefit for many working families across the country. It is the aggregation of these price pressures on working families on which the government has been keen to act.This has been an absolutely essential focus of what the government has sought to do, but there is a third focus in the government's overall strategy, and it is this: we also see, through this budget, an important opportunity for nation building which also dovetails with the important fight against inflation and further upward pressure on interest rates. That means dealing effectively with the long-term challenges we face with the skills shortage and infrastructure bottlenecks. The previous government had 12 years in office to act on these constraints and did nothing. They were warned on 20 separate occasions by the Reserve Bank of Australia to act; otherwise, there would be consequences for the overall inflation equation. They failed to act. This government, by contrast, within its first five months in office has decided to act. We have done so by establishing three investment funds for the future - on infrastructure, on skills and also in the critical area of building a better hospital system.This government is proud of the budget, which is framed in terms of economic responsibility; of assisting working families under pressure who are dealing with cost rises from groceries, fuel and elsewhere; and, importantly, of investing in the future. This stands in stark contrast to the budgets we have inherited from the previous 12 years.</DOC>

 - The important thing about this budget is that we have not only produced a document of responsible economic management but, unapologetically, decided to tip the scales in the direction of working families. This is absolutely critical for those people who are suffering cost of living pressures right across Australia - working families, working Australians, retired Australians - those who are doing it tough at present. The first challenge however is to produce a responsible budget, not one galloping ahead with out-of-control expenditure growth but one which actually puts itself within respectable fiscal parameters.This $21.7 billion surplus is a significant investment in the future but it is being delivered on the basis of hard work - as the finance minister indicated yesterday - $7.3 billion in savings involving $5.3 billion of spending cuts. Where were the spending cuts and savings measures in previous budgets brought forward by those opposite? I do not recall. We see those measures detailed in page after page of the budget papers brought down by the Treasurer the other night and an overall expenditure growth. The fact that we can deliver an outcome for the budget which produces an increase in real expenditure by barely one per cent, against the 4.5 per cent real expenditure increases delivered by the smiling member for Higgins in recent budgets, frankly, I think, stands in stark contrast to the fiscal record that we inherited.On the expenditure side, it is worth emphasising this point: we have produced an outcome on expenditure in this budget whereby expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product now ranks as the lowest that has been produced by any government since 1989-90. That is a significant measure. On the other measure which is relevant to the overall size, effectiveness and efficiency of government - that is, tax as a proportion of GDP - we have reduced tax as a proportion of GDP from 24.7 per cent, which was in the budget we inherited, down to 23.8 per cent. That is a significant advance. The investment funds for the future indicate the way in which we want to build the nation into the 21st century. The money involved in those investment funds is not our money, it is not the Liberal Party's money and it was not Peter Costello's money; it is the Australian people's money.The Australian people want that money invested long term in fixing urban congestion; in dealing with the infrastructure crisis and bottlenecks which are confronting many of our citizens today; in improving the state of our public hospitals; in our universities so the kids studying there do not have to crowd into lecture or tutorial halls; and in the TAFE schools and colleges of this country to ensure they are of a 21st century standard and not that of a different age or era. Most importantly in the measures contained in this budget, we have been about the business of tipping the balance in the direction of working families - $47 billion of tax relief over the next four years is directed to low- and middle-income earners. We have also of course increased the childcare tax rebate from 30 to 50 per cent. - Families across the country are dealing with real challenges, so we make no apology - while those opposite giggle and guffaw about the financial pressures faced by families today - for delivering $47 billion of tax cuts to those families, no apology for ensuring that we deliver an education tax refund of $4.4 billion, no apology for ensuring that we increase the childcare tax rebate by $1.6 billion from 30 per cent to 50 per cent and on top of that deliver a housing affordability package of $2.2 billion. These are practical measures which deliver to the bottom line of working families and we are proud of what we have done in unapologetically tipping the balance in their direction.The contrast between what we have done and what those opposite have done stands in absolute stark contrast. Those opposite have advanced three propositions in the course of this budget debate: (1) that the inflation challenge facing Australia is a charade and a fairytale, (2) they have argued that there is no economic case for cuts in government spending and (3) they refuse to support effective measures concerning welfare reform. We find ourselves in a situation today where the Labor government of Australia is now being attacked from the left by the big-spending Liberal government of the past on these critical measures of economic competence and performance. Furthermore, when it comes to issues of social policy, we now find ourselves being attacked from the libertarian left of the Liberal Party who say that we should not intervene when it comes to binge drinking and the proper treatment of RTDs. I find it remarkable that we have a Liberal Party today which has lost its way, lost its direction and bears no resemblance to the great party of Menzies of the past.</DOC>

 - One of the roll-on consequences of 12 interest rate rises in a row is that they affect, over time, the economic performance of the economy. What we have seen as a consequence of the tightening of monetary policy off the back of lax fiscal policy from those opposite, going back year after year now, are the actions that have been taken by the Reserve Bank of Australia. That government - those opposite - had 12 years to act on the key capacity side constraints of the economy. They failed to do so. They created the environment whereby inflation, when we took over office, was running at a 16-year high. As a consequence of that, monetary policy settings have been adjusted by the Reserve Bank, and the consequence of that is that we have had an impact on real activity in the economy.Can I say to those opposite that after 12 years of absolute neglect we now have them seeking to say that they have no responsibility whatsoever for the economic circumstances which this nation confronts in the year 2008, including the prospective impact on activity and employment. By contrast, what we have put forward is a responsible economic document based on a robust surplus, helping working families under pressure on the way through and, most importantly, investing in the future.But we would all, in this place, be advantaged by one thing - and that is knowing where exactly the Liberal Party now stand. Are they in favour of further tax cuts? Are they in favour of a greater emphasis on government spending? Are they in favour of doing something about inflation? Do they support welfare reform? Do they support means testing? Or do we have to wait for the member for Wentworth to replace the current Leader of the Opposition to find out what the real policies are? Do we have to wait for the member for Higgins to replace the member for Wentworth, to replace the Leader of the Opposition, to know what the real policy settings are? It remains a mystery to the nation.</DOC>

 - I certainly welcome the question, because the Rudd government's first budget is a responsible budget - a responsible budget that builds a strong surplus. And there has been some favourable commentary from sensible analysts. So for the benefit of the House I thought I might run through some of that commentary. From Michael Blythe at the Commonwealth Bank:The Budget ticks all the boxes in terms of the government's medium-term fiscal strategy.He went on:The budget produces a larger surplus than the 1% of GDP projections with which the Coalition was comfortable. The emphasis has shifted from spending to savings. So, the ALP can now claim the mantle of fiscal conservatism.And Mr Williamson from TD Securities said:It looks to be a mildly restrictive budget, living up to the credo that they had of being an inflation-fighting budget ...Rory Robinson from Macquarie Bank said:It is a major restraint relative to the Whitlamesque five per cent growth estimated for this year - the Howard government's final budget year.He pinged them for very big spending! Of course, we have the shadow Treasurer's former employer, Goldman Sachs; this is what they had to say:After two years of notable conflict we finally have fiscal policy that is pushing in the same direction as monetary policy.So I think it is pretty clear that the market thinks Tuesday night's budget was a responsible budget. But what does the opposition have to say about this? The member for Wentworth fancies himself as an economic guru, so what does he have to say? This is what he had to say on budget night -  - On budget night the shadow Treasurer was asked this question by David Speers:If you had been standing at the dispatch box tonight, would you have gone further with deeper spending cuts?Do you know what the shadow Treasurer said? He said:Look, I cannot comment on that.The once great hope of the Liberal Party - but he could not comment on that, on budget night. The great white hope of the Liberal Party had nothing to say - no alternative framework, no suggestions for savings, no suggestions for fiscal policy whatsoever.He was also asked on 14 May this question by Mr Neil Mitchell:Is this your last budget as shadow Treasurer?Mr Turnbull:Well, we'll see.Yes, we will see! We will see whether the Liberal Party has an alternative economic framework tonight, because what is apparent from what they have had to say is that they are the party of high spending, high taxation and high inflation.Leave not granted. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have not seen the article in question but I accept the honourable member's rendition of it. The first thing to be said about the tax cuts introduced by the Australian government is that they flow to all families: $46.7 billion worth of tax cuts. Then if you go to the range of benefits that flow to people who, for example, may be eligible for family tax benefit A, you have got another 1.7 million Australian families. They of course benefit from family tax benefit A. They also benefit from the education tax refund. They also benefit from new entitlements which flow in the case of dental services to children - teenagers obtaining new dental services. But you see, Mr Speaker, overall what we believe is that in helping working families we must make sure that the economy is in first-rate working order. That means fighting the fight against inflation and making sure that you are not contributing to the lax fiscal policy which we inherited from our predecessors, and, secondly, bringing in tax cuts which flow to all Australian families. That is an important measure, including for all those families who may not be the beneficiaries of the particular measures which are contained in the income support measures brought in by the government.This is a very difficult question in terms of $150,000 and obviously it is a very difficult question for those opposite. The member for Wentworth says it is a fair benchmark for means testing but the Leader of the Opposition says it is not. I would like to know where the Liberal Party stands on this.Leave not granted.The member for Herbert then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The Rudd Labor government has stamped our credentials this week with Tuesday night's budget as Australia's nation-building party. We have established this fund to provide critical economic infrastructure in road, in rail, in ports and in broadband. Australian businesses have been crying out for years for national coordination on infrastructure to free up bottlenecks and assist in passenger and freight movements. After last year's budget the Business Council of Australia said this:The key issue still appears to be the lack of long-term integrated planning to drive investment to address ongoing bottlenecks.After 12 years they received nothing from those opposite - no action. But I am pleased to advise the House that those days are over. Indeed, the feedback from the community, and in particular from the business sector, has been extraordinarily positive. People who care about Australia's future are relieved to finally have a government prepared to take action on infrastructure and therefore place downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates.The Business Council of Australia last year made the comment I mentioned. This year they said that the establishment of the Building Australia Fund is 'an effective way of ensuring that today's strong revenue growth can be better directed to meet the nation's long-term infrastructure needs'.Mark Birrell of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, a former minister in the Kennett government, said that the creation of the $20 billion Building Australia Fund is 'a landmark investment in national infrastructure and an unprecedented down-payment on the priority projects that can sustain economic and job growth'.Peter Verwer from the Property Council of Australia said:The government's $20 billion investment in critical infrastructure confirms its commitment to nation-building.Michael Pearson from the Minerals Council said:The budget signals a critical shift to a focus on building new supply capacity in the Australian economy. The importance of this shift cannot be underestimated.Chris Brown from TTF said:This is a major step forward, signalling a brave new world of federal government engagement in our major cities.Tony Shepherd of Transfield said:The $20 billion injection into the Building Australia Fund is a great development for the country.Finally, at the federal level we have recognition of the government's obligations in terms of the investment and development of infrastructure. I have from those opposite talk of criticism, that this is a slush fund. What else would they say? There is criticism from these people, including from the National Party. This is what the National Farmers Federation had to say - this is what David Crombie had to say:Tonight's announcement of the $20 billion Building Australia Fund is a positive move towards addressing critical transport and communications infrastructure.There were many other business leaders, including Paul Bell from the Australian Local Government Association and Stephen Holmes from the Urban Development Institute of Australia. Ivan Backman from the Australian Logistics Council said:$20 billion for infrastructure announced in tonight's budget is a substantial commitment to building the road and rail networks and ports required for our national future and will be embraced by our transport and logistics industry.Indeed, the only people in the nation who have not embraced the Building Australia Fund are those opposite. Those people who did nothing for 12 years to address critical infrastructure are now criticising a government that has had the courage and the foresight to plan for our future. They are so out of touch with their own base that they have walked away from them and are completely isolated from the business community, from farming organisations and from regional Australia, who have all endorsed very strongly the Building Australia Fund as a critical centrepiece, along with the education and health infrastructure funds - Labor's forward-thinking budget which will secure our future prosperity.</DOC>

 - Which makes it more remarkable that the Leader of the Opposition said that he would support this tax measure when it was first announced. But try to find where the Liberal Party stands on any tax measure or any policy measure at the moment; what the three-ringed circus - which equals the leadership of the Liberal Party today - the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth and the member for Higgins - currently represents on the question of this measure. We have responded to the reports which we have been presented. From the Australian secondary students' use of alcohol: the proportion of teenage girls aged between 12 and 17 who chose RTDs as their preferred drink rose from 23 per cent to 48 per cent; secondly, between 2000 and 2004, the percentage of female drinkers aged 15 to 17 reporting that they had consumed RTDs at their last drinking occasion increased from 14 per cent to 62 per cent. And, according to a 2007 survey, approximately 20,000 girls aged 12 to 15 reported that they drink daily or weekly. The key challenge here is what government can do about this.Of course, what is interesting about the figures I have just referred to is they all postdate an important event in the year 2000. What happened in the year 2000? With the introduction of the GST, a certain party in government decided of its own volition, in response to lobbying - we do not know - that this particular group of drinks, RTDs, would in effect have preferential tax treatment. As a consequence of that, we have seen a complete explosion in the use of these RTDs by young people, and in particular by young girls. If you go around the country and if you speak to those who are responsible for accident and emergency wards in the nation's hospitals, if you speak to the nation's police commissioners or if you go for a walk through the city at night and see what is happening in the streets of our major metrocentres and elsewhere, you will see this is a huge problem. Because of these factors, the government have decided to act - that is, we have decided to embrace a series of measures to tackle binge drinking.On the question of binge drinking, we have dealt with a whole range of measures: firstly, $14.4 million in community-level initiatives to confront the culture of binge drinking; secondly, $19.1 million to intervene earlier; thirdly, $20 million in advertising that confronts young people with the costs and consequences of binge drinking; on top of that, closing the alcopop tax loophole, which those opposite introduced in the year 2000; and, on top of that again, ensuring that funds can be -  -  - All these elements form part of an integrated strategy for dealing with this. This is not an easy measure. We are dealing with a very complex social problem, and we must therefore act at every level. We will have more to say about binge drinking in the months ahead, because we are in close consultation with our colleagues in the police service and in the states and territories who are responsible for this.I find it interesting, again, that here we are today being attacked not just from the left on economic policy by the Liberal Party but also from the libertarian left on social policy. Let us look at these institutions which have come out in support of the government's measures. The Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia CEO, David Templeman, said:Â _ this initiative clearly recognised the problems created by the excessive consumption of RTDs which were attractive to the youth market.Furthermore, the Australian Drug Foundation CEO, John Rogerson, said:This tax fixes a problem started with the introduction of the GST and shows that the Government is serious about tackling alcohol problems in our community.I pause at this moment to ask: what did happen back there in the year 2000 to cause this particular tax loophole to be created? This would be a very productive area for inquiry as to why that happened, because the public health consequences which have flowed from that decision have been acute. - If you look at the comments on this measure from the respected health authorities of the nation, they make for sobering reading. The Public Health Association of Australia President, Professor Michael Daube, said:This is a timely response to a growing social problem.He continued:There is now dramatic evidence showing that young women are out-drinking their male counterparts - and unfortunately many of them drink to get drunk _ This has been helped by the ready availability of cheap spirit-based drinks, which have become the first choice of young women. Alcopops are the first _ drink for as many as 60 per cent of girls.We then go on to the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation CEO, Daryl Smeaton, who said:International evidence demonstrates that taxing alcopops at the same rate as bottled spirits will change the consumption patterns amongst young people and lead to less alcohol-related harm.We have here, from the respected public health authorities of the nation - the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia, the Australian Drug Foundation, the Public Health Association of Australia, and the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation of Australia - this series of considered remarks in response to the measure which was introduced by the government in the budget.What stuns me is that the Leader of the Opposition, a former president of the AMA, when he first heard of this measure that we introduced said what I thought was the responsible thing:The proposed increase in the excise on alcopops is something that will be supported by us _I find it quite extraordinary that, within a week or so in politics, we have a flip-flop on this, as we have had a flip-flop on the whole question of means testing and on every measure under the sun, on the part of those opposite.This is a difficult and complex area. What the government seek to do through this measure is to close a tax loophole which has been there, created by those opposite back in 2000, and to act in a responsible way to reduce the growth in RTDs and their consumption across the country. We will add to these measures in the future when it comes to other forms of policy which can help to deal with the binge-drinking crisis in Australia. The government are committed to acting in this area. Those opposite, I am sad to say, now pit themselves against the respected public health authorities of the nation and the repeated calls of police commissioners and others across the country to act in this area of critical need. I believe that working families across the country will know which piece of policy actually deals with this problem, as opposed to those who exhibit no interest in it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. A responsible question about government policy stands in stark contrast to the performance of the Liberal Party, which obviously thinks question time is now for clutching bottles of alcohol and hurling over the dispatch box abuse about important social issues like binge drinking. I am sure the member for Moreton is also very interested to hear that the government's Better Universities Renewal Fund will deliver to his local university, Griffith University, $16.2 million, an investment in a world-class education system - an education revolution. The government has to deliver an education revolution to make up for the more than a decade of neglect of our education system by the former government, by the Liberal Party and by the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition when serving as ministers for education in that government.Amongst our major initiatives in this budget is the Better Universities Renewal Fund to deliver $500 million to universities by the end of this financial year. But we are also creating the Education Investment Fund of $11 billion, a fund which will enable the renewal and renovation of both the higher education sector and the vocational education and training sector. These institutions have been allowed to languish as a result of more than a decade of neglect. The Education Investment Fund is composed of $6 billion coming from the former Higher Education Endowment Fund and a new investment of $5 billion. The money is all about improving higher education and vocational education and training.The Liberal Party have criticised this fund, as they have criticised all of Labor's investments in the future. But on these criticisms they show themselves to be out of touch with the thinking of those that care about the future of Australian education. In that regard, I refer to ANU Vice-Chancellor, Ian Chubb, who has remarked in relation to the Education Investment Fund:Allowing us to draw down from the capital will make an enormous difference to the size and scope of the projects we do. We go from spending on maintenance to being able to plan for a world-class future. -  - The opposition interject that someone like Ian Chubb, the Vice-Chancellor of ANU, ought not to be making such remarks, but he has endorsed the structure of the current fund. The Vice-Chancellor of ANU has endorsed the Rudd Labor government's structure of the current fund and rejected the structure of the Higher Education Endowment Fund. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may be interested that the Higher Education Endowment Fund board chairman, Phil Clark - the board chairman appointed by the former government, when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was the minister for education - has welcomed the new broader endowment structure and the end to the inflexible reliance on earnings. He argues, as reported in the Australian:The $11 billion is good but the totally integrated framework (of the new fund) is the real winner; most people will miss that.Clearly, amongst the people who have missed that are the people sitting on the opposition benches, the members of the Liberal Party.The endorsements for the new fund, as reported in the Australian, go on. Mike Gallagher, the Executive Director of the Group of Eight universities, has said that the way in which capital can be spent is 'a major shift'. He goes on to say:Otherwise it would just be this drip ... over many years, a couple of hundred of million a year.He noted that we are 'billions behind the rest of the world'. The flexible nature of the fund will obviously allow the government the discretion to provide funding where it is needed most.The endorsements of this new fund go on, endorsements not understood by the out-of-touch Liberal Party. TAFE institutes have welcomed the Education Investment Fund. The CEO of TAFE Directors Australia, Martin Riordan, has hailed the new fund as great news for students and stated:It will boost TAFE capacity to meet growing demand for 21st century technology training by industry.Opposition members - Boring! - I understand that members of the Liberal Party are bored by education because they care nothing about it, and I understand that they are out of touch with the thinking of those that care about Australian education and its future. But these endorsements show that the education community understands that the Rudd Labor government, through its budget, is committed to the future of Australian education, committed to delivering an education revolution and committed to overcoming the legacy of neglect left by a decade of Liberal Party rule and, in particular, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - When it comes to acting on alcopops, we have taken the appropriate advice, and the appropriate advice proceeds first and foremost from concerned mums and dads in the community, people who work in accident and emergency and people who are in the field and on the front line of policing - people trying to deal with this challenge as it presents itself to them. - On the question of alcopops, we have acted because this is a public health concern. We have also acted because those who preceded us in government left this extended tax loophole. On the question of the budget projections, it is very simple: if you increase the cost of alcopops over time, it is going to reduce the growth in the consumption of alcopops. But the unit price will increase, consumption will continue and, as a consequence overall, you will see in the budget papers the revenue consequences which flow. It is very clear, and I am surprised those opposite have not been able to reach that conclusion.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. It seems to me that there is one thing that those opposite haven't adjusted to in being in opposition - that is, they have not yet discovered the existence of the Parliamentary Library. I might like to point out to them where the Parliamentary Library is, but in case they are having difficulty finding where the Parliamentary Library is, I have asked the member for Perth - given there is so much evidence upon which we based these measures - to provide for me and to take members opposite through the numerous public reports filed in the library and accessible to every member of this House.I can take members through this long list of reports if we want to, and if members opposite really request it of me I will read through each of those. It might be more convenient for the House - and I am sure for Hansard - if I table the list of references and encourage those opposite to use the Parliamentary Library to go and access these materials. What they will find - if they take the time to read through these reports - is the number of quotes that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and I have taken people through time and time again.What I will also table for the benefit of those opposite is the Treasury modelling that makes quite clear the basis upon which we have taken this measure. -  - I know the anticipation is killing the shadow minister. I think I am entitled to speak on this question before I table it. I have flagged to you that I am going to table it, so settle down and let's actually take ourselves through this. -  - The Treasury modelling makes clear the impact of this measure. What we need to talk about and concentrate on when we look at the change in consumption is what consumption would be if we did not take this step, and what consumption would be if we do take this step. The Treasury modelling shows us that this excise change will reduce consumption in 2008-09 by 43 million bottles in one year. Forty-three million bottles is obviously not regarded by those opposite as a large amount. It may be that they have more experience in the amount that can be consumed, but to me that seems like a lot of alcohol. - This figure rises to 55 million bottles per year by the time we get to 2011-12. This is equivalent to one million litres of alcohol per year. It is interesting to me that the Leader of the Opposition persists with his enthusiastic opposition to such a sensible measure. This measure is equalising tax treatment for spirit products. The members opposite do not understand that if you drink 30 millilitres of bourbon straight or you drink 30 millilitres of bourbon that is mixed with Coke in a can, you will pay the same amount of excise, courtesy of our decision - not yours. - We are not making it cheaper, as the previous government did, for these sweet products to be available and cheap for young people who get hooked on alcohol. The Leader of the Opposition has been calling for this modelling. We are tabling this modelling, and when the Leader of the Opposition actually sees this modelling - when he sees that this will reduce consumption next year by 43 million bottles and by the end of the forward estimates by 55 million bottles - will the Leader of the Opposition still say that he is not going to support this measure? Which side of the debate is he going to end up on? He has been flip-flopping in all sorts of different directions. Once he has seen this evidence, we want to know whether the Leader of the Opposition has got the guts to support our measure. I table the report.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question. The government certainly do support the baby bonus, and as part of the budget we have introduced a number of measures to better target and improve the delivery of the baby bonus. From 1 January next year, a family income test of $150,000 a year will apply to the baby bonus. We consider that this level of family income, $150,000, to be a reasonable point at which to introduce an income test for the baby bonus. The vast majority of families will still continue to receive the baby bonus. Around 280,000 families will be eligible to receive the baby bonus in 2008-09. From our point of view, targeting these measures is economically responsible as well as fair. This government has had to make sure to introduce measures like this to rein in the profligate spending that took place under the previous government which has of course driven up inflation. We have also decided to pay the baby bonus in 13 fortnightly instalments to make sure that parents get the cash they need as their bills come in.The member for Franklin asked me about other views. There have been some interesting views put forward about this. The ANZ Bank's federal budget report interestingly said:The decisions to means-test the 'baby bonus' and Family Tax Benefit Part B ... are especially praiseworthy as an attempt to improve the targeting of such measures.But I have to say that my favourite quote is from an article in none other than the Manly Daily under the title 'Budget's warm reception'. The member for Warringah, I am pleased to note, is now paying attention. The Manly Daily, for the member for Warringah's benefit, said:The Federal Labor Party's first budget in more than a decade has received strong support from families on the northern beaches.It went on to say:Means testing the baby bonus, which will be raised to $5000 as of July, was also supported.It is unfortunate that members opposite do not spend more time listening to the constituents of the member for Warringah, because, if they did, they would not be in the pickle they seem to be in today.We have had so many different points of view from those opposite; they just seem to be in a horrible mess. We have had the member for Warringah, the member Canning, the member for Pearce and the member for Indi all divided. Some support it and some do not support it. Then of course we come to the Leader of the Opposition. 
A government member - What's his position? - I just do not know. Two weeks ago he was campaigning against any changes to the baby bonus. Yesterday he repeatedly refused to answer whether or not he supported the baby bonus changes. This morning, he called a doorstop and said, 'We don't support means testing as a policy but we are not going to block the budget. We do not support means testing of these things.' That is what he said this morning, so I thought I would go back and have a look at previous comments about means testing by the current Leader of the Opposition. In the North Shore Times on 30 May 2001 - I know you will be surprised! - he said the exact opposite. What he said back then was:Surely it is time now to think more of others and less of ourselves. In this lies the best interests of our nation.If only he remembered writing this.Whether that means supporting targeted funding in a federal budget, or supporting a charitable youth program in our own area, it is time to stand up and be counted.Well, it certainly is time to stand up and be counted, and this Leader of the Opposition has a little bit more time to stand up and be counted. How on earth could he say that we should stand up and be counted when he takes so many different points of view that an Olympic gymnast would be proud? This is yet another about-face from this Leader of the Opposition, who has no idea at all what he stands for.</DOC>

 - What we are concerned about is the prevalence of data concerning the increased use of RTDs by younger males and, in particular, younger females. Those who occupied the treasury bench when the member for Higgins was the Treasurer decided in 2000, at the time of the introduction of the GST, to provide a special measure in terms of the taxation treatment of this category of drinks, RTDs, and the data since then has shown that the proportion of girls reporting the consumption of RTDs on their last drinking occasion has increased from 14 per cent to 62 per cent. I regard that as a definition of a public health problem. We have acted responsibly in response to the taxation loophole the previous government left deliberately in this category of drinks. We have acted on it accordingly and we have acted on it according to the advice that we have received.</DOC>

 - Thank you to the member for Parramatta. The Prime Minister made it clear before the election that new policies and new initiatives that would improve housing affordability would be a central plank of a new Rudd Labor government's agenda, and Tuesday night's budget delivers on those commitments. It delivers $2.2 billion worth of new investment in affordable housing for working families and individuals. It is the first budget in 12 years to respond to community concerns about failing housing affordability.In fact, the former government cared so little about the housing needs of Australians that they did not even have a housing minister. I am very pleased that they now have a shadow housing minister and I was looking forward to reading her press release yesterday. I have enjoyed her previous press releases very much. I was wondering about the tack that she might take. I was wondering whether she would try and attack us on not doing enough for first home buyers. Well, no. It would be very difficult to do that because our $1.2 billion first home saver accounts would make that a difficult line to run. Our first home saver accounts help young Australians save a bigger deposit for their first home by making a government contribution of 17 per cent for the first $5,000 that young Australians put into these accounts each year, taxing them at a special low 15 per cent tax rate and making withdrawals tax free when they are taken out to build or buy a first home. It would be pretty difficult to criticise the greatest revolution in savings culture in Australia since compulsory superannuation reform. This is a reform that will see $6Â½ billion saved in its first four years of operation, a reform that will see average income earners putting aside 10 per cent of their incomes able to save around $88,000 in five years towards a deposit for their first home.So she is not able to criticise our efforts for first home buyers. I was wondering whether she would have a go at us about rental properties or affordable homes to buy. That would also be very difficult, because we have our National Rental Affordability Scheme to build 50,000 new affordable rental properties and, if they are needed, another 50,000 affordable rental properties that will be rented out at 80 per cent of market values for low- and moderate-income earners, providing a source of growth funding for community housing, delivering lower rents for the people who need them most and, for the first time in Australia, making investment at the more affordable end of the rental market attractive to institutional investors.What about homeownership? We have a $512 million fund - half a billion dollars - to bring down the cost of new homes to buy, particularly at the entry level of the market. So the shadow minister is not able to criticise us on first home buyers, on affordable rental market or on houses to buy. The shadow minister took an even more courageous path. The press release was entitled 'Labor budget disregards public housing'. That is very, very brave from the former government that cut $3.1 billion out of public housing, that cut housing in real terms by 30 per cent and that presided over a public housing system that had 20,000 fewer homes in it when they left office compared to when they went into office - very brave indeed.The shadow minister went on to say that it was a critical component of the overall housing supply chain. I think that every person on this side would agree with that - but then we are not the ones that cut $3.1 billion out of public housing. She called it 'the part of the system under most stress'. Well, it is no wonder it was under most stress, having had $3.1 billion cut from it. -  -  - Mr Speaker, I will take that correction in the spirit in which it was intended, because I think that the member for Farrer is a really lovely person. I like her very, very much. I want to put that on the record. When I meet housing developers, builders and people in the social housing area and when I meet people struggling to pay their mortgages and struggling to pay the rent and they ask me, 'Is there a shadow minister? What is her name?' I say: 'There is - it's the member for Farrer. She's a great human being,' and they look forward to meeting her eventually too.This budget delivers on housing affordability for Australians. It makes a down payment on our efforts to tackle homelessness. It doubles financial counselling; it helps with environmental measures for people's own homes and for rental properties. The government has begun talks with the states, the private sector, people in community and public housing areas and mums and dads. I believe that - despite the fact that we cannot fix 12 years of Liberal Party neglect overnight and there is no silver bullet to housing affordability - this $2.2 billion of new measures will begin to turn around problems of housing affordability in Australia.</DOC>

 - This is not a new tax. This is the closing of a loophole which has given some people a very considerable advantage over others. When an ordinary punter wants to go out from work and buy a coffee, they pay for it in after-tax income, but through this loophole, which has been exploited, through salary sacrifice some people have been getting their lunch tax free. That is what they have been doing. It has been a loophole that has been exploited for a long time and we are not ashamed to close it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for the opportunity to talk about the Labor government's absolute commitment to the defence of the nation, its people and their interests. His interest in these matters is well known. In framing the defence budget the government had two key objectives in mind. - The first, of course, was to ensure that Defence, in the short term, had sufficient funding to undertake its tasks at a level appropriate to do that job effectively - as efficiently and as safely as possible. The second was to put the defence budget back on a sustainable footing. Not only did the new government inherit a serious inflationary situation in the economy, we also inherited a dysfunctional defence budget full of black holes. Let me give you a couple of examples. There are the so-called net personnel and operating costs - these are the sustainment costs of keeping our defence capability going. There was a shortfall of up to $7 billion over the course of the next 10 years, a shortfall the new government has to fill. Second, there is the enhanced land force - this is the two new battalions being raised. There was up to a $700 million shortfall in the funding of that project. Again, the new government has to fill this hole.Do you think the now Leader of the Opposition when he was defence minister allocated funding for the overdue pay rises for our troops? No, he did not. There was an $800 million shortfall over the forward estimates. In addition to that, we now have to find the money for failed capability - just take the Seasprite helicopters, for example. Not only did the former government flush a billion dollars or more down the drain; the new government now has to find the money necessary to replace that capability.There is no doubt that we met the first objective - that is, the continuity in funding. In the coming fiscal year, we will spend a record amount of money on defence, up seven per cent on what will be spent in the 2007-08 year. On the second objective - that is, putting the budget back on a sustainable footing - we have substantially laid a very solid foundation. Prior to the election, we said that we would grow the defence budget by three per cent annually out to the year 2016. On Tuesday night we announced that we would grow the defence budget by, on average, four per cent annually right out to the year 2018. This lift in funding means more money for defence, but the additional two years means that we can now plan for capability and force structure on a decade-long basis. We will have the confidence to be able to do so as a result of these new initiatives.Properly financing our defence needs is not just about stumping up the cash; it also requires a lot of hard work. It means ensuring that Defence is an efficient organisation and that every dollar spent is a dollar spent well and efficiently. It means showing leadership and having the courage to take the tough decisions necessary to ensure scarce money is not being squandered in layers of bureaucracy. It means stopping the waste and mismanagement which has become so synonymous with defence procurement in this country.In addition to the white paper, the government has commissioned nine companion reviews which collectively will reassess the way we do things right across the non-military side of the Defence organisation including issues like management structures and information technology. The new government is putting in place a plan to ensure that, over the course of the next decade, defence not only gets the money it needs but also that every dollar stretches further and taxpayers get value for money. The work on that plan commenced last December and it received a big boost in Tuesday night's budget.</DOC>

 - I am unaware of the report that the honourable member has referred to. I do not doubt his rendition of it. As I said before to the Leader of the Opposition, we will look carefully at the report and come back if we have something further to say on it.On the question of the luxury car tax, we stand by it. We believe it is necessary because we believe it is important to produce a responsible economic outcome for the nation. Can I say that we believe that all relevant taxation measures are appropriate. It would be very interesting at this stage to calculate the quantum of the individual budget measures which have been laid to one side by those opposite in their comments in the last couple of days. That amount is now quickly adding up to billions upon billions of dollars. On the individual circumstances that the honourable member has raised, we will look at the matter further.</DOC>

 - The government are indeed committed to delivering for regional Australia, and our budget on Tuesday night delivered $176 million to fulfil our Better Regions election commitments. Next year we will establish the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, a program that will encourage economic development and invest in local community infrastructure. We provided on Tuesday night $74 million for the new regional development Australian network; $8 million for the Office of Northern Australia, which will be based in Townsville and Darwin; $10 billion for rural and regional road and rail initiatives over the next five years; and $1.9 billion for local government across Australia. All of that is on top of the $20 billion Building Australia Fund that will deliver critical infrastructure for the nation's regions.I was intrigued to hear the former government continue to defend their approach to regional development, in particular the Regional Partnerships program. I was intrigued to see the member for Calare and my shadow minister stating that he was worried that Labor had changed regional programs so that city groups could now compete for funding. He argued that Regional Partnerships had excluded funding in the cities, and said of Labor's approach:It is going to make a town like Tibboburra in the far north-west, the most isolated town in New South Wales, compete with areas like Wollongong, Newcastle and Sydney.That backs up comments by the leader of the Nationals, who said on 8 May to the ABC about the Regional Partnerships program:This program was specifically designed to provide things in small communities. The big cities have got the resources and can often provide, on a commercial basis, projects that are simply unviable in regional areas.So there you have it - post election the senior members of the National Party and the opposition arguing that Regional Partnerships money was just for regional areas. The reality of course is very different. Regional Partnerships provided $43 million on a political basis for projects in Australia's capital cities whenever it was convenient.When you think about regional Australia you think about Orange, Tibooburra, Townsville, Wangaratta - you think of these regional communities around the nation. Well, just before the last election, under the Regional Partnerships program, the former government committed $1.5 million for a surf lifesaving club. Was the surf lifesaving club on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, at Coffs Harbour in New South Wales or perhaps on the Surf Coast in Victoria? No, it was at Bondi Beach. Under the Regional Partnerships program, $1.5 million went to a club at Bondi Beach. But, of course, there is form. It was not just the North Bondi Surf Club in the electorate of the shadow Treasurer, the member for Wentworth, who was under pressure during an election campaign, which received funding. There is form here because in 2004 the then government committed $422,000 for a marine discovery centre, again under the Regional Partnerships -  - I understand that they do not want to hear this, but I am happy to talk about Regional Partnerships consistently in this parliament. You would think that the marine discovery centre funded under Regional Partnerships might be on the Great Barrier Reef. But let us not be East Coast centric; it might be at Ningaloo. There are lots of areas where it could be in regional Australia. Oh no, it was at Bondi as well - in the electorate of Wentworth. And it does not stop there. Regional Partnerships had a forerunner - the Regional Assistance Program. Nine hundred thousand dollars went to the electorate of Wentworth. It does not just stop at regional funding. Let us come to roads. The former government had a program called the Strategic Regional Program. It was designed for disadvantaged regional areas suffering from drought. Do you know where $2 million dollars went for a road under the Strategic Regional Program?Opposition members - No. - You want to hear. When you go to Bondi Beach, go to Campbell Parade. Campbell Parade was funded $2 million under this program. Geography had nothing to do with how regional funding occurred under the former government. It was all about politics. Yet, now they are in opposition, the shadow Treasurer, the member for Wentworth, said just on Tuesday that inefficient programs should be 'changed, revised, removed'. So when he is part of the government, he is prepared to sit in the cabinet room and take money from regional Australia to funnel it into marginal seats in Sydney. It is all about complete fiscal irresponsibility. That defines this opposition - an opposition that has completely lost its way, an opposition that is prepared to mislead the Australian public when it -  The member for Dickson then left the chamber. 
 - The member for Wentworth is very excited about this. He thinks this is terrific because he is the shadow Treasurer with no idea about economic responsibility, no idea about good infrastructure funding such as that which we are providing - a planned approach to infrastructure development. On the other side, it was all about pork during election campaigns. That is one of the reasons they were rejected last November. They were rejected because they had no long-term plan for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question because revenue as a percentage of GDP will go down. The high-taxing people are on that side of the parliament and the shadow Treasurer knows this. What we have here is the party of low surpluses and high spending, putting upward pressure on inflation. It falls to this government to rein in that spending, to deliver the tax cuts that were earned by the Australian people. We have done that by spending cuts and big savings in this budget: $7 billion worth of savings in 2008-09 and $33 billion of savings over the forward estimates. It does not matter how he tries to fiddle the figures; they are the facts. He cannot hide from his economic irresponsibility.This shadow Treasurer is the best friend inflation ever had. He absolutely is. And he is in there with the former Treasurer as well, the member for Higgins. The legacy they left this country was high inflation. We have brought down a responsible budget that tackles inflation, delivers for working families and invests in the future. All the opposition want to do is scuttle a responsible budget. The Australian people will see them for what they are - opportunists and nothing else.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for the question, acknowledge his engagement with both the recreational and commercial fishing sector off the coast of Darwin, and note his commitment to the fight against illegal fishing. I wish to advise the House in response to that question that between 17 and 30 April the Australian Fisheries Management Authority apprehended some 33 vessels off the coast of Northern Australia suspected of illegal fishing. Following investigations, I am advised that nine of the vessels and 55 of the fishermen were not engaged in illegal fishing. I am further advised that the vessels were apprehended in accordance with the Australian government guidelines dealing with vessels operating north of the provisional fisheries surveillance and enforcement line under treaty arrangements between Australia and Indonesia with respect to the south of the seabed boundary area.In this area, as opposed to many of the other areas where we patrol for illegal fishing, we have control of the seabed, whereas Indonesia has control of swimming species, and jurisdiction there. As could be the case for any law enforcement activity, suspicions that form the basis for apprehension do not always amount to evidence of actual wrongdoing. When that happens law enforcement officials act promptly to release the individuals they have apprehended, and that is exactly what has happened on this case.I am further advised that, of the nine vessels that were not engaged in illegal fishing - they were fishing legally - when they were apprehended, four of those vessels were destroyed at sea because they would have presented serious risks to safety had they been towed. Another vessel was destroyed in Darwin Harbour because it did begin to sink, and two of the remaining vessels are not seaworthy. In accordance with the international law of the sea, the government will compensate the fishermen - those who were fishing legally - for the loss of their vessels and their fishing equipment.My colleague the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, from the other place, has advised that six of the 55 were minors and that they have all been accommodated appropriately by his department at a local motel. He also advises that his department is promptly working towards the relocation of the crews of the affected vessels from the Northern Immigration Detention Centre to alternative accommodation in Darwin, with a view to expediting their return to Indonesia at the earliest possible time. It is expected that those remaining in detention will be relocated today from the immigration facility and accommodated under community based detention arrangements, which probably will be motels in and around Darwin. - These crews, all of whom were involved in legal fishing, will be kept together and accompanied by a detention service provider officer until Saturday when the fishers will be returned to Indonesia. The minister also advises that his department is developing a management strategy for the remainder of the illegal fishermen detained at the centre. This will include the engagement of additional staff to expedite the number of illegal foreign fishers at the detention centre as quickly as possible.The government does not resile from its tough stance on illegal fishing. However, as can be the case in any law enforcement activity, genuine errors can be made. Given the numbers of people involved, I felt it was important to inform the House directly of these matters. I also note, with our gratitude, the cooperation and assistance of the Indonesian authorities, and the work we do together with Indonesia to combat illegal fishing. The Indonesian consulate is expected to provide travel documents for this group by noon tomorrow to assist their return to Indonesia.</DOC>

When it comes to the budget measures, to which the member for Port Adelaide was just referring, we on this side of the House are proud of a budget which delivers for working Australians, for working families and for those doing it tough. It contains within it a $55 billion support package for working families. It contains additional payments for seniors and carers - payments additional to those provided in the Liberal Party's last budget in this place. Of course, the measures that we put forward in the budget we are proud of. When it comes to the future we will continue to examine measures which will be able to support working families under financial pressure. We have always said that. That is in part why we have commissioned the Henry commission of inquiry to comprehensively review the tax and income system - comprehensively and for the long term, and to support working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. When the government assumed office, and in framing this budget, we were faced with three big economic challenges: one, inflation in Australia running at a 16-year high, delivered to us as a courtesy, a parting gift, of the preceding government; two, a world financial crisis which the International Monetary Fund says is one of the most serious crises we have seen since the Great Depression; and, three, historic shifts in commodity prices, including a doubling of oil prices in the last 12 months. That is why it has been critical for the government to deliver a responsible budget. We are a government of responsible economic management. We believe in ensuring that we are budgeting for Australia's long-term economic needs rather than for short-term political opportunism, which seems to have been the hallmark of those opposite.What have we therefore delivered? One, a $22 billion budget surplus. That surplus is critical to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. That is the hallmark of what we have done. Beyond that, government expenditure as a proportion of GDP is now at its lowest level since 1989-90. Tax as a proportion of GDP has also gone down. This is a fundamentally responsible and conservative economic document designed to meet the economic challenges of our time.Beyond that, the budget has sought to invest in Australia's future. Investing in the future is a core requirement to ensure that the proceeds which have come into Australia per medium of the resources boom are not frittered away on consumption, as has been done by those opposite, but invested in long-term productive capacity. We have done that through, firstly, the Building Australia Fund to invest in infrastructure. Secondly, we have done that through establishing an Education Investment Fund of $11 billion to invest in the critical needs of our TAFE and university sectors, which have been crumbling in recent times. Thirdly, there is a $10 billion Health and Hospitals Fund for the future to make sure that through reforms in that sector we deliver the best possible health system that Australia can support.On top of that we have made sure that apart from investing in the future, apart from producing a responsible budget and putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates, we have also delivered on our commitments to working Australians, working families and those doing it tough. I referred in my earlier answer to a $55 billion support package for working families, including for the first time a $4.4 billion education tax refund to help mums and dads out there struggling with their school expenses. There is $750 a year for primary school kids and $1,500 a year for secondary school kids, and for identified education items there is an opportunity to come back and claim 50 per cent of those amounts. Of course, there are our additional payments for the childcare tax rebate, raising it from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. Then there is our assistance in the housing affordability challenge facing so many Australians. Not only do we have for the first time a housing minister - there was not one under those opposite; we have housing policy because there was not one before, either. There is $2.2 billion of investment in housing affordability initiatives for working Australians.Beyond that is the Making Ends Meet package. The budget delivered senior Australians an additional $900 compared with last year's budget. Carers allowance and carers payment recipients will get up to $2,100 in addition to what they were provided in the last budget. Disability pensioners will receive an additional $500 towards the cost of living, in addition to the last budget.The question asked whether there are threats to this. There are. That threat is summed up in three words: 'the Liberal Party'. The challenge to Australia's future economic policy lies in the Liberal Party - or, as it could now be described, 'the many liberal parties'. As I look across the front bench I see many liberal parties represented there. It is difficult to choose which one we are responding to on any given day. Of course, their promise so far is to block the budget, to block budget revenues to the tune of some $22 billion. At a time when we are fighting inflation and fighting to put downward pressure on interest rates the response from the party of so-called responsible economic management is to say, 'We'll raid the surplus to the tune of $22 billion.' This was a remarkable first step.But there are three things that stand out about this overall budget position on the part of our opponents. These are of direct relevance to the country because the opposition controls the fate of the budget in the Senate. When we look at the raid on the surplus, nothing can be said of it other than what Saul Eslake said. He described it as a piece of economics which is 'dopey, dopey, dopey'. - I thank the member for O'Connor, including for his enlightened observations on Aboriginal policy at the door today. The second point about the opposition's position on this budget and why it represents a threat to Australia's long-term economic security is what it does in terms of the inflation challenge. The Leader of the Opposition does not think that there is any inflation crisis. We have had from those opposite a statement that in fact inflation is a fairy tale, a charade, and that there is no inflation crisis whatsoever. This flies in the face of the most fundamental precepts of economic responsibility.The third thing you can say about the opposition's posture on this budget is the fact that they do not agree with one another. They have at least two, if not three or four, different positions on petrol tax. They are divided on the question of means testing. They are divided on the question of whether you should means test the baby bonus. They are divided on the question of who should be the leader of the Liberal Party. The member for Wentworth wants to replace the member who is currently the leader of the Liberal Party. Then we have the member for Higgins, who thinks he might want to replace the member for Wentworth as the prospective leader of the Liberal Party. Then there is the member for Mayo, who may want to replace the member for Wentworth as shadow Treasurer before becoming the leader of the Liberal Party. We have a Liberal Party which is terminally divided. I say this to those opposite: there is a challenge of responsible economic management here. - Of course, in that list of prospective candidates for the leadership of the Liberal Party we left out Hockey, Joe, who has added his name to the list over the course of the weekend. -  - I am sorry - the Manager of Opposition Business. I anticipate the interjections from those opposite. - Now we have these five candidates for the leadership of the Liberal Party it will make an interesting season ahead. I can only imagine why those opposite are somewhat sensitive on this question today. My clear message to whoever leads the Liberal Party in three months time, six months time or nine months time - and I need to address these remarks in five different directions to make sure they hit the mark - is that this budget is a budget of responsible economic management and if those opposite are about to embark upon a course of action involving a raid on the surplus to the tune of $22 billion, an assault on the fundamental financial integrity of the budget of the Commonwealth of Australia, then be it on their heads what the consequences will be for them. Be it on your heads what the consequences will be for you.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Had the Leader of the Opposition been listening attentively to my answer to his first question, what he would have heard me say was this: the budget announced by the government contains a range of measures to assist working families. I will repeat them: $55 billion as a working family support package and, on top of that, a package of $5 billion plus to assist seniors and carers. We have also said quite clearly that we will continue to be attentive to other measures which can assist working families into the future. That is what I said in response to the first question, had the honourable member been listening. That is why the Henry commission has been established to undertake a comprehensive, long-term review of Australia's tax, income and retirement income support systems. - The Leader of the Opposition interjects, 'Another review.' I notice that in the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply he is depending on precisely that review to construct his position on the future of retirement incomes policy and the position on seniors. If it is such a bad review, why is it that those opposite are depending on the selfsame review to deliver their own policy outcome? It would help if those opposite could develop a coherent position.On the question of global oil prices, which the honourable member refers to, and their impact on Australia and at the bowser for working families, petrol prices are going through the roof and that is affecting working families right across the country. It is affecting all those working Australians and it is affecting those who are doing it tough in Australia as well. Therefore, it is important to place into context what is happening on oil prices. If you look right across the spectrum and across the world, what we have seen since the Iraq war is global oil prices having gone up by 400 per cent. We have had oil prices double in the last year. We have had the biggest increases in global oil prices since the 1970s when we had the double oil shock of that decade. So what we have today is oil prices at their highest point in history, taking into account all inflationary factors. That is the global economic reality, and the impact on Australians at the bowser is acute. Based on the analyses that we have been provided, we have now had Australians paying $30 more per month over the last seven months. This is a big slug on the family budget. Right across the world we see prices going up as well. In the UK they are now paying $2.35 a litre and $2.95 a litre in France.In terms of a proper analysis of what is happening with the global oil challenges, what are we therefore confronted with? Across the world today, we have a huge number of supply and demand factors at work. On the demand side, with the rise of China and India, the same factors which are fuelling the demand for Australia's energy based resources are fuelling global demand for oil - hence, the oil price is going through the roof. You see that with India bringing on stream something like 1.3 million new automobiles every year. There is a similar development in China. - The honourable member interjects about what this has to do with the price of petrol in Australia. It is called the global oil price, and the global oil price directly affects the Australian oil price. I would suggest that they refer to their own statements on this matter over time. When you look at these challenges, on both the supply side and the demand side, it is important that we have an integrated response. On the supply side there are continued problems in Nigeria, and it is only recently that, after five years, supply from Iraq has begun to catch up with its pre-war levels of oil production. On the question of a proper response to this, it must be one which deals with long-term global factors and immediate national and short-term cost pressures for families as well. We need to look carefully at what is happening with overall global supply and maximise our leverage on organisations such as OPEC, as the President of the United States is seeking to do at present, backed by other heads of government as well, including this government. We must look also at the overall pattern of global demand. If we continue to have a lack of efficiency in global oil consumption, that will also have a cumulative impact on pushing the oil price up. In Australia we must also deal with practical challenges. The number of Australians who are currently sitting in queues in traffic around the country because of urban congestion -  - Coming in on cue, the Manager of Opposition Business says 'blame the states.' We have a Building Australia Fund, which is designed to confront the challenges of urban congestion. Why don't those opposite come up with a positive response to the challenges of urban congestion, for example, in dealing with what we do with the future of urban metro? Beyond that is an alternative fuel strategy, such as never emanated from those opposite, which is currently being developed by my colleague Minister Ferguson. On top of that, what are we going to do in terms of automobile design? We have the green car innovation fund, with half a billion dollars to assist in the production of an Australian hybrid car. Then you have domestic competition policy arrangements. What we have done on our side of the House is the appointment of a petrol price commissioner, the application of formal price monitoring in relation to the petroleum retail industry and the proposed introduction of FuelWatch by year's end, endorsed by the state Liberal government of Western Australia, who introduced it, and the state Liberal leadership of New South Wales - and it seems that the federal leadership once again have parted company with their state colleagues. On the question of taxation treatment, as I said before, these matters are before the Henry commission and we wait for their report.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As the Prime Minister has said, rising oil prices around the world are causing concern for Australian motorists. I can report to the House that, with a rise of $8 in the last week, the current price for Malaysian Tapis oil is $139 a barrel. Increasing transparency and competition in the fuel market has been a priority for this government. That is why we have substantially increased the powers of the ACCC, and that is why we have appointed Australia's first Petrol Commissioner. An important result of the ACCC's petrol inquiry was to suggest the consideration of a national FuelWatch scheme. FuelWatch was introduced by the Court Liberal government in Western Australia in 2001 and has received bipartisan support in that state since then. FuelWatch is a scheme which will put motorists back in charge and will give them more certainty when buying petrol. It is a scheme which will enable motorists to map their route between work and home to determine where the cheapest petrol will be today and tomorrow and to make their decision on that basis. We know that there is a big gap between the most expensive and the cheapest petrol in any capital city on any given day. Today in Brisbane the gap between the cheapest petrol and the most expensive petrol is 24c a litre. On 15 May, the day the Leader of the Opposition responded to the budget, the gap in Melbourne between the cheapest and the most expensive petrol was 30c a litre. FuelWatch will enable motorists to find that cheap petrol from their home or from their work on their computer. This will put motorists back in charge.I am asked if there are any obstacles to the introduction of FuelWatch. I regret to inform the House that there are obstacles to the introduction of FuelWatch, and they sit opposite, because FuelWatch will require the passage of legislation through both houses of the parliament. Obviously, it will be a lot easier with the support of honourable members opposite. Now, we are not sure where they stand. The Leader of the Opposition and others have criticised FuelWatch. Yesterday the leader of the opposition in the other house said they have yet to make a decision about where they stand on FuelWatch, so we are not sure where they stand. But on this side of the House we stand for the Petrol Commissioner. On this side of the House we stand for giving the ACCC real teeth and we stand for FuelWatch while the opposition prevaricates. Some of them say that the better policy is to reduce the excise. The Leader of the Opposition says that. We are not sure if that will be the policy at the next election. They are not sure whether FuelWatch will be their policy, and they are not sure if reducing the excise will be their policy at the next election. The shadow Treasurer was asked whether it would be policy at the next election to cut the excise and he said, 'Well, it might if Brendan - look, if that is our policy then I will argue for it as eloquently or not as I can.' That is as certain as they could get. - We know the shadow Treasurer could not bring himself to say this was good policy. The best he could do was say it was good politics. We know the member for Flinders has misgivings, we know the member for Mayo has misgivings and we know the member for Higgins opposes the policy, so why don't they just get behind FuelWatch? We had an indication as to their thinking yesterday. We know that, on excise, they have more positions than you would find on a cricket field. But, on FuelWatch, we have an indication as to their thinking when the leader of the opposition in the other house, Senator Minchin, whom we understand is a man of very great influence on that side of the other house under current arrangements, said, 'We don't support FuelWatch because it is very expensive.' - Mr Speaker, I was asked about obstacles. And it is an important obstacle that we may not be able to get FuelWatch through the upper house. Yesterday the leader of the opposition in the upper house said that they have misgivings about FuelWatch because it is so expensive. Honourable members opposite would have read the budget papers. They know that FuelWatch will cost $20 million over four years. Apparently that is too expensive. But $8 billion over four years is not too expensive. I know the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Education has a great concern about the quality of maths teaching and teaching standards in this country. I have referred this to her as a case study for studying value for money - that is, that $20 million over four years is actually cheaper than $8 billion over four years.But I am pleased to report to the House that there is one leader of the Liberal Party in Australia who has shown leadership on this issue. Unfortunately, it is not the honourable gentleman who sits opposite, but it is one well known to members from the great state of New South Wales. Mr O'Farrell has said of FuelWatch:This will ease the burden on families and pensioners by helping drive down petrol prices.He went on to say:This is about putting the interests of motorists' wallets ahead of oil company profits.We will soon know where honourable members opposite stand on that particular equation when they announce whether or not they will support FuelWatch in the upper house.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. On the question of FuelWatch, we have looked carefully at the experience of the Western Australia state Liberal government, who introduced this scheme in 2000 and who continue to support it on a bipartisan basis. We have also taken advice from a range of people about its potential impact at the bowser. We have never overstated it. At the time of its launch we said about 2c on average over time at the bowser. But, as the Assistant Treasurer just said, the critical challenge lies in the ability to provide consumers with information 24 hours before as to where the cheapest petrol can be had in a given area. That is an important piece of information because, as honourable members would know, as you go from the CBD out into the suburbs across metropolitan Australia you can see such a huge variety of fuel prices across the suburban area and within the one day. Therefore, for us it simply makes basic common sense that this helps.I am surprised, of all members in this place to stick up his head and ask a question about fuel policy, that the member for Wentworth has just done so. If you are trying to find a coherent position on the part of the Liberal Party when it comes to fuel policy and fuel pricing, where do you go? In the 'yes' camp on the excise arrangement which they announced on budget reply night we have the Leader of the Opposition, and now in the 'no' camp we have - they get very sensitive about this -  - It is very difficult to map any consistency on the part of those opposite on any coherent approach to what you do on the question of fuel. In the 'yes' camp - that is, on the 5c excise - you have the Leader of the Opposition. You are not sensitive, but we are taking another point of order. - On the question of fuel policy, the Leader of the Opposition puts forward an approach which deals with excise. We have a range of policies which deal with fuel policy. When it comes to their position, we have the Leader of the Opposition supporting the excise measure. The member for Wentworth now opposes the excise measure, the member for Higgins opposes the excise measure, the member for Mayo opposes the excise measure and, on queue, the member for Flinders comes in on the excise measure, opposed to it as well. It is quite interesting. I think their policy is in complete disarray.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, because the fight against inflation does require responsible budgeting. What it requires is a very strong surplus. What it requires is costed, funded and deliverable commitments, and of course what the last budget shows is that the only party in Australia that is in the cart for responsible economic management is the Labor Party, because those opposite have become utterly irresponsible. Their $22 billion smash-and-grab on the surplus can do nothing other than put up inflation and put up interest rates; it is completely irresponsible. And of course in the opposition leader's reply the other night there was not one dollar of savings in that proposal to fund alternative proposals that he put forward. There was not one dollar of savings to fund his proposal on excise, for example. There was not one dollar of savings in a so-called budget-in-reply speech. And of course, when the Treasury spokesman got to the National Press Club the other day, he did not give the Treasurer's budget-in-reply speech; he gave a Brendan-in-reply speech. There were no costed proposals that came from the shadow Treasurer - no costed proposals at all. So what this smash-and-grab on the surplus shows is that those opposite are the fiscal vandals of Australian politics. There is not a dollar being put forward to fund their commitments. They are opposed to increasing the Medicare levy surcharge thresholds in favour of higher tax on modest income earners. They are opposed to fixing fringe benefits tax loopholes. They are opposed to our measures on condensate, opposed to removing tax concessions for alcopops and, of course, opposed to the luxury car tax.We on this side of the House will defend the integrity of our budget, because the future living standards of Australian families depend upon that. The Australian people are happy with our long-term plans for the nation against the short-term, irresponsible proposals of those opposite. What they want is sustainable growth, lower inflation and lower interest rates. We will defend the integrity of our budget. Those opposite have lost their way on the economy. What have we had from the shadow Treasurer? He says a means test of $150,000 is about right. Then he says he is in favour of welfare payments to millionaires. He says fuel tax excise cuts are bad policy and then he says he is in favour of them. He says one per cent growth is inflationary and then he refuses to admit that four per cent spending growth is inflationary. The Treasury spokesman is going so badly over there that even Alexander Downer thinks he can do a better job. - It has taken the member for Wentworth six months to turn the Liberal Party's economic credibility into a smoking ruin.</DOC>

 - I am sure that, on matters as contentious as fuel policy in general and on the introduction of FuelWatch in particular, you are going to have a range of opinions and advice rolling around the country at any given time, within government and outside of government. That is the nature of public policy. The key thing is that when this matter was subjected to analysis by the ACCC, the conclusion was clear that this particular proposal of the government was worthy of implementation. It provides consumers with choice, as described recently by the Assistant Treasurer. We believe therefore it is an appropriate course of action consistent with what the Liberal government of Western Australia and the Liberal leadership of New South Wales have had to say. As I said, policy is contestable and people have different points of view - I understand that - but we think that this is the right way to go. It is certainly worth providing consumers with this opportunity for choice.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. The Rudd government inherited a budget full of waste and inefficient spending - $457 million was spent by the former government on government advertising within the last 16 months of its term in office; $350 million was spent in one single year on the failed Work Choices regime, the infamous Regional Partnerships grants and of course a rapidly growing federal Public Service, including a 44 per cent increase in the fat cat brigade, the SES level of the public service. In the budget a couple of weeks ago the government put in place $7.3 billion of savings in the forthcoming financial year, $1.6 billion of which were outlined prior to the election and $3.8 billion worth of spending cuts that were indicated post that election. If you look at the detail of these savings, what you will see at the heart of these savings is substantial cuts in government advertising across a very wide range of programs, very substantial reductions in the cost of the industrial relations regime being run by the Commonwealth, the abolition of the Regional Partnerships program and, of course, a small but significant reduction in the overall level of the federal Public Service. There is more to be done. There is a substantial task still in front of us with respect to cutting back on wasteful government spending, but we have delivered a surplus of 1.8 per cent of GDP and got government spending down from running at a five per cent real increase to just over a one per cent real increase.The opposition's response to this has been completely confused. In fact, during the past two weeks in Australian politics, it has been almost impossible to identify an issue on which the opposition has had the same position over the time it has been debated in the public arena. Before the budget it said there was no need for spending cuts, there was no wasteful spending, but after the budget it described a reduced spending projection as a high-spending budget. Inflation has variously been described by the opposition as a 'charade' a 'fairytale' and then, subsequently, as a 'problem but not a crisis'. It is in favour of means testing the baby bonus one day, opposed to means testing the baby bonus the next. The member for McPherson is running a petition to increase the base rate of the pension, but the shadow Treasurer, the member for Wentworth, has indicated that that is not the opposition's policy. It was in favour of restoring the tax level to alcopops a couple of weeks before the budget, but, in response to the budget, it has now changed its position. It cannot even agree on whether the member for Mayo is coming or going! It simply cannot take a single position on any issue in contemporary Australian politics.This mob is giving the word rabble a bad name, and nowhere more so than on the issue of government spending. It is the easiest thing in the world for a political leader to promise free money. The opposition are promising all kinds of things: tax reductions, knocking over things that they do not like, increased spending on things, 'We'll keep Regional Partnerships' - all of these things the opposition are putting forward as their alternative to the budget without a single indication of how they would be paid for. But they are not even coherent on that, because in the midst of all of this they are proposing to restore a tax slug that the government has removed on middle-income Australians - namely, the Medicare levy surcharge that applied to people on very ordinary middle incomes. The government has lifted the thresholds to put them back somewhere remotely where they were intended to be - on higher incomes. The opposition - so much for their alleged low-taxing rhetoric - want to restore that tax slug on middle-income Australians.The money the opposition want to spend - on reducing the petrol excise, on restoring that surcharge, on Regional Partnerships, on reducing the alcopops tax - all has to come from somewhere. The member for Sturt let the cat out of the bag on Friday night when he indicated where it is coming from. It is coming from the surplus. That is where it is coming from. That is why there were no savings initiatives in the budget reply by the Leader of the Opposition two weeks ago - because they have no savings initiatives, they have no source of alternative funding to implement these policies, and the only available source is to reduce the size of the surplus. And that means one thing - that is, higher interest rates. Higher inflation as the result of greater public demand and increased government spending, just like we inherited, would inevitably produce higher interest rates.The Rudd government have delivered a tough, responsible budget, but we are not going to rest on our laurels. We now have a second stage of the razor gang that is starting work looking for future savings from the systemic approaches of government - the processes, the programs of government - to continually find more money to strengthen the federal government's budget, because pressures for new spending are ever present. And, unlike the opposition, we understand that there is no free money lying around and that, wherever that money is going to be spent, it has to come from somewhere. We would welcome any suggestions or savings proposals from anybody in the general community. We would particularly welcome them from the opposition, if they can manage to stir themselves into a bit of activity and a bit of coherence for a change. We would welcome any savings suggestions that the opposition have to put. We have not actually seen any savings proposals yet, and we will work hard to ensure that we have a strong, continuing budget surplus that is putting downward pressure on inflation, downward pressure on interest rates and delivering to the Australian people in the long term the kind of economic prosperity that we are committed to delivering. That is what the Rudd government's budget and fiscal policy position is about, and it stands in stark contrast to the totally confused, chaotic, changing-every-five-minutes critique that we see from the opposition.</DOC>

 - On the question of fuel, we need to embrace a range of policies. The Assistant Treasurer before outlined the undertakings we gave prior to the last election on enhancing competition in the fuel industry and our implementation of those. And to those we have added our new policy in relation to FuelWatch. On the FuelWatch question, the honourable member refers to Sydney in particular. - The leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party, Barry O'Farrell, said:[FuelWatch] will also ease some of the wild fluctuations in weekly pricing which frustrate motorists so much _ This will ease the burden on families and pensioners by helping drive down petrol prices - this is Mr O'Farrell - FuelWatch will put motorists - not the oil companies - back in charge _ It will put an end the common frustration for motorists of driving past a petrol station only to find when they return hours later the price has jumped by ten cents a litre.Also, if you look at the New South Wales Liberal fair trading spokesman, Catherine Cusack -  - I find that remarkable from the Manager for Opposition Business, who said, I think, that this policy was copying Liberal policy. Is that what he was saying? And we have just had them say they are going to block this policy in the Senate! I can make neither head nor tail of where the Liberal Party stand on this matter, or any other matter on fuel policy. Divided on excise, now divided on FuelWatch. It will be remarkable to see what unfolds in the Senate.I say in response to the honourable member's question, New South Wales Liberal opposition fair trading spokesman, Catherine Cusack, said:[Labor] has shown leadership_ we think it's good news for motorists and we're quite happy -  - Again I return to the question asked by the honourable member, quoting the Liberal opposition fair trading spokesman in New South Wales, the state from which she comes. The spokesman said:[Labor] has shown leadership ... we think it's good news for motorists and we're quite happy to come out and congratulate the federal Labor government for doing it.If the Liberal Party cannot sort itself out within Canberra on where it stands on excise, it certainly cannot sort itself out nationally about where it stands on FuelWatch. I find it remarkable that those opposite could hold open the possibility of this measure being blocked in the Senate.The bottom line is that there is no silver bullet when it comes to petrol. We all believe that we need to help working families under financial pressure to the greatest extent we can in dealing with the pressures on the family budget, but we certainly do not have the view that those opposite had barely five or six months ago that working families have never been better off. We did not make an undertaking to the Australian people that interest rates would be kept at record lows. What we have said quite consistently is that we need to enhance what we can by way of competition policy. One statement after another the member for Higgins criticised us for putting forward those policies in opposition, saying that they were not sufficiently prescriptive on the future. Check the member for Higgins's statements on this in his transcripts. So I say to the honourable member that this will help at the margins. We do not wish to understate it and we do not wish to overstate it: it will help at the margins. But we think in terms of the experience of Western Australia it is the right way forward. Of course there will be conflicting advice on these questions, there will be conflicting evidence, there will be conflicting points of view. We, however, believe this is the right way forward. - If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition contests this policy, which is what she is doing, I presume she is saying the same directly and publicly to the state Liberal leadership in her own state of Western Australia.

 - I thank the member for Forde for that question. Today we have seen an important contribution to the education debate, a report by the Business Council of Australia on the vital question of teaching quality. Interestingly, the report proceeds from concern about where Australia has slipped to in international rankings. As a result of more than a decade of neglect by the former government, we have slipped in the international rankings which benchmark us against our competitors.The report focuses on the vital area of teacher quality. This is the question of how we get the best and brightest to go into teaching, how we then have quality teacher education in our universities, how we retain the best and brightest in front of Australian classrooms. This is an agenda that the government is already hard at work addressing. Earlier this year the government entered a historic partnership with state and territory governments right around the nation to work towards improved teacher quality. In the recent budget the government allocated $400,000 to a research project to provide a shared evidence base which will feed into that work between state and territory governments and the federal government. It is the end of the blame game when it comes to teacher quality. It is the end of the blame game and it is the start of action. Governments around the country are committed to ensuring that we enter a new national partnership on improving teacher quality by December this year, meaning that the first part of the new policies and plans developed to improve teacher quality could be in operation as soon as in the next school year. There is nothing more important to a child's education than the quality of the teachers in front of the classroom. As part of our education revolution, the Rudd Labor government is acting. Our policies will be costed, they will be well thought through, and they will be delivered in partnership with state and territory governments.Whilst the Liberal Party today has also welcomed the Business Council of Australia report, and I thank them for that, I am somewhat intrigued that, despite their welcoming of that report, they really do not have anything to say about more than a decade of neglect of the vital area of teacher quality. The current Liberal spokesperson for education said on 31 January this year, when talking about the issue of teacher quality, that it is 'not just a problem that has sprung up this week'. Never a truer word spoken. It was not a problem that had just sprung up in January; it is a problem that has been many years in the making. What has been the action or lack of action of the Liberal Party during those years in between? Interestingly, the Leader of the Opposition is a man who does not seem to be one who likes reviews. But when we actually look across the track record of the Liberal government on the vital area of teacher quality, what do we find? We find that the first review was announced in October 1996. What was done? Nothing effective was done. Then in 2002 the current Leader of the Opposition announced another review. Interestingly, when he decided he would announce publicly the outcome of that review, what was his policy for change? The policy for change was this, and I am going to quote it because it is so extraordinary:Perhaps it is also time to reinvigorate school mottos. Some schools do not even have one.The challenge of getting the best and brightest into teaching, the challenge of improving teacher education, the challenge of ongoing professional development, the challenge of rewarding excellence in teaching - and the Leader of the Opposition's solution? It would all be better if we had a school motto! Interestingly, in 2004, when he was responding to this review of 2002, plus the motto, he basically announced exactly the same things that he announced in his budget reply. Announced in 2004, nothing done, then re-announced in 2008. Doesn't this just sum up the attitude of the Liberal Party, whether in government or in opposition. It is a sorry tale of looking at a real problem, not being prepared to do the hard policy work to address it and coming up with a diversion or slogan like a school motto - the politics of the moment rather than the politics of the long term.But perhaps I am being too harsh on the question of the ability of school mottos to change behaviour. If the Leader of the Opposition is really committed to the question of mottos, then maybe he can start using some for the opposition itself. Maybe he can have embroidered on the pocket on the member for Mayo: 'Quidquid excusatio prandium pro,' which, of course, means, 'Any excuse for lunch.' Maybe that would be a useful motto! Or maybe on the pocket of the member for Wentworth, 'Disce pati' - 'Learn to endure'. In the meantime, the government will be getting on with the real work of changing teacher quality in this country.</DOC>

 - Families across the country, working Australians - those doing it tough - are suffering from high petrol prices. Therefore it is important that we provide those families and those individuals with whatever help we can through government. We have sought to do that through the budget and we have said, in the period subsequent to the budget, that we will also be examining other ways by which we may be able to assist families.The second thing I would say is in reference to the Henry commission - again, the one just ridiculed by the Leader of the Opposition, but the one now to be deployed by the Leader of the Opposition to inform his response to the question of long-term payments for those on retirement incomes and pensions. Leave that to one side. If the Leader of the Opposition is having difficulty recalling it, it is what the Leader of the Opposition said in his budget reply. On the question of the Henry commission, the terms of reference for this inquiry were launched by the Treasurer on budget day, from memory. They were laid out in clear and simple terms about the way in which we need to go. At the 2020 Summit, for example, the overwhelming call from business was: it is time the country had a comprehensive look at taxation. The overall taxation arrangements for the Commonwealth, when it goes to company tax, personal tax and the range of other taxation imposts on businesses in the community, need to be looked at, but looked at in a comprehensive manner which also factors in income support and retirement income. All of these things are part of a whole. Therefore, it was important for us to do this in a long-term, systematic, comprehensive manner as opposed to an approach which says: 'I've got a budget reply. I wonder what will be popular. I will pull something off the top shelf.' And then, within 24 hours, when asked - by the same Neil Mitchell, I seem to recall - 'Was this policy costed?' the answer was, 'No, we haven't costed it yet.' So I find it remarkable that those opposite could say that this approach of ours is somehow lacking in responsibility and theirs represents the reverse. The Henry commission will look at these matters over time. The Assistant Treasurer was quite explicit, well before the budget reply, about examining the impact and the interrelationship between GST and excise and will be looking at the recommendations of this commission on these matters and other taxation matters in the period ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for the question. It is something that he and many members on this side of the House are acutely interested in. Members, probably members from Sydney, would have had the opportunity to see an article in today's Sydney Morning Herald - others in the House may not have seen it - which published some findings from the latest Nielsen ScanTrack Liquor survey. The results of this industry survey show that since 2005 the growth in the white spirit - or light-coloured or clear spirit - ready-to-drinks, usually the vodka-based drinks targeted at girls and young women, have increased by 23 per cent. This is against a 15 per cent increase - still a large increase, I might add, but not quite as large as in those white spirit products - of the darker ready-to-drink products.Within this category, one of the worrying statistics provided in this research is that the highest growth has been in those products with the highest alcohol content - seven per cent and above. These worrying results back up the action taken by the Rudd government to tackle alcohol abuse and alcohol abuse by young women. So while the Leader of the Opposition and the member for North Sydney have been running around the country trying to talk this initiative down, research shows that they just do not know what they are talking about. In fact, only yesterday, the member for North Sydney tried to tell Barrie Cassidy on Insiders that the fact that rum based drinks were popular with older men meant that tackling alcopops growth was a bad idea. - I hope that, having read this article today and seeing this research, he is feeling just a little bit embarrassed about the comments that he made yesterday. - I understand why members opposite are a little bit touchy and a little bit embarrassed about this, because they have been absolutely all over the place. The member for North Sydney has been on radio saying:_ I don't think you should overplay it. Let's not go over the top.The Leader of the Opposition supported the measure; now he opposes it. In fact, there has recently been a single Liberal in the country who has actually spoken some sense on this issue. Perhaps I should take the House to the comments of Dr John Herron, the Chair of the Australian National Council on Drugs and a former senior Liberal minister, who wrote to the Prime Minister recently congratulating the government on the budget initiatives that were taken. In the letter, Dr Herron said:Utilising the taxation system is one of the most effective measures we have for reducing alcohol-related harm and problems for both individuals -  - I was asked to inform the House about this new research. The point I am trying to make is that it is going to take some work to inform those opposite about this research. Let me tell you one reason why. I have obviously underestimated the amount of time and effort it would take for us to inform not the public but those opposite of how important this was. The latest evidence for the flippant approach is from the member for Mayo. Two weeks ago the member for Mayo read a description of the effects of excessive drinking in the Sydney Morning Herald. The writer had sketched out this portrait:_ early on a Saturday morning, picking my way through vomit and broken glass _ I _ came upon _ 15 drunks fighting over a taxi. This was at 7 am _So inflamed by this description was the member for Mayo that he was moved to write to the Sydney Morning Herald, and on 16 May I came across his published letter, which read as follows, amongst other things:Mr Montgomery - the writer of the previous commentary - may have found drunks in Adelaide. If he wants a city without drunks, perhaps he should move to Riyadh.This is the sort of measure we have from the opposition - not a sensible tax measure to protect young women but sending everyone who worries about this issue off to Saudi Arabia. It is outrageous behaviour. We believe that this measure is an important measure to tackle binge drinking, which is affecting many young people, including young women. We think this tax measure will do more than try to send everybody off to Saudi Arabia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question and for his very real concern about what are extremely serious matters that have been brought to the public's attention in the programs that he highlights in his question. He also highlights what I think is the critical issue - which the police have also raised - which is the need for people to come forward with their evidence about these terrible allegations. The police cannot act unless they have evidence upon which to act, and so I would say to any member of the public who has evidence about these very serious matters that they should bring that evidence to the attention of the police so that people can be properly prosecuted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Firstly, on behalf of the Australian government can I again express condolences to the people of Burma for the terrible loss of life and the devastation caused by Cyclone Nargis. The situation, of course, remains grim. Official estimates are of over 78,000 dead, with other estimates of anywhere between 100,000 and 200,000 dead and UN estimates of anywhere between 1.5 million and 2.5 million Burmese people adversely affected.But we may be seeing some progress. Yesterday the ASEAN-UN international pledging conference was held in Rangoon to discuss Burma's and the international community's response to Cyclone Nargis. Australia was represented by the Parliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance, the member for Fraser, Mr McMullan. The government congratulates ASEAN and the UN for co-hosting this conference. We regard it as a positive step forward and a good example of constructive multilateral diplomacy.The conference was jointly chaired by the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, and the Singapore foreign minister, George Yeo - Singapore, of course, chairs ASEAN at this point in time - together with the Burmese Prime Minister, General Thein Sein. I think all members of the House will appreciate that effectively from day one the single biggest problem has been the Burmese regime's resistance to international assistance, in particular denying access for international expertise and international aid workers to the most adversely affected areas.The Australian government has used a range of diplomatic channels to persuade, both directly and indirectly, the Burmese regime to allow the international community to assist the people of Burma - for example, the Prime Minister has raised this matter in discussions with his counterparts from Indonesia, Singapore and Japan, together with the UN Secretary-General himself. And I have raised it similarly with foreign ministers from China, Japan, Indonesia and Great Britain. Our post in Rangoon - and posts elsewhere - have made similar representations both direct to the regime and to neighbouring countries.We welcome the unanimous agreement from the ASEAN-UN conference yesterday 'on the need to scale up urgently and very significantly the current relief efforts'. The Australian government very much believes that this is a correct analysis. We also strongly support the agreement from the conference yesterday of the indispensable requirement for a rapid joint UN-ASEAN assessment of recovery and assistance needs. We also welcome the agreement between the UN Secretary-General and the Burmese regime on increased access for international humanitarian workers, including the establishment of so-called logistical hubs in the most adversely affected areas. We regard this, as well, as a positive development and we look forward to these changes being implemented effectively.The government also welcomes the commitment of ASEAN - together with UN involvement - to coordinate and monitor the delivery of the international relief efforts. Australia, as the Australian public would expect and require, has been amongst the most generous of international donors. The government will provide $25 million in humanitarian assistance. At the conference yesterday Australia announced the offer of a specialist medical team to work in partnership on the ground with ASEAN medical teams. As well, members would recall that the Minister for Defence has announced that the Royal Australian Air Force will assist the World Food Program by transporting helicopters from South Africa for use in Burma. This follows upon the earlier delivery by the RAAF of a C17 aircraft containing over 30 tonnes of humanitarian supplies to Rangoon in the middle of May. We hope very much that the weekend shows a turning point in the Burmese regime's resistance to much needed international assistance. The government continues to examine what further options it can make available to the people of Burma but of course this will be predicated on the basis of the Burmese regime genuinely and truly opening up for international assistance in this humanitarian disaster.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. People in rural and regional Australia are doing it doubly tough when it comes to the cost of petrol. As a consequence, their concerns, as well as those of people in urban Australia who are struggling with the increasing cost of fuel, are important in our overall consideration of the support we should give those families and individuals into the future.What we have done in the budget package is to bring forward a $55 billion support package for families under financial pressure. That includes, of course, some $45 billion in taxation relief. If you add to that what we are doing by increasing the childcare tax rebate - which applies to rural Australia, regional Australia and metropolitan Australia - from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, you will see that also helps with the family budget. Add to that the education tax refund - a $4.4 billion program. It also assists in delivering some extra money to the hard pressed family budget bottom line.But I am first to say to the honourable member that there is no silver bullet on this matter. Therefore, these measures that we have introduced, we believe, provide some assistance. But as we have also indicated, we believe there are other measures which can be embraced into the future. That is why the government commissioned, on budget day itself, a wide-ranging, comprehensive, long-term review of how we best handle the tax, income support and retirement income policy into the future.We think that is an appropriate and responsible course of action. We think it is also a unified course of action on the part of the government, as opposed to the views of those opposite, who have five different positions now on the question of fuels policy - so much so that they now correspond with each other privately and publicly on this question, as the member for Wentworth helpfully did on budget day itself.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for that question. I know of his deep concern for fairness in the workplaces of the working families in his electorate. Today the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is holding its first formal public consultations into our award modernisation process. This is the important first step in creating simple, workable and modern awards for Australian employers and employees for the future.On this side of the parliament we have always believed that at work Australian workers should have a safety net on which they can rely and that awards are a vital part of that safety net. But, of course, awards need to be in a form for the modern economy. They need to be simple; they need to be fair; they need to be workable; they need to be flexible. We have asked the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to begin a process to modernise awards so that on 1 January 2010, when Labor's new workplace relations system is fully operational, there will be simple, modern awards on which Australian employers and employees can rely.This approach is a stark contrast to what has gone before. There was a period under the Howard government when there were attempts to simplify and rationalise awards. The first attempt to simplify awards came to nothing. It was a task that took too long and was ultimately a complete failure. The second attempt to rationalise awards actually did not get past the discussion paper stage, so nothing effective was done. But is it any surprise really that nothing effective was done to modernise awards when those opposite - who were in government and are now in opposition - do not believe in a safety net at work?Whilst of course there has been much discussion of the divisions between those opposite, they do not know who should stay and who should go - whether the member for Mayo and the member for Higgins should be in this parliament or be outside it. They do not know who should lead the Liberal Party, whether it should be the current leader, the member for Wentworth or the member for North Sydney. No doubt there will be other starters - maybe even the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. You never know. - On the question of how it differs from previous approaches, our belief in modern, simple awards goes hand in hand with our belief that Australian workers should have a safety net at work, which is a sharp contrast to those opposite, who effectively believe in no safety net. No matter who ends up leading the Liberal Party, the one thing they are united on, when they cannot be united on who should be in the parliament or who should lead their parliamentary party -  - We have a clear answer to the question we were seeking to have answered, haven't we: the one thing that unites them. I am sure the Australian people will be very pleased to learn about that. Of course, beyond what the member for North Sydney said, the other thing that unites them is a belief in industrial relations extremism and the removal of safety nets. Australians should not be misled by any of the statements that have been made by those opposite on the question of Work Choices, because now we have it confirmed out of the mouth of the Leader of the Opposition that Work Choices continues to be the policy of the Liberal Party when he said so very clearly: 'John Howard got it right on industrial relations.' So it is a political party divided on so much, a political party where we have seen the political partnership of Abbott and Costello now replaced by Laurel and Hardy here, a political party that does not know whether it is coming or going. The one thing that it does know is it believes in industrial relations extremism and Work Choices, and if they ever have the opportunity it would be back.</DOC>

 - I particularly thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. Today is a very significant day for all Australians. For 10 years now on 26 May we have paused and reflected on what I think many Australians recognise is a very blemished chapter in our nation's history: the forced removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families and their communities.What began as a recommendation in the Bringing them home report has become a day of real national significance. It is very pleasing that across the country, whether it is in the different cities and towns or in outer and remote parts of Australia, we have many, many different Australians participating in Sorry Day events. Here in Parliament House this morning, the Prime Minister unveiled a manuscript of the motion of apology, which will now remain on permanent display - and I thank the member for Warringah for joining us in that unveiling.On Sorry Day we also acknowledge the significance of this parliament's national apology to Indigenous Australians for what are now recognised as past injustices and mistreatment. When the Prime Minister offered the apology, he said it gave us the impetus:_ to deal with this unfinished business of the nation, to remove a great stain from the nation's soul and, in a true spirit of reconciliation, to open a new chapter in the history of this great land _The apology has also, I think, provided us with a very important part of the framework to enable us to deliver the very necessary practical, structural changes that are needed to see improvement in the lives of Indigenous Australians. We have set ourselves very, very tough and ambitious targets to close the life expectancy gap and to address child mortality, access to early education, educational attainment and employment outcomes. In the six months we have been in government we have in fact allocated $1.2 billion to this task - a task that is aimed at making communities safer, improving economic participation and including major programs of work for early childhood development, education, health, welfare reform, governance and leadership. It is really only through this major agenda for reform that we are going to see this gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples close.We do know that healing the hurt will not happen overnight. For many of the families of stolen generations, the process has only just begun. For many of them, we know, it will be a very long journey. They will need the support and understanding of all of us here, as well as from other Australians. Today, Sorry Day, is just one way that we can all help in that healing and in the healing of the nation.</DOC>

 - The government maintains a close working relationship with the mining sector and the resources sector in Australia. We have done so in the past; we will continue to do so in the future. Secondly, on the question of tax, those opposite have a clear set of priorities here. That is, when it comes to the taxation arrangements for condensate, taxation arrangements for luxury cars, taxation arrangements across the board, it seems that those opposite do not have their priorities right, and they need to get their priorities in order. -  - Yes.</DOC>

 - I think all members of the House, despite some of the rancour in the debate today, would agree that organisations like St Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army, Anglicare, you name it, are out there working really hard on behalf of the most disadvantaged Australians. Therefore, we believe that it is important to support those charities where we can. If you look at the competition for the charitable dollar across Australia, it is really hard; and, if you speak with those organisations, many of them are actually doing it very tough when it comes to raising the money they need to keep their operations going. -  - I am surprised that those opposite are objecting as if this is some sort of cynical debate about Australia's charities. These charities do a fantastic job. If you do not support what these charities do, put your hand up. Come on. These charities do a fantastic job. On top of that, if these charities were to suddenly withdraw from the field, the cost to the Australian taxpayer of filling the jobs that they currently do in critical sectors like aged care and caring for the homeless and disadvantaged, frankly, would be huge - leaving aside what is just the basic, decent human thing to do for those people out in the Australian community who need help.Out there in the community, the smart thing to do is to try and do what we can at a practical level to assist in their fundraising efforts. In a small but practical measure, the government has decided to make Kirribilli House in Sydney available to Australia's national charities, those with a national focus, to raise funds each year. What we intend to do is have the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet -  - I notice the member for O'Connor finds this objectionable. I find that remarkable. The government proposes to call for expressions of interest from the church and charitable sector and, as a consequence of that, offer Kirribilli House in the first year for up to 10 such events to raise funds for those charities. They will not be charged, of course, any rent or associated costs for the actual facilities. It will simply be on a cost basis in terms of running the actual function itself. This is a small but practical measure to use Kirribilli House to support some of our leading national charities in raising a dollar.When I look at those opposite who have interjected during the outlining of this proposal, I find it remarkable that they could be so cynical about a proposal like this when I seem to recall that Kirribilli House was used for other purposes by the previous government - other purposes, I think, associated with party fundraising. I think it would be good if there were a more generous spirit on the part of those opposite. And I have got to say to the Manager of Opposition Business that I was really disappointed in what he had to say before. I do not think it is really him when he stands up and says that the only thing that unites the Liberal Party is hatred - hatred for the Labor Party. I actually think we can do better in this House when it comes to debate. I would have hoped the Liberal Party could unite behind positive policies for the future rather than that sort of, I think, unnecessarily negative observation.The government is pleased to offer Kirribilli House for this purpose. We believe that our leading national charities deserve every level of support that can be provided. This is one small but practical measure to assist, and I would urge those opposite to provide it with simple bipartisan support. On that note, Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I think what the Australian people want of their government, and would be happy to have from their government, is responsible economic management. I think what the Australian people would want and be happy about is a government prepared to look to the long term rather than the short term. I think what they would be happy about is a government prepared to deliver a $22 billion surplus as opposed to those prepared to conduct a $22 billion raid on that surplus. Australian people understand that you must put downward pressure on interest rates and, through that, put downward pressure on inflation. That means ensuring that you have a responsible course of economic action. It also means that you are serious about the undertakings you have given to working Australians, working families, those doing it tough, about the cost-of-living pressures that they face, including rents, mortgage rates, child care, petrol, as well as grocery costs. Put all of those things together and families are under pressure. That is why this government has been so determined to implement this pre-election commitment of an assistance package for families in the order of $55 billion - including tax cuts, including a childcare rebate, and including, on top of that, an education tax refund - as well as payments in excess by a country mile of those delivered by those opposite in their last budget to both pensioners and carers. These are the practical measures that not only assist with delivering a decent bottom line for the overall budget surplus but also provide a decent outcome for working families so that they can deal with some of the pressures they face. This does not represent a silver bullet for their overall economic challenges and challenges to each week's budget; it does represent a helping hand on the way through. The reason we have commissioned the Henry commission of inquiry is to do just that: to look at long-term approaches to the reform of our taxes, to income support systems and, of course, to the retirement income system.</DOC>

 - The challenge of government is to make sure that you take the nation's long-term economic interests first and foremost as the necessary underpinnings, not just for the stability of the overall economy but to deliver the best set of circumstances for families, for people who are doing it tough out there in the general community. That is why what we have determined is an approach to budget management that has as its cornerstone a $22 billion surplus. That is the hallmark of economic responsibility. It also embraces within it a determination to ensure that those families - that is, working families, families under financial pressure, working Australians, those doing it tough - have the level of support from government that can assist them to deal with all of those cost-of-living pressures. On top of that is the determination for there to be a nation-building budget - unapologetically a nation-building budget - whereby we invest in this nation's long-term needs, and, rather than turn our back on health and hospitals, to invest in them by establishing a $10 billion health and hospitals reform fund. On top of that we have an $11 billion fund for education investment both for our TAFEs and for our universities and, on top of that, a $20 billion fund, a Building Australia Fund, to do something about the overall state of this nation's economic infrastructure, including those suffering from urban congestion. These are the hallmarks of responsible economic management: ensuring that you have a decent budget surplus, making sure that what you can do for working families is sustainable and honours your pre-election commitments to do so, and, on top of that, investing in the country's long-term economic future.I will tell you what the hallmark of economic irresponsibility is: to conduct a $22 billion raid on the surplus and then, on top of conducting that $22 billion raid, to turn around and say, 'We don't know where the money's coming from;' to turn around and say, 'We haven't actually costed our budget reply;' to turn around and say, when asked where the $22 billion comes from, 'We don't really know; it might come from the surplus.' Spokesperson after spokesperson has said, 'Well, we are not actually sure where this $22 billion is going to come from.' Let me tell you what $22 billion adds up to in terms of economic irresponsibility. It adds up to this: $22 billion worth of further pressure on overall inflation and therefore, as a consequence, $22 billion worth of further pressure on activity in the economy, which leads through to interest rates, which affect working families. We on this side of the House understand the ingredients of responsible economic management. Those opposite understand full well, it seems, the ingredients of irresponsible management. They cannot make up their mind on inflation, they cannot make up their mind on means-testing, they cannot make up their mind on whether or not there is an economic case for reducing government spending, and they cannot make up their mind on whether or not they are going to have a 5c excise reduction because they are split down the middle on that. Above all, they have absolutely no capacity to deliver on any of the above, and they had 12 years in office to do so.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member's question, and for those in regional and rural Australia as well as in our cities, I draw her attention to the report delivered by the ACCC on the implementation of a response to the petrol price inquiry. What I find interesting about this document is that it was commissioned not by this government; it was actually commissioned by the previous government. In fact, the document was commissioned in June 2007 by the member for Higgins. So I turn to page 247 of this document, which says as follows:The main finding from this econometric analysis is that the average of the price margin reduced by a statistically significant amount for Perth relative to the eastern capitals in the time since the introduction of FuelWatch. The relevant weekly average price margin was around 1.9 cpl less on average for the period from January 2001 to June 2007 than for the period from August 1998 to December 2000.Further it goes on:These results are robust to using monthly averages rather than weekly averages. This reduces further any influence of weekly price cycles. A decrease of around 1.9 cpl -  - The rest of the paragraph I was reading from, which is part of a report written in consequence to a request delivered by the member for Higgins on the part of the previous government, provides the factual basis for the policy upon which we have proceeded.The results are also robust to using the low points of the week's prices rather than simple weekly average prices. Here the indicative decrease was smaller at around 0.9 cpl on average.Those are the findings in this document of several hundred pages, and the government stands by these findings. It is on this evidentiary basis that the government has decided to proceed with this policy on Fuelwatch. We regard that as an appropriate policy setting for the future. We also have said consistently that there is no silver bullet when it comes to fuel prices and we have said it consistently, including at the time that this policy was launched. I tell you what is responsible in terms of saying to the Australian people -  - So the government in framing its policy on Fuelwatch is entirely mindful of the conclusions of this report commissioned by the gentleman who now sits temporarily up the back and who is incrementally seeking to work his way down to the front. The government stands by this report and the conclusions which were reached in it, and it is on this basis that we formed a policy.In terms of irresponsible guarantees, let me tell you where you find irresponsible guarantees. The Australian people are sick and tired of irresponsible guarantees by politicians, like the one which said 'let us keep interest rates at record lows'. That is an irresponsible guarantee from central casting, a guarantee which you are incapable of delivering. Prior to the election our commitments on this were absolutely clear-cut, to increase competition policy arrangements for these price arrangements, and we intend to abide by them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The government has delivered a responsible budget carefully designed to fight inflation and to also invest in the future. It is a budget that brings spending back under control -  - and that begins the vital task of building supply capacity. We have provided the funds for long-term investment in infrastructure, education, training, health and hospitals. We have built a very strong surplus and we are banking upward revenue surprises. - We have reined in spending growth, which was four per cent under the member for Higgins. And every single dollar in new spending in 2008-09 is one that comes from savings. There has not been a single saving from those opposite as they have gone about blowing a $22 billion hole in the surplus. Those opposite are simply spendaholics - a $22 billion hole in the surplus. They are spendaholics; they cannot help it. Old habits die hard: $40 billion spent by the member for Higgins at the last budget and not one dollar of savings. They are absolutely shameless, because that sort of spending has put upward pressure on inflation and, of course, upward pressure on interest rates. Not one dollar of savings was produced in the shadow Treasurer's reply at the Press Club. There were no costed policies, no indication of what they would do to meet their commitments. As I watched the shadow Treasurer at the Press Club, I thought, 'Who does this remind me of?' as he was up there, all front and no substance. I said, 'I've got it. It's Andrew Peacock but without the suntan!'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been widespread community support for the government's approach on this, starting with the leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party, Barry O'Farrell, who said that Fuelwatch would put motorists, not the oil companies, back in charge. That is before you go on to the New South Wales Liberal opposition fair trading spokeswoman, Catherine Cusack, who says that Labor has shown leadership on this question. The CEO of Choice magazine, Peter Kell, says that Choice would strongly support -  - Choice magazine said that they would strongly support the introduction of a national scheme based on the WA FuelWatch model by the government. Then the NRMA president, Alan Evans, said -  -  - Of course all these folk are irrelevant to the general debate, I presume! The President of the NRMA says:Our research this shows that FuelWatch is of benefit to motorists and if introduced in the eastern states then they will get the benefits of the people in the West who have been receiving that benefit for some years.Then you have David Moir, Executive Manager Advocacy, RACWA, who says:Our recommendations to the commission - that is, the petrol price inquiry - are that the FuelWatch system is not only maintained in WA but a similar system is adopted in other states.If you look at this range of comments it is quite clear that there is a huge array of support for the scheme across the country.As I said in response to a question yesterday, there is obviously going to be conflicting information and advice on this. We understand that. We said that before, we said it again yesterday and I will say again today. That is because we are moving in an area where the Liberal state government of Western Australia decided to move in the year 2000 and then subsequent to that we have had recommendations from these bodies for this action to be taken nationally. We have always said that there is no silver bullet on petrol, but we have also said that, if you look at the evidence produced in this lengthy inquiry of several hundred pages, commissioned by the member for Higgins - he who seeks to return, we think, to the frontbench, depending on whether he beats the member for Mayo to the frontbench - if you look at page 247 of this report and its conclusions on the net impact on price, which is over the period survey of 2001-07 a net impact on price of 1.9 cents per litre less, then this provides a basis for a reasonable course of action. But, as we said on the day that we launched this policy, it does not represent a silver bullet. It does, however, help competition policy at the margins.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for her question. As a Western Australian member, she well understands the benefits of Fuelwatch, as did the Liberal Party in Western Australia when they introduced the scheme, and as does the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales. Fuelwatch brings increased competition to the petrol market by requiring petrol stations to notify the ACCC of their next day's price at 2 pm every day, forcing petrol stations to pick their cheapest, best price in order to ensure that they get turnover in an industry which relies so strongly on turnover. As I said yesterday, one of the great benefits of Fuelwatch is that it enables consumers to find the cheapest petrol. The difference between the cheapest and the most expensive petrol in any given city can be 10c, 20c or 30c a litre quite regularly. This enables motorists to find that cheap petrol where at the moment they have absolutely no chance of finding the cheap petrol as they drive around the city looking for it.At the moment, of course, this is all a one-way street. At the moment petrol stations and oil companies share information. They share their pricing information and motorists and consumers are not allowed to see it. This is a very important point and it is a point that the ACCC made some very interesting findings on in their significant report. This is what they had to say in their petrol report, which was released last December:The direct exchange of price information between suppliers is conducive to anti-competitive coordination ...They went on to say:... the circulation of price data on a very frequent, or near real time basis, raises concerns that it could be promoting anti-competitive behaviour among the refiner-marketers and supermarket chains in the retail market.So the ACCC said that we have a situation which is conducive to anticompetitive coordination. Any party which chooses to oppose Fuelwatch in this parliament is saying that they support a situation which allows anticompetitive coordination. They support a situation which means that motorists are locked out of the information which petrol stations share with each other. As the Prime Minister indicated, there is considerable evidence based on the findings of the ACCC that FuelWatch in Western Australia has put downward pressure on prices - by a modest amount, but downward pressure nevertheless.Some members opposite, the Leader of the Opposition in particular, have questioned whether those benefits are available to people who buy only on Tuesdays, only on the cheaper days of the week. It is a fair enough question for analysis. The ACCC found that their analysis was robust every day of the week. Regardless of when people buy, they found downward pressure on prices. Perhaps it was put a little more eloquently and a little more colourfully by the shadow minister for fair trading in New South Wales, who said this about the claims of honourable members opposite - this is a good one; wait for it: 'My federal colleagues appear to be unaware of what's going on in the Sydney market.' It is those opposite she is talking about. This is Catherine Cusack, the shadow minister for fair trading in New South Wales. - Is she a supporter of yours or not, Joe? She said, 'My federal colleagues appear to be unaware of what is going on in the Sydney market. They're having to buy petrol more than once a week.' I hazard a guess it is in more places than Sydney that you need to buy petrol more than once a week. That is what Catherine Cusack said. - So we have the ACCC and the Liberal Party in New South Wales in complete agreement. All we need to close the circle is the agreement of honourable members opposite. Another matter raised by the putative leader of the opposition, the member for Wentworth, is the effect on independent retailers - a concern as to whether independent retailers are disadvantaged under Fuelwatch. Again, if you read the ACCC report and you read the submissions to the ACCC, you find that the proportion of independent retailers in the fuel market in Western Australia under FuelWatch has gone up - not down. So the concerns of honourable members opposite would be assuaged if they read the ACCC's report or may be assuaged when they receive their briefing from the ACCC. The key question here is: why do the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and other members opposite appear to support an arrangement which is conducive to anticompetitive conduct and anticompetitive coordination?I understand that there is scepticism from honourable members opposite. The Western Australian motoring organisation RACWA, which is well known to honourable members from Western Australia, has supported FuelWatch and it is the motoring organisation which has worked with FuelWatch for the last eight years. This is what Mr David Moir, Executive Director of RACWA, said:We believe that consumer pressure is the best to keep the market competitive, but that relies on transparency and easily available price information.Our recommendations to the commission are that the FuelWatch system is not only maintained in Western Australia, but adopting a similar system in other states...It is time for the opposition to indicate whether they will stand with motorists against anticompetitive conduct or stand with those with vested interests. - Mr Speaker, I was quoting from the ACCC report, which I table.</DOC>

 - I think a WA member would be well advised to listen to the comments which have come from the WA motoring association. The WA motoring association's point of view is very clear. David Moir, Executive Manager for Member Advocacy for the RACWA, put this view to the ACCC inquiry public hearing on 28 August when he said -  - This is someone from your own state. He said:We believe that consumer pressure is the best to keep the market competitive, but that relies on transparency and easily available price information.A Member may raise a point of order with the Speaker at any time. After the question of order has been stated to the Speaker by the Member rising ...Clearly, the member for North Sydney just stood and said, 'I have a point of order,' and you sat him down. I think it is fair to say that you need to hear the point of order stated before you can sit a member down. - If the honourable member from Western Australia would reflect on what the head of his own state motoring organisation has said on FuelWatch, it would be a very useful advance to the debate. The reason, I presume, that people support Fuelwatch is based not just on the positions plucked out of space by those opposite but on the findings based on detailed econometric analysis by the ACCC. Of course, each one of those opposite knows better than this econometric analysis. Despite the fact that those opposite commissioned this volume, despite the fact that taxpayers' dollars were spent in putting this volume together, despite the fact that Graeme Samuel, the appointee of those opposite, ultimately produced a finding which contains the conclusions I have just referred to about the price being 2c a litre down, on average - despite all of that - those opposite, as some practice, process or expression of ideology, say it is of no relevance whatsoever.The honourable member raised a question about the cost impost on business. The honourable member may not be aware that currently a large number of petrol stations are now submitting their prices to a data collection company. This can be as frequently as every 15 minutes. In exchange for a fee, petrol companies have access to their competitors' prices. As the Assistant Treasurer said before, apart from anything else this places those in the petrol industry, including the retailers, in a position of competitive advantage over motorists, because motorists do not have access to that amount of information. So what we have from the party of free enterprise opposite is an argument which says that those in the petrol industry - the petrol majors and retailers - should control all the price sensitive information and that consumers out here should not have access to that information. That constitutes the essence of the proposition which underpins Fuelwatch. Under FuelWatch, petrol stations need only submit one price every day to the ACCC and not be charged for it. There is a plain contrast between the two. The contrast here between our position and that of those opposite is pretty stark. We are simply saying, 'Here is a -  - The contrast between the two positions here in this parliament is pretty clear. On the one hand, we say that consumers should have some power; they on that side of the chamber say the consumer should have no power. We on this side of the chamber say that, if this succeeds in bringing down the price by 2c a litre on average over time to the consumer, it is worth backing; they say on that side of the chamber it is not worth backing. We say on this side of the chamber that, if you have got price variations within one market of between 15c and 20c per day, which has pertained in recent days in various parts of metropolitan Australia, the consumer should have the opportunity to make a choice about where they go to buy their fuel; those opposite say the consumer should have no such choice and no such information upon which to base that choice. We stand for transparency; those opposite stand for nontransparency. We stand for choice; they stand for nonchoice. I say this to those opposite: when the question has been posed - including to the leadership aspirant of the Liberal Party, the member for Wentworth - about which way the Liberal Party will vote on this in the parliament, the response on the part of the opposition is, 'We don't know.' They are so committed to this proposition which they are debating in the parliament that they have not even formed a position about whether they are going to support the legislation - yes or no. The position we have put is clear cut: 2c; 15c to 20c variation; transparency; consumer choice. They stand for not giving the consumers that choice. Those opposite need to resolve once and for all whether they are going to support this legislation or not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question, because this is a government that delivers for working families and those doing it tough. We put down a budget that tips the scales in favour of working families and those doing it tough, and those opposite neglected them for a decade. As a result of this budget, low- and middle-income earners will have more money in their pockets.Let's take the tax cuts. For the first time in a long time, low- and middle-income earners will benefit most from the personal income tax cuts, unlike what occurred over previous years under the member for Higgins. Let's take the example of a couple earning $70,000 a year. A couple earning $70,000 a year will have a combined extra $40 in their pay cheque each week from 1 July. That will help with the rising costs of living.Let's move on to child care. There is an increase in the reimbursement of out-of-pocket childcare costs to 50 per cent. Those opposite paid it in arrears at 30 per cent. They were not concerned about the cost of living while they were doing that. In fact what they were doing was attacking the living standards of those on low and middle incomes. Do we remember what they were doing with Work Choices or what they did to working families, with interest rate rise after interest rate rise after interest rate rise? They have gone very quiet now because the Australian people remember their record.We are delivering assistance to working families and those doing it tough because of the rising cost of living and we are proud to have been able to do that - absolutely proud. All that those on the other side of the House could do was lecture working families about how they had never been better off. We do understand the impact of the cost of living on families, which is why we have moved decisively in this budget to tip the scales towards working families and those doing it tough.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question from the member for Wentworth because it goes to: how do we make the federation work? How do we make the federation work in those areas which mean something to working Australians and working families right across our nation? What it goes to is what sort of education system we are going to have - one where we simply buck-pass one to the other? It has gone on for too long. What sort of health system are we going to have - one where we just buck-pass to one another? What sort of climate change arrangements are we going to have? We have conflicting state and federal emissions trading regimes or renewable energy schemes. We say that what we want to have is a regime in which we have a cooperative federal arrangement with the states which has one objective: delivering a decent outcome for people who consume government services.I think those opposite have not quite caught up with the 21st century. People are sick and tired and have had a gutful of politicians pointing the finger at each other between federal, state and local governments saying, 'not my responsibility', 'not my responsibility', 'not my responsibility'. That is why we have said through COAG that we intend over the course of 2008 to have a work program which deals with education, which deals with health, which deals with climate change and each one of these matters. -  - When it comes to the business community the clear-cut cry of business across this nation is, 'Let's move to a point where we have a genuinely seamless national economy.' Let's move to a point where our businesses are not confronted with one set of state regulations after another which conflict right down the scale to the smallest things and up to the largest things, making it very difficult and very costly for a small to medium sized business that wants to operate across state boundaries. That is why, again through COAG, in the spirit of cooperative federalism, what we are trying to do is to bring about a practical program, through the minister for small business and his state counterparts, on how you make it better for business nationwide.Right now we have 27 items of legislation before us which have conflicting state and federal arrangements which we are working our way through methodically. So, whether it is those consuming TAFE services, those consuming early childhood services, those consuming health and hospital services, the business community having to deal with their regulatory environment or those who are trying to deal with these conflicting state arrangements on emissions trading and renewable energy, it is time to fix the federation.I would appeal to the constructive spirit of those opposite to say: what is a positive way forward to deal with these things? I remind them again that they had 12 long years in office to act in these areas. Instead, they did not prefer to come up with practical, positive solutions. Their approach was this: the best thing to do is simply blame the states because it makes for a good political outcome.On the question of tax, the Henry commission of inquiry quite legitimately examines the entire raft of taxation, and that was contained and made explicit in the Treasurer's statement on budget day itself. Of course, the taxation arrangements as they impact on the states will be considered in that context as well. You can do this on a comprehensive, long-term basis. And remember the call of business? They have not had a decent, all-round review of the tax system for a quarter of a century. You were in office for 12 years. What we now have is a proposal to do precisely that. Six months into our government we have a program of action on this. For 12 years those opposite sat there, dithered, did nothing - including the smiling member for Higgins, who cannot make up his mind whether he wants to be here or here or elsewhere. They had 12 years to fix these matters, even to put their shoulder to the wheel. They neglected to do so because instead they saw the politics of the blame game as better suiting their political project. We have a different approach.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question, and I know he is deeply concerned about education and training in his electorate. The recent budget delivered $19.3 billion for education, skills and training - $11 billion of it in the form of our new Education Investment Fund. Some $1.9 billion was delivered directly for skills, and vocational education and training providers will have access to the $11 billion Education Investment Fund. We needed to make investments of this mammoth nature because by world standards the education system of this country is falling behind, and we face a skills crisis. The legacy of the former government to the nation in education and training has been a system falling behind the standards of the world and a skills crisis. In the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition they have the people who were personally in charge of these matters for half of the period of the Howard government, so they are uniquely, personally responsible for Australia falling behind the rest of the world and facing a skills shortage. The fact that we face a skills shortage was verified by the member for Goldstein, who in the same statement verified that this was basically from neglect. Last year, the member for Goldstein told an industry group, and this is a very revealing quote:Â ... we've got a problem with skill shortage. ... I mean we knew it was coming but it has arrived with a force. ... And you know, it's only going to get worse. - He was a government minister who thought he was a spectator on a problem, rather than having any responsibility for the delivery of a solution. - Where members opposite failed, the Rudd Labor government is delivering on skills and education. We are delivering on skills and education because we know this is a capacity constraint on the economy that is putting upwards pressure on inflation and interest rates. If members opposite doubt the veracity of this advice then they may choose to consult the current chief of staff of the Leader of the Opposition, who said when he was the head of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 2004, 'A recent survey of investor confidence in Australia revealed the No. 1 threat to future investment was the availability of suitably qualified staff.'Mr Hendy had it right back then in 2004. It was a criticism of the former government, who did not do enough in this area to prevent a skills crisis. We are certainly working on this area. In particular, we delivered in April this year 20,000 new training places, the first of 630,000 training places to be delivered by this government. I am pleased to report that, with these 20,000 training places being delivered, the first 500 graduates will be finished their training and be ready to start work in June. Encouragingly, there has been uptake in skill shortage areas targeted by the program, including aged care and child care. -  - I have just had mining raised and I will give you the answer in a second; I do not think it is going to be the answer you are expecting. There are currently more than 3,500 people enrolled in these training places, with more than 200 signing up each day. We have already 400 registered training organisations delivering more than 550 qualifications in 980 sites around Australia, including 145 people undertaking qualifications of importance to the mining and construction industries. These are the most recent up-to-date figures about the delivery of these 20,000 training places, the first of 630,000 training places to come.This record of achievement and delivery in the first six months of this government stands in stark contrast to what came before. Of course you cannot fix the skills crisis overnight. We have never suggested that you could, but we have hit the ground running with these 20,000 training places out there, with Australians now getting the benefit of that training in areas that matter to skill shortages and capacity constraints. This is simple economics. If skills are short and if businesses cannot fill jobs, that leads to an economic constraint on growth. We are all about lifting that economic constraint. We are all about dealing with the inflation and interest rate challenges. In contrast, members on the other side do not even know whether they believe inflation exists. On the day that they do concede inflation exists, they have got no idea how to deal with it. Their only economic strategy is a $22 billion smash-and-grab raid on the surplus, which would put upwards pressure on inflation and interest rates. This is a party that is now joined together by three things. Helpfully, the member for North Sydney told us yesterday they are united around hatred for the Labor Party - nothing about working Australians or looking after them, but hatred of the Labor Party - they are united around Work Choices and, as we now know post budget, they are united around economic irresponsibility. - Yes, Mr Speaker. - Yes, it is.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. On the question of policy debate within the government, as I said yesterday, there are always going to be conflicting views. I would have thought that a healthy policy debate in the cabinet -  - the member for Mayo comes in on cue - would have been had in their cabinet prior to their decision to invade Iraq. I think actually having an exchange of views and having a debate where you have a complete embrace of different points of view is the way to go. We are actually pretty relaxed about having a debate which has different points of view. We do not seek to suppress different points of view. We encourage debate; we actually like debate. We are not in the business of suppressing debate as those opposite did on the question of -  - the Iraq war -  - and on the question of climate change and on the question of all those matters which went through the cabinet of the dearly departed Howard government - all those matters where there was not a free and frank debate and where there was one predetermined outcome and one predetermined outcome alone. And off they went to war without thinking about it. Off they went for a decade of inertia on climate change without thinking about it. Off they went in multiple directions without thinking about it.To return to the honourable members question about Sydney, again I would draw her attention to the findings in the document I am holding. This document was commissioned by the member for Higgins back in June last year when he was Treasurer of the Commonwealth. Presumably those opposite, including the honourable member, were becoming concerned about petrol prices back then so they decided at five minutes to midnight that they had better do something about it. So they commissioned Graham Samuel and the ACCC to investigate the price of petrol in Australia and what could be done about it. Then they produced some analysis - and I draw this to the attention in particular of the honourable member who has asked the question - which goes to the difference between the price in Perth and in all the other metropolitan centres on the east coast, and that would include Sydney as well. As a consequence, they reached a conclusion that there be a two per cent differential over time. That is their analysis and that is why we proceeded on that basis.Furthermore, when this was presented as a way ahead - that is, a way in which to intelligently respond to the whole challenge of how we price petrol in the future - what did the member for Higgins say at the time? He said:... the ACCC is an independent market regulator which has more expertise in the area of access and pricing than any other federal government instrumentality or agency and that is why it is very important that it is engaged in all of these pricing issues.That is what is important here: evidence based policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Members would of course be aware that on 29 March both parliamentary and presidential elections were conducted in Zimbabwe. Regrettably, the presidential results were not finally published until 2 May and now a scheduled second-round run-off is listed for 27 June, some three months after the original parliamentary and presidential elections on 29 March. That is three months where we have seen the brutal Mugabe regime firstly seeking to rort an election through counting means and now seeking to perpetrate intimidation and violence during the second-round election on 27 June. Australia remains very concerned that we will not see anything near a full, free and fair election in Zimbabwe. Members would of course be aware that under the Zimbabwe constitution and electoral laws this second-round run-off ought to have been held within three weeks of the first round, not three months subsequent to it.The Australian government has been very active both in the international community and in Africa in making these points strongly to Zimbabwe's neighbours, particularly members of the African Union and the Southern African Development Community states. I have spoken variously to my counterparts from South Africa, Zambia and Tanzania and to the Vice-President of Botswana. I have of course also been in regular contact with the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, which, like Australia, shares an interest in Zimbabwe as a member of the Commonwealth.The Australian government of course welcomes very much the recent announcement by SADC, the Southern African Development Community, that it will substantially increase the number of election observers for the forthcoming 27 June presidential run-off. As I have indicated publicly on any number of occasions, Australia stands ready, willing and able to also supply election observers if we are so asked. Frankly, I do not think that request will come, because the brutal Mugabe regime has made it clear that it is not proposing to seek any assistance from those nation states that have been critical of the process.Hopefully the return of the opposition leader, Mr Tsvangirai, for the next six weeks for the purposes of the election campaign will be a new stage in this electoral process. We hope very much that Zimbabwe's neighbouring states will bring as much pressure to bear as they can on the regime to lead us somewhere towards the chance for a free and fair election in Zimbabwe.I have indicated to the House that Australia's offer of election observers is there. Members would of course be aware that Australia, under governments of both political persuasions, has always made the point that we make a contribution so far as humanitarian assistance is concerned to the people of Zimbabwe, whether it is food or other humanitarian assistance, and this of course is ongoing. Our attitude to that is not in any way deterred by the actions or the attitude of the brutal Mugabe regime. The Australian government remains very concerned. We hope there is some prospect of improvement so far as the Zimbabwe situation is concerned, and we stand ready, willing and able to render assistance if so asked by Zimbabwe, the African Union or the Southern African Development Community states.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. People in regional Australia, such as in the area of Sale and Wonthaggi, which the honourable member has just referred to, like those across the country, are doing it tough with petrol prices and the general cost of living. -  - The interjection was, 'Why didn't you do something?' Petrol prices since 2001, when those opposite made an adjustment to the excise, have gone up by about 50 per cent. We have been in office for five or six months. They were in office for 12 years. From 2001 to 2007 strikes me as being about six years. What did those opposite do in those six years on petrol prices? What did they do on excise? What did they do on GST? What did they do on competition policy? What did they do with a petrol price commissioner? What did they do on any of these matters to empower consumers? Answer: zero, zero, zero and zero. So after 12 years in office and six years since the adjustment in 2001 there has been not a single piece of action. This is so very consistent with what those opposite say about any matter of public debate in this parliament. They say that in six months this government is responsible for attending to all the matters which they left unattended for a decade-plus. I find it remarkable.Turning to rural and regional Australia, the impact of petrol prices there is significant because people travel longer distances. That is why it is very important that the government does everything it can to ensure that - through our family support package delivered through the budget, our payments of $900 in excess of those delivered in the previous Howard government to seniors, our $500 delivered in excess of other payments and, on top of that, $2,100 delivered in excess of payments to those in receipt of carers allowance and carers payments - we use measures that are designed to assist families and to assist individuals under financial pressure. Of course, when you look at the added pressure which comes with petrol prices and add that to grocery prices and the others, it is very tough to make the budget balance. But our response as a responsible government is to make sure that we are delivering through the tax system, delivering through child care, delivering through the education tax refund and delivering through enhanced payments to pensioners and carers - and ensuring that we have done all these things in a responsible economic manner.On top of that, looking to the long term, we have undertaken, for the first time in a quarter of a century plus, a comprehensive commission of inquiry into the tax income support and retirement income system. That is the responsible way to go. The irresponsible way to go is to say, 'I've got a budget reply coming up; I'll reach up on to the shelf, pluck something down, call it a 5c excise arrangement,' then say the next day that you have not costed it, and then add to it the fact that you have the member for Flinders, the member for Higgins, the member for Mayo and the member for wherever else opposed to this particular measure. That is not an alternative policy; that is a piece of short-term retail politics to get you over the hump of the budget reply. We have a responsible course of action on this and we are determined to implement it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. From the outset I take this opportunity, through the parliament, to welcome to Australia the some 650 delegates who have commenced their arrival in Australia for the FIFA Congress. I would also like to note and welcome the almost 2,000 observers and media representatives who will join them. This FIFA world congress is a prestigious and very important gathering which has never before been hosted by Australia and is being held at the Sydney Opera House. It is, in fact, international football's biggest off-field event and a significant opportunity for us to showcase Australia. Last night I had the opportunity to meet with the President of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, and the FIFA executive committee. I informed President Blatter that the Rudd government is committed to the growth of world football in Australia and I outlined -  -  - how the federal government recently honoured our election commitment and invested some $32 million into the sport, which was double the amount that had been pledged by the previous government. - Our government recognises that world football - soccer to some - has experienced enormous growth rates in participation. - We want to support and further enhance the amazing transformation of the sport in Australia. As a government with a very deep commitment to preventative health, and as a government that is adamant about the need for us to address obesity rates, we note that there has been a 22 per cent increase in registered players in the sport in just the last five years. We also particularly note the rates of young girls who are playing football. The $32 million which we invested in the budget will be spent on a number of projects that will assist Australia's soccer players, all the way from the grassroots level to the Socceroos. We want to help along the way the new Harry Kewells and Scott McDonalds of the future.Of course, our government has also indicated our willingness to work with the FFA to back Australia's bid for the 2018 World Cup. We are also backing the FFA's attempts to bring the 2009 and 2010 Club World Championships to Australia, and the 2015 Asian Cup. I will attend a number of FIFA and FFA functions this week, and I am pleased also to note that the PM will be addressing the world congress. I note the comments of those opposite and I hope that I can speak on behalf of the whole parliament in saying that we wish our FIFA guests an enjoyable stay this week. We trust that they will be impressed by our capabilities to host large-scale events and we hope that we can continue to host them in a number of capacities into the future.</DOC>

 - Responsible economic management means that you do something about ensuring that you have got a reasonable surplus, and those opposite have not had one thing to say about where they are going to find $22 billion worth of savings. Where are they? Where are the savings? -  - I do not hear anything. On the doorstep what they say is, 'Let's raid the surplus.' That is a sure-fire recipe for doing one thing: putting upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates - and that flows through to all families and all people with mortgages and businesses across the country. On the question of dealing with the tax matters raised by the Leader of the Opposition, as I said, there is one way of handling the reform of tax and that is to do something which has not been done in more than a quarter of a century, and that is a comprehensive review which deals with the tax system and income support as well as retirement income.On the question of the competitive dimensions of what is proposed, if the Leader of the Opposition were serious about analysing the responses of those who head the motoring organisations of Australia - the NRMA as well as the RAC in WA and others - what you have is a clear-cut statement that you have either a set of arrangements that puts the power in the hands of consumers or a set of arrangements which puts the powers in the hands of the petrol industry. We stand for empowering the individual motorist, the individual consumer; those opposite stand for the reverse.On the question of budget measures, they have been put in a responsible economic framework and, as we have said consistently, we will continue to examine further measures to assist working Australians and working families under financial pressure. That is the right thing to do. It is the responsible thing to do. You do it with an economic framework. You do not pull out a budget reply one night and say on radio 12 hours later that you did not bother to cost it. That is the recipe for economic responsibility, and those opposite have shredded what remains of their credibility.</DOC>

 - It is very interesting that this question is posed in the absence of the alternative Prime Minister. On the question of condensate, the measure -  -  - I do not think that was the coup d'etat arrangement. Wasn't it supposed to be Wentworth and not Curtin? On the condensate arrangement, it was actually instituted back then in order to provide encouragement for the industry to start with. That is the first point. Secondly, that is quite a long time ago, and since that time the industry has not only become profitable and been established; if you look at the return to the industry concerned, its actual profits in recent years have been not just in the hundreds of millions of dollars but in the billions of dollars.What this seeks to do is to actually close a tax loophole which has existed for a long, long time and, furthermore, to use those taxation measures to underpin the robustness and the financial integrity of this budget, with its $22 billion surplus, which is necessary as an instrument of economic responsibility. What we have witnessed in this chamber just now with this debate and this vote is quite remarkable. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition -  - As I said, these measures close a loophole which has long existed. I suggest that those opposite look at the original rationale for the measure in question, which is to do with the establishment of this industry in the first place, and then look secondly at the actual returns which those companies are generating by way of profit now. Given their preferential taxation treatment, I have a simple response: let's use that revenue to assist families under pressure; let's use that revenue to start doing something about investing in the schools of Western Australia; let's use that revenue to invest in the hospitals of Western Australia; let's close a tax loophole that in fact can deliver revenue to the overall integrity also of the budget. This debate has been quite extraordinary, because those opposite have just voted against FuelWatch. - Oh, they say, no, they have not voted against FuelWatch! I take the interjection from the Manager of Opposition Business, where he says they did not vote against FuelWatch. He has just said they have not -  - One of the great principles of politics in this place for the Manager of Opposition Business is: the greater the volume the lesser the content. What we have had most recently is a complete tactical implosion on their side of the House. They know what has happened. They moved their censure motion, we moved a substantive amendment and we asked them to vote one way or the other on supporting this fuel tax measure -  -  - On the question of condensate, it is quite clear where our position lies - that is, that that revenue stream should be delivered to assist working families, including in ensuring that that money we have allocated to the establishment of national FuelWatch, some $20 million, can be delivered from an appropriate and secure revenue stream for the Commonwealth. The Manager of Opposition Business said they have not just voted against FuelWatch. That is exactly what he said. - When I said before that those opposite had voted against FuelWatch, the interjection from the Manager of Opposition Business was: 'No, we haven't.' That is what we all heard over here. Now he gets to his feet with great gusto and says, 'No, I didn't say that.' What is the position of those opposite? You are not opposing FuelWatch; it is just that you are not supporting it. - It is an arduous task, given the level of interjection and the number of interjections from those opposite, who are desperate not to confront a single fact - that is, they voted against FuelWatch. So when the motorists of Australia confront the challenges at the bowser -  - So condensate and all the other measures in the budget represent an exercise in financial integrity. The measures represent how you construct a robust surplus for the Commonwealth and how you produce, through that surplus, insurance for Australia's long-term economic interest and sufficient revenue flow to ensure that we can help working families on the way through, including by establishing a national FuelWatch scheme. The direct connection between the two propositions is quite clear-cut. Those opposite have just voted against FuelWatch. They have tried to deploy every procedural device to avoid the vote. They voted against it and now they are seeking to wriggle out from under. It is quite clear-cut. - Therefore, this overall debate has been most instructive about where those opposite stand and where we stand on the question of condensate, on the overall taxation arrangements for the Commonwealth and on assistance to working families. This debate has been about the Liberal Party, not about working families. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. It is a very serious question going to a problem confronting not only Australia but also the global community. It goes to the fact that the global community at the moment is experiencing huge increases in the price of fuel which are a reflection of high oil prices. It is simply a question of demand outstripping supply. In that context, can I also say to the House, it is about time the Australian community understood that this little problem did not eventuate in the last six months. -  - This problem has not eventuated since 24 November last year. The Rudd government has been seeking to do everything possible to work out not only short-term solutions but also medium- and long-term solutions. - The facts show that last week the world benchmark West Texas crude oil price hit US$135 per barrel. It is interesting to note that this means that the benchmark price of crude has more than doubled in the last 12 months. You are also no doubt aware - and it obviously crosses the member for Mayo's mind from time to time - that the price of crude oil has increased by more than 400 per cent since the Iraq war. It is for those very reasons that the government has been doing everything possible to actually try and work out not only the best possible response in terms of consumers' immediate demands and challenges but also a medium- to long-term strategy, which goes to a very serious alternative fuel debate -  - that was neglected time and time again by the previous government. It is in that context -  - and as part of a normal cabinet process that views are tested, and the best policy comes out of open and robust debate. I simply say that I fully support the cabinet decision on FuelWatch. -  - Fuelwatch, in association with additional powers to the ACCC and to put a cop on the beat, represents the best available option for the Australian community at the moment in a very tough global market. It guarantees that consumers have transparency in petrol prices and it gives to consumers the best available information about when and where to buy petrol. Consumers understand that prices are principally a reflection of record world oil prices, and they expect government, as the Rudd government has done, to explore all available options to assist them to deal with the rising cost of oil. That is what the cabinet debates have been about and that is why we have made a range of very serious decisions to try and assist motorists at the petrol bowser. I simply say that I contend that all consumers will ultimately benefit from a national Fuelwatch scheme wherever they live in Sydney, or in any other major metropolitan city. - I might also say that it is not only about government looking at short-term solutions to assist motorists; it is also about government trying to put in place a medium- to long-term strategy. That is about a long-term plan going to Australia's energy security. Just as we are making some hard decisions at the moment to try and assist motorists in the short-term -  - we are also doing something that the Howard government failed to do over 12 long years. - Another area of very serious neglect by the Howard government - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Right now the global economy is going through a period of enormous challenge. It has been underway since the events of August last year when we saw the unfolding of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States and the roll-through in instability we have seen in global financial markets. We have seen revisions downwards in growth in the United States and Europe and now in our own East Asian hemisphere. This is a concern to all policymakers around the world. It has been compounded, of course, by the increase in the global price of oil. Oil prices are at record levels of around US$130 per barrel. They have more than doubled in the last 12 months and this is adding to the challenge we have in terms of inflation.The US Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President, Thomas Hoenig, warned last month:There is a significant risk that higher inflation will become embedded in the economy and require significant monetary policy tightening to reduce it ...That is the response by those responsible for monetary policy in the United States. The European Central Bank said most recently there is 'an accumulation of shocks that is clearly not yet over' and warns further that we have a protracted period of high inflation rates.Also in Australia we have a deep challenge with inflation. When this government took office, inflation was running at 16-year record highs and this presents a real challenge, placing further upward pressure on interest rates. Interest rates, we know, are the enemy of all Australians - the enemy of families, the enemy of those on fixed incomes, the enemy of businesses, the enemy of small business. They are the enemy of the economy overall and the enemy of living standards for working Australians. Therefore the challenge which the government faced in the budget was how to bring about a responsible budget in the context of responsible economic management to bring downwards pressure to bear on inflation and, therefore, on interest rates. And that is what we did. We brought in a budget which proudly boasted a $22 billion surplus. We believe that is a responsible course of action. It is a responsible course of action because it peels pressure away from public demand and the overall impact on demand in the economy, both public and private.That is one step in the right direction. Another step in the right direction as far as the inflation challenge is concerned is investing in skills and infrastructure. On this side of the House we are proud to have established Infrastructure Australia. We are proud to have established the Building Australia Fund - some $20 billion to do something about the infrastructure bottlenecks, about which the previous government was warned for many, many years as causing overall inflationary pressures in the economy. Beyond infrastructure, we have taken steps to increase skills as well, which again was the subject of repeated Reserve Bank warnings to the previous government but which was neglected. We have established Skills Australia, and we have also established an Education Investment Fund of some $11 billion for the future, focused on universities and TAFEs. The overall objective in these policies is having a responsible government surplus through the budget process and, on top of that, investment funds for the future guided by professional bodies such as Infrastructure Australia and Skills Australia to deal with these long-term capacity constraints in the Australian economy. If this overall fiscal discipline is compromised, so too is the overall integrity of the budget and the integrity of Australia's economic policy settings.Those opposite have come forward with a budget of some $22 billion worth of raid on the overall surplus and yet with not one indication as to where they may extract a single saving from. That, I think, is a real problem in terms of economic credibility. I think it behoves the Leader of the Opposition to indicate which of those programs currently before the House he will be seeking to remove, axe, not fund and not support in order to find the offsetting savings for the $22 billion raid he has conducted on the government surplus. Will the opposition be supporting, for example, the education tax refund in the Senate? Will the opposition be supporting the increase of the childcare tax rebate in the Senate? Each of these measures is expensive but the opposition so far has said, opportunistically, that it will conduct this $22 billion raid. It is about an opposition which controls the numbers in the Senate and has therefore a high degree of relevance.In terms of the overall inflationary pressures both globally and within Australia, we are also dealing with the effect of rising oil prices. This is a major problem for motorists right across Australia, a major problem for families and a major problem for those who are dealing with making the family budget stretch to the extra cost that they have to pay at the bowser. We have put forward a clear-cut long-term policy for dealing with this. We have an array of measures out there, one of which deals with how we affect retirement incomes policy and the treatment of various taxation imposts in the context of the Henry commission. We brought about competition policy measures through the ACCC and, of course, we have our well-established policy in relation to Fuelwatch.I contrast our policy clarity on the one hand with a policy confusion on the part of those opposite. We already know where they stand - or we think we know - on this 5c excise, which is that the Leader of the Opposition says it is core opposition policy, whereas the shadow Treasurer says that he could not give any guarantee that this will be implemented should they go to and win the next election.Beyond that, their position on Fuelwatch has really been one to observe in the last 24 hours, because yesterday we had a vote in the House of Representatives on a detailed motion that goes to the absolute core content of the Fuelwatch legislation. The honourable members opposite were asked to vote. They could not sit on the fence anymore. When push came to shove they had to vote, and they voted against Fuelwatch. You would think that would have summed up the situation entirely, but 12 hours is a very long time in politics. If we look at what has happened in the intervening 12 hours, it really gets very interesting. Yesterday they opposed Fuelwatch, but this morning, as the good Senator Adams from Western Australia entered the Senate doors, what did she say about Fuelwatch? I quote:I think FuelWatch is working.She then went on to say:Some places are a lot higher and others are a lot cheaper. Myself, I am very aware of what is at the bowser. If there is cheaper fuel at a price somewhere, and if someone else is 10c dearer, I will certainly go there.That is from Senator Adams, a Liberal senator for Western Australia. This is not a month ago or a year ago; it is from this morning. It was barely a few hours after they voted in the Senate to say that they would oppose this legislation. The good Senator Adams - I would like to meet the good senator - said that she thinks that Fuelwatch is working, and she is from the one state in the federation where it has been operating since 2001, when it was introduced by a Liberal government.But it gets better from there. For further clarity on the part of those opposite on their Fuelwatch, we then turn to good old Senator McGauran, who was asked this morning at the Senate doors what they would do on this. He said:Pre-June 30, we will knock it back, because we control the Senate.So we have Senator Adams saying that this is a terrific piece of policy and Senator McGauran saying they are going to oppose it. If that is not sufficient lack of clarity, let's turn to the good old member for Wentworth. He was asked this morning what his position on FuelWatch is - and this is a good one. The member for Wentworth said:We are going to both support it and oppose it in the parliament.This was this morning, 28 May. They are going to support some of it and they are going to oppose some of it, despite the fact that they voted against all of it yesterday.So we have Senator Adams saying it is a fantastic piece of policy; we have Senator McGauran, despite the fact that Senator Adams thinks that it is a fantastic piece of policy, saying the Senate is going to vote against it; and then the member for Wentworth says that we are going to have half of it but not the other half of it, even though they voted against all of it yesterday. And where does the Leader of the Opposition stand in all of this? Nobody knows where the Leader of the Opposition stands on this. The last time he seems to have been asked about this, he did not know whether he was going to support or oppose it either. There is no clarity on their excise policy and no clarity on their Fuelwatch policy. The government is getting on with the business of governing.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question and simply say that I, like the Australian community, regard the problems in the international market with respect to the price of oil at the moment to be very challenging and a major difficulty for ordinary households. It is for that very reason that our cabinet has had serious debates about how we try and assist consumers. As the Leader of the Opposition knows, cabinet processes are robust and the best possible policy options emerge as a result of those robust discussions and the testing of ideas. I assume that he would never - and I can guarantee that I will never - reveal the nature of cabinet discussions.This is about proper consideration in a free and objective way; it is about the best way forward for Australian consumers. It is not just about the initial decisions made. There is also ongoing work that I will assist cabinet colleagues with. That not only goes to the introduction of Fuelwatch in December of this year, which is about transparency and the capacity of Australian consumers to select the best possible price when purchasing fuel on a given day in a given place, but also goes to ongoing work that I have with other ministerial colleagues to introduce a review of the Oil Code, and that is currently underway. It also goes to conducting an audit of terminal capacity for petrol in ports. We are about guaranteeing that we can meet our future challenges as a nation whilst assisting consumers in the short term. I simply stand by the cabinet process. There was a full and proper process, and the right decision has been made.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. We on this side of the House understand that responsible budgeting and investing in the future are absolutely necessary to fight inflation and to put downward pressure on interest rates. It is something that is not understood by those on the other side of the House. We have put forward very substantial savings in this budget to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. Now the opposition is attempting to blow a $22 billion hole in the surplus. That can do nothing but put upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.In this budget we cut back spending very hard. We withdrew spending growth to one per cent. Under the previous Treasurer it was four times that - reckless spending from the previous government. In the last Howard-Costello budget they went on a spending spree of $40 billion, without one cent of savings. That is what occurred in their last budget. They did that despite the advice from the Treasury at the time. On 24 November 2006, this is what the Treasury had to say to the then government, including the present Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer. This is what the Treasury said to the then Treasurer:_ as the economy is running close to capacity there is a real risk that significant spending will add to inflationary pressures.That is what the Treasury said about their last budget. At that stage, they had $13 billion worth of additional spending on the table - and guess how much they spent when the budget came down? $40 billion. That is what is putting upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates. Since that time, interest rates have gone up four times and inflation has hit a 16-year high. They have learnt no lessons from that. A leopard never changes its spots. Old habits die hard - because now they want to blow a $22 billion hole in the surplus. We saw it in the House this morning. We saw it from the shadow Treasurer. He could not even make it into the House to take his speaking slot on the luxury car tax bills. He could not even get in here. They are so disorganised. They have so lost their way, and they do not know where they stand on this budget. Do you know what he said when he arrived in the House? He said, 'We might be in favour of the luxury car tax or we might not.' That is the response of the Liberal Party. They are disorganised, they have lost their way and they do not know what they stand for except high inflation, high interest rates and high spending. - No, I was reading from notes. - They are.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. It is interesting that he should raise Western Sydney. I grew up in Western Sydney. My mother still lives there and so do three brothers and sisters and my nieces and nephews. Whilst I represent a seat in Melbourne, my heart is also still in Western Sydney, because that is where I grew up and was given an opportunity in life. I can assure the House and the Australian community that the challenge of oil is not a short-term problem. I correctly contributed to a cabinet process, and for me as the minister for energy it is an ongoing process. It is not something that the opposition discovers from time to time trying to play short-term political games. It is actually about overcoming years of neglect by the Howard government on what is a very serious policy debate. - Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I, like Australian motorists, follow petrol prices on a regular basis, because I am concerned about their impact on ordinary Australian families. More importantly, I am concerned in trying to develop, through my national energy security assessment, a white paper on where we go in energy security and how I can contribute in a real policy debate to putting in place a real alternative fuels policy in Australia - something the Howard government neglected.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question, and I know she is deeply concerned about educational opportunity and skills shortages in her electorate. Today is an important day because it is the first day that the government's new body, Skills Australia, meets - and I congratulate Mr Phil Bullock, a former Chief Executive of IBM, who has agreed to lead Skills Australia for the government. This body is going to act in a crucial advisory capacity to government, charting where skills development is most needed and where skills shortages are most acute, charting where the government's 630,000 training places would be best deployed to meet skills shortages and advising government on the long-term policy agenda for reform in the vocational education and training sector. Having Skills Australia is part of a reform process for vocational education and training, with the government in the recent budget committing $19.3 billion, including an $11 billion Education Investment Fund. All of this work is necessary because this nation is facing a skills crisis. Whether you are trying to build a huge resource project in the north-west of this country or trying to get a plumber to come to your home to attend to a small job, you are an expert in the skills crisis in this country.Right across the country we are crying out for skilled workers. This has been a crisis a long time in the making and it was specifically made by the more than a decade of neglect by the Liberal Party in government of this vital skills agenda, a personal neglect by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. We have moved to address the skills crisis immediately with 20,000 new training places. As I indicated yesterday, we have more than 3,500 students already enrolled and 380 registered training organisations signed up and ready to go.This morning the Prime Minister and I visited a childcare centre where the skills crisis was on display, a childcare centre that would like three more skilled workers but cannot get them. I am very pleased to say that a number - more than 700 - of the government's training places which have already been taken up have been taken up by people who are going to work at certificate III level in the childcare industry.From time to time members opposite in this place come in and pose as great supporters of the resources sector. We have seen that on display as recently as this week. But it has been my pleasure today to speak to the Minerals Council of Australia, and when you talk to them what they know is that the skills crisis is restraining the capacity of the resources boom. We need to be investing in skills in mining and in construction, and we will be doing that.Later today I will be speaking at the master builders dinner. It is an industry that is suffering the constraints of skills shortages. This is the record of more than a decade of neglect, something that members opposite should be ashamed of. They have not only constrained the productive capacity of our economy, putting upwards pressure on inflation and interest rates, they have denied hardworking Australians the opportunity that increased investment in skills would have brought. Where a decade of neglect has built up, the Rudd Labor government is addressing the problem and part of addressing the problem is our new skills advisory body, and I congratulate it on its first meeting in the House today.</DOC>

 - The former Liberal Prime Minister of Australia stood here with the support of all those opposite and not only said that working families had never been better off but went one better and said irresponsibly that interest rates would be kept at record lows. If I know one thing about the Australian people it is that they are sick and tired of politicians making irresponsible promises. We have introduced a competition policy measure. We have said that it is not a silver bullet but we think that it is the right way ahead. At least we have a policy. Those opposite, as of today, have four different policies. It would be useful if the opposition would provide clarity on that.</DOC>

 - I think the honourable member for Fremantle for her question, another Western Australian member who understands the benefits of Fuelwatch. Everyday in Western Australia 30,000 emails are sent out to individuals who have subscribed to the FuelWatch system. There are 30,000 emails everyday telling people where they can find the cheapest petrol in Western Australia. Each month the FuelWatch website receives 190,000 visitors - just in Western Australia. There are 190,000 people using the website to find the cheapest fuel in Western Australia.A very interesting market survey in 2006 found that 86 per cent of Western Australian motorists had used FuelWatch and 10 per cent told the market survey that they saved over $10 a week through the FuelWatch service. Apparently one of those 86 per cent of Western Australian motorists was a member of the Senate, Senator Adams, who said this morning that she thought FuelWatch was working. She joins a long line of conservative politicians who support Fuelwatch. She also joins the Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory, Terry Mills, who said:A FuelWatch system is long overdue particularly in the Territory where we regularly pay the highest prices in the nation. Giving customers information on fuel prices for a 24-hour period will produce sharper competition in the marketplace. FuelWatch will enable consumers to quickly compare the various prices on offer in their town and buy accordingly. People are very price sensitive about the petrol so I am sure consumers will head to the stations offering the best price.We could not have said it better ourselves! That was the Leader of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory.As I said yesterday, the ACCC's report made very clear that there are great concerns about the current operation of the fuel market. They made very clear that there are great concerns about the way information is shared between retailers through their own website. Yesterday we heard the shadow Treasurer, the member for Wentworth, claim that the ACCC does not really support FuelWatch, that it is all a socialist plot to take control of the market. Let us see what that well-known socialist Graeme Samuel thinks about that. Comrade Samuel said on the Business Sunday program:There has been a lot of focus on the one to two cents saving which our analysis through the petrol inquiry indicated occurred in Perth and we believe it will occur across Australia.These are the words of the chairman of the ACCC - 'we believe it will occur across Australia'. He went on:But to focus on that ignores the most important element of this FuelWatch scheme which I think is a very important process to be introduced for the benefit of Australian motorists.That is the ACCC Chairman, Graeme Samuel. He went on to say:The really important saving for motorists is the power it gives them to know when prices will be lifted and reduced - And, more importantly, know where they can buy petrol at the lowest possible price - If you know that prices will be lifted by 10c tomorrow, you've got 15 hours notice under the FuelWatch scheme to buy today, that'll save you 10c a litre.That is the Chairman of the ACCC, Mr Graeme Samuel. We also heard from the opposition yesterday that Graeme Samuel used to oppose Fuelwatch so, therefore, it must be a bad thing. So let's see what Mr Samuel says about that. He was asked on the 7.30 Report: 'Isn't it true that it was you who long questioned the effectiveness of introducing a Fuelwatch scheme?' Remember, they said the report was not rigorous and there was not enough analysis. This is what Mr Samuel said:Oh, absolutely, and I would be the first to say that I was wrong. We would not, I would have to say to you, examine the FuelWatch scheme in as much detail and with as much rigour as the commission has examined it as part of the petrol inquiry.That is what the ACCC says about the Fuelwatch proposal and their analysis.But in all seriousness, and in all fairness, I can understand the difficulties that the opposition have. In all seriousness, and I mean this in all fairness, the government has had the benefit of working through the ACCC's report with them over several months and working through the implications. The ACCC recommended that more work be done on Fuelwatch. I understand that the government had had the benefit of that analysis and that process and that the opposition has not. I wrote to the Leader of the Opposition on 16 April and 18 April suggesting that he receive a briefing from Mr Samuel, from the Petrol Commissioner and from Dr Stephen King, one of the ACCC commissioners and a well-respected expert on competition matters. That briefing has not yet occurred. But today I can, for the benefit of the House, facilitate a briefing for any member of parliament by Mr Samuel, Dr King and Mr Walker on the benefits of the ACCC's proposal for Fuelwatch. For any members, collectively or individually, the chairman of the ACCC is more than happy to work them through the analysis that the ACCC has done, work them through the econometric analysis and work them through the proposals. If members seriously want to deal with petrol prices and they seriously want to hear about the rigorous analysis that the ACCC has done, they will take up that offer and they will meet -  - I think you will find the member for Dickson has another engagement at four o'clock. - I made it very clear that that briefing had not yet occurred, but the chairman of the ACCC is available for the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer or any other member. Far be it from me to give the opposition political advice, but the chairman of the ACCC will be appearing before estimates next week and he will be more than happy to take the questions of opposition senators as to why the ACCC supports Fuelwatch.Let's have none of this nonsense that the ACCC does not support Fuelwatch, because on this side of the House we back the people who stand up for consumers. The ACCC is the body which supports consumers. The ACCC is the regulator. You left them out to dry. The ACCC called for criminalisation of cartels. You would not do it. The ACCC called for a strengthening of the Trade Practices Act. You would not do it. - We will back the regulator any day of the week.</DOC>

 - The advice on which the government has constructed its Fuelwatch policy comes from this 300- to 400-page report commissioned by the member for Higgins, commissioned by the previous government, and delivered to this government and referred to just now by the Assistant Treasurer. It says quite clearly that the relevant weekly average price margin was around 1.9c per litre less on average for the period from January 2001 to January 2007. We believe that is a robust basis upon which to implement this, as in fact does Senator Adams from Western Australia. We think it is a robust way ahead. We think it is not a silver bullet, but we also think it is appropriate. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. This was a very clear-cut piece of advice commissioned by those opposite, ignored by those opposite, but we have decided to back consumers. This actually is the party which supports consumers. It seems increasingly that those opposite are the party of big oil.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. Underlying inflation is currently running at 4.2 per cent in the Australian economy, which is well outside the Reserve Bank's target zone. That is why the Reserve Bank has been engaged in putting up interest rates over the past six to nine months. One of the key reasons why inflation has been running at an unacceptably high level, of course, is that government spending has been running at an increasingly high level, growing much too fast. In fact, in the financial year that is about to end, the budget that we inherited from the former government had spending growing at over five per cent in real terms, pumping up spending in the economy without increasing the economic capacity that is needed to absorb the spending in productive activity.The Rudd government inherited a loose, wasteful budget from the member for Higgins that is pushing up inflation and pushing up interest rates. Therefore, we have no choice but to slow government spending, to put the brakes on, in order to push back against rising prices and rising interest rates. That is why the government has delivered a surplus of $21.7 billion for the forthcoming financial year - 1.8 per cent of GDP - slowed spending growth from around five per cent per annum in real terms to barely over one per cent per annum in real terms and reduced spending as a proportion of the total economy by over one per cent to the lowest level since 1989-90. That is why the government has put on the brakes: it is in order to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates and to reverse the impact that the budget was having from the previous government's fiscal settings of putting upward pressure on inflation and interest rates.Inevitably, commentators have had different views about the budget. There have been one or two who have suggested that we have not gone hard enough. Many commentators have, however, suggested that, broadly, the settings are in the right place and the fiscal positioning is right to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. I have not seen too many commentators, though, who have suggested that our settings are too strict - that they are too tight. Not many credible economic commentators have suggested that. There is, however, one set of participants in public debate who have suggested that our settings are too tight, that they should be looser and that we should be spending more money - namely, the opposition, the Liberal Party.And, I have to say, the member for Moreton got it in one. He was absolutely correct about this set of commentators - complete losers. Their position still is to pump up inflation, increase interest rates and pour money into the economy. They want to restore tax lurks. They want to revive the notorious Regional Partnerships program. They want to bring back the failed $1 billion access card project. They want to hand out various tax reductions to all and sundry. But there is one big flaw in this strategy - one big very simple flaw - where is the money coming from? Where is the money coming from to pay for all of the giveaways and all of the rejection of the government savings initiatives?The combined impact of the position that the Liberal opposition have taken in response to the government's budget would cut a hole of about $4 billion in this year's budget and a total hole of over $22 billion over four years in the budget. And not a single cent of savings has been put forward by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Wentworth, by the shadow finance minister, the member for Dickson - we are not quite sure what he does in his day job; he is certainly not finding any savings - or indeed by the Leader of the Opposition. One commitment has not even been costed. The commitment to change the arrangements for capital gains tax on small business does not even have a costing, so unconcerned are the opposition about the impact of their fiscal position on the overall position of the budget.The member for Wentworth confessed last week where the money was going to come from. He said it would come from the surplus. That is where the money for it would come from. That is a simple recipe for higher inflation and higher interest rates. Motorists know that the short-term effect of cutting the petrol excise could be blown away in a day's oil price fluctuations. What they also need to recognise is that the short-term effect of that would be blown away by the increase in inflation, by the increase in prices generally and by the increase in interest rates that would follow from the loosening of the budget that the opposition is proposing. It would be a false saving for Australian families because it is not funded, it is not paid for and, inevitably, it has to come from somewhere and the opposition refuses to say where. It is not that long ago since the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Wentworth were members of the Howard government cabinet that rejected the very proposition that the Leader of the Opposition now advances. So, after 11Â½ years of opportunity to put this policy in place, they now suddenly discover it is a good idea.In conclusion, the opposition's economic approach is very simple: spend, spend again and spend yet again. It is to let inflation rip, let interest rates increase and put further burdens on the budgets of ordinary working people in this country. It is to have giveaways to everybody that they think needs to have some kind of political approach made to them, and to let the pressure on inflation and on interest rates that their budget, which we inherited, was delivering actually increase rather than be turned around. That is the approach that caused the problem that we are endeavouring to deal with in the first place. A grab bag of giveaways is not an economic policy. The Rudd government is committed to responsible economic management, to investing for the long term and to protecting working people's living standards for the long-term future of this country.</DOC>

 - In the last budget, the coalition set an AusLink 2 budget of some $22.3 billion. In accordance with our commitment to economic responsibility, prior to the election Labor made promises within that $22.3 billion. In the recent budget we have delivered on all of these commitments, as well as bringing forward half a billion dollars of worthwhile projects, while still delivering a $22 billion surplus. But the National Party and the coalition were never really good at sticking to a budget. In a desperate attempt to make up for years of neglect, they went on a predictable pre-election spending spree, so that by 7 November, a couple of weeks into the election campaign, the $22.3 billion was all gone. It had all been allocated. But that did not stop them. They just kept spending. Their spending was so reckless that the Nationals leader, the then Minister for Transport and Regional Services, does not know what they spent. On 20 February 2008 the Leader of the Nationals put out a press release saying, 'the coalition committed to spending $3 billion more money'. Then three weeks later, in parliament, on 11 March, he changed his mind and said they put 'another $3 billion to $5 billion towards our commitment for roads'. Then, on 17 March, it changed again. A spokesperson quoted in the Australian went back to the original figure and said that they had allocated $22.3 billion before the election. But the very next day, 18 March, they changed their mind yet again - for the fourth time. In a press release, the Leader of the National Party said 'they committed to spend $31 billion before 2013'.So let us be clear here. On 17 March they had spent $22 billion - a day later it was $31 billion. Even for the National Party, a $9 billion spend in 24 hours is a pretty good effort. But there is even more - it did not stop there. Even though they are now the opposition, they have not stopped upping their government commitments. On 22 May, after our budget which was so welcomed by the transport industry, the Leader of the Nationals told Lloyd's List that they promised $10 billion more than Labor. So let us recap: in February it was $3 billion, in March it was up to $8.7 billion and in May it is $10 billion. Spend, spend and spend some more. Do not worry about where the money is coming from, do not worry about the implications for inflation and do not worry about the implications for interest rates - they have simply given up on economic credibility. We already know that the opposition leader's uncosted reply to the budget, which aimed to preserve himself rather than to preserve Australia's economic future, blew a $22 billion hole in the surplus. If you add in the National Party leader's comments, there is another $10 billion on top of that. How has that been received by the industry? We know that the transport industry has a direct interest in the issue of petrol. There has been a bit of debate in parliament over the last few days about petrol. This morning I spoke to the national conference of the Australian Trucking Association. There were some 600 members there.Honourable members - Tony Sheldon! - This is the Australian Trucking Association. Those opposite say 'Tony Sheldon', but this is actually the industry - the owners, Lindsay Fox. This is not the union; it is the industry. The Chief Executive, by the way, is Stuart St Clair. Trevor Martyn, Chair of the ATA - the speaker before I spoke, and I was very interested to hear his comments - said today:Of course it has been suggested the Australian government could reduce fuel excise, but it would be just a gesture. The price of diesel has already gone up by 48c and is likely to rise an extra 20c. A tax cut of even 10c a litre would hardly be noticeable. Instead, the best approach the Australian government can take is to focus on the long term and fix the road transport laws that are stopping us from using the latest and most fuel-efficient truck designs.That was the view of industry today. The opposition are totally out of touch, they make promises they cannot possibly fulfil and they continue to have no regard whatsoever for economic responsibility.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Of course I had an interest in the impact of FuelWatch on small business and so I made some inquiries. Those inquiries revealed, for example, that upon the introduction of FuelWatch in Western Australia, in the period from 2001 to 2007, the number of independents went up quite substantially. This is no secret, because the member could have checked out the relevant website today. He would have found out that as of today there are 93 different independents operating in the metro markets in Western Australia. I will give a couple of examples: Gull has 28 outlets, Independent has 15, Better Choice has three, Quick Fuel has one, Liberty has eight, Peak has 20, United has 15, Westco has three, for a total of 93. In addition, in non-metro outlets, there are 64 independents operating, bringing the total to 157. - Indeed, I provided that advice to my colleagues - obviously not as of today's date, because the discussion was held and the decision was made in April. I advised my colleagues that I considered that FuelWatch could, if anything, advantage small business in Western Australia, and indeed I was right, based on the evidence over the period March 2001 to June 2007. There is not only a substantial number - and an increase in the number - of operators, as I am advised, but total sites for branded independents have gone up from 34 per cent to 36 per cent and for general independents it has increased from two per cent to five per cent. That is the sort of information that would have been available to the member for Moncrieff. That is the sort of information that would have been available to the opposition if it had so inquired. That is the sort of information that leads me to fully support the introduction of Fuelwatch in the eastern states, because I believe that small business will be big beneficiaries from the introduction of Fuelwatch.</DOC>

 - I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question. We have had cause in this parliament to reflect on the skills crisis that was brought to this country by the Liberal Party, particularly by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and it is contrasted with the Rudd Labor government getting on with the job, creating Skills Australia and delivering 20,000 new training places as part of 630,000 new training places.I have from time to time remarked that the member for Goldstein, as the last minister responsible in this area, stood by as a spectator watching the skills crisis build and did absolutely nothing. I do need to add a fact to the public record that I was not aware of before. The member for Goldstein, the former Liberal government, the former ministers who are here, the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did not do absolutely nothing. They did what the Liberal Party always do when they do not know what to do next: they advertised, spending more than $68 million of taxpayers' funds on skills advertising. These people who now feign a great interest in cost pressures on working families were quite happy to rip $68 million out of their purses and wallets to fund advertising.I am a woman who has done her best to control the plague of Work Choices mouse pads, the avalanche of pens - I have done my best - but I regret to inform the House that I have found some remnants of the skills advertising, what is left of the $68 million: a mug, and that is how they were treating the Australian community - as mugs. - My purpose really is to inform Australian taxpayers what their $68 million went on - the mugs and the business card holders, which presumably are full of business cards that said things like, 'My name is Brendan and I have done absolutely nothing to fix the skills crisis.' And then, of course, there is my personal favourite: this one is for the mantelpiece; you can put a picture next to this clock so you can watch the skills crisis count down and see a picture of who is responsible. -  - They provided to Australian businesses a clock so that they could count the minutes as the skills crisis counted down. They spent $68 million of taxpayers' money. Last but not least - and we have heard a lot about luxury motor vehicles in this parliament in the last few days - we have, would you believe, the skills sun visor for your car so that you can protect the dashboard of the Maserati when you are out on a nice sunny day. That was the contribution of the Liberal Party of this country to the skills debate. There were young Australians wanting apprenticeships and businesses wanting skilled workers, and what did the Liberal Party of this country do? They spent $68 million, and those opposite were around the cabinet table when it was spent.This tells the Australian community about your priorities. The Leader of the Opposition could have given working Australians $68 million, but instead he participated in a decision to spend it on propaganda. Add that to the $121 million spent on propaganda for Work Choices. The Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Manager of Opposition of Business, the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the National Party were all participants in wasting $121 million of taxpayers' money on Work Choices propaganda and $68 million on this. Do not come into this parliament and feign an interest in the welfare of working families when you have been a participant in this level of waste. - That is what they thought was a priority in government: Liberal waste; a rip-off of Australian working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I regret to advise the House that overnight the Burmese military regime extended the detention of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the last democratically elected Burmese leader. Given the terrible human tragedy that has unfolded in Burma, the Australian government has recently tempered its remarks so far as the Burmese military regime has been concerned. That has obviously been in order to seek to maximise our efforts to get humanitarian assistance into Burma in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis. But this particular matter cannot go without comment.Aung San Suu Kyi has been under house arrest continuously for the past five years and has been in detention for more than 12 of the last 18 years. Since her most recent detention in May 2003, Australia has repeatedly called for her release and for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners in Burma. Australia's embassy in Rangoon renewed these representations yesterday. Our estimates are that there are around 1,500 political prisoners in Burma.Aung San Suu Kyi was first arrested after her party, the National League for Democracy, won a majority of votes in the 1990 Burma election, an election that the Burmese military were happy to agree to until it saw the result. In 1991, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. She is a testament to the desire of the Burmese people to freely determine their own future and to bring democracy and respect for human rights to Burma. Sadly, she is also a symbol of the lengths to which the military regime in Burma will go to stay in power.The extension of her detention comes after the military regime's recent announcement that over 92 per cent of the votes cast in the recent referendum were to approve a new constitution. That referendum and its process was a complete sham. The fact that it was held consecutively on 10 and 24 May was, in the circumstances, a complete disgrace. That new constitution is fundamentally flawed. It is designed to entrench military power, not to move the Burmese state and people back to democracy. It allows the military to deregister political parties and it prevents Aung San Suu Kyi from standing for political office. Progress towards democracy and respect for human rights in Burma will only occur in a manner which the international community supports and when all political players in Burma have a genuine and transparent opportunity to take part in a genuine political process.I welcome very much the statements overnight supportive of Aung San Suu Kyi from the UN Secretary-General and from a range of governments, including the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom and Indonesia. I say that this regrettable decision on the part of the Burmese military regime will not affect in any way the Australian government's continued efforts to seek to bring humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma in the aftermath of Cyclone Nargis. In this context, I am very pleased to inform the House that earlier today - very early this morning - the Royal Australian Air Force delivered two helicopters for the World Food Program to Bangkok. These helicopters are sourced from South Africa and will be used by the World Food Program to deliver much-needed food to Burma.I will conclude on this point: the reluctance of the Burmese military regime to accept international assistance in this matter stands in stark contrast to the approach of the government of China. Can I say to the House how very much we regret the aftershocks that have occurred in China and the additional pressure that this has placed on the Chinese government. I say that, as a consequence of these aftershocks, I have today written to the Chinese ambassador renewing, again, our offer of any appropriate assistance from Australia on behalf of the Australian government but also on behalf of the Australian community. That approach of the Chinese government stands in very stark contrast to the approach and attitude of the Burmese military regime.</DOC>

What I am more than happy to confirm for the House is that the ACCC has found that fuel, on average, has been cheaper in Perth for every one of the last five months and has been cheaper in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. I am able to confirm that I had a call early this morning to confirm that some skeletal remains had been found as a result of an excavation that we are undertaking at Fromelles. This confirms that there are bodies buried at Pheasant Wood, with the strong possibility that they are allied dead buried by the German army but not recovered after the war.It is worth while just recalling for a moment the nature of this battle. In a 24-hour period, 5,533 Australians were either killed, wounded or captured. Two thousand of these Australians were killed. We believe - or at least we hope - that what we have here are potentially the remains of 170 Australian soldiers, or thereabouts, most of whom crossed no-man's-land on that fateful day or evening to reach the enemy lines, only to be killed either in their trenches or beyond the lines. After the battle was over, the German army properly buried these troops - we think at this site at Pheasant Wood.We need to understand the horror of this event. It is the worst experience of loss of life and the most tragic day in Australia's military history. You need to understand this. It is a bit hard to describe the land, but across no-man's-land, flanked by machine guns, Australian soldiers were ordered across those lines. One soldier said:The air was thick with bullets, swishing in a flat criss-crossed lattice of death _ Hundreds were mown down in the flicker of an eyelid, like great rows of teeth knocked from a comb.The tragedy was a terrible waste of life. It was, frankly, a pointless, senseless, incompetently managed attack. The Germans were fully aware and ready with their lethal response. But the extent of the tragedy needs to be further understood. On that day, on that evening and over that 24-hour period, 12 sets of brothers died; two sets of fathers and sons died; the very bravest of Australian soldiers, many of whom had fought at Gallipoli, died. It is important that, if we are able to confirm that these are the remains of Australian soldiers, we commemorate them appropriately.As you would expect, Mr Speaker, as a result of the find early this morning - yesterday our time - in France, work on the excavation site was suspended to allow it to be referred to the French police. We expect that the excavation will resume later today in France. The most important task for this team is to determine the condition and quantity of the remains. I need to stress that there is nothing at this time that can determine the nationality of the remains recovered thus far. We will pursue every available method to identify these remains, including the use of DNA if there is a reasonable chance of a match. However, I need to stress that it is too early to determine whether DNA analysis can be used in such a way. Should the remains be assessed as unidentifiable, the Australian government's position is that the soldiers remain in situ and that the land in which they lie be acquired by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission as an official war cemetery. A small ceremony is planned at Fromelles once this initial excavation work is complete. I am looking forward to working with the British and French governments to ensure that the sacrifice of these brave Australian soldiers is appropriately commemorated.I need to advise the House that today a meeting will take place of the Fromelles Evaluation Group. It will meet to advise on the next steps. That group comprises the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, Major General Mike O'Brien from the Australian Army, and representatives of the British and French governments. Like the discovery of HMAS Sydney this news will be greatly satisfying for many Australian families who have never known the fate of their uncles, great uncles or grandfathers. We will do everything we can to keep them informed.Finally, can I recognise here the singular efforts of Mr Lambis Englezos and his supporters, who have researched and urged so persuasively that this research be undertaken. I am sure that, without his commitment and dedication, this mystery would never have been solved.Honourable members - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - If we go to exactly what Mr Samuel said today on ABC radio 774 with Ali Moore this morning, he said:FuelWatch will not in our view lead to an increase in prices. It will, based on our analysis of the Perth situation, lead to a statistically significant reduction in prices. But there is a far more important element of FuelWatch - it is about giving consumers the power to determine when to buy petrol and where to buy it at the lowest possible price.The choice in this House is very simple: either we vote for additional information to be provided to Australian motorists and consumers or we vote for a cosy, continuing deal with big oil companies.</DOC>

 - Look around the world today. We are confronting the full dimensions of the global oil crisis, which has seen global oil prices go up by 400 per cent since the Iraq war. As we know, the Iraq war of itself represented an enormous impediment to the successful continued flow of oil onto the global market. But it is just one element. There are other supply-side factors, including supply-side constraints in Nigeria and huge demand-side challenges which come from the rise of China and the rise of India. With the Indian economy booming, you are going to have another one million-plus Indian motor vehicles on the road each year. Look at the rise of China and the projections out from where China was just a few years ago onto 2010, 2020 and beyond, and the total proportion of world oil consumption which China will represent is a huge new demand factor in overall global oil prices. China's global energy demand means that we also see, through Australia's resources boom in the coal sector and the resources sector more generally, that that demand is leading to an acceleration of our own terms of trade. On the question of supply and demand, the other responses which are important in terms of global oil deal with what we are going to do in terms of alternative fuels into the future. This government is embracing that as a strategy for the future through work being done by several of my ministerial colleagues.On the question of fuel-efficient cars, Australia needs its own manufactured hybrid car. That is why we have put money through a half billion dollar green car fund to assist Australian motor vehicle manufacturing to bring onto the streets of Australia our own hybrid car so that Australian consumers can go out there and buy with confidence, knowing they are supporting Australian manufacturing jobs when they buy that vehicle and at the same time contributing to a better outcome for themselves in terms of what they pay at the bowser, not to mention a better outcome in terms of the environment.Beyond these measures - how we deal with the demand-side and supply-side factors, how we deal with alternative fuels and more fuel-efficient cars - is the great challenge of public transport investment. Historically the government which has preceded us has said, 'That this is not our zone; we don't go there.' In fact they have said that this is exclusively a responsibility for the states. We have said the reverse. If you look at urban congestion in the major cities of Australia up the east coast - in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne - and the fact that we still, in the 21st century, do not even have the beginnings of anything that looks like a comprehensive metro system in these large cities, surely that is an indictment on us all that we have failed to act. We are facing gridlock in Sydney, gridlock in Melbourne, gridlock in Adelaide and gridlock in Brisbane and in other cities because of this: an absence of effective measures to deal with public transport. That is why we have, in part, a Building Australia Fund: so that we can investigate these sorts of proposals for the future and, if they pass muster, to get behind them to get people out of cars, into decent public transport and to work on time so that they can also contribute to the overall challenge of reducing demand on global oil.Of course, the other thing which governments can do is to make sure that the family budget is assisted to the greatest extent possible. What we have done through this budget is to make sure that through the tax measures, through the childcare tax rebate and through the education tax rebates that we are providing, we are also delivering extra dollars into the family budget each week. Let me give you one example: a family of four with a combined income of $87,000, one full-time worker $60,000, one part-time $27,000, two kids, one in child care and one at school. What do they get as a consequence of the budget that we have just passed? - I will come to the cars question in a minute. It is worth actually calculating the quantum here. Through the tax cuts, a family of that nature - that is, with a $60,000 full-time worker and $27,000 part-time worker and two kids, one in child care and one in school - are delivered an amount equalling $1,050 per year for the 2008-09 year, that is $20.19 a week. That is the first thing. The second thing is that the childcare rebate delivers $1,255 for the year, $24 .13 a week, and the education tax rebate $375 per year. Add those together and that is $2,680 a year in extra disposable income delivered by the measures which have been introduced through this budget. That is what we mean by practical assistance to the family budget to assist them in dealing with all the challenges coming about through increase in the price of petrol, increase in rents, increase in mortgages, increase in grocery prices and the rest. That adds up to an extra $52 per week.What have those opposite offered in this respect? If you are to believe that those opposite are serious about their policy on excise, given that the member for Wentworth has said he cannot guarantee that they would actually implement this policy if they were elected at the next election, on 30 litres being consumed a week that means you are adding $1.50 extra per week to the family budget, in contrast with $52 per week that we are delivering through these budget measures. Can I say that at the end of the day it is one family budget and the question is: where do you find the extra disposable income to help on these critical cost of living pressures? That is what shapes so much of our determination in this budget to make sure that we could deliver extra to the budget table. In the bill currently before this House, which I think has just been voted on, the Medicare levy surcharge alone assists families in the bracket of $50,000 to $100,000, who are currently regarded by those opposite as high income earners, because that was the basis on which it was established - high income earners. We do not have that view and we think it is better that we allow those individuals to have some choice when it comes to how their precious family budget dollars are spent.So through the tax measures, the education tax refund, the childcare tax rebate and the measures which have just gone through the House of Representatives on the Medicare levy surcharge, we deliver extra real dollars to the family budget. It is $52 per week extra based on the cameo I referred to before against $1.50 a week extra on the basis of the excise promise which those opposite do not have sufficient confidence to say to the parliament they would actually deliver when they are in government.I conclude on this: at the end of the day it is about responsible economic management, and responsible economic management means that, if you are putting downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates, you have got to deliver a decent budget surplus. We have done that with a $22 billion surplus. Those opposite have conducted a $22 billion raid on the surplus, and what that is going to produce is upward pressure on inflation, upward pressure on interest rates and therefore upward pressure on prices when it comes to those in the Australian economy currently doing it tough.</DOC>

 - First of all, I ask those opposite to commit to whether they will rule in a cut to the excise, given their position -  -  - that the member for Wentworth refuses to commit to honouring the commitment publicly given by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition says, 'I'm going to give you a 5c cut in the excise on petrol.' The member for Wentworth gets asked, I seem to recall, at the National Press Club and says that he won't give that commitment. - We have made it clear through the statement delivered by the Treasurer and by the Assistant Treasurer that when it comes to the Henry commission of inquiry into tax, income support and retirement income, they will of course consider the GST implications which flow from excise, and we will await the outcome of that report.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. As the Prime Minister was saying before, global oil prices are on the rise and that is pushing up domestic petrol prices, putting a very considerable strain on family budgets. That is why we on this side of the House are so committed to doing something practical with FuelWatch. Those on the other side of the House are fond of saying that watching petrol prices does not make them go down; that is what they have been saying. They should know: they sat in cabinet and watched them go up for 12 years. That is what they did - for 12 years they sat there and watched them go up. And they did not care what was happening to working families during that period.Now they pretend they have an answer. The shadow Treasurer spoke for 15 minutes in the House this morning when we were debating our proposals for FuelWatch. In that 15 minutes the shadow Treasurer did not once mention their proposal to cut excise - not once! The Leader of the Opposition is up here talking about it but his policy is not supported by the shadow Treasurer. He has done it again. The shadow Treasurer has dropped another clanger this morning. He said this at the doorstop interview this morning: 'The new modelling from the ACCC is as inconclusive as the old modelling.' That is what he said this morning at the doorstop. He was asked a question by a journalist, who said, 'Have you seen it?' Mr Turnbull answered, 'No.' He is an expert on modelling he has never seen. His arrogance knows no bounds. Those on that side of the House do not have an alternative proposal. The only proposal they have is to blow a $22 billion hole in the surplus and put further upward pressure on inflation, interest rates and prices for average families.</DOC>

 - Let us look at the question which is being put forward by those opposite on the impact on family budgets. -  - There actually is a reason why I occasionally refer to notes -  -  - and that is, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, I prefer to have one position on all policy matters, not multiple positions as the Leader of the Opposition has. He has multiple positions on inflation, multiple positions on the question of whether there should be government spending cuts, multiple positions on whether there should be means testing and multiple positions on whether they are going to support or oppose FuelWatch. The reason I am a bit careful about things is that I prefer to be consistent. I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that he should be consistent as well.On the question of the budget and its impact on working families, the key thing is what you deliver into families' pockets. What can you also help working Australians with? What can you help those pensioners and carers who are doing it tough out there with? Through the budget we have provided levels of support which assist in meeting some of the cost of living pressures which working families are under. If you go to the example of a family of four that I referred to before, $2,680 per year in extra disposable income is what is delivered by this budget outcome. That results in something like $52 per week extra. I contrast that with the proposal by those opposite on excise - whether in fact they are serious about it or not. Let us go to another cameo of a family of four on a combined family income of $105,000 with no private health cover. Put all these measures together and they are better off after this budget to the total of $5,628 in extra disposable income from 2008-09. That is $108.23 per week. These are practical measures.We know from the family budget that whether it is petrol, whether it is groceries, whether it is rent, whether it is mortgages or whether it is the cost of child care, it is all going up, up and up. As a consequence of that we must ensure that we provide levels of assistance like this to help families balance the budget. That is the first thing. The second is, if you were to quantify what those opposite have put forward on the excise and actually translate it through into a figure of dollar per week assistance to the family budget - I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to do that - what does it actually add up to in terms of the total yield per week or the total yield by the end of each year?Of course overall the challenge is this: how do you help in delivering assistance to families who are under financial pressure and to Australians doing it tough out there. You can, through the budget, invest in Australia's future through infrastructure in schools and in hospitals. You can deliver a responsible budget with a $22 billion surplus. I contrast that with those opposite, who have said, 'Let's throw economic responsibility out the window and engender instead a $22 billion raid on the surplus.' That is not responsible economic management; that is absolute political desperation underpinned by the content of the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for her question. FuelWatch is the only system on offer which will halt the intraday price movements and put consumers back in charge of their purchasing decisions. We support FuelWatch because it was a unanimous recommendation of the consumers' watchdog, the ACCC. We support FuelWatch and we are pursuing FuelWatch because the ACCC and the government think that this is the way to give motorists an even chance - an even chance against the big oil companies and the petrol stations for whom the deal is stacked.Motorists and consumers often say to me, 'Don't you think there is collusion? Don't you think the oil companies are colluding? Why do the prices all move together?' I say to those individuals, 'No, I don't think there is collusion because they do not need to. It is all stacked in favour of the retailers. It is all stacked in favour of the oil companies.' The oil companies and the retailers share information, and consumers and motorists are locked out. We saw today the chairman of the ACCC call the fuel market in this country as close to collusion as you can get, backing up what the ACCC said in their report that the current fuel market arrangements are conducive to anticompetitive coordination. On this side of the House we do not think that is acceptable. Apparently that does not go for members opposite.For the benefit of honourable members, in the ACCC analysis, and in the full analysis which was released today, the conclusion was that from the econometric analysis, on a conservative basis, the ACCC can say that there is no evidence that FuelWatch led to any increase in prices and it appears to have resulted in a small price decrease overall. Importantly, the ACCC has dealt with the myth perpetrated by the Leader of the Opposition that people who only buy on Tuesdays would be worse off. The ACCC said that prices decreased by an average of 0.7c per litre for the lowest day of the week.I shared with the House this morning some views of real people who have been emailing and writing to the government about the debate on FuelWatch. I got one in my email at 12.52, which I read just before I came down to the House. It is from a constituent of the honourable member for Canning. I enjoy reading my emails because it does keep you in touch. This is what the constituent of the honourable member for Canning says:Here in Perth our experience with FuelWatch has been quite good. Initially, I myself was sceptical and didn't bother about it. But when we experienced the wide price ranges from petrol stations of sometimes 20c within a radius of just a couple of kilometres of where we live, and the substantial savings by using it, we use it all the time.He goes on to say:Petrol stations with the highest prices had the least customers. Informed buyers are not stupid. Considering the wide range of prices, the volume of sales are definitely greater at the cheaper ones, hence the average petrol sold in Perth is definitely lower than if there was no FuelWatch service.Brian from Canning can work it out but the member for Canning and his colleagues cannot. - Yes, I was. - It is. -  - Mr Speaker, to protect the confidentiality of the individual I am happy to table the document after removing the individual's second name. - Almost, Mr Speaker. - Real people understand how FuelWatch works. They understand that it puts motorists back in charge. The shadow Treasurer's argument is that oil companies oppose FuelWatch because it benefits them. His argument is that oil companies will benefit from FuelWatch but they oppose it. I will leave the House to draw its own conclusions as to the logic of the honourable member for Wentworth's proposition. But the Australian people know who is on their side - it is the ACCC and not the oil companies.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. I am pleased to be able to take this opportunity to address some of the latest information that has been released about the consumption and sale of products that have been the focus of our binge drinking initiatives in the past. This morning and last night, the alcohol industry distributed to media outlets some recent figures on the sale of spirits. I would like to take the House through those figures, because the figures in the newspapers this morning and in the press release that was released today show that the sale of alcopops has now dropped by almost 40 per cent - a measure that the government is very pleased about.Forty per cent is quite a big decrease on its own, but when you look at the limited amount of data that has been released, what you will find is that in the latest week the most recent figures, from 11 May, actually show a 50 per cent drop. This is a staggering drop in the alcopops industry and something that we believe the distillers have deliberately understated. - It is a positive sign that sales of these products, which are designed to attract young people, to seduce them into a drinking habit, have dropped. -  - We have the members opposite begging us to address what has been the increase in the sales of some other products, so let me take those interjections since the members opposite are so keen. What this data has revealed, by the industry's own admission, is that there has been an increase in the sale of a number of other products - a 20 per cent increase in the sale of hipflasks of full-strength spirits and a 21 per cent increase in the 700 ml bottles of full-strength spirits. - That is a very good question that the member for Paterson asked: how many does that equate to? What it equates to, by the industry's own admission, is an overall decline, when you look at the decrease and the increase, of 100 million - sorry, one million -  -  - We are only talking about two weeks. One million standard drinks of spirits fewer have been sold in a two-week period. I challenge the members opposite, whatever mathematical skills they have, to tell me that a decrease of one million sales of products is not a good reduction. - It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition just interjected across the table that he wrote the book on this. I tell you what, I hope young people are not reading the book that you wrote, Leader of the Opposition, because what it would show in this debate is that we have the industry -  - with a clear self-interest aligned with the opposition, and we have every other health expert in the country aligned with the government saying that this is a measure which is positive. I will take the House through some of those health professionals: Dr John Herron, a former Liberal senator, now at the Australian National Council on Drugs; David Templeman, the CEO of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia; John Rogerson of the Australian Drug Foundation; Mike Daube from the Public Health Association; and Daryl Smeaton from the Alcohol, Education and Rehabilitation Foundation. But perhaps what will be of most interest to members opposite is that I came across a quote the other day which was given in March by the President of the AMA, Dr Rosanna Capolingua, who gave a very vivid description of the urgency that the problem of alcopops presents to us. Let me read you the quote:Alco-pops are a specific issue within the binge-drinking problem.Here you have drinks that are about affordable prices and pretty colours, particularly targeted at young girls - and we're talking about 12, 13, 14, 15-year-olds.We have to look at the alcohol industry and how it targets young people with alco-pops. It builds brand loyalty and the kids connect with a type of drink - they're hooked in.Then they go off and have an accident, or they're king hit while waiting in a queue outside a tavern, or they're raped or are having unprotected sex.That was from Dr Capolingua, who is not known for necessarily coming out and supporting the position of the government. She is the president of the AMA, a position that the Leader of the Opposition has held himself and apparently wrote the book on. What I am worried about is whether he wrote the book in the week that he supported this measure or in the week that he opposed this measure, because we do not know where the Leader of the Opposition stands on this. But this debate is becoming very clear. You have the health experts and the Rudd government on one side; you have the industry and the opposition on the other side. And there may be a little bit of deja vu in this debate, because it is very like the debate on fuel, where you have the opposition siding with industry and the Rudd government siding with the experts and the consumers. We are interested in protecting young people, and one million standard drinks fewer that have been consumed in the last two weeks is good news.</DOC>

 - Let me draw the honourable member's attention to another remark made today by the chairman of Australia's competition watchdog. It goes to the matters which the member has just raised:Importantly, and I have to stress this point, the fuel companies have it all over us. They have a very sophisticated price-sharing system run by a company, called Informed Sources, out of Brisbane, where they know the price that every one of their competitors is charging at every service station in the metropolitan areas of Australia at any point during the day. That is as close to collusion, it's as close to tacit coordination, as you can ever get.That is what, seriously and soberly, the chairman of Australia's competition watchdog has had to say. This is an important consideration, and the choice before the parliament in this matter is very clear-cut. You either vote in support of Australian consumers and motorists or you vote for a continued cosy deal between Australia's major oil companies. That is the choice that is alive here, and the choice which the Leader of the Opposition faces very soon is whether he is going to kill this option for Australian consumers and motorists in the future through his vote in this chamber or whether he is going to allow this to proceed so that Australian motorists have the same information available to them as big oil has available to it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for her question. The government is firmly committed to economically responsible family policy. We want to have family policy that supports people who are doing it tough in this country. That is why we are introducing a number of measures to better target family payments, including payments like the baby bonus and family tax benefit part B. We will be introducing an income test that will apply at $150,000 a year - a reasonable limit for these payments. Around 280,000 families will continue to receive the baby bonus, and around 1.4 million Australian families will continue to be eligible for family tax benefit part B. We consider that it is responsible to target government support to those families who are in the most need.It is the case that these changes have been heralded by a number of commentators. 'Praiseworthy' is the way in which Ross Gittins, the economist writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, described it. By contrast, it has taken the Leader of the Opposition quite a while to come to a position on the government's changes. It does seem like it has been a rather long and very painful process. First, he said he opposed income testing. Then he could not decide which position to take. We know he could not get his colleagues into line. Eventually, I understand, he has agreed that he will be supporting the bill. We do know that he could have gone either way because it is not as if he actually believes that family policy should be both economically responsible and fair. It is the case of course that this Leader of the Opposition has more positions on a range of issues - more positions than even a yoga instructor. -  - I am glad to hear that the opposition are listening because they might be interested in something this Leader of the Opposition had to say on his various views about politics to the Age newspaper back in 1994. - I am glad you are listening and I am glad the Leader of the Opposition is listening. I am sure he will remember what he said to the Age back in 1994. He said:I would feel equally comfortable as a moderate Liberal as I would feel in the Labor right. -  - I hear my colleagues in the Labor Right indicating that they would not feel comfortable, and the moderates over there do not look very comfortable either. This is the man who wants to be considered the alternative Prime Minister of this country, and he does not know where he feels more comfortable - whether it is in the Labor Right or the moderate Liberals. He is so confused he has no idea what he stands for. On this side of the parliament we know what we stand for. We stand for an economically responsible and fair family policy.</DOC>

 - One of the interesting things about the ACCC and the attitude of the member opposite and the sources of advice for pricing questions is that there is a view on the part of those opposite that all wisdom lies in the regular bureaucratic departments, whereas I am always taken by what the member for Higgins says and what he is up to. We are all taken by what he is up to in recent times - and he should inform the Leader of the Opposition of what that is in due course. The member for Higgins had this to say when this report by the ACCC was first launched:_ the ACCC is an independent market regulator which has more expertise in the area of access and pricing than any other Federal Government instrumentality or agency and that is why it is very important that it is engaged in all of these pricing issues.That is what he, whom even you described yesterday as the fountain of economic wisdom, had to say when this report was launched. That is why this government, in considering its position on FuelWatch, has been entirely mindful of the econometric modelling contained within the ACCC report. - Yes, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Australia joined over 120 states at a diplomatic conference in Dublin, commencing 19 May, to negotiate a legally-binding convention prohibiting cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians. The Australian government joined this process because we believed that the time had come for the international community to address the impact of cluster munitions, particularly those that cause indiscriminate harm to civilians long after the cessation of conflict. Australia has a good and proud record in such areas. We have long been a supporter of Mine Action and of alleviating the terrible adverse impacts of the so-called explosive remnants of war on innocent civilians. Over the last decade, Australia has committed over $175 million for Mine Action and to alleviate the adverse impacts on victims. Most recently, on Mine Action Day on 4 April, the government announced a contribution of $10 million to the United Nations Mine Action program for Afghanistan.In the months and weeks leading up to the Dublin conference and during the recent negotiations, the government has worked very hard to achieve a text that delivers that important humanitarian objective that I have outlined, while at the same time safeguarding Australia's national security interests. We have worked very hard with the Australian NGO community, the non-government organisation community, with the Australian Red Cross and World Vision Australia having membership of the Australian delegation. During the period of the conference I have spoken to Norwegian and UK ministers and the Prime Minister has spoken to the Norwegian and the New Zealand prime ministers on deliberations before the conference.The news overnight from Dublin is that very good progress has been made at the conference so far as the text is concerned. A draft text has been agreed and it is expected that it will be formally adopted at the conference tomorrow. The treaty will then be opened for signature formally in a treaty-signing opportunity in Oslo in December this year. States that sign the treaty can then move to formal ratification and adoption of the obligations of the treaty as state parties to it.I am pleased to advise the House that the government's preliminary consideration is that the text represents a strong humanitarian outcome, particularly with regard to protection of civilians in conflict zones, victim assistance and clearance of adversely affected areas, and is consistent with Australia's long-held humanitarian traditions. The text establishes a broad prohibition on those cluster munitions that randomly scatter battlefields with tens or hundreds of so-called submunitions and that have no self-destruct capacity, posing a threat on innocent civilians for many years to come. This does not include modern, precision guided weapons with self-destruct capacities such as the so-called SMArt 155 antitank munition recently acquired by the ADF.The text also addresses the government's concern to ensure that cooperation between nations through peacekeeping and other joint operations with states who may not become party to the treaty is able to continue - for example, the United States. This cooperation, formally known as interoperability, is a vital pillar of Australia's strategic security and defence arrangements. It is also a vital element of Australia's ongoing peacekeeping operations, and I note that today is formally the 60th anniversary of the start of the United Nations peacekeeping operations in which Australia first took part.I congratulate the Irish government on the hosting of the conference. I congratulate the Norwegian government on its leadership in initiating this negotiation and this process. Members of course would be aware over a long period of time that Australia has worked very closely with Norway on nonproliferation and disarmament measures. I congratulate the Australian delegation, in particular Ambassador Caroline Miller, who so ably led the delegation. Ambassador Miller is of course our Ambassador for Disarmament and our permanent rep to the UN in Geneva. I am pleased to conclude by advising the House that, whilst the government will review carefully all of the elements of the treaty text in the lead-up to its opening for signature in December, I am very optimistic - indeed, very confident - that Australia will be in a position to sign this treaty before the end of the year.</DOC>

 - The government in framing FuelWatch has been entirely mindful of not just the advice contained within the econometric analysis within the ACCC report but, as the Assistant Treasurer has also referred, subsequent advice provided to him as well. These have been skipped over, I notice, by those opposite today. When we speak of departmental advice I also draw to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Wentworth that the ACCC falls within the Treasury portfolio. It is there and it has the characteristics described, I think, accurately and elegantly by the member for Higgins - and I do not often say that about the member for Higgins - when he said that the ACCC is an independent regulator -  - So I am fully endorsing the member for Higgins in this particular observation that the ACCC is an independent regulator and, as I have just said, falls within the Treasurer's portfolio. It is not a minor matter. It is not an agency staffed with people who are not up to the task. In fact it has the range of expertise unique in the areas of access and pricing. This is quoting exactly what your economic hero the former Treasurer had to say about this particular body. Furthermore, in the subsequent econometric modelling which has been put out by the ACCC today, I draw again to the attention of honourable members the conclusion at the end of this document. I notice that they are not making any questions on the basis of this document because it is so definitive -  - I would suggest that this conclusion is definitive. It says:The purpose of this econometric analysis has been to satisfy the ACCC that the introduction of the FuelWatch scheme nationally would not, based on the experience in Western Australia, lead to consumers paying higher prices for petrol.From econometric analysis on a conservative basis, the ACCC can say that there is no evidence that FuelWatch led to any increase in prices, it appears to have resulted in a small price decrease overall.The government has been entirely mindful of this advice in framing its position on FuelWatch. It is a contentious matter for debate - we recognise that. But we have turned to the same agency that the former Treasurer turned to in seeking advice on this matter in the first place. If those opposite contest that that is what the former Treasurer was saying when he made those remarks back in June-July last year, I suggest they raise it with the member for Higgins.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question. Responsible economic management and a resolute commitment to tackling climate change go hand in hand. They are the necessary foundations for building a sustainable Australia, economically and environmentally. And that commitment to responsible economic management is underwritten by Labor's $3.3 billion in the federal budget climate change program commitment. This is an unprecedented investment in meeting the greatest social, economic and environmental challenge we face.We know the investment is unprecedented because it compares with a commitment of $2.8 billion in the last coalition budget. In fact, that figure of $2.8 billion contained in last year's environment budget overview was the coalition's claimed total spending on climate change since 1996 and projected out as far as 2020. The Rudd Labor government has already committed more to meeting the challenge of climate change in our first budget than the last government did in their entire 12 years in office and projected over another 12.And it is not just about headline figures; the government has a strategic approach to ensuring Australia reduces its greenhouse gas emissions at the least cost cost. At the centrepiece is an emissions-trading scheme - ruled out by the previous leader of the Liberal Party in his term here as Prime Minister. This will be a most substantial reform - to use the market to drive a least-cost approach to delivering Australia's emission reduction targets in the future. It will be complemented by a range of measures addressing non-price barriers and, importantly, reducing the overall cost of tackling climate change. We are committed to a 20 per cent renewable energy target to help Australian households and communities tackle climate change. We are investing $1 billion, including $300 million for low-interest green loans, $150 million for energy-saving insulation in rental homes and $480 million to make every school a solar school.As sea levels rise we understand the fundamental point that the risks and associated costs of neglect of climate change are greater than the cost of action. The Rudd Labor government's budget is the first down payment on tackling this great challenge. It is an investment that is economically responsible both in the immediate term and with a view to secure a sustainable Australia in the future.Where is the opposition going on this critical issue? We should not forget that the Liberal Party has form on climate change - 12 years of climate change denial, 11th hour makeovers as the election came on and people got concerned about climate change, and suddenly wasteful and expensive climate-clever green wash, but it just did not stick. The Australian public was not fooled by this.As the headlines and the reports continue to pour in, with more evidence of the impact climate change will have on our coastline, our farming communities and our way of life, we look in vain for the Liberal Party to take climate change seriously. Yet the opposition leader's budget reply, all 3,500 words of it, mentioned climate change just once, and even then it was the familiar Liberal Party scaremongering - all about the perils and costs of acting and nothing about the truly perilous consequences and missed economic opportunities if we do not act.The Leader of the Opposition said, 'We'll be back to you on a carbon price,' and that has been his contribution in the House on climate change. But this is not a time for scaremongering; it is a time for rising to the challenge of sound economic management which recognises the critical importance of ensuring that Australians have a sustainable future. And that is exactly what this government is delivering - $3.3 billion on climate change for the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I do, and both the Assistant Treasurer and I said this when we did a press conference together just before coming into the chamber. The Leader of the National Party would have been better advised to have observed our comments then rather than expend a question in the way that he just has. The text of the government's decision on this matter was that there would be no net establishment costs to participating retailers; these net establishment costs for participating retailers would be zero. That is a decision which we took at the time, and we stand by that decision because we recognised a couple of things. One is that there are already cost imposts on retailers in this sector because many of them are either required or are participating in -  - When cabinet considered this matter it was entirely mindful of any compliance costs faced by business. That is why we took the decision that we did. We are unapologetically a party that supports business, and we are unapologetically a party which believes that we have got to get behind our small business entrepreneurs out there rather than leave them in the lurch like those opposite have done by doing nothing to assist them in practical terms after 12 long years in office. We stand by the decision we took as a cabinet and we will honour that commitment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. I expect that the House will be interested to hear that the government will ban the importation of laser pointers above one milliwatt, with the regulation to take effect from 1 July. That means that lasers will, rightly, be treated like other dangerous weapons like knives, tasers and crossbows.Last year there were 325 laser incidents involving aircraft reported to the department of transport, and yesterday in Senate estimates the Office of Transport Security revealed that since January this year there had been 563 attacks. It is obviously concerning. Those sorts of numbers are of major concern considering the potentially devastating consequences an attack could have. Indeed, aircraft pilots are very anxious to see these changes.Obviously there are legitimate uses for high-powered lasers - in the construction and mining industries, in surveying and in astronomy. Therefore, under the government's new regulation, importers will have to obtain police authorisation from the relevant state or territory police force before applying for an import permit. Customs will work with them to make sure that they are aware of the new scheme and know how to access it.I do not pretend that this ban can immediately prevent all illegal use of lasers. There are thousands of them already in the community. Several jurisdictions - Victoria, Western Australia and the Northern Territory - have already introduced laws banning possession of lasers, and similar laws are at present before the parliament of New South Wales. Of course, this import ban has to be supplemented by these kinds of possession laws if it is to be effective.It is difficult to locate the source of laser lights directed at aircraft and therefore to apprehend offenders. There is often a long distance between the origin of a laser light and its target. Nevertheless, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Air Services Australia are working with the Australian Federal Police to improve procedures for detection of these incidents, and the AFP is working on a mapping system which will help narrow down the location of the light source.I thank Customs, the Attorney-General's Department and other agencies for their work in getting this ban quickly in place. Together with the state possession laws, involving significant jail terms, I am confident that the new Commonwealth regulation restricting laser importation will restrict the availability of laser devices and help us to change the culture which has led some people in our society to so disregard the potentially disastrous effects of their improper use.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Forde for his question. It is a very important question, and I know he shows a great deal of concern about job seekers in his electorate. The government wants to boost the nation's workforce to improve productivity and ensure that we stay globally competitive. Employment participation is one of the key elements of the government's war on inflation. This inflation legacy - the highest inflation in 16 years - was bestowed upon the Australian people by the previous Liberal government and needs to be tackled on all fronts. Increasing participation in our workforce, of course, is also a foundation of the government's social inclusion agenda. We know that having a job creates opportunities for financial independence and personal fulfilment.The previous government were lucky but lazy. An unprecedented mining boom, of course, led to a welcome fall in unemployment, but the Howard government sat back and did what all Tory governments always do: they let the nation's natural resources do the work for them instead of doing the work as a government. They ignored, for example, 20 Reserve Bank warnings on the skills crisis that besets this country. They constantly ignored the warnings of the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and other employer bodies who were crying out for the government to address the skills crisis.Of course, as we know, recently the shadow Treasurer has informed us, either in this place or publicly, that he does not believe there is a skills shortage in this country. The only skills shortages he likes to talk about are those that are exhibited by the Leader of the Opposition. That is the reality in this place. The only thing the shadow Treasurer likes to do is to get on the phone, and also use his email, to indicate how much he thinks the Leader of the Opposition is deficient as the leader of the party opposite. He is happy to talk about those skills shortages all day long. We know that the Howard government also ignored those who remain unemployed and failed to adjust employment programs to suit the new workforce circumstances. - I will give you a few facts, Sunshine. There is no greater reminder of the Howard government's policy inertia than the fact that the proportion of the very long-term unemployed more than doubled over the life of the Howard government. In 1999, one in 10 job seekers had been on income support for longer than five years. By 2007, this rose dramatically to almost one in four - one in four job seekers who had been on income support for more than five years. The current Job Network system as we know it is outdated and is being strangled by red tape. Job Network fails to sufficiently assist the highly disadvantaged people and we are going to address those concerns.The other thing that the Rudd government has done because of the failure of the previous government is to listen to employers who have been crying out for training to provide the proper skills for the vacancies that exist in this country. That is why this government has a plan to provide 238,000 training places for job seekers over the course of the next five years at the cost of $880 million. This is a massive boost in training for job seekers and it is something that employer bodies and employers have been asking for. It is something they asked the previous government to attend to and of course they failed. We know that is a critical area and we will address that.The second fundamental change in our approach to assisting job seekers is providing a work culture. The government will deliver a new system commencing in July next year that will instil a work culture through a no show, no pay rule. If you turn up and do what is required you will receive your benefit but if you do not turn up without reasonable excuse your income will be docked - just like a real job. Just like a real job, your income will be docked if you do not turn up without reasonable excuse. This approach will be more effective than the harsh and counterproductive imposition of the eight-week non-payment period. Not only does this current approach push job seekers further away from employment; there is mounting evidence to show it is leading to family breakdown, homelessness and impoverishment. We know that we have got this new proposal right.I welcome the support across the political spectrum with respect to our new proposal. We have certainly been applauded by the Brotherhood of St Laurence with respect to this particular matter. They believe it is a fair and more effective system. The Executive Director of the Institute of Public Affairs, John Roskam - no friend of the Labor Party - the former chief of staff of former education minister David Kemp has said he agrees with the Brotherhood of St Laurence in supporting the government's position with respect to this. He said that it is a better approach. He said:I agree with Tony Nicholson on this. If we can make the system more flexible it will get a better result, mainly to get people to stay engaged.So we have the Institute of Public Affairs and the Brotherhood of St Laurence and many other bodies coming out and supporting this system because we are attending to the training issues that were ignored by the previous government and a skills crisis that was ignored by the previous ministers that sit opposite. That is the reality. We are attending to that. - We are not into playing games like those opposite. We are about getting on with the business of government, addressing the skills crisis in this country and putting productivity back on the nation's agenda.</DOC>

 - You'll find out. - An opposition member - Now he's got a chance to read it. - I will read it out to you. - Mr Speaker, I will read it out to him. At the government's urging the FuelWatch scheme was designed in such a way as to minimise any compliance costs. There is no need for businesses to establish and maintain IT infrastructure to communicate with the ACCC under the approved FuelWatch scheme. They can use a toll-free number. They will still have to notify petrol prices to the ACCC but this is a once-a-day event and integral to the scheme as a whole. I compare that with present subscribers to Informed Sources. Do you know about Informed Sources? -  - Under Informed Sources those subscribers must subscribe and notify of any price changes many times a day. Under this scheme they will have to do it only once. Treasury has ensured that the legislation is simple and easy to comply with. There is no need to establish record-keeping IT systems or records on petrol prices. The ACCC will wear the cost and will keep the records.My attention has been drawn to a statement that has obviously just been made today by the Queensland Liberal leader Mark McArdle - he is a relatively new leader in Queensland. He was on ABC radio today and I am advised that he has contradicted his federal counterparts and expressed support for FuelWatch. Mr McArdle says FuelWatch is worth considering. He said:The issues around FuelWatch are very complicated, but certainly it is an initiative that appears to have worked in Western Australia and I think it should be looked at here in Queensland and across Australia as well.Go Mark! He said:I understand that my federal colleagues may have a different view, but that is their point of view.Here is the Liberal leader in Queensland saying FuelWatch is worth considering. So, Brendan, give Mark - the Liberal leader in Queensland - a ring on the toll-free number. Ring Mark McArdle. Mark McArdle knows what is in the interests of motorists. Mark McArdle has contradicted you -  - the Leader of the Opposition. He has contradicted the shadow Treasurer and he has contradicted his Queensland colleague the shadow minister for small business, and the member for Moncrieff. The Liberal leader in Queensland, the Liberal leader who introduced FuelWatch in Western Australia and the Liberal leader in New South Wales are all right. They support FuelWatch and so they should, and it is about time you got onside. - I was, Mr Speaker. - No, it is not, Mr Speaker. I table the statement from Mark McArdle.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. Further to the answer that I gave to the House yesterday, I would like to advise the House that work has resumed at Pheasant Wood following the inspection of the site by the French police who approved the continuation of the dig. However, at this stage no further discoveries have been made.The meeting of the Fromelles Evaluation Group agreed on a tighter security regime and agreed that work should continue until 13 June and that investigation should proceed on the future of the land. I should mention, however, that conditions at the excavation are proving quite difficult. The watertable is high, requiring pumps and waste water storage; the clay is very heavy and quite difficult to dig, so hand trowels are being used, and that is necessary for the care needed in such a delicate task. I have been overwhelmed by the public response to the decision to proceed with his dig.Yesterday I paid tribute to Mr Lambis Englezos for his support and, indeed, leadership in providing us with guidance as to where we might look. I would also like to give recognition today to General Leahy, Chief of Army, who acceded to requests to consider the evidence objectively and to obtain expert advice. It is indeed a salutary feeling for a modern commander to remain committed to recovering those lost in old battles. But I also want to recognise that this parliament is no stranger to the debate over the recovery of the missing; nor, should I say, are we strangers to the people who fought at Fromelles. Indeed, General 'Pompey' Elliott, who led the devastated 15th Brigade from Victoria on that fateful night in July 1916, tried to prevent the attack from proceeding and wept inconsolably the next morning at his 1,600 casualties, was a senator in the parliament for two terms. Sadly, though, he took his own life. That perhaps is an illustration of how disaster can ruin lives - not just through death in battle but through the horror of the memories. It is worth pointing to the difficulty that confronted him at that battle and what he said following it. He said not soon after:I presume there was some plan at the back of the attack but it is difficult to know what it was. I trust those who gave the order may be made to realise their responsibility.The general who gave the order, General Haking, is quoted as saying of that battle that the experience would do the Australians 'a great deal of good'. This was, of course, after General Elliott further said, some years later, about the battle, 'It was a wretched, hybrid scheme which might well be described as a tactical abortion.'In conclusion, I also want to remind the House that 1,300 men were missing after that battle. A mass grave for 410 Australians already exists at VC Corner, just down the road from Pheasant Wood. Even if the Pheasant Wood site is proven and approximately 170 lost souls are in fact identified as being Australian - and we think we may know who they are - many hundreds more remain missing. There are in fact 7,243 individual graves in France, Belgium and Gallipoli marked 'Known only to God'. I undertook yesterday to keep the parliament and the public informed of progress, especially the families, who have such a keen interest, and I will continue to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The extent to which that matter is being considered by the government is a question that we will address through the implementation of the policy. The extent to which the Constitution permits the federal government to legislate and regulate the affairs of unincorporated bodies, including small businesses, partnerships, sole traders and the like, is obviously one to explore in the development and implementation -  - but the government will ensure that Fuelwatch applies across the board and that the full gamut of constitutional powers will be utilised to ensure that it applies to corporations, unincorporated bodies, partnerships, sole traders and the like and, if it be necessary to discuss the matter with state governments, ensure that there are necessary arrangements in place. The arrangements will apply across the board to all those bodies - being corporations, sole traders or partnerships - selling petrol. That will be done utilising the full scope of the federal Corporations Law. It will be done using the full gamut of constitutional arrangements and it will be done in consultation with the states.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for the opportunity to acknowledge his deep interest in the welfare of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force and for the opportunity to share with the House a little more information about the logistics of our withdrawal from Iraq. I also thank the Leader of the Opposition, who, during his earlier statement, confirmed what former Prime Minister Howard said this morning - that is, if the coalition had won the last election, our combat troops would be remaining in Iraq. This is now a stark difference between us and the opposition. -  - I am about to clarify this point. The coalition seem confused. They agree on one hand that the job is done in southern Iraq but then argue that more needs to be done. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am just making the point that the Leader of the Opposition said they would be retaining trainers in Iraq and that that would require force protection. Force protection comes from combat troops. I join the Prime Minister in acknowledging the fact that in recent years the Australian Defence Force has been working hard in southern Iraq to ensure that we provide the Iraqi people with the security and stability they need to take control of their own destiny. Members of the Australian Army training team and the Overwatch Battle Group have now bedded down security in both Al Muthanna province and Dhi Qar province. At the same time, they have been training and building capacity within the Iraqi security forces, giving them the skills they need to enforce the rule of law in their own country.A ceremony to mark the completion of the mission was held yesterday at our base in Tallil. Importantly, the ceremony was attended by the governors of both Al Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces. Also there was the commander of the Iraqi Army's 10th Division, the commanders of Multi-National Force Iraq and Multi-National Security Transition Command Iraq and the commander of Multi-National Division (South-East). Dhi Qar becomes the second province handed over to Iraqi security forces, the first being Al Muthannna. Our soldiers have worked to ensure that the Iraqi people can look to their future with optimism.Our forces are now well into the process of packing up the extensive infrastructure we have established in Iraq and they are beginning to return home. Indeed, some of them have already returned home. They will continue to withdraw in groups over the course of this month, culminating in an official welcome home ceremony in Brisbane on 28 June. I ask all Australians to keep them in mind. The extraction process is not one without risk.The Australian government remains committed to a secure and stable Iraq. Our frigate in the gulf will continue to protect the sea lanes and Iraq's oil infrastructure. Our P3s will continue their surveillance work and our security detachment will continue to protect our diplomats and others in Baghdad. These elements, along with some headquarters logistics liaison staff, reflect our continued commitment to Iraq and to the Iraqi people.Today I join with the Prime Minister and, I am sure, with all members of the House in paying tribute to the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. I thank them for their commitment, dedication, courage and sacrifices. I also thank their families for their sacrifices and the anxiety they have lived with and suffered while their loved ones were away facing danger on a daily basis. We look forward to joining them on 28 June to welcome our troops home safely. All Australians can and should be proud of them.</DOC>

I understand that the advice has been sought, however, by Treasury and the Assistant Treasurer. The advice is that, insofar as unincorporated associations, partnerships and sole traders deal with fuel companies, which are in turn corporations, there is sufficient constitutional power to implement the Fuelwatch scheme.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As the House would be aware, the government has provided nearly $14 million of support for the Iraqi police service in the recent budget. That funding is to provide for forensic and technical training and for the development of management and leadership skills for up to 243 members of the Iraqi police service. Each year over the next three years approximately 81 Iraqi police service members will receive training under two courses, one in forensics and one in management.In the forensics stream, they will learn how to better manage crime scenes to identify, record and collect evidence so that it will not be contaminated when it is finally analysed. In other words, they will learn to become better at police work. Annually, 51 officers will undertake forensic and technical training in Canberra, with access to the specialist expertise of the AFP's forensic scientists. The AFP has come to be highly regarded for its ability to help law enforcement bodies in various countries to improve their investigatory techniques. It has provided training across our region in dealing with transnational crimes, including people smuggling, human trafficking and child sex tourism, and in surveillance techniques and disaster victim identification. Thirty Iraqi police - middle and senior level officers - each year for the next three years will also receive management and leadership training delivered through the Australian Institute of Police Management at Manly in Sydney.A team of four specialist AFP personnel went to Baghdad earlier this year to determine the feasibility of providing this training and a program management team is now being established in Australia to coordinate the training that will begin later in the year. Australia is continuing to support Iraq with reconstruction and humanitarian assistance. It is obvious enough that the establishment of strong law enforcement capacity will help Iraq achieve stability for its postwar reconstruction. In conclusion, there are significant challenges for this program to provide the Iraqi police force with improved skills. But they will be able to take those skills home and use them to train local police into the future, and we look forward to providing that support.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I think that the question is out of order, but I do not propose to make any more mention of your ruling. - I thank the honourable member for trying to ask this question a second time. I infer from it that the member thinks that the government's policy or my views are somehow intended to be a vote of confidence for the increase in petrol prices. I want to ask this of the shadow minister: is this the best question that he can come up with? Why isn't he asking me a question about the environment? Furthermore, why isn't he asking a question about climate change? If he wants to ask a question -  -  - Mr Speaker, those opposite have run out of substantial questions to ask. I refer to the shadow minister's question and say the following: in relation to the matters that any government would want to bring forward to deal with the question of petrol prices, this government has delivered. That is the first thing I would say. The second thing I would say is: in the absence of any concrete policy being advanced by the opposition on the wider matters of what likely costs or otherwise there may be in dealing with matters of climate change or the environment, you have had nothing to add to this point in time. You have just wasted your question.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. There could be few things more important in helping a nation recover from a difficult period than actually doing something about helping them provide food for their population. The Prime Minister during his visit to Iraq made the commitment for 100 Australian agricultural scholarships. Earlier this year, in January, we had a visit from my counterpart the Iraqi Minister for Agriculture, Dr Ali Husayn Kadim al-Bahadili. He referred in our meeting here to there being a history of agricultural cooperation between our nations spanning all the way back to the 1970s. The reasons are clear: we face many of the same challenges. Both Australia and Iraq have very high levels of evaporation, particular soil problems and soils and plants that lose the moisture they do obtain from what little rain they receive. Much of the Iraqi vegetation is, as a result, reliant on irrigation. For that reason our assistance to them with dryland agriculture has been of critical importance.For every economy at a time of world food shortage, this sort of cooperation is important. While agriculture is only seven per cent of Iraq's GDP, it does employ more than a quarter of their workforce. The minister, in his comments to me, identified Australia's expertise and referred to a number of Australian universities which he believed would be well placed to deliver courses which might be of assistance. Since then, such courses have been announced at the University of Western Australia, Curtin University, the University of Adelaide and the University of Queensland. They will be starting in September at a cost of $8.5 million.In addition to that, $50 million has been provided to facilitate transition to an open, market based economy through helping restore agricultural services and boosting agricultural production. Boosting skills and the capacity of a further 180 Iraqi officials who are working in the sector and in the field, supporting their veterinary services, implementing projects targeting good crop management and also assisting them with pest control practices in areas such as wheat and barley are all part of the equation in trying to make sure that we can help rebuild a better community for the Iraqi people.</DOC>

 - Interestingly on the question of diesel, the previous government, being in office for 12 years, did not have a sterling track record of acting on this. The assumption therefore, both on petrol prices and on diesel prices, is that in a matter of six months the newly elected government can turn around and undo what has occurred with movements on petrol prices and diesel prices over the last 12 years. I find this a remarkable statement, given that they had the reins of power for so long.Secondly, I would say this. When you look at our approach to a long-term response to the challenges of energy policy and petrol policy, it goes to these factors. One, global demand factors. What can be done when it comes to efficiency measures in developing countries, because when you have got the rise of China and of India you are pushing ahead with the impact on overall global energy prices? Then there are supply factors - and we have been debating the Iraq war here - and other factors which impact on supply. Then you go down to alternative fuels. Then you go down to fuel-efficient cars, and that includes diesel. It includes greater fuel efficiency in those cars which use petrol. It includes greater dependence on what we can do in a whole range of other measures which can assist fuel efficiency. On top of the above, you can also deal with the range of taxation imposts on families and motorists as well.These constitute the elements of a long-term policy to deal with what is a global problem affecting motorists and governments right around the world. What the government has embarked upon is a long-term response along each of these measures. It is not embarking on a course of action such as those opposite: cherry pick a piece here, cherry pick a piece there, turn to rank populism the next day, and hope that that constitutes a policy.</DOC>

 - Our economy in Australia is greatly shaped by developments across the world. We have seen since last August the unfolding of the global financial crisis, the roll-on effect in North America and western Europe and the United Kingdom, as well as what is happening in our own hemisphere and in Australia. You see also the impact which that has had not just on confidence but also in terms of real economic numbers. For example, I draw the House's attention to data released on Friday showing that consumer confidence in the United States has now fallen to its lowest level in 28 years. Furthermore, the US economy is also suffering from the worst decline in its housing market in a quarter of a century. And this all occurs at the same time as we have global oil prices running at near record levels.We all know the roll-on impact for Australia is significant, not just the impact in terms of global financial markets and confidence within the global financial services community but also, beyond that, the impact on the real economy. If we look at the flow-through impact on prices for Australian families, there is data released today in the TD Securities-Melbourne Institute Monthly Inflation Gauge which says that it rose by 0.3 per cent in May to be 4.5 per cent higher than a year ago. What this represents is a challenge not just for the economy overall but acutely for families struggling with cost of living pressures. And that, of course, forms the benchmark for how the government itself chooses to respond, because the enemy to all working families, all Australians doing it tough, all working Australians, is inflation and, in turn, its upward pressure on interest rates.When this government was elected, we had interest rates running at 16-year highs. We had an inflation rate running at 16-year highs and as a consequence there was a flow-through impact on rates. On the question of rates, we have had 12 consecutive interest rate rises, two of which have occurred since the election.We did not make an irresponsible promise at the last election - unlike the promise made by those opposite at the previous election - about keeping interest rates at record lows. But we understand this: to make it possible to bring downward pressure on rates, one of the important things is to ensure you bring about downward pressure on inflation. One of the important ingredients in that respect is to make sure you are prosecuting a responsible fiscal policy. That is why the budget brought down by the Treasurer and by the government, more broadly, is anchored in a $22 billion budget surplus. That is the cornerstone of economic responsibility: to ensure that the expenditure measures we adopted, and which were new, were funded by savings and, furthermore, to ensure that tax is now lower as a percentage of GDP than it was before and that expenditure as a proportion of GDP is now the lowest it has been since 1989-90. The alternative offered by those opposite is to conduct a $22 billion raid on the surplus, and that has one huge consequence for families: it flows through in terms of overall demand in the economy; it flows through in terms of inflation; and it flows through in terms of upward pressure on interest rates.Inflation remains the cornerstone of dealing effectively with the macroeconomic circumstances in Australia. This government believes in fighting the fight against inflation; the cornerstone of it is a $22 billion surplus. The cornerstone for the economic policies advanced by those opposite is instead a $22 billion raid on the surplus. I say this: as each one of the budget measures passes through this House and is debated in this House in the weeks ahead, those opposite will be faced with a single responsibility - that is, as you conduct one raid after another on the surplus, as you seek to vote against and pull out one further budget measure after another, the responsibility of those opposite is to identify what is the alternative source of savings. The failure to identity the alternative source of savings means one thing: that you will raid the surplus, put greater upward pressure on inflation and greater upward pressure on interest rates.So as members opposite vote against and vote down these revenue measures, or vote against or vote on the budget measures, their core responsibility in terms of economic discipline is this: what are the alternative savings measures? Failure to deliver them will result in one equation: walking away from working families and working Australians and saying that the 10 interest rate rises in a row that they delivered to families are of no consequence because they simply want to fuel the inflation fires further. Our response is one of responsible economic management. Our response is to make sure that we stand by a $22 billion budget surplus. Our response has its fundamentals in an attitude to economic management which says, 'Let's look after families, not just for the short term but for the long term, and deal effectively with the inflation monster, because if the inflation monster -  -  - which is obviously the object of great mirth on the part of those opposite - begins to wreak havoc on interest rates into the future, those opposite will be dealing with the consequences of their irresponsible actions one after another as they go in idle pursuit of political populism over economic responsibility.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. What I am aware of is that informed sources this morning released an analysis of the independent analysis by the ACCC. I am also aware that informed sources, whose business model depends, frankly, on the asymmetry of information between consumers and retailers, alleged that the ACCC's analysis did not take into account that period.I was informed by the ACCC today that those informed sources are wrong. I am informed that the ACCC's econometric work tested FuelWatch effectively starting in September 2001, as well as in January 2001. They found a lower price in the west, relative to the eastern capitals, whether FuelWatch was considered to have started on January 2001 or on September 2001. The ACCC is on the side of motorists. It always pays to take independent advice that is rigorously done by those who are paid to stand up for Australian consumers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Responsible economic management is central to the fight against inflation. We have some data that came out today from TD - their monthly inflation gauge - and this is what they had to say:Inflation remains the most pressing issue facing Australian policy makers.We on this side of the House understand that. We understand that responsible budgeting and investment in the future is needed to fight inflation. That is why we did deliver a responsible budget - a budget that cut back spending, a budget that began the vital task of investing in the future and addressing the capacity constraints that are putting upward pressure on inflation after years and years of neglect.The opposition on the other hand are content to try and blow a $22 billion hole in the surplus thereby putting further upward pressure on inflation and further upward pressure on interest rates. This is what the shadow Treasurer had to say on the Sunday program, just after the budget:Mr Oakes: There is not a single suggestion in Dr Nelson's speech of a saving.Mr Turnbull: ... that's true. There is no suggestion of a saving there, that's right ...And, of course, it is right. They have no credibility in this House when they pout around with supposed alternatives, because they cannot make a budget add up. The shadow Treasurer has had a bit more to say. This is what he said last week:We recognise there is an overall impact on the budget, and that is something that we _ take into account.How can you take it into account if you do not cost your policies? You cannot do it. The shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition are blowing a very big hole in the Liberal Party's economic credibility, and it is nothing more than a smoking ruin.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question, and I know about her deep concern for education in her electorate and for the future of the children in her electorate. I would like to answer the honourable member's question by referring to just two aspects of the Rudd Labor government's education revolution. This is a government that believes in delivering on its promises, and this is a government that believes in investing for the future, in ensuring that we equip this nation for the challenges of the future. With our education revolution we are doing both - delivering our promises and equipping this nation for the challenges of the future and particularly the challenge to lift productivity and participation. We are doing this across the board in education, but I want to say a few brief words about what we are doing in early childhood education and what we are doing to renew our vocational education and training sector and our universities. Of course, the education revolution includes schools as well, but I would like to briefly focus on early childhood education.This is a government that will deliver an additional $533.5 million over five years to support early childhood education - funding that supports our commitment to ensuring that every Australian child has access to an early learning program delivered by a university qualified teacher for 15 hours a week, 40 weeks a year in the year before formal schooling. This work is being led by the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare, the member for Bennelong. We believe it is vital, and all of the world research shows that if you can intervene early you can make a difference for life chances. Gone are the days when a Prime Minister - as the former Prime Minister did - would say early intervention is a big part of the answer and then do nothing. Gone are those days. Gone are the days when the former education minister, the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition, could say in one breath, 'Investment in early childhood is very, very important,' and in the very next breath disavow any Commonwealth responsibility for funding. We are investing because we believe in the best possible start for Australian children. We are also investing to make child care more affordable with our increases in the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs. This measure comes into effect on 1 July. I make it very clear that the government will be watching and the government will not tolerate unfair pricing practices amongst childcare providers related to the new rebate being delivered. The government will canvass all options to act if there is any evidence of unfair pricing practices.Our agenda - our education revolution - goes from the early years all the way through. This is a government that has invested $11 billion in our Education Investment Fund to renew our universities and our vocational education and training sector. This is a fund with $6 billion coming from the former Higher Education Endowment Fund joined by a new investment of $5 billion to enable renewal of the capital infrastructure of universities and vocational education and training. In the words of the Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, Ian Chubb, this new Education Investment Fund will 'allow us to draw down from the capital. That will make an enormous difference to the size and scope of the projects we do. We go from spending on maintenance to being able to plan for a world-class future'.Also gone are the days when an education minister - as the former education minister, the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition, did - can say, 'Our universities are in the best financial shape they've been in.' This government and ministers on this side of the House will not be making statements like that, and they ought not to be made, when this nation watched, under the Howard government, public investment in tertiary education decline by four per cent between 1995 and 2004 while in other OECD countries it increased by an average of 49 per cent. Those days of neglect of our education system are over. The legacy of the former government to the nation is one of slipping standards and a skills crisis. Our education revolution is there to invest in the future.I have watched as this House in recent days has canvassed a number of issues, and it has intrigued me that the opposition is now pretending to care about petrol prices when in government it did not care about them at all. The opposition is now pretending to care about cost-of-living pressures on families when in government it did not care about them at all.Interestingly, in opposition they do not even pretend to care about education. Here we are in June and I am still waiting to be asked the very first question by the shadow minister for education - the Marcel Marceau of Australian politics, still trying to work his way out of that imaginary glass box. Now presumably he will be seen in mimic eating -  -  - I am happy to conclude at that point. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question. The Commonwealth is engaging in infrastructure development after 12 years of neglect. We have already had three meetings of the COAG infrastructure working group, which is working through issues between the Commonwealth and the states to make sure that we get greater harmonisation of regulation to improve efficiency and productivity. For the first time, however, we are not just working between the Commonwealth and the states; we are engaging directly with the private sector to ensure there is national coordination of infrastructure. That is why we have established Infrastructure Australia, which I am pleased to report will have its first meeting this Wednesday here in Canberra.The council will be chaired by Sir Rod Eddington, who brings broad experience from the aviation, resources, energy and finance sectors. The advisory council's inaugural members bring a wealth of experience from planning, financing and regulation through to the construction and maintenance of infrastructure. The inaugural members include Ms Heather Ridout, the Chief Executive of the Australian Industry Group -  -  - who somehow is opposed by those opposite, it would appear. - The member for North Sydney is suggesting that Heather Ridout is biased. That is an interesting observation from the member for North Sydney. - I am sure the Australian Industry Group, whose members take in the construction and manufacturing industry, will be interested to hear that. Other members include Mr Phil Hennessy, the Queensland Chairman of KPMG; Mr Ross Rolfe, Senior Executive, Infrastructure, Babcock and Brown; Garry Weaven, the Chair of Industry Funds Management and also a director of Members Equity and of Pacific Hydro; and the Hon. Mark Birrell, a former minister in the Kennett government and Chairman of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, which comprises both public and private sector organisations engaged in the infrastructure industry. In addition, they will be joined by Professor Peter Newman, the Professor of Sustainability at Curtin University in Western Australia, Mr Terry Moran, Dr Ken Henry, Mr Jim Hallion, Mr Anthony Kannis and Dr Kerry Schott. Showing just how serious the government is about infrastructure investment, we have made an unprecedented commitment of $20 billion for the Building Australia Fund to invest in critical economic infrastructure.Infrastructure Australia's advice based on a rigorous analysis of costs and benefits will feed into the government's decisions about allocations from the Building Australia Fund. The government understands that a considered approach is vital to ensuring a well targeted investment strategy that boosts productivity, captures private sector investment funds and makes efficient use of existing infrastructure.</DOC>

 - I draw the honourable member's attention to the further econometric analysis undertaken by the ACCC, which was released last week, and its conclusions:The purpose of this econometric analysis has been to satisfy the ACCC that the introduction of a Fuelwatch scheme nationally would not, based on the experience in Western Australia, lead to consumers paying higher prices for petrol.From the econometric analysis, on a conservative basis, the ACCC can say that there is no evidence that the introduction of Fuelwatch in Western Australia led to any increase in prices and it appears to have resulted in a small price decrease overall.The government's position on this is as we have said before: based on this advice from the ACCC, drawing from the WA experience and based on this econometric modelling, the advice which was provided to us is that this actually represents up to a 2c a litre advantage to motorists. Secondly, and most importantly, it gives motorists choice. Within a metro area, where you have price variations on a given day of between 15c and 20c a litre, the consumer should have the same choice as the big oil companies. That is, consumers should have the power and information available to them to make the choices about where to get the best price for the day. Whereas those opposite argue that that power should uniquely be held by big oil, we stand up for consumer choice. Those opposite stand up for big oil.</DOC>

 - On 22 January 2008 the government directed the ACCC to commence a formal inquiry into grocery prices and report its findings by 31 July 2008. From the farm gate to the checkout counter we thought it was the right thing to make sure that working families are getting a fair deal at the supermarket. The ACCC is considering the industry's current structure and the nature of competition. -  - That ACCC inquiry was launched in January 2008 and it is to report by 31 July. The government has also asked the ACCC to undertake a monthly survey of grocery prices for a typical shopping basket of goods across Australia, and to establish a dedicated website on grocery prices. Also in April the government agreed to extend the time frames for the development of vacant commercial land under Australian foreign investment policy from 12 months to five years, as the government's interest in introducing -  - I just referred in the second part of my answer to the ACCC undertaking a monthly survey of grocery prices - if those opposite bothered to listen to the answer. The third part relates to how you go about bringing greater competition into Australia's grocery sector. As we indicated in April, we are dealing with how to make it easier for foreign investors who are bringing greater competition into the Australian retail grocery sector. One of the challenges we face here is the concentration within the sector. Major retailers such as Woolies and Coles are estimated to have a combined market share of over 70 per cent in some segments. The annual average growth in food prices in the 10 years to the March quarter 2008 was 3.9 per cent across the CPI headline of three per cent. Given that those opposite were in power for over a decade, what did they actually do on the question of greater competition power in the grocery sector? Let us go to some other data. In the 12 months to March 2008, food prices increased by 5.7 per cent, due to strong increases in dairy and other related products, and that contrasted, of course, with a lower CPI figure for the overall period. The question is: what did those opposite do about that increase? - The challenge for us is how to bring about greater competition and greater information for consumers - like on the question of petrol and like on the question of groceries. We stand on the side of consumers, as opposed to being on the side of big business - whether it is in the grocery sector or, in the case of 'big oil', whether it is in the petroleum sector. The figures show that over a decade there was a 3.9 per cent on average increase in excess of CPI in the price of food. Those opposite were in power for that period. Over the previous two years there was a 5.1 per cent increase in food compared with a CPI of 3.3 per cent. That was over the last two years. What did those opposite do about it? Nothing. In the 12 months to March 2008 food went up by 5.7 per cent. What did those opposite do about the price of groceries in that period of time? Nothing. The government actually stand for having a go. We stand for giving consumers some of the purchasing power within the marketplace which those opposite seem very happy extending only to those opposite. What we have here is a Liberal Party standing up for the distillery companies and alcopops, for the big oil companies when it comes to petrol prices and for the supermarkets when it comes to grocery prices. They stand condemned.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question. On Friday in Sydney, with the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, the member for Maribyrnong, I attended a meeting of Commonwealth, state and territory disability ministers. It was a very productive meeting. In fact, it was one of the most productive meetings that has taken place for many, many years in this area. It marked a new era of cooperation, the type of cooperation that Australia needs - particularly people with disabilities, their families and their carers - if we are to move beyond the divisions of the past to make sure that we can deliver the services that vulnerable groups in our community need.Thousands of people with a disability, their families and their carers will benefit from the $1.9 billion boost in funding that was agreed on Friday. State and territory disability ministers agreed to deliver $900 million in funding on top of the Australian government's $1 billion commitment. The good news is that this is money on top of the service provision in the last Commonwealth state/territory disability agreement. This is a very significant step forward for Australia's disability system, and I want to highlight the particular improvements to services that will result.The $1.9 billion is going to deliver around 2,300 in-home support services, 2,300 supported accommodation places, 9,900 individual support packages and, very importantly, 10,000 much-needed respite places in a range of forms across Australia. Ministers also agreed to start delivering immediately the 309 new supported accommodation places with the $100 million in capital that the Prime Minister announced on 4 May would be given to the states and territories for this purpose. So in total there are going be 24,500 places that will begin to ease the anxiety of people with disabilities, their families and their carers, many of whom have waited far too long for this support.There have been some positive responses to the announcement and the agreement that we arrived at on Friday. The convenor of the disability advocacy group the CSTDA Alliance, Sue Harris, said on Friday, 'It gives people hope.' Carers Australia said in a statement:... the new agreement will bring greater certainty to the lives of families who had been left floundering for far too long.Carers Australia President Pam Webster went on to say:This is a fantastic achievement for everyone concerned. We would like to acknowledge all the hard work that has produced this important milestone.I echo those remarks and, in particular, give my thanks to our state and territory colleagues and to the parliamentary secretary for disabilities - who, I have to say, is an outstanding advocate for people with a disability. It really does demonstrate what can be delivered when people work together.I would note, however, that Pam Webster did go on to say - and I think she is right:While this is a very significant announcement, the continual growth in the need for carer support means the job is not yet done.We agree. The government do understand that this is just a first step. More does need to be done. There were other measures in the budget. In particular, I want to draw the House's attention to the fairer rules for carer payment (child). This will help 19,000 parents of children with profound disabilities, something they also had been waiting a very long time to receive. Unfortunately, under the previous government, we had disability ministers meetings completely breaking down, with ministers unable to come to an agreement. And, of course, it was always descending into the blame game. The new government have an approach based on cooperation. We intend to get things done - to deliver for people with disabilities, for their families and for their carers.</DOC>

 - When a new government takes over, one of the first things that happens is that PM&amp;C provides you with temporary staff. It occurred in our case, and I am sure it occurred when you guys took over back in 1996 - that is the first point. I am glad, though, that you raised the question of staff, because what we have done is actually slash the number of ministerial staff by 30 per cent. Do you know what that saves the taxpayer? It is $15.4 million in the current financial year. We stand for saving the taxpayer some dollars; you stand for wasting the taxpayers' dollars.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. Since last Thursday, the excavation at Fromelles has continued in five pits. Also since that time I have spoken to Major General O'Brien, the project manager, who briefed me on the progress of the excavations and the discussions with local authorities. He also confirmed with me the difficulties involved with the excavation as well as the higher level of media interest.I have subsequently been advised that remains of up to three individuals have been found in pit 1 and of five in pit 5. I hasten to add, though, that these remains are bones; there is no body tissue. As well as bones in the pits, many artefacts have been found, including buttons, which we understand may have been from German groundsheets in which bodies may have been wrapped; a bayonet scabbard of an Allied type; and some live rounds of .303 ammunition - none of which is distinctly Australian. Work is continuing carefully, particularly given some of the risks that more ordnance might be uncovered.As well as continuing to remove the clay from the top of the pits, a trench will be dug beside the pits, conditions permitting, to allow a cross-sectional view which will help assess the condition of any remains and the possible number of individuals buried at the site. I say 'conditions permitting' because this ground is waterlogged and there are serious safety issues for trenching which have to be dealt with. With respect to the future, I wish to thank all of those relatives, some 80 thus far, who have registered their family name on the Defence website. I can also advise that my colleague the Minister for Defence spoke to his British counterpart in Singapore over the weekend about this issue. Clearly, that is important, given the fact that we believe a majority of the bodies that are at this site may well be British. With respect to options for the future, the Fromelles Evaluation Group, comprising Australian and British officials, will continue to consider the options for detailed advice in due course.Also, on the matter of identity, I can advise that we do have a German list of names of those buried by the German army after the battle, we believe, at this site. While this list is considered authentic, some reconciliation is needed, though we may never know, obviously, the exact identities of the Australians buried, let alone those of the British. I have said that it is too early to consider the issue of the possible identification and fate of each individual until technical advice is available and detailed consideration is given by the Australian, British and French governments. I repeat, however, that there are also 410 unknown Australians buried in a mass grave at VC Corner, just down the road, as well as some 7,243 unmarked graves in France, Belgium and Gallipoli. Like these, it is possible the identity of those at the Fromelles site may remain known only to God.</DOC>

 - I did not say that at all. I did not make a statement of that kind with respect to public servants. In fact, the statement I made was with respect to the work ethic of the former government, actually asking the question of why it is that the Rudd government is setting a very strong agenda. The answer is very simple, and that is that there is an awful lot to do. The thrust of my comments yesterday related to the former government and that, if there were public servants struggling with additional work under the new government, the reason is that the former government did not do very much. My predecessor sat around and watched the cows come home. In the last four budgets, there were not any savings at all - no savings in the last four budgets. What was the Minister for Finance doing in the former government? Where were the savings? There is just one example. The Rudd government have a big, nation-building, reforming agenda. We are committed to working hard. We have a lot of things to do. The former government did very little and that is what my comments on Insiders were directed to. - Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There is a very simple question at the heart of the government's commitment to reforming wheat legislation and wheat marketing, and it is this: should wheat growers be allowed to choose who they sell their wheat to? The National Party has decided that the answer to that is no, but the problem is that we have to provide certainty to wheat growers. Wheat growers are now at a time when many of them either have planted or are about to plant and, understandably, want some certainty in what the marketing rules will be for the next harvest. Against that, we have the unusual situation where the shadow minister does not speak on behalf of the opposition. - What has not been understood by the members of the National Party is that the current legislation, post 30 June, changes everything. After 30 June this year, if we as a parliament do not change the current rules, all the protections that the National Party believe they want to keep in place will disappear. The ministerial veto will go. The concept of the single desk that the National Party are claiming they want to keep will actually disappear under the current legislation. The current legislation leaves us with the worst of all worlds, so the National Party have said, 'We'll take that one.' Unfortunately, we have now waited for months and months to find out whether or not that reflects the position of the opposition in order to be able to provide certainty for wheat growers.On 20 March, I wrote to every member of the opposition guaranteeing that they could have private briefings with my department. Those briefings were provided on a confidential basis and remain so. But the question remains: do the Liberals agree with the Nationals? An exposure draft was put out and we still could not find out. There was a report from the Independent Expert Group, but we still could not find out if the Liberals agreed with the Nationals. Then Liberal senators added comments to the end of a Senate report and we still could not find out whether the comments of those Liberal senators matched the position of the Liberal Party. So not only do we not know whether the Liberals agree with the Nationals; we still at this moment do not know whether or not the Liberals agree with the Liberals.We have been trying to work out what on earth it is that unites those opposite. Then Senator Sue Boyce let us know. In a particularly impressive publication called 'Effective Opposition', which surprisingly was made by a member of the opposition in the federal parliament, Senator Sue Boyce let us know what the main game was. She said, 'It's full of tips and strategies to help maintain our focus at branch and SEC level on the main game - beating the Labor Party.'What happened to the main game being a plan for the future? What happened to the main game being providing choice for people who grow wheat? It is actually their wheat; it does not belong to the National Party. It is their wheat and they should have the choice of who they sell it to. Who they export their wheat to is a choice that the government believes they should have. It is a choice that the National Party believes should be denied to them. It is a choice that one day, if there is any interest in providing certainty for wheat growers, the opposition will declare a position on.</DOC>

As the Minister for Ageing I am very proud to be representing the seniors in this parliament. This government has done more for older Australians than those on the other side did for all of the 12 years they were in government. In the next four years, we will be putting $40 billion into aged care services. When it comes to older Australians, that side of the House see them as a problem; we see them as a great opportunity. The wisdom, the experience and the knowledge of older Australians are vital. What did the previous Minister for Ageing, the member for Sturt, have to say about older Australians? He said he did not particularly like them. This new federal government -  -  - I was in fact quoting the member for Sturt when he was the Minister for Ageing. - Certainly, I shall withdraw it. I want to conclude by saying that this new federal government is committed to providing services for older Australians. We will invest more in aged care than any previous government and we are very proud of that achievement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Werriwa for his question. Members will be pleased to know that an Australian Federal Police investigation spanning several continents has culminated in the arrest of 15 people and the dismantling of a criminal syndicate involved in the global production of narcotics. Nothing could more clearly demonstrate the importance of the AFP's close relationship with its international law enforcement partners. The operation required the AFP to work closely with Australian jurisdictions and officers from the Netherlands, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Thailand. Last week 12 people were arrested in the Netherlands and one in Thailand and yesterday saw the arrest of two people in Sydney, including a senior investigator with the New South Wales Crime Commission, Mark Standen.It is alleged that these men were part of a conspiracy to import 600 kilograms of the precursor chemical pseudoephedrine with the potential to produce 430 kilograms of methamphetamine - that is, ice - with a wholesale value of $120 million. That is a wholesale value not a street value. The AFP has also estimated that, if those drugs had reached the community, they would have caused $140 million worth of harm in terms of social and welfare payments, medical treatment and policing.Yesterday, both men were charged with various offences relating to conspiracy to supply and import commercial quantities of a prohibited drug and of perverting the course of justice. The arrest of Mark Standen has not surprisingly generated high media interest but, as the matter is now before the courts, the comments I am able at present to make are rather limited. However, in May last year the investigator became a person of interest to the AFP and since July 2007 the AFP and the New South Wales Crime Commission have been jointly investigating Standen's alleged involvement in the syndicate. Evidence of his alleged connections to that syndicate came about, as I have said, because of intelligence received from the AFP's international law enforcement partners as well as through its own investigations. It will be alleged that he used his position to provide advice to the syndicate on law enforcement methods and information on drug enforcement activities. These are allegations that are profoundly serious against someone in such a position.I am entirely conscious that it is critical to the Australian public to have confidence in our law enforcement agencies. The AFP has managed this highly sensitive investigation with very great professionalism. In fact, Dutch authorities have publicly stated that their belief in the AFP's capabilities was one of the main reasons that they - that is, the Dutch authorities - allowed such a long and resource intensive investigation to continue in circumstances that would have been, in the absence of such trust, quite untenable. The investigation is ongoing but, on behalf of the Australian government, I congratulate the AFP on its outstanding work in this matter.</DOC>

 - Australia's pensioners, carers and those on retirement incomes are doing it tough because of the impact of cost-of-living pressures coming off the rising price of oil, the rising price of groceries and other costs as well. That is why the government has been keen in the context of this budget to allocate an additional $5.2 billion for pensioners over the next five years. Firstly, seniors will be $900 a year better off in 2008 as a result of this budget. That means that there will be not only a $500 bonus but, in addition to that, a commitment to increase the utilities allowance from $107 per year to $500 per year. Secondly, when it comes to carers, through an additional allocation of $1.1 billion over the last budget, those carers in receipt of both the carers payment and the carers allowance will receive up to $2,100 a year in addition to what was received previously. Thirdly, those receiving disability support pensions will now be receiving the utilities allowance of $500 a year for the first time, and that results in an additional $1.3 billion compared to the previous budget.I make those points very clearly because these represent net additions to what was provided by the previous Howard government in each of these areas. We on this side of the House are acutely conscious of the need to make sure that retirement incomes policy in the future enables those on pensions in particular to properly plan for their retirement. That is why the Henry commission of inquiry has a reference which specifically deals with retirement incomes policy. We await the outcome of their report, which is due in February next year.</DOC>

 - The government is committed to responsible economic management. It is committed to working out how we can assist working Australians, working families and those who are doing it tough and are under financial pressure right now and how we can plan for Australia's long-term economic future. Part of planning for our long-term economic future means moving forward on the whole regulatory agenda. If there was one loud and clear signal which came forward from the 2020 Summit from those in the business community it was this: they want Australia to move in the direction of a seamless national economy. They are expecting leadership from the national government on moving in the direction of a seamless national market.One of the areas where we can make progress is the financial services sector. My colleague the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy who has responsibility for deregulation, together with the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, is currently working with the states and territories on 27 items of legislation in order to deal with the regulatory complexity which currently confronts businesses operating in multiple state and territory jurisdictions and, as a consequence, to do what we can to reduce the compliance burden and to reduce the overall cost therefore of running a business across the country.I draw the House's attention in particular to the green paper on financial services and credit reform released today by the Treasurer and Minister Sherry, because this is an important step forward in a critical area of necessary regulatory reform - that is, improving the regulation of financial services and credit and also seeking to target unscrupulous practices and to promote competition. For example, right now, under our existing regulatory arrangements, some consumers receive poor or inadequate advice in areas such as mortgage brokering, which may lead to them overextending themselves into debt, paying extortionate fees or being sold an unsuitable product for their circumstances. That is one example. Secondly, some consumers are unknowingly playing Russian roulette when they buy certain financial products like margin loans, because how you purchase a product determines how it is regulated. With such products becoming more mainstream, this is simply not good enough. The problem we have -  - and I note some of the interjections from those opposite - is that, when they say this is a problem for the states, the problem is that we have such uneven regulation across the states. This is why we have found it necessary to move in the direction of this important green paper which will have its conclusion through the Council of Australian Governments as a necessary national reform. Right now, current regulation is duplicated, patchy and confusing. In fact, it is a complete dog's breakfast. It is time we had some decent, long-term economic reform to ensure that this sector is also provided a proper pathway to the future.Of course, one of the contentious matters which will arise in the debate on this financial services reform green paper is how we cover the extent of the financial services market. Do we simply include the mortgage credit or do we include the entire extent of consumer credit as well? This is a legitimate matter for debate with the financial services sector, and that is why this green paper will now become the subject of discussion and negotiation with the financial services sector over the months ahead. We will then move to deliberation of a decision with the Council of Australian Governments. This is a necessary step forward if we are to move towards our national objective of a seamless national economy and a seamless national market. It is very necessary if Australia is to maintain its long-term global competitiveness.If you go to what people in the sector are saying you can see that it is pretty important to see where the business community is coming from. Luke Lawler, a senior advisor from Abacus, the Association of Building Societies and Credit Unions, has said, 'The exclusion from the Corporations Act of credit is a kind of arbitrary division. It is not really logical why credit is not there.' The Consumer Credit Legal Centre has said something similar. Gordon Renouf, head of policy at CHOICE, also said something similar. In fact, we had this statement from another individual in the middle of last year:... we would say to the States that if they want to refer powers to us, then we would be willing to step in and take their powers and to legislate in this area.That was Peter Costello on 19 August 2007.The challenge here is to make practical steps forward to achieve a uniform national market. When it comes to consumer credit and mortgage credit, I think both Australian consumers and the business community across the nation have a realistic expecta-tion of government that we can achieve enduring, lasting national reform in this area. After 12 years, those opposite achieved no outcome on this.We are advocating a program of reform here through cooperative endeavour with the states and territories. Once the green paper reaches its conclusion through the Council of Australian Governments, the government will be bringing forward significant reforms in this area because we are committed to long-term economic reform, long-term microeconomic reform and long-term regulatory reform in order to create a seamless national market in this nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Warringah for his question, which I did not think was a particularly amusing one. -  - Obviously the question of childcare fees is one that impinges on working families who need to pay for child care. Maybe my memory fails me, but if there was some amazingly effective Howard government initiative to deal with childcare fee increases then I do not seem to recall it. -  - I do not recall it. So for 12 years - the member for Warringah being in the cabinet for most of that period - nothing effective was done on childcare fee increases. In contrast, what is this government delivering? - The Leader of the House reminds me that I have been asked the question by Mr 'People Skills', but I did not think we had promoted him to being the single voice of the people! But, in any event, what this government is doing to deal with childcare fee increases is to increase -  -  - Presumably lunch started at 12 noon and finished at five minutes to two! - I am endeavouring to answer the member's question. What the government is doing to deal with childcare fee increases is to increase the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent on 1 July. This means that families in all income levels with children in approved care will get increased government assistance - that is, the amount that they pay for child care will be reduced. Obviously there have been media reports in the last few days about childcare operators considering fee increases. We need to remind ourselves, of course, that childcare fee increases happen from time to time and that, of course, there are increases in costs in child care. When there are legitimate increases in costs, that is reflected in fees. But, even with some of the percentage figures we have seen named in the media in recent days - and there have been a variety of figures, including figures in the range of two to three per cent, suggested as likely fee increases - with the government's increased childcare tax rebate working families would still be better off.What we have indicated to childcare operators is that the government will be watching prices, something the Howard government neglected to do because it was not concerned at all about this issue. We will be watching prices, and we are putting operators on notice that, if any evidence emerges of unfair pricing practices, the government will be ready to use the powers at our disposal to deal with the matter.We are talking, at this stage, about working with industry to ensure that any price increases are legitimate reflections of increased costs. I would have thought that every member in this House would want to send the same message on behalf of working families to childcare operators: that every member in this House would want to see working families benefit to the maximum extent from the government's new childcare tax rebate initiatives. All I can conclude from this question - and, most particularly, from the interjections during it - is that members opposite could not care less one way or the other. Well, despite their indifference, the government will be getting on with the job of increasing the childcare tax rebate and ensuring that working families enjoy the benefit of the increased rebate.</DOC>

 - Yesterday the Treasurer announced that the Rudd government intends to introduce legislation to establish a Financial Claims Scheme that will ensure that most depositors and insurance policyholders will have quick access to their money in the very unlikely event that a financial institution fails. The FCS follows through on advice that has been received variously from the Council of Financial Regulators - which includes APRA, ASIC, the Treasury and the Reserve Bank - dating back as far as 2005, the recommendations from the HIH royal commission of 2003, and advice from the global Financial Stability Forum earlier this year.Until now, Australia has been one of only two OECD nations with no scheme of this kind designed to protect depositors and policyholders in the unlikely event of an institution failing. Early access to money is very important, obviously, for Australian families and working people in order to ensure that they can continue to conduct their ordinary life business. When an institution fails, immediately its existing funds and assets are frozen. In some cases, it can take a very long period before all of the matters associated with its failure are resolved, the disputes settled and money freed up.This will ensure that up to $20,000 in the case of each depositor will be made available by the government, we expect within a week of any such event occurring. That will ensure that individuals and families are not disadvantaged in the short term and that their existence and activities of their normal life are not disrupted unduly by any such failure. It is a very important protection to ensure that we do not again see some of the events that have occurred in the past. There have been one or two instances in recent times, HIH being the most recent, where issues of this kind have emerged. It is very important to ensure that the knock-on effects of such occurrences are minimised. Also, it is desirable to avoid totally relying on ad hoc, post facto arrangements were such events to occur.The government is also accepting recommendations of the Council of Financial Regulators that a number of changes should be made to the regulatory framework to allow better management by the regulatory bodies in the event of any institution failing. These measures will enable the regulators to act comprehensively and decisively in dealing with that situation. They will add to their capacity to recapitalise a distressed bank, credit union or building society, whatever institution may be involved.I should emphasise that Australia's financial system and regulatory regime is sound. We have rarely seen instances in this country's history of losses as a result of financial institution failure, but eternal vigilance is essential in this area. These enhanced arrangements to deal with such a crisis are going to be very important in the unlikely event that something of that kind does occur to provide even greater security and comfort to ordinary Australians when and if such an event occurs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Obviously the government has a range of policies in the childcare area -  -  - if you wait for the end of the sentence, you never know what you might learn - and the government subsidises child care through a variety of means. One is the childcare benefit; the other is the childcare tax rebate. Obviously, the government makes these payments available. The childcare industry is aware that the government is a subsidiser of childcare fees. That means, of course, that there is an interconnection between the government's policies and intentions and these payments. What I have said to childcare operators is that we want to work with industry. I would remind the member opposite that these questions have been motivated by press reports where one operator on one day was reported as considering a price hike in the vicinity of 10 per cent. That same operator today was reported as saying that no decision had been taken. Other operators were reported as saying that fee increases could be in the order of two to three per cent - that is, they could be in the order of the sorts of fee increases that we have seen reflective of real cost changes. At this stage, when the material from operators in the public domain at the moment is these sketchy reports, the government is indicating to operators that it will be watching to see -  
Opposition members - Watching! - It is interesting we are talking about child care, because the behaviour is bordering on the childish - this from members opposite who in government did what? Remind me. What did you do about childcare fee increases? The answer is nothing. Absolutely nothing was done by members opposite in the cabinet room. So against a government that did absolutely nothing on this question, what is this government signalling? It is signalling to operators that it will be seeing what happens with prices and, if there is evidence - as opposed to press reports, which are different from one day to the next - of unfair pricing practices, the government will canvass the options at its disposal to act. We want childcare operators who, at this stage, would be considering their fee settings to understand the government's policy predisposition in this area. We want to be very clear with industry about that. We will be working with industry and it is our policy intention to not see unfair pricing practices in the area, to see CCTR increases passed on. We do understand that, as there are cost increases in child care, there are naturally changes that flow through. We are talking about unfair pricing practices.I compare that with what happened with members opposite. Presumably, if members opposite were still making the decisions today, we would have CCTR still at 30 per cent, not increasing to 50 per cent on 1 July. We would not have working families benefiting at all from an increase in CCTR. We would see, if there were childcare price increases on 1 July - if members opposite were making the decisions - working families go backwards whereas under this government, because of the changes in CCTR from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, working families are going to get relief from the pressure of childcare costs. We on this side of the House think that is appropriate; on that side of the House they are playing kindergarten games about some words, but they have no policies, no plans.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for her question. I can inform the House that the Rudd government has taken a new direction to meet the challenge of climate change, a direction which takes responsibility for Australia's sustainable future. It is a new direction which comes after 12 years of inaction from a coalition government that refused to take responsibility for Australia's future and, even more clearly - after 12 months of setting out on this side of the House - it is a comprehensive plan to tackle climate change. This government is delivering on its commitments.Let us be clear: Australia is extremely vulnerable to climate change impacts. Some members may have seen a recent edition of the respected journal Nature which reported the increasing impact that climate change will have on our environment, on the biophysical limits of the environment that we all have to live within. Just this morning we read that houses on the coast at Taree, in New South Wales, are facing mounting coastal erosion pressures. These climate change impacts are real. They affect us, they affect our environment and they affect our economy.At the last election Australians were offered two distinct approaches for the future. In the international arena we had a choice between refusing to ratify the Kyoto protocol, thus being a spoiler in international climate change negotiations, and ratifying the protocol, which was the first official act of the Rudd Labor government. This gave Australians a seat at the negotiating table where we now, through Minister Wong and other ministers, play a significant role. We had a choice between a Prime Minister who previously said a five-degree increase in temperatures would be 'uncomfortable for some' and the Rudd Labor government, which accepts the science, listens to the experts and acts accordingly.Australians chose between a Liberal Party with no target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Rudd Labor government, which is committed to the target of 60 per cent of 2000 levels by 2050. On emissions trading, the Liberal Party's predawn conversion was a scheme that the previous Prime Minister spent years blocking and then grudgingly accepted and which would have started in 2012. Under the Rudd Labor government Australians will be implementing in 2010 a scheme that we should have had years ago. Whilst they were talking down the science they were talking up the nukes, with Mr Howard's nuclear power crusade and a commitment to repeal nuclear legislation and bring nuclear reactors to a suburb near you. - If you want to have a clear understanding of where the previous government were on these issues, look at where they put their money instead of their mouth - they spent as much on taxpayer funded political advertising as they actually delivered on climate change. If the coalition had been returned to power, we would not be standing here talking about $1 billion to help households and communities tackle climate change, about low-interest green loans -  - about rebates for energy-saving insulation or about accelerating energy efficiency. Instead, we have had scaremongering from the Leader of the Opposition and symbolism from the member for Flinders, who in June last year presented two Wollemi pine trees to the King of Sweden - a gift that was described by the former government as 'a symbolic gesture of action being taken to tackle climate change'. Wollemi pines become fig leaves when you examine the former government's attitude and delivery on climate change.Australia now has a government that is taking a new direction, taking responsibility for tackling climate change, taking responsibility for sound economic management and taking responsibility for ensuring that Australians have a sustainable future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I have indicated that the government are sending a message to childcare operators. We want that message to be heard. We expect it to be heard. We want working families to benefit from increased CCTR. We want working families to have the pressure of childcare costs in part lifted from their shoulders by additional government investment in CCTR. Obviously, as a government we are concerned if there are any suggestions of unfair pricing practices. We are sending a very clear message about unfair pricing practices.As I indicated to the member before in my answer to his last question, the matter has been in the media. There have been reports that have been of a contradictory nature about likely childcare price increases. We are obviously going to work with industry. We are going to see what the evidence is. But we want to send a message to childcare operators that we do not want to see unfair pricing practices.At the same time - and I am glad the member has a new-found interest in child care - we are addressing the supply constraints in child care, which have put pressure on. They include insufficient workforce. That is why as part of our action on child care we have not only increased CCTR from 30 per cent to 50 per cent; we have taken steps to expand the childcare workforce including through fee relief for people who want to be childcare workers, new investments in childcare early educators and, of course, our proposals to expand the number of childcare centres by 260. - I am responding to the question and I am indicating the supply-side measures that would make a difference, including the new 260 childcare centres that the government is committed to delivering.From an opposition with no solutions in this area when they were a government, what I anticipate is that the shadow minister opposite wants to go on some cheap fear campaign to raise concern amongst parents that either the changes in CCTR will not benefit them or for some reason their subsidy or benefits will be cut off. Such a fear campaign would be a grossly un-truth-ful act of irresponsibility. This is a government that is delivering CCTR changes and making a very simple and legitimate point, and one I am surprised is not unanimous across this House - that is: we do not want to see unfair pricing practices in child care.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. I know that she is interested in fairness and balance in Australian workplaces. I am asked about the progress of the government's substantive workplace relations changes. Of course, the government have already delivered our transition act, which stopped the making of new Australian workplace agreements. In relation to the substantive legislation, we are doing the thing the Howard government refused to do - that is, we are consulting on the details to make sure that the legislation is right, not a complex mess. Not only are we going to be delivering the policies we promised the Australian people; we want to make sure that the legislation is in an appropriate form and not the sort of complex mess that caused confusion amongst employers and employees.Of course, apart from bringing industrial relations extremism to this country, what we know came with the Howard government's Work Choices changes was an avalanche - a blizzard - of advertising material. Just yesterday in the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations estimates hearing, we were told that the previous government spent a staggering $137 million on promoting Work Choices - $137 million ripped out of the purses and wallets of hardworking Australians to featherbed a desperate government and to try and prosecute its political agenda with money that ought to have come from the Liberal Party. This staggering total included $44 million on the first Work Choices advertising campaign, $58 million on the second Work Choices advertising campaign and $35 million on the employer adviser program.I am asked: what would be the effect of a return to the Howard government's workplace relations policies? Given that blizzard of advertising, it pays to recheck some of the things that were said in the Work Choices advertising by members opposite when they were in government. I would specifically seek to remind the House of the example of Billy. We used to hear a lot about Billy last year. Billy was a case study in the Work Choices propaganda. Billy was a minimum wage worker who lost all of his protected award conditions for not one cent of compensation: overtime, gone; penalty rates, gone; annual leave loading, gone - all of his award conditions without one cent of compensation. Of course, members opposite defended as fair and reasonable that a minimum wage worker should lose all of those award conditions for not one cent of compensation.It amazes me, given their defence of that policy, why it never occurred to them in government: how did Billy pay for his petrol? How did Billy pay for his mortgage? How did Billy pay for his -  - 'He had a job,' the Deputy Leader of the Opposition says - exactly what the Prime Minister said in defending Billy's case as fair and reasonable. I thank her for her confirmation that driving people back to minimum wages with no award conditions is still Liberal Party policy. I thank her for that confirmation.There we have it: a Liberal Party still committed to Work Choices. If the Liberal Party are still committed to Work Choices, they are committed to that rip-off of working people. All of the carry-on we have seen from members opposite about their supposed concerns about cost-of-living pressures on working Australians, supposed concerns about petrol, supposed concerns about childcare costs and supposed concerns about grocery costs - all of this melts away in an avalanche of hypocrisy given they are committed to minimum wage workers bearing the brunt of their industrial relations extremism.Someone needs to explain to members opposite that the equation for working families is one that equals: what comes in in the pay packet and what goes out. As to what comes in in the pay packet, they believe in having laws which enable it to be cut for those in the workplace with the least bargaining power. - The party of Work Choices cannot be heard to say they care about cost-of-living pressures on working families. They were the ones who brought that industrial relations extremism, which hurt so many -  - Come in spinner! 'The country's in great shape.' You still believe in Work Choices, don't you! You cannot stop yourself calling out in support of it. The party of industrial relations extremism on display. - Can I conclude on this: if I inadvertently indicated you may be an industrial relations extremist, Mr Speaker, I certainly apologise for that. We know where the industrial relations extremists are in this parliament and they are sitting over there.</DOC>

 - I have been reading the National Audit Office report, a report which has taken six months because it is 1,200 pages of a litany of the rorts that occurred under the Regional Partnerships program under the maladministration of those opposite. I did appear on the Sunrise program three weeks ago. No questions were asked at the time, but they are a bit slow in the National Party. On that program they raised the issue of a playground. It was a playground in Bundaberg in the electorate of the member for Hinkler. I am happy to talk about that playground and the circumstances because the discussion that I had with David Koch was about that playground. I rang the proponent of this particular project. This is a proponent who has raised substantial amounts of money through Rotary, through the local community, and who was given approval by the former government under Regional Partnerships.One of the deals that comes with the contract once it has been fulfilled for Regional Partnerships is that there has to be signage that the Australian government was providing funds for a particular project. For this project, which had not been contracted, for which there was no finalisation of arrangements, there was a sign on the fence of the playground saying 'Funded by the Australian government'. One of the things that the Rudd government is committed to is making sure that the victims of the incompetence and maladministration of the Regional Partnerships program do not miss out. That is why we have a process whereby those approved but not contracted programs will have until 31 July to complete their contract but with proper financial scrutiny, including from the department of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. That needs to occur.Also in Bundaberg under Regional Partnerships there was an application from Bundaberg City Council for the turtle interpretive centre. It was in the same town under the same program. The council wrote to the federal government on 15 March requesting - because the Queensland government had given $770,000 - that the grant from the federal government be made up to $576,400. On 15 March the council said it wanted $576,000. But what happened with taxpayers' funds? On 30 April the Regional Partnerships ministerial committee approved $1,114,300. You apply for $576,000 but you get $1.1 million approved. The minister sent a letter to the council informing the council of the grant. The member for Hinkler went and announced $1.1 million, even though the council only wanted $576,000. The then government found out about this and, on 4 May 2007, an email from the minister's office, from the adviser, to the department said, 'I have just got off the phone from a very angry Mr Neville who has announced twice the amount that the council wanted for this project.' There was a bit of a problem. This was taxpayers' funds they were concerned about. The ministerial adviser then went on - and this is the real area of concern; this is the punchline for those who know it is coming and the member for Hinkler knows it is coming - and said, 'At this point there should be no public discussion of this with the council or ACC,' the area consultative committee. So you apply for $576,000, you announce $1.1 million, but you do not tell anyone. It is only taxpayers' funds after all!That is the problem with this project. The problem is that the National Party confused their funds with taxpayers' funds. They thought that it was their money to hand out willy-nilly regardless of processes. On 17 April 2008, the Mayor of Bundaberg, Lorraine Pyefinch, in the Bundaberg NewsMail said:I can't see how any organisation in this current climate could even attempt to set up a business which relies solely on having live loggerhead turtle hatchlings as part of the attraction because as a business model it just didn't stack up.I thank the honourable member for his question. I look forward to my first question from the shadow minister for regional development, because he has not asked one in this House. It is not surprising, because their performance was completely embarrassing and a complete maladministration, as these 1,200 pages indicate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for his question. A short time ago, the Reserve Bank of Australia announced that it had decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 7.25 per cent. To quote from the governor's statement:Inflation in Australia has been high over the past year in an environment of limited spare capacity and earlier strong growth in demand.This of course will be a welcome reprieve for Australian families who have now faced 12 interest rate rises in a row, but we must treat today's announcement with caution for the future. Twelve interest rate rises in a row have already significantly impacted on the Australian economy. Yesterday, we saw some slower growth in retail sales and last week we saw lower private sector credit and consumer confidence.To support the economy we need to put downward pressure on interest rates and that means putting downward pressure on inflation. The government in January of this year was clear cut about its five-point strategy for dealing with inflation: one, to bring about an appropriate discipline, when it comes to public demand, through generating a significant budget surplus; two, to encourage private savings; three, to work on our capacity constraints through what we can do on the infrastructure front; four, to work on capacity constraints when it comes to skills; and of course, five, to boost workforce participation. This is the direction the government has been working on all year. This will be a long-term fight, but it is one which the government is seriously engaged in.The cornerstone of the government's fight thus far has been our $22 billion budget surplus. Again I would say to those opposite that, as they consider their votes in this place and in the other place on the budget measures, if they continue with their proposed plan to conduct a $22 billion raid on the budget surplus, its consequences will be to put upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.Furthermore, the government's strategy for dealing with inflation deals with capacity constraints. When it comes to skills and when it comes to infrastructure, through this budget we have announced our plans for the future, not just in terms of the year ahead but also for the decade ahead. We also see long-term planning through the establishment of an Education Investment Fund of some $11 billion, together with a Building Australia Fund for infrastructure of some $20 billion.We have also indicated for the future, when we deal with capacity constraints through these funds and the proper decision-making processes that exist beneath them, that we are acting to deal with long-term capacity constraints in the economy. This is part and parcel of nation building - long-term economic decision making for Australia - and it is important also in the fight against inflation.As I said before, inflation is currently running at 16-year highs. In the House yesterday I reported that the TD Securities-Melbourne Institute Monthly inflation gauge released yesterday showed a 0.3 per cent increase in May, to be 4.5 per cent higher than a year ago. This of course is of concern to families, but it also represents a real concern in terms of our overall macroeconomic management.Looking at household debt servicing, the burden faced by working families and those doing it tough - working Australians - is at a record level. The ratio of interest payments to total household disposable income has reached an all-time high of 11.9 per cent. That is the most recent RBA data from December 2007.Today's RBA decision is welcome news for many Australians, but we must treat the RBA's decision with caution because, when you have inflation running at 16-year highs, we are faced with increased upward pressure on inflation and, together with that, continued upward pressure on interest rates. We believe that this will be a long-term fight against inflation. Other governments around the world are faced with similar challenges, both through the combination of fiscal policy settings but also through the constraints which are now beginning to arise as a consequence of the global increase in the price of oil and global increases in the price of food.This will be a 15-round fight; it is going to go on for a long time. There is no knockout blow when it comes to inflation but we are resolved with absolute determination on the part of this government to fight the fight against it. It is a core challenge for responsible econ-omic management for Australia and, unlike those opposite, we do not regard it as a charade or a fairy tale.</DOC>

 - On 19 November last year I did visit Fort Street High School with my colleague the member for Batman, the shadow minister for transport. There we reiterated Labor's commitment to provide insulation for the kids at Fort Street High School. Those on this side of the House take the education revolution seriously. Part of giving young people the opportunity to have a proper education is making sure that their classes do not get disrupted every two or three minutes when planes go across.Fort Street High School is at Taverners Hill. It is called Taverners Hill for a reason: because it is on a hill - it is up high. It is particularly affected by aircraft noise, which is why we - through the then shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne - promised in 1998, in 2001, in 2004 and in 2007 to provide insula-tion.We on this side of the House take all of our commitments to the Australian public seriously. We did not come in and say, 'We have core and non-core promises,' like those opposite did. We take all of our commitments seriously. That is why we gave support to insulate Fort Street High School. The fact is that Fort Street High School is an old school. It is a heritage building - just like a similar school down the road, Newington, insulated at a cost of $15.5 million in 1995-96 dollars. That is over $20 million in today's terms. But I think that is reasonable because I do not think that aircraft noise discriminates between public schools and private schools. I do not think how wealthy you are should determine that. That is why, when they were chairs -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. That is why when they were chairs of the Sydney Airport Community Forum, if they go back and look at their files, the member for Bradfield and the member for North Sydney were both supportive - to their credit - of expanding the insulation scheme. Just as last Friday, when the member for Cook, who has asked this question, moved a motion, guess who voted for it? The representatives of the member for Bradfield, the member for North Sydney and the member for Wentworth all asked for an expansion of the insulation scheme at the Sydney Airport Community Forum last Friday - just three days ago.They have lost the plot on this issue, because they also raised this at Senate estimates last week and Senator McGauran made an interesting contribution. Remember, he is the guy who was a Nat and is now a Lib. He has got ahead of the amalgamation game: he has been in both in one term. This is what Senator McGauran had to say about Fort Street High School:... it is one of the most prestigious and expensive schools in Sydney, and it is not willing to contribute a dollar ...He said this was a 'very wealthy school' and he went on to say:... this is quite a high profile private school. It can meet at least ... some of its costs ...Public schools get funded through taxation. This is a public school. It deserves insulation, just as Newington deserved insulation -  -  - </DOC>

 - Inflation in Australia is currently running at 4.2 per cent, well beyond the Reserve Bank's target zone, and Australians have suffered 12 interest rate increases in a row. I have no doubt that working people in this country will welcome today's decision by the Reserve Bank to keep the interest rate on hold. One of the key factors that has been putting upward pressure on interest rates and inflation has been government spending increasing much too rapidly. In fact, for the financial year about to end, the budget that the Rudd government inherited had government spending increasing by over five per cent per annum in real terms, therefore putting significant upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. That is why the government introduced a tough budget, a fiscally strict budget delivering a $22 billion surplus and reducing the rate of increase in government spending down to a little over one per cent in real terms, also thereby ensuring that government spending as a proportion of the total economy will shrink by around one per cent of the economy, one per cent of GDP - the lowest level since 1989-90.Yesterday the member for North Sydney made a very telling interjection. He described the government's budget as 'expansionary'. Do you all agree? Is that the position of the opposition: you describe this as an expansionary budget? Let's hear from you. Let's hear what you have actually got to say. The member for North Sydney described the Liberal Party last week as being 'united in hatred of the Labor Party', so he tends to run off at the mouth a bit. But the suggestion by the opposition that the government's budget was expansionary does raise a couple of interesting points. It raises the question: if a 1.1 per cent real increase in spending is expansionary, what does that make a five per cent real increase in 2007-08? How do they describe their final budget, the member for Higgins's final budget? If ours is expansionary at 1.1, what is theirs at five? Secondly, and more importantly, it raises this question: if the Rudd government's budget is expansionary, why is the opposition proposing to blow a giant $22 billion hole in the surplus, massively reducing the surplus across the forward estimates, by $4 billion in this financial year and spreading out even further over forthcoming financial years, with not one single savings initiative proposed? In other words, on the one hand they are suggesting it is an expansionary budget, but the answer to Australia's financial problems, to Australia's macroeconomic issues, is to actually increase the extent to which it is an expansionary budget.We have heard the opposition suggest that the inflation problem in Australia is imaginary, that it is fictional, a charade. On the other hand, we have heard the opposition, the member for Wentworth, say that it is actually a serious economic issue, that it is an important challenge. Indeed, on 6 February the member for Wentworth said inflation was 'running at manageable levels' when the Rudd government took over responsibility for the economy, and it is not that long ago that the member for Wentworth was standing outside the parliament saying that a 0.25 per cent increase in interest rates was being overdramatised - all from the people who promised to keep interest rates at record lows. So the total picture of the opposition's position with respect to the government's budget and its prospective impact on inflation and interest rates is this: there isn't an inflation problem, but there is; government spending is too high, but the solution is that we should spend even more; the 2008 budget with a one per cent increase in spending was inflationary and irresponsible, but the 2007 budget with a five per cent increase in spending was not inflationary and irresponsible.The truth is that the opposition are completely, totally, utterly incoherent. They have no fixed position on these fundamentally important issues for the future of the nation's economy. They are engaging simply in random sniping, desperate searches for relevance, desperate seeking of headlines. A one-line news grab is not an economic policy. The government is getting on with the job of dealing with the complex economic situation facing Australia of defending the living standards of working people in this country and investing for the long-term future, and we will not be diverted in our legislative program to put the budget into effect by the short-term, naked sniping by the opposition that is completely contrary to the interests of economic management and responsibility. We intend to put our budget through the parliament and to ensure that there is a strong surplus to put further downward pressure on inflation and interest rates.</DOC>

 - What is remarkable about the Liberal Party is where they actually always stand up either in defence of the consumers or in the defence of those who are providing cost to consumers.Whether it is in terms of the private health industry, whether it is in terms of big oil companies, whether it is in terms of large supermarkets, we have a party in this parliament -  - You can take the posture of those opposite, which is to hoist up the white flag and say: 'You can do nothing about this. You can just sit back and allow any cost impost to be thrown onto consumers.' Or you can stand up for working families, working Australians and those doing it tough.The Labor Party stands up for the people under financial pressure at the moment. Those opposite, it seems, have the opposite resolve. I stand by the comments made before by the Deputy Prime Minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. Tackling infrastructure bottlenecks is indeed part of the government's five-point plan to fight inflation. Bottlenecks put upward pressure on inflation, which then flows through to higher interest rates. For example, the lack of dedicated rail freight lines through Sydney means either more trucks on our city streets or containers left sitting on the wharves. This adds to the cost of doing business, which flows through to higher prices. If businesses cannot rely on reasonably priced and efficient infrastructure they will think twice about increasing production or investing in their business.The previous government's wasteful spending of budget surpluses, instead of investing in our economy's potential through infrastructure, added to inflation and put upward pressure on interest rates. Before in this House I have spoken about the Reserve Bank's 20 separate warnings, but today there is further evidence from the Reserve Bank. In the statement by Glenn Stevens, the governor, on monetary policy that he released less than one hour ago, the governor said in the second sentence:Inflation in Australia has been high over the past year in an environment of limited spare capacity and earlier strong growth in demand. In these circumstances, the Board has been seeking to restrain demand in order to reduce inflation over time.There you have it, Mr Speaker: the Governor of the Reserve Bank today, less than one hour ago, saying very clearly that the Reserve Bank, which has increased interest rates 12 times in a row, did so because of the environment of limited spare capacity. It goes straight to the issue of infrastructure and the failure of the previous government to address infrastructure bottlenecks.Compare those comments with the comments of the shadow Treasurer, who said that infrastructure bottlenecks 'have little to do with inflation'. He may not understand the connection between infrastructure bottlenecks and capacity constraints in the economy and increases in inflation and in interest rates, but the Governor of the Reserve Bank understands, and so does the Rudd Labor government. That is why we have established Infrastructure Australia. That is why we have put $20 billion into the Building Australia Fund.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I explain to the Leader of the Opposition that the government has indicated its attitude about pricing practices in child care. You would expect the government to be clear with childcare operators that we do not want to see unfair pricing practices. You would also expect the government to be clear that it will canvass all options within its power should evidence of such pricing practices emerge. -  - The Leader of the Opposition, by way of interjection, raises the question -  - The Leader of the Opposition, by way of interjection, raises the question of cups of tea. Presumably, a lot were drunk by him and his colleagues in government when they did nothing about childcare fee increases. Presumably, he drank a lot of tea in his six years in cabinet when he did nothing about petrol prices. Presumably, he drank a lot of tea as minister for education whilst he did nothing about our education standards slipping behind the standards of the rest of the world and a skills crisis emerging, including in child care, which has put constraints on supply. Presumably, a lot of tea got drunk whilst they were reading the outcomes of Work Choices and the rip-off of working families which meant it was even harder for them to pay their childcare costs.But what the Leader of the Opposition cannot seem to understand is that this is a government that is indicating to childcare operators - as a message to childcare operators which we expect to be heard and received - that we do not want to see unfair pricing practices in child care. Obviously, if evidence of unfair pricing practices emerges then the government will canvass all of its options and powers to deal with unfair pricing practices.I conclude from these questions that, because the government has exhibited a concern about this question, because the government has exhibited that it is going to monitor the question and canvass options to act should that become necessary, the opposition's view is that a government should sit idly by and do nothing. That is your view. Well, this government does mean what it says, and I mean what I say to childcare operators. We are obviously very determined to deliver our CCTR changes. I do not know whether that is one of the budget bills that the opposition is intending to block - whether it is going to rip those CCTR changes out of the hands of working families and put additional pressure on them, including through its $22 billion smash and grab raid on the surplus - but we are determined to deliver our childcare tax rebates and we are determined to send a message to childcare operators. The opposition might stand for inaction, unreasonable price hikes and tea drinking; we do not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question - and it is lucky; I am just warming up. This is a government that has had to address 12 years of inaction and neglect of our skills system by the former government and, personally, by the Leader of the Opposition and, personally, by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who did nothing to address the skills crisis as it loomed when they were in government, sitting around doing nothing. As I have had cause to mention to the House in the past, their inaction was actually made transparent to the world by the illuminating comments of the member for Goldstein, who helpfully said that when it came to a skills crisis they knew it was coming and it had arrived with force. What they never thought about was doing anything about it. There was no action on the skills crisis despite the fact that the skills crisis puts upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. - The member for Goldstein is now interjecting; presumably he is trying to cover up his track record of inaction in this area. The Rudd Labor government, as part of our plan to fight inflation, is acting -  - to deal with the skills crisis. I reassure the House that that quote from the member for Goldstein is not a verballing. The Rudd Labor government is acting to address the skills crisis. We understand that when skills are short that puts upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. This is a government that is committed to the delivery of 630,000 new training places - 20,000 new training places were delivered in April. We are happy with the enthusiastic response from training providers and participants, with more than 5,000 people already enrolled in courses. - I take it from the interjection of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that she would prefer that people were not enrolled in courses and we went back to the days of idleness, neglect and tea drinking of the Howard government.More than 5,000 people are already enrolled in courses. The first 500 graduates will be finished their training and ready to start work by June. There are hundreds of people signing up to take these places every week. And, encouragingly, this program is targeted at skills shortage areas. We have seen strong enrolment in crucial areas and - wait for it - more than 1,000 people enrolled in certificate III in children's services.Opposition members have spent a bit of time today feigning concern about child care. You cannot run child care and you cannot expand supply if you do not have childcare workers. That figure of more than 1,000 enrolled in certificate III in children's services is very good news for anyone in this country who is concerned about the cost, quality, accessibility or affordability of child care - and people on this side of the House are.In addition, we have seen nearly another 1,000 enrolments for aged-care qualifications, and members on this side of the House, frequently out in their electorates, would not have an issue raised with them more than people wanting to be assured that they can get access to aged care. The minister would know that one of the constraints on that is the lack of skilled workers. In that too, almost 1,000 people enrolled for aged-care qualifications is very good news.It is also pleasing to see that these enrolments are at the certificate III level. The previous government's voucher system was limited to certificate II. What all of the analysis is telling us, what business is telling us, what economists are telling us and what people know from being out and about and talking to those in the community is that we need to deepen skills in our community. We need more people studying and getting skills at the more senior level, particularly certificate III and above.I am happy to see this take-up of these places. It is only just the start. It is the take-up of the first 20,000 of 630,000 places in total. This is the Rudd Labor government addressing years of inaction and neglect, and what we know is that this skills crisis is playing its part in terms of the current economy and exacerbating inflationary pressures. That is why it is clearly part of the government's plan to fight inflation to address these skills shortages. A start was made in April, and some very pleasing results are being seen, particularly in areas where we are crucially short.</DOC>

 - I understand that this particular application was not approved by the previous government and that it was under assessment at the time of the government change. Therefore, because the Regional Partnerships program has been closed, there are two categories. The first is those projects that have been fully contracted and will be honoured by the government. There are 420 of those. The second category is the not-for-profit applications that were approved and not contracted. They have until 31 July to be put forward. There are 86 of those projects, and 55 of them are in seats held by the coalition.The government believed that a common-sense approach was to ensure that they were not disadvantaged by the maladministration that occurred under the previous government where, under Regional Partnerships, in a 51-minute spending spree before the 2004 election just before they went into caretaker mode, 16 projects were approved for some $3.3 million. - The member for McEwen has asked about a specific Regional Partnerships grant. One of the problems with Regional Partnerships was that it was so broad that everything fitted in under its umbrella. Had it been contracted then it certainly would have been honoured.But we know the member for McEwen, when it comes to the use of public funds, has had other interesting proposals. This is the member who wanted to put a shadecloth over the Great Barrier Reef as her solution to protecting it from climate change. That is what the member's attitude was towards use of public funds. The government were in denial for years. Then they wanted to put a shadecloth over the Great Barrier Reef. Another member wanted to put a great big shadecloth in space, so I guess that is not that extreme from the member for McEwen.This government makes no apologies - The member for Tangney then left the chamber. - for the fact that we regard public funds to be precious and will make sure that they are spent wisely.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to get a question from the member for Bendigo. The government was elected to fix 11 years of neglect and we have been very busy getting on with the job of fixing infrastructure and the skills crisis, getting on with the job of dealing with health and hospitals, getting on with the job of the education revolution and getting on with the job of the greatest challenge of our generation - the challenge of climate change. - That is why there is so much legislation put forward in this House. We make no apologies for the fact that we have a big legislative agenda and for the fact that we have 22 bills which we will be pursuing through this House this week in order for them to get to the Senate so that the Senate can give them proper deliberation. There has been some opposition and questioning of this and there is some doubt over whether those opposite want to block $22 billion of measures - and blow a $22 billion hole in the budget.Let us have a look at some of these measures that will be before the House this week. There is the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008. That will increase the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent on 1 July. The Dental Benefits (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 is needed by 1 July because it will start Labor's Teen Dental Plan, worth $484 million. The Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Bill 2008 is needed to inject half a billion dollars into public hospitals by 1 July. The Wheat Export Marketing Bill 2008 is required so that farmers can have certainty over whom they can sell this year's harvest to. They have already planted it. The same-sex relationships bills are necessary in order to provide justice in terms of death benefits for same-sex couples by 1 July. The tax laws amendment bills are necessary so that those who are recipients of carer adjustment payments or Austudy rent assistance will not be taxed. If the bills are not carried by both houses by 1 July and come into law then they could open those people up to taxation. This bill fixes previous government omissions.We think this is consistent with the government's overall economic position of putting downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. We have a long-term plan for the nation that is embodied in our budget and in the bills that are before this House. We will not be lectured about putting too much legislation through the House by an opposition that guillotined some 36 bills during their period in office and that rammed through legislation during their last term in office. This is an opposition that, when it was in government, rammed through the Work Choices legislation. They briefed the advertising company before they actually got the legislation right when it came to Work Choices - we remember that.This was a government that rammed through legislation relating to kids overboard and to the intervention in the Northern Territory and, most significantly, did not have proper debate before this chamber on the most important decision that a government can take - taking us to war in Iraq. Despite the opportunism of those opposite, this government will not be deterred from our big agenda to provide a lift in living standards for the long term with economic, social and environmental policy. That is why we say to the opposition: we are determined to have these bills carried in accordance with our program and our mandate that we received last November.</DOC>

The member for Farrer should know that this is a very modest measure that will affect a very small number of people and that the money will go directly to the states. Again, I find extraordinary the sudden interest of the opposition in the issue of housing affordability. In government, they did nothing for 12 years to progress housing affordability. I think people can draw their own conclusions about the sincerity of the opposition's interest in this issue.</DOC>

 - Today's national accounts, reflecting 0.6 per cent increased growth in the March quarter and 3.6 per cent in the year to the March quarter, reflect some moderation in overall economic growth. Today's national accounts paint a clear picture of the economic challenges which now face the nation. We have continuing economic growth, but at the same time we have a real problem in dealing with supply-side constraints in the economy, which have had a cumulative effect in increasing inflationary pressures.We are very much at the initial stages of a 15-round fight against inflation. Inflationary pressures have taken a long time to build in the economy and they will take a long time to turn around. Inflation is a critical challenge facing the national economy because inflationary pressures running ahead have an upwards impact on interest rates. If you have an upwards impact on interest rates, that represents a long-term drag on economic growth and therefore a long-term impact on employment as well. That is why it is important that this government places at the centre of its economic priorities the fight against inflation.That is what the government did in January this year when we announced our five-point strategy for dealing with the inflation challenge. Remember that, at the point at which we assumed office, inflation was running at a 16-year high. Therefore, we announced a strategy which was going to have as its core elements: (1) responsible economic management through bringing about a significant budget surplus; (2) encouraging private savings; (3) increasing capacity when it comes to skills formation in the economy and dealing with skill shortages; (4) investing in infrastructure and overcoming infrastructure bottlenecks; and (5) enhancing workforce participation. This is a coherent strategy for dealing with the inflation challenge, and if there is one sobering message to emerge from the national accounts data today it is that this challenge must be addressed head on.The government's response in the implementation of this strategy has been clear cut. We have brought about a $22 billion surplus and, in the engineering of that surplus, we have also brought about $7.3 billion in savings in the coming year and $33 billion worth of savings across the forwards estimates. Ensuring that you are bringing about significant savings and that you are exercising appropriate restraint on expenditures is a responsible course of action for the future. Again, we have done that by ensuring that expenditure growth as a proportion of GDP has been kept low and that, similarly, tax as a proportion of GDP has been kept low as well.The second element of the government's budget strategy has been to deal with others of those inflationary pressures which are evident upon any analysis of the national accounts data. That means dealing with our supply-side constraints. That is why the government is clear cut in its strategy to invest in skills and invest in infrastructure. That is why we have established the Building Australia Fund to deal with infrastructure challenges for the future. On that point, I commend the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government for convening today the first meeting of the advisory council of Infrastructure Australia. It is six months to the day, I think, since this government was sworn in, and we have a meeting of the advisory council of Infrastructure Australia and a Building Australia Fund, which has been part of the budget papers because this government is serious about dealing with the challenges of infrastructure bottlenecks and the constraints that they represent in terms of not just long-term economic growth but ensuring we are effectively fighting inflation. Similarly, on the skills front, there is the establishment of the Education Investment Fund of some $10 billion for the future.We need look no further than the part of the national accounts which deals with the contribution of net exports to overall growth. The net exports contribution has been negative 0.7, and this of itself reflects the fact that we are still not overcoming infrastructure bottlenecks and skill shortages when it comes to getting our product out to market. It is very simple: we are depending at present on prices going up when it comes to demand globally for our resources, but, while we have a lot of volume coming in by way of imports, we basically have modest growth when it comes to the volume of exports leaving the country. Therefore, if we are going to deal with these challenges, we have to finally respond to those 20 consecutive warnings contained in one Reserve Bank document after another to act on capacity constraints in the economy. There was warning after warning, year after year, about skills and infrastructure, and that is nowhere more evident than in the national accounts data today and their reflection on the net contribution of exports to overall growth.Of course, the third element of the government's budget strategy is not only to bring about responsible economic management through a sizeable budget surplus - and to invest in our future in skills and in infrastructure to deal with these constraints and to deal with those factors which are fuelling inflationary pressures in the economy - but also to deal with the financial pressures faced by working families, working Australians and those doing it tough, because for those Australians inflation is not a charade. For those Australians inflation is not a fairy tale. For those Australians inflation is a real problem, and it is a real problem when inflation going up has an upwards impact on interest rates and that feeds through to their mortgage rates and the overall cost of living. That is why this government has been determined as part of its budget strategy to deliver a package of support for families, for individuals as well as for pensioners and carers, as I outlined to the House yesterday.The government inherited, after 12 years in office by those opposite, inflation running at 16-year highs. We inherited 10 interest rises in a row. We have inherited these economic circumstances and, as a consequence, the real challenge we face with inflation is either to regard it as a charade, to regard it as a fairy tale or to take that fight head on. This government's resolve is to take that fight head on. As I said before, taking on the fight with inflation is critical for this country's long-term economic health and the wellbeing of individuals and families, who depend on the cost of credit and the cost of finance to do so much when it comes to their normal everyday lives. Fighting the fight against inflation is core business for us but I say this: the best way you can fight inflation in terms of the outlays from government is to engineer - and not render a threat to the integrity of - the budget surplus. In this process we have generated a $22 billion budget surplus. That represents responsible economic management. The contrast is a $22 billion raid on the surplus which is the essential accumulation of all the individual budget measures which those opposite have said they will oppose. The contrast on responsible economic management is clear. The government's resolve in fighting the fight against inflation, particularly on the back of this new national accounts data, is clear. We fight the fight against inflation. That means dealing with upward pressure on interest rates. If we fail to do that then higher interest rates will flow through to economic growth and flow through to employment. We have a responsible strategy for dealing with it; those opposite do not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. It appears that he has changed his position on this year's budget yet again. So we now have a third position on the budget - it appears that the 2008 budget is now a rather good budget. But we will take that on board. We are happy for today's endorsement. It may well change tomorrow, but we will take that on board. I notice the trickiness in the question in that he referred to two different indicators. What he did not mention is that if we use the GDP deflator indicator it would show that government spending in this year's budget is actually going to fall in real terms. So you choose one indicator when it suits you, but you do not want to choose it when it actually suits the government. What a remarkable coincidence.What is most astonishing about this performance is that this question is coming from the party which says that this budget is expansionary, that the budget is a high-spending budget and yet that the government should be loosening the purse strings to the tune of billions and billions of dollars. It should add $22 billion to net government spending. It should reduce the surplus by $22 billion over those years. That is the position of the opposition. - I will conclude on one point. If you would care to finally get around to reading the budget papers, which you will eventually do, no doubt, what you will find -  - Sorry, Mr Speaker. What the member for Wentworth will find is that government spending as a proportion of GDP across the four years of the forward estimates is substantially lower than it was under the member for Higgins in the 2007-08 budget. So the percentage of GDP the government is spending as a proportion of the total economy across the forward estimates stays below the level we inherited from the former government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. In the context of a slowing world economy, today's national accounts provide reassuring news on economic growth but they also show that the inflation fight is very definitely far from over. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, we are still in the early rounds of what is definitely a 15-round fight. That is why the figures that I have released today, the national accounts figures, underline the importance of a tough, responsible budget - the budget that the Treasurer handed down last month - and underline the importance of the $22 billion surplus that we brought about, as the Prime Minister said. - I must say I am delighted to see there is some life in the member for Higgins. - I know that members of the opposition find it tedious that we have handed down a $22 billion surplus, but you had better get used to it. Today's figures reinforce the need for responsible spending and dealing with the capacity constraints that we inherited after a decade of neglect under the recently revived member for Higgins. The government will not rest until we get the long-term policy settings right that will enable the building of a modern economy that will deliver sustainable, strong growth and low inflation.I have a very simple message for the opposition here: the last thing that the Australian economy needs, the last thing that the Australian people need, is to loosen the fiscal settings that have been put in place by this government to slash the surplus and to pump more money into the economy. That is the last thing that the Australian economy needs and that is the real message that comes through from these national account figures. The opposition are endeavouring to mount a smash-and-grab raid on the surplus through the Senate. They have the swag over the shoulder, the funny mask on and they are off in the corridors of the Senate seeking to mount a smash-and-grab raid on the surplus. That is simply a recipe for higher inflation and higher interest rates. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition was out there handing out even more money this morning, but still there are no offsetting savings and no explanation of what impact this would have on inflation and interest rates. These accounts indicate that real growth eased to 0.6 per cent in the March quarter, or 3.6 per cent over the year, and they do show that families are feeling the impact of rising prices and higher interest rates, with household consumption slowing to 0.7 per cent in the quarter and 4.3 per cent over the year.It is good news, though, that business investment continues to grow strongly, rising by 1.6 per cent in the March quarter and 6.6 per cent over the year and, as a share of the nominal economy, business investment remains at approximately its highest level since the early 1970s. Net exports detracted from GDP growth in the March quarter and reflect, as the Prime Minister indicated, ongoing weakness in export volumes and, in turn, the problems with capacity constraints that this government is so committed to tackling.In conclusion, the Rudd government is committed to playing its part to putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates through a responsible budget that delivers a strong surplus and invests in the future. That is something the Leader of the Opposition did not understand a few months ago. Higher inflation means higher interest rates which, in turn, tend over time to reduce economic growth and reduce employment growth. That is why it is so crucial to get inflation in check and that is why it is so crucial to run a strong surplus. I urge the opposition to think very carefully before they throw their economic responsibility credentials completely out the window in the Senate.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the member for North Sydney for his question. What we have seen in the period since the measure has been increased, I am advised, is that there has been a 39 per cent decrease in dark spirit based drinks and a 37 per cent decrease in light spirit based drinks. That is one thing. Of course, there have been increases in other categories of drinks. -  - That is true. The question, though, is what is happening in this particular category and what the overall impact is. -  - Of course, this is early data. We are talking about a month's worth of data. That is the first thing. The second thing is that this government is determined to act on binge drinking. Those opposite stand on the side of the distilleries on this question. We believe that the responsible course of action lies in acting in the face of the data that we have received, and the data we have received shows that ready-to-drink products targeted at girls and young women have seen a 23 per cent growth since 2005. On top of that, we have seen a 250 per cent increase in RTD sales since the Howard government created a tax loophole back in 2000. So what you can do is: ignore that data, ignore the social problem and ignore the public statements by the police commissioners of the nation and do as those opposite are doing and simply wave a white flag - or act as this government has decided to act.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The government has indeed delivered a strong budget surplus of $22 billion that ends wasteful spending and sets aside the vital funds to begin to make up for years of neglect. The government is taking the steps necessary to drive down inflation and drive down interest rates. I refer to the statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank yesterday where he again, on top of the 20 warnings about capacity constraints in the economy leading to increases in inflation and increases in interest rates, indicated that the capacity constraints in the economy were what had led the Reserve Bank to address demand in the economy by increasing interest rates through 12 consecutive rises.But you can only invest in infrastructure and address these long-term issues if you have responsible economic management, and that is what the advisory council members of Infrastructure Australia who met for the first time here in parliament today are making a contribution to. The Infrastructure Australia Advisory Council will make recommendations to the government on a range of issues. Firstly, addressing infrastructure is not just about new investment; it is actually about using more efficiently the infrastructure that we have. It is also about making sure that we have greater harmonisation of guidelines and regulations, including on public-private partnerships.They will also be conducting a national audit into infrastructure and will produce a national infrastructure priority list at the COAG meeting in March 2009. This will be aimed at addressing the infrastructure bottlenecks that those opposite might ignore, not just in speech but in practice, by their $22 billion raid on the surplus. But those who acknowledge that infrastructure bottlenecks are a major capacity constraint on the economy, along with skill shortages, know that we need that long-term planning. The Rudd government is determined to do that. We have the structures in place to do that through Infrastructure Australia. We have put our money where our mouth is by investing in these long-term infrastructure funds, not just in the Building Australia Fund but also in education and health. If we are serious about addressing these issues, we have to be also serious about being responsible economic managers. That means maintaining a commitment to a strong budget surplus as the first point in the Rudd government's five-point plan to fight inflation.</DOC>

 - The government has a first-class plan for dealing with the future of hospitals in this country. When it comes to the future of hospitals in this country, you can either invest in the future of hospitals or ignore them, which is why this government, for the first time in the nation's history, has established a hospitals investment fund of some $10 billion to look at the long-term needs of the system. This is fundamental to making sure that the capital needs of the nation's hospitals are set in the right direction. If you travel around the hospitals, as the Minister for Health and Ageing and I have in recent times, you will discover one set of capital needs after another. Then there are the workforce needs - again, monstrously undertended by those opposite who, year after year and for a full decade, did nothing to address the undersupply of doctors and nurses across the nation despite the fact that doctors and nurses are trained in tertiary institutions which are the exclusive responsibility of the Commonwealth.If the opposition are raising questions seriously about the future of hospitals, the future of health policy and the future of our health workforce, I would suggest that after 12 years in office, with ample opportunities to act in each of these areas, they should have done so. We have a long-term plan for the future when it comes to health and hospitals - $10 billion worth of investment and a cooperative negotiation currently underway through the Council of Australian Governments to work with the states and territories on how we overcome duplication and overlap and bring an end to the blame game in this critical area of concern to the people of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question and note his interest in productivity, because he understands that today's productivity growth is the nation's future prosperity. -  - I understand from the reaction that members opposite do not care to discuss productivity, because they would be rightly ashamed of the record of the former government on productivity, and, of course, as they shred their economic credentials and try to mask that behind bullyboy carry-on, they do not want people talking about the economy at all. But whilst the opposition, the Liberal Party, demonstrates each and every day just how much it has lost its way, the government is getting on with the job of building productivity and prosperity for the future. There is no more important part of that agenda than the human capital agenda - the investment in education and training, which goes from the education of our youngest children, through schools, through vocational education and training to higher education. We need to make a difference for all of that breadth of education if we are to make a difference over time for national productivity growth.This is a government that is committed to an education revolution and to reform in all areas. We have embarked on a comprehensive range of measures in child care and the early education agenda - a $2.4 billion investment. It includes our changes to the childcare tax rebate to take pressure off working families, with an increase from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. It includes our commitment to the delivery of up to 260 new childcare centres. It includes our commitment to deliver $126.6 million to build capacity in the early years workforce. This level of activity and investment stands in stark contrast to the neglect of the previous government, where the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the then minister for education, said:... I agree that investment in early childhood is very, very important and traditionally the State Governments have been responsible for early childhood. I'm not blaming anyone, I'm just stating a fact that State Governments are responsible for early childhood ...That is, that the former government was going to do nothing, did not care to do anything, did not believe in doing anything and never acted.On the question of schools, we have investments in new capital and we have investments in the quality of teaching. We have investments to try to assist students in schools that are in the most disadvantaged circumstances. We are working towards new national partnership arrangements for all of those areas of schooling that the former government put in the too-hard basket.In skills, we are investing $1.9 billion to create up to 630,000 new training places, with the first 20,000 of them already delivered. What we will not do and what we know the alternate approach was, one so graphically articulated by the member for Goldstein when he was the relevant minister, is to sit idly by and watch a skills crisis grow and do precisely nothing about it. That was the record of the previous government.Of course we are investing in our university sector, with our $500 million investment this financial year through our Better Universities Renewal Fund and a new long-term Education Investment Fund - $11 billion available to assist with infrastructure in universities and in vocational education and training.Once again, this approach, of investment, is a stark contrast to a government whose only concern about universities was to meddle in their industrial relations by tying funding to industrial relations extremism and Work Choices. And we are bringing fairness, balance and productivity to Australian workplaces by dismantling the industrial relations extremism of those opposite, putting the focus back on cooperation and on lifting productivity. In each of these areas the government is determined to act.I know members opposite don't like to listen to this because they don't like to listen to talk of their more than decade of neglect - neglect of early childhood, indifference to the quality of schooling, creation of a skills crisis, ideological intervention in our universities in pursuit of industrial relations extremism. Where the former government failed, this government is acting. We understand that productivity growth is about prosperity tomorrow. That is economic responsibility on display.</DOC>

 - The government stands by Treasury's modelling and has no basis to question the Treasury modelling upon which the government's decision has been based. We notice that that modelling has been challenged both by the Australian Health Insurance Association and the AMA. Again, it is no passing coincidence that those opposite always rely upon organisations like those who represent the big supermarkets, the big oil companies and the private health insurance companies to underpin their argument. As I said before, we stand by the modelling which Treasury has provided us in framing our policy on this.The second point I would make on it is that those opposite are still of the view that a $50,000 salary is a high income, because that is the threshold at which they introduced the surcharge on families way back when and they have refused to adjust it since. And each time the member for Higgins, when he was Treasurer, was challenged on this, he said, 'No, no, not now, not yet.' Now, $50,000 may have been the calculation of the Liberal government back then as representing those on a high income; I would say, as a further indication that those opposite have lost touch with working families and those under financial pressure in the community, that $50,000 is no longer a high income. Therefore, they are standing in the road of providing savings of up to $20 per week per individual and $30 per week for families and couples. I would suggest that those opposite get themselves back in touch with those Australians who are struggling deeply with the challenges to their family budget. This is one measure - together with the education tax refunds, together with the childcare tax rebate, together with our initiatives in the housing portfolio, together with $44 billion worth of tax cuts to families and individuals under financial pressure - to take pressure off the overall family budget. I would suggest that is the productive way forward in dealing with this and, secondly, with a radical program of investment in the nation's hospital and health services - a system from which those opposite extracted $1 billion during their time in office.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. She is a very strong supporter and advocate of the local small business community on the Central Coast of New South Wales. The national accounts released today are reassuring news at a time of global uncertainty in an economic downturn, but they also confirm that the fight against inflation here in Australia is far from over. Members opposite will be aware that, when the Rudd government was formed, we inherited an inflation rate at a 16-year high. This is despite 12 interest rate rises in a row. We know that high interest rates are public enemy No. 1, but they are especially the enemy of small business.There have been several small business surveys that have confirmed that businesses are identifying high interest rates as a key factor affecting business confidence and their business planning decisions. I will refer to three of them. One is the National Australia Bank's quarterly business survey, which says:_ the combination of much tighter financial conditions, falling global equity markets and the global credit crunch has produced a sharp fall in business confidence.The Dun and Bradstreet National Business Expectations Survey says:_ the combination of high interest rates and market turmoil has fuelled executive concerns regarding the impact of the credit market on operations.And, finally, an SAI Global/ACCI survey on investor confidence was released and in relation to that ACCI said:The survey shows that interest rates and ongoing financial sector turmoil has significantly dented business confidence.The point is that interest rates are having an effect on business confidence and on business planning decisions.The budget, however, is designed to help put downward pressure on interest rates through putting downward pressure on inflation. It is a contractionary budget, Malcolm, with a surplus of almost $22 billion or 1.8 per cent of GDP. It cuts spending growth from five per cent in the current financial year down to one per cent. I am reminded that, at the time of the release of the former Prime Minister's biography, the member for Higgins was prompted to say about the then Prime Minister, 'In formulating budget policy, I showed him the menu and he took the entree, the main course, the dessert and the vegetarian option.' It was an unprecedented spending spree and we are now reining in that irresponsible government spending.Indeed, the budget cuts spending as a share of gross domestic product goes from 24.4 per cent to 23.4 per cent. That is a full one percentage point reduction in government spending as a share of GDP in a single year. That is a very big achievement for the Treasurer, for the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, the Prime Minister, for everyone involved in formulating that budget - bringing in a budget surplus of $22 billion, 1.8 per cent of GDP, and a very, very substantial reduction in government spending as a share of GDP. And that is why it is vital in this fight against inflation that this budget is passed by the Senate, so that it can do its work and help put that downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. The last thing small businesses in Australia need is a $22 billion raid on the surplus, which is being orchestrated by the coalition. That would be very bad news for small business and very bad news for the Australian economy.The budget also helps ease the capacity constraints, which were identified again yesterday by the Reserve Bank in its statement announcing that it was keeping interest rates on hold. There was some dispute about this. The infrastructure minister was pointing this out. He was asserting that the Reserve Bank did identify capacity constraints. Members opposite do not seem to believe there are any. But the Reserve Bank does say, from that statement yesterday:Inflation in Australia has been high over the past year and in an environment of limited spare capacity and earlier strong growth in demand.So there you have it, Mr Speaker: yet again, on top of the 20 warnings, another warning yesterday saying that the problem is -  - we have capacity constraints. The budget provides $1.9 billion over five years to create 630,000 training places. This is very important for small business in easing the skills crisis -  - and investing very heavily in infrastructure.The member for Moncrieff then left the chamber. - The Rudd government is building a strong surplus for a strong economy, capable of meeting the challenges of the 21st century for the working people of Australia and for Australia's 1.9 million small businesses.</DOC>

 - I am glad to see that the shadow minister for education finally got a question. He is no longer the Marcel Marceau of Australian politics. I was looking forward to that miming of eating an apple later on in the session. We are obviously going to miss out on that. But, if he is going to routinely get questions in the future, I think he is going to have to up the quality. No wonder the shadow ministry tactics committee has been holding him back, with the calibre of questions like that. - I certainly will, Mr Speaker. I was just hoping to offer a little bit of encouragement along the way. On the question that the member asks about computers in schools, the government's policy is absolutely clear. We are delivering now a $1.2 billion investment in computers in schools. Have a look at the budget papers; you will see it there. That $1.2 billion investment in schools includes $100 million which will be delivered before the end of this financial year. On the question of the partnership with the states ensuring that computers are in settings where they can be used, at the last meeting of the Ministerial Council for Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, MCEETYA, a resolution was adopted unanimously by the ministers who met there on partnership and cooperation about the digital education revolution. Of course, what the government is trying to achieve here - which is something, I understand, that members opposite must be opposed to from the way that they are calling out - is to invest in upper secondary schools, years 9 to 12, to ensure -  - To conclude my answer: the government's program is being delivered. All I can conclude from the antics of members opposite is that they are opposed to students in years 9 to 12 learning with digital education technology. If one looked at their track record in government, what one would see is 12 years of neglect of the need to ensure that students are learning in 21st century classrooms. This is a government that is committed to that process and is investing $1.2 billion in getting the job done.</DOC>

 - Prior to the last election, the Labor Party made a commitment to strengthen the Trade Practices Act to crack down on anticompetitive conduct by powerful businesses. I am pleased to inform the House that the government is acting on that commitment. Australian consumers need small and medium sized enterprises to provide rigorous competition. The Australian economy depends on rigorous competition so that Australian consumers can benefit. Predatory behaviour by large and powerful businesses means that they abuse their power in the market with a view to damaging a small business to increase their market dominance.Through a series of cases, the courts have watered down the Trade Practices Act over several years. For example, in 2003 the High Court, in the Boral case, said that if a big firm cuts its prices to drive a small business out of operation to dominate the market the ACCC must be able to prove that that big firm can make up the losses into the future. That evidentiary burden proved so high that the ACCC immediately discontinued all its predatory pricing cases and has not commenced any others. Unfortunately, the member for Higgins completely ignored calls from across the board to fix that situation, and it has taken the election of a new government, five years after the Boral case, to fix the Trade Practices Act. On 28 April we announced the government's package of reforms to fix this problem. This amounts to the biggest reform of the Trade Practices Act in 22 years. The new rules will make it easier for the ACCC to prosecute businesses who are engaging in anticompetitive behaviour. The government's amendments will ensure that victims of predatory pricing, or the ACCC, will no longer have to prove that the predator has the ability to recoup losses after participating in anticompetitive, below-cost pricing.We will also clarify the meaning of the term 'take advantage' in section 46 in response to concerns raised that the present meaning of the term has prevented section 46 from capturing anticompetitive behaviour. And we will remove the uncertainty that arose in the dying days of the previous government under the cobbled-together amendment which resulted in a two-track process. It is very important for business certainty that that situation is fixed, and we are looking for bipartisan support for that very important reform. We will also give small business cheaper and easier access to the courts to prosecute situations in which they are being disadvantaged by anticompetitive conduct by big and dominant players by giving them access to the Federal Magistrates Court. We will also enshrine in legislation - make it the law - that one of the deputy chairs of the ACCC will have a small business background.I am pleased that these reforms have been welcomed as striking the right balance from businesses across the board and are seen as a sensible approach. They have been welcomed by the Council of Small Business Organisations, by the Australian Industry Group, by the Motor Traders Association, by the Fair Trading Coalition and by that well-known friend of the government the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. These reforms have been welcomed because they are sensible, they have been welcomed because they are long overdue and they have been welcomed because the previous government wilfully neglected to act.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question and acknowledge his strong engagement with the wheat growers in the electorate of Wakefield, who have a prime involvement in the export market. The reform that was dealt with in the chamber earlier today was required for the $5 billion industry that is the wheat industry in Australia. It was required because of failures of the previous government. If there was ever a moment where it was made clear that the old system was not serving growers well, it was the moment that can be defined by three letters, AWB, or three words, wheat for weapons. At that moment it was made clear to everybody around this parliament that the system had to be changed. Last year the previous government, instead of providing certainty for growers, took the legislation to a point where it provided the worst of all worlds.To find the best endorsement of that, look at what people have defended in this chamber over the last 24 hours. We had the National Party position. They said, 'Forget the current legislation,' and advocated the rules we had at precisely the time that wheat for weapons took place. We then had the Liberal Party position in the Senate inquiry, which said we needed more regulation than what our bills provided. We then had the Liberal Party position in this chamber last night, which said we needed less regulation than what our bills provided. But nobody at any point said the way to provide certainty to growers was to leave the previous government's legacy in place. Not one person in this chamber at any moment during the debate on that bill has said that the previous government's legislation got it right. The reason that no-one can defend it is that it is truly indefensible.I have been seeking for some months to provide certainty for wheat growers through a sensible marketing system into the future. On 5 March we released an exposure draft bill. At any time since 5 March it was open to the Leader of the Opposition to declare what the position of the Liberal Party would be. Growers have had to go through, work out whether they are going to plant and work out exactly what sort of wheat they are going to plant. They have had to make all those business decisions while waiting for the convenience three months later of the Leader of the Opposition to finally declare a position. Certainty for wheat growers is finally getting closer.But we saw divisions when earlier today we had the division here in this chamber on going to the next stage of providing certainty for growers. Let us not pretend that there was any small gap among the members opposite. The Leader of the Opposition, when he talked about the reasons why the Liberal Party would be not opposing it referred to the legislation as being 'consistent with the core philosophy of the Liberal Party'. The National Party, when explaining their reasons for opposing it, referred to the legislation as being a 'fundamental tenet of the National Party'. Each of the parties opposite has completely elevated how wide and fundamental to their core beliefs this issue is. So they have decided that now - when they are voting on opposite sides of the chamber, when they are disagreeing on absolutely fundamental issues and core principles - is the time to say, 'Why don't we amalgamate?' In working out whether now is the time to amalgamate, go to the ABC Online website and you will see comments from plenty of people seeking certainty for growers who are making their thoughts clear. Tony Gilleland writes:The abolition of the single desk is because it lost all credibility through AWB on the National Party's watch, trying to suggest otherwise is laughable.Peter says:What people have to understand is there has been a lot of debate about scrapping the single desk for years, but that it was never going to happen under the Coalition Government.The big, long-term reforms that were necessary to provide certainty for growers were not going to happen under the previous government.Greg A. says:This only shows that the Nationals need to be more independent and not just vote like lemmings to support their Liberal colleagues. It is clear that the Liberals do not treat their election partners well, look at the McGauran defection.As we move forward to try to provide certainty for growers for the next harvest, the chasm between the opposition parties could not be greater - and that is not due to how I define their differences, but due to how they define their differences. They talk about it being a difference between fundamental tenets and core philosophy. When their fundamental tenets and their core philosophy clash but they are still talking about a merger then it can only be because they have given up on plans for a future and are just out there looking for a logo.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. For all the talk about people not knowing where they stand, I do not think that is an accusation that will ever be levelled at the honourable member for Kennedy. There is no doubt that the high grain price is an issue that people in the livestock industries are perilously aware of. There is also no doubt that the ethanol debate is not nearly as simplistic as the simple food-for-fuel debate it is often depicted as.I have visited the Sarina mill to which the honourable member refers, and I have seen and spoken to the people there about some of the opportunities for that ethanol plant and the way forward. The specific question goes to what is happening with respect to progress on the inquiry. There is a review, as has previously been made public and as I have spoken to the honourable member about, being conducted jointly by me and the minister for energy. There is, particularly with the current global food crisis, a great deal of complexity playing into world prices and the individual protectionist policies of some nations - and the United States is the one referred to in the question. Our growers have also taken a particular hit with respect to seven or eight years of extended drought. Those issues all play in together.In terms of the progress, the current part of that inquiry is a review of all existing government policy. Once that review is complete, we will then move forward to look at the issues that were raised specifically in this question. We will then be in a better position to get that balance right in making sure that we deliver economic opportunity, energy security and also a better deal for those who are reliant on various forms of grain, and, in particular, sorghum.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for her interest in this area. I know that she has a longstanding commitment to addressing the issues of violence against women and children. Today the Prime Minister and I attended the first meeting of the National Council on Violence Against Women and Children. Establishing an expert body in this very important area is a major milestone. During the election campaign we said that if we were elected we would accept some responsibility as a Commonwealth government to reduce the incidence and impact of domestic violence and sexual assault on women and children in our community and that we would ask an expert council to help us and guide us in that work. Today we delivered on that commitment.The Australian Bureau of Statistics reports that around one in three Australian women experience physical violence in their lifetime and almost one in five experience sexual violence in their lifetime. It is a problem that remains still too hidden in our community and is one that requires the urgent attention of our government. We released new figures today that show that 90 per cent of women who experience physical or sexual assault do not access crisis support services, legal help or helplines. We also know that two out of every five women who do get help and take out a restraining order against a former partner experience further violence after that restraining order has been put in place. That is simply not good enough. It requires practical Commonwealth leadership in this area.Our council is made up of 11 experts with very high standing. The chair of the council is Libby Lloyd, who is one of the founders of the Australian White Ribbon Day campaign and an internationally respected voice in human rights. The deputy chair is Heather Nancarrow, the Director of the Queensland Centre for Domestic and Family Violence Research. She is also working with us on the homelessness steering group. The other members of the council include: Lisa Wilkinson, Pauline Woodbridge, Vanessa Swan, Dorinda Cox, Andrew O'Keefe, Dr Melanie Heenan, Associate Professor Moira Carmody, Maria Dimopoulos and Rachel Kayrooz. These people are extraordinary community leaders from a very diverse range of backgrounds. I am sure that they will make an enormous commitment in helping us reduce violence against women and children.The Prime Minister has asked this council to oversee not just our national plan but the practical measures that have already begun in this area, including a resource that will roll out to high schools all around the country educating young men and young women about what respectful relationships look like and about the impact of domestic violence and sexual assault on our community. They will also oversee work on the expansion of the White Ribbon Day campaign and a number of other projects that we have already initiated in this area. This is in contrast to the actions of the former government in this area. There was a degree of -  -  - I do know. Mr Speaker, I know they are a little bit sensitive about this. It is in stark contrast to the record of the former government that did, I agree, spend quite a lot of money on advertising in this area. Part of the difference in approach is that the previous government did focus a lot on advertising and publications. In fact when the deputy leader was the minister for women in the financial year 2006-07 they spent more than half a million dollars on publications alone including public information. - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said that they spent this money on a public education campaign. Indeed if we have a look at the public education material that we are talking about, one of the things produced was -  - I am very happy to offer the -  -  - We have 13,000 copies of this book left. It is a beautifully-produced book -  - I would like to offer the remaining 13,000 copies of this book to the opposition. If they are able to dispose of them, they are welcome to have them. - Yes. - </DOC>

 - I am very pleased to get a question, the first question, indeed, in this parliament, from the shadow minister for regional development. I am particularly pleased to get a question about the Sustainable Regions Program. In this House we have had some debate about Regional Partnerships. Many of the members here, even those in regional areas, would not be aware that the previous government had a Sustainable Regions Program. The Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia and I had a meeting with the new Regional Development Australia board, made up of the chairs of the executive of the old area consultative committees here in this parliament. It was a pretty interesting meeting because we discussed the Sustainable Regions Program. There were a number of sustainable regions. One of those was the North Coast of New South Wales.For information on the North Coast of New South Wales I asked the former chair of the area consultative committees, 'What electorates were in the North Coast region of New South Wales?' We all know the North Coast begins at the Queensland border. You cross the Tweed and you hit the electorate of Richmond. But was Richmond included in the Sustainable Region for the North Coast of New South Wales? No! Why? Because after the 2004 election, when Labor won the electorate of Richmond with our outstanding candidate Justine Elliott, they excised it from the North Coast of New South Wales. The North Coast Sustainable Region consisted of Lyne, Cowper and Page but it excluded Richmond. Do not let me think that it was just discrimination against people who happen to vote Labor, because the honourable member's question goes to the Darling Matilda Way region. The Darling Matilda Way begins at the Victorian border and goes -  - The Darling Matilda Way Sustainable Region area begins down around Balranald and the Wentworth local government area. It goes all the way up through Bourke and Brewarrina, which is where this particular project is included. It goes up into Queensland; it has got Diamantina and Barcoo and goes right up to Winton, Longreach, Aramac and Jericho, which, before the election, were of course all held by the National Party exclusively. - The Sustainable Region for Darling Matilda Way stops, though. It does not include Mount Isa, Cloncurry, McKinlay, Richmond, Flinders or Dalrymple. Why? Because they are represented by the member for Kennedy. That is why. The member for Kennedy's area was deliberately excluded from this Sustainable Region.But let us go further and look at a third sustainable region, the Campbelltown Sustainable Region. You know: remote and rural Campbelltown, represented from Mosman. We had two areas - Camden and Campbelltown; not Liverpool around it; not Wollondilly, which is far more regional than either of them; not Wollongong, which is a regional centre - just Camden and Campbelltown. I wonder why? I wonder why you would single out Camden and Campbelltown to make into a sustainable region. What an outrage.The only thing that makes the Regional Partnerships program just look red hot, rather than totally on fire, is the Sustainable Regions program. What an outrage. This mob opposite define 'regional Australia' by how people vote and not by where it was actually located. It was all about politics and not about geography.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question on this very important matter. Today the Rudd government will take an important step for the rights of persons with disabilities. Today I will table a national interest analysis proposing that Australia ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.This convention aims to remove barriers faced by people with disabilities. It enhances opportunities to participate in social and political decision making. It also recognises their rights to education, health, work, decent living conditions, freedom of movement and equal recognition before the law. We are grateful for the valuable input received during the extensive consultations that have occurred in the preparation of this matter.The lead we are taking on the international stage is complemented by practical steps we are taking to improve the rights of persons with disabilities at home. The Prime Minister recently announced an additional $100 million in capital funding to build supported accommodation for people with disabilities. Earlier this week the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs outlined a new agreement to provide a $1.9 billion boost in funding. She rightly congratulated the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services for his role in this important area.The Rudd government is committed to a whole-of-government national disability strategy to increase participation, social inclusion and support for people with disabilities and, importantly, for their carers. The Minister for Employment Participation and others are also developing a specific national mental health and disability employment strategy to identify barriers to employment for people with a disability and practical steps to increase their participation in the workforce and hence their independence. In my portfolio we are developing standards for access to premises and finalising a review of transport standards. I would like to acknowledge the work and assistance of my colleagues the minister for transport and the minister for industry in respect of those matters.In conclusion, the government has a long-term plan and is committed to being a regional and international leader for people with disabilities and, importantly, for their families. I commend the national interest analysis to the House and I urge all members to support the timely ratification of this very important convention.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. This government is fully committed to Australia's solar industry and will remain so. Furthermore, the measures outlined in this budget ensure the sustainability of a solar industry for the long term and address those issues which the former government had not addressed in terms of the delivery of this particular program. I say to the member opposite: this government will bring forward a commitment of some half a billion dollars for Solar Schools, a commitment which will include the delivery of solar panels to Solar Schools, a commitment which was not present in the policies of the former government.This government will bring forward a commitment to Solar Cities, an additional commitment on top of the commitment provided by the former government. I will point out to the members opposite that the government brought forward spending for this particular program - some $25 million was brought forward to the $150 million outlay. If this program had continued in the way in which it was constructed previously, it was agreed by both industry parties and others that it was overheating. We are producing a policy solution which will deliver sustainable growth and we are in close contact with the solar industry. We will monitor this program closely and we have every expectation that this program with the commitment of $150 million over three years, as opposed to $150 million over five years -  - The government has a strong commitment to the solar industry. I make no apology for the fact that we are bringing forward programs which will ensure the sustainability of the solar industry into the long term.</DOC>

 - The government was elected on a platform of delivering responsible economic management, of assisting families, working Australians, pensioners and carers under financial pressure, and also of planning for Australia's long-term future. The government is planning for the future of our infrastructure, planning for the future of our health and hospital system, planning for the future of our education system but also planning for Australia's future in our own immediate region.When it comes to our future in the Asia-Pacific region we in this country face, in the 21st century, the Asia-Pacific region becoming the centre of global economic power and progressively the centre of global strategic power. Therefore, we have a challenge on our hands. We either allow the future to wash over us or seek to engage, plan and shape the future to the best interests of Australian families and Australian working people. The most core interest which every Australian in every constituency represented in this House has is: how do we ensure that Australia operates in a regional environment of peace and security into the century?Right now in the Asia-Pacific region we do not have a body which brings together a common security dialogue, a basis of common security cooperation between the major powers of our wider region - the United States, China, Japan, Indonesia and India. It is time Australia began to shape this agenda, which is why this government has put forward a proposal that we should have an ambition for the region to create an Asia-Pacific community which can, for the first time, have a pan-regional dialogue on the question of our common security. We should not succumb to the inevitability, as some suggest, that there is some real, long-term prospect of war within our region without putting in place mechanisms to ameliorate that risk.Furthermore, on the economic agenda, we must ensure that we have the best mechanism possible to bring about free trade across our wider region. We have a series of bilateral free trade agreements which perform a function. We have negotiations underway through the World Trade Organisation at present. But right now across the Asia-Pacific region there is a great danger that we will end up with a bowl of spaghetti rather than an integrated set of free trade agreements of the type that the President of the United States is advocating.Beyond that, what we need across the Asia-Pacific region is increasing counterdisaster cooperation. Most recently we have seen extraordinary natural disasters in Burma and China. As a region, we need to make sure we have a capacity to respond to these disasters when they occur in a timely fashion so that the region can work as one in dealing with what is increasingly a grave threat to the peoples of our wider region.On the matter which has been the subject of the most recent question, and discussion in the House before with ministerial statements, climate change, we need also a body which works across the Asia-Pacific region, where China and India loom as enormous, long-term emitters, making an enormous long-term contribution to the overall effect of global warming. We must have a mechanism to engage them within our wider region.So what is the government's proposal? The government's proposal is not simply to allow the region to drift. The government's proposal is not simply to allow regional organisations to crop up one after another and not in a properly coordinated fashion. The government's ambition is this: let us, Australia, in partnership with our friends and allies across the region, work towards an ambition of bringing about an Asia-Pacific century. Those opposite may deride that as a legitimate ambition for Australia. We on this side of the House do not.In terms of our country's long-term security interests, economic interests, trade interests, environment interests, the way in which we manage our investment interests and the handling of natural disasters in our part of the world, making sure that we have the most effective regional cooperation arrangements in a body which, once and for all, brings the United States, China and India into a common body to shape our world, our region's future, is the government's ambition. I invite those opposite to support that ambition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I think it is time to lay out for the House the history of the support for the solar industry in this country over the last two decades and make very clear that the posture of the former government - those now sitting opposite us - has never been to have significant support for solar, none whatsoever. As I recall, you were always supporting nuclear, not solar. It was your former leader who made it perfectly clear, as I recall -  - that renewables were on the margin, not in the centre of this debate. I listened carefully to the question that the honourable member put. - The fact is that previously, under the former government, this was a five-year program. They had perfect notice that this program was oversubscribed and would have overheated and produced in the solar industry demand fluctuations such that it would have made this industry very difficult to be sustainable. The government has brought forward rebates, increased the number of rebates that are available and compressed a five-year program into a three-year program, thus providing for greater sustainability for the solar industry, something I have pointed out to representatives of the industry when I have met with them and heard their concerns. But we have done much more than that.We have produced a plan for low-interest loans which will see householders able to put solar panels on their roofs with low-interest loans made available to Australian communities. We have an investment of half a billion dollars for Solar Schools, which will see Australian schools able to put solar panels on their roofs, a program which starts after 1 July. Additionally, we have an emissions-trading scheme and a renewable energy target - all things which will contribute significantly to the capacity of the solar industry, an industry we want to see succeed and an industry which we have the policy settings to support.</DOC>

 - The latest release of the OECD's Economic Outlook notes that the current economic situation across the OECD remains particularly unsettled. The OECD's projection for the global economy also says:... despite the fact that there is a view that the worst may be behind us in relation to global financial markets, there is still much uncertainty which lies ahead.There is 'much uncertainty which lies ahead.' Of course, the consequences for Australia in the midst of this global uncertainty are acute. That is why the response of the government has been to bring about a budget anchored in this principle: responsible economic management. Therefore, the core of responsible economic management is defending the integrity of a $22-billion budget surplus. The logic is simple: if you allow public spending to escape, if you allow public spending to run riot, if you therefore contribute to public demand, you put upward pressure on inflation and you put upward pressure on interest rates. When that happens, as those opposite know, having been responsible in terms of their fiscal policy settings for these trends to have emerged - and we have seen 12 interest rate rises in a row - the cumulative effect is that it affects long-term economic growth and it affects long-term employment. The logic is clear: indisciplined public spending leads in turn to higher inflation, leads in turn to upward pressure on interest rates, leads in turn to an effect on economic growth in Australia and leads in turn to an effect on employment. That is the core economic discipline we are confronted with here. The core element of our budget orthodoxy is a $22 billion surplus. Those opposite stand, by contrast, for a $22 billion raid on the surplus and, as each day goes by, they add further elements to the raid on the surplus. Day by day new things are added without one savings measure being announced by those opposite to offset their raid on the surplus. - As the finance minister correctly interjects, where is the list of proposed savings by those opposite? Not one. Do I hear any objection about where the savings are to occur? Not one. So we stand difficult decisions: a $22-billion surplus, for which there will be, automatically, controversy in the Australian community. It was a tough decision but a tough decision anchored in responsible economic management for the future - in contrast to a $22-billion raid on the surplus, one which grows further.Returning to what the OECD Economic Outlook had to say, it says on page 142 of the report:To avoid rising inflation expectations causing strong wage growth, monetary conditions need to be kept tight until domestic demand and price pressures have moderated sufficiently. In this context, - the OECD goes on - the stabilising role that fiscal policy should play is welcome.That is, 'the stabilising role that fiscal policy should play is welcome'. Fiscal policy is what you do with your budget. Fiscal policy is whether you are going to have a robust surplus or not. Fiscal policy discipline is about whether you are going to defend that surplus. Fiscal indiscipline and economic irresponsibility equals a $22 billion raid on the surplus. So my appeal to those opposite, as each one of these items of legislation to do with the budget goes through the chamber, this House, and through that other place, the Senate, is to consider first and foremost your responsibility to the long-term economic interests of this nation. If you unleash a $22 billion raid on the surplus, which is your current stated plan, what it will do inevitably is drive up inflation and drive up interest rates and the impact on all Australians for that would be, in a word, disastrous.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his new-found affection for Dean Mighell and his willingness to cite Mr Mighell as an example of the economic approach of the opposition. The fact is that the Rudd Labor government takes sustainability seriously and it takes the solar industry seriously. It recognises that economic competence and economic capacity go hand in hand when designing programs which would see greenhouse gas emissions come down and us meet the challenges that we have with climate change. The fact is that this program was a five-year program which it seems the opposition were willing to let burn out. - We were not prepared to do that. We wanted a sustainable program. That is what it will be. I point out to members opposite that additional to the measures I have already outlined to the House -  - we have a half-a-billion-dollar investment in renewable energy. We have half a billion dollars which we have identified for investment in renewable energy. We have a commitment to solar thermal. We have been talking about solar in this House for a long time and now this government is acting.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question. The government faces a tough fight against inflation and, therefore, has handed down a tough budget with a $22 billion surplus that is central to that fight. Reducing public sector demand is crucial to that fight against inflation and crucial to ensuring that we maximise downward pressure on interest rates. It is vital that government spending restraint be allowed to work. That is why it is vital that government legislation to implement the budget is able to pass through the parliament by 1 July this year. If it does not pass by then, it could well be late August or early September at the earliest before the Senate considers the legislation again. That, in turn, would delay the implementation of these measures and threaten to erode the surplus and erode that government spending restraint.The Liberal opposition are blocking a number of initiatives in the budget, a number of taxes and charges initiatives, and if they are delayed by three months it will reduce the surplus by almost $300 million. They include the increase in the luxury car tax, the reform of the condensate exercise fee, the increases in visa fees for foreigners and passport fees and the imposition of means tests for certain government transfer payments at the level of $150,000 of family income. We do not see too many huge issues of principle involved in the opposition's stance on these issues. There are no broken promises; there are no issues that are essential to the philosophy of the Liberal Party. What exactly are they trying to stop? These are initiatives like removing an outdated tax break for big resource companies, charging foreigners more for visas and removing a punitive tax on middle-income earners that tries to force them to take out private health insurance. Where are the big issues of principle that override the needs for fiscal responsibility and budget discipline? The answer is: they are not there.The Leader of the Opposition is a very angry man. He is angry about almost everything. In the interests of fiscal responsibility, I am happy to chip in for a bit of anger management for the Leader of the Opposition because that might help the fiscal position of this nation. The Liberal response to the budget has been an empty, populist, posturing response. Their stated position would eliminate $22 billion from the surplus over four years and they have yet to put forward a single savings measure. They are adding to the list daily; the endless cavalcade of giveaways just keeps on growing. Yesterday it was another $975 million according to the Leader of the Opposition, taken from a supposed GST windfall on petrol prices to be given to pensioners. There are a couple of problems with this. Firstly, the Treasury calculation is that, if there is a 'windfall', it is $411 million and not $975 million, so the costing that the Leader of the Opposition came up with is slightly deficient. Secondly, there is a slight problem in that as people spend more on petrol because prices are going up there is a tendency for them to spend less on other things - things that have GST on them. So the actual increase in GST receipts to the states could be significantly lower even than that figure. And, finally, there is the fact that not content with raiding the federal budget surplus the Leader of the Opposition also wants to raid the budgets of the states because that is where the GST revenue goes. And, just like with the federal budget, he is happy to stand up here, lecture the states and say that their budget positions are not strong enough and yet, at the same time, advance positions that would weaken those budget positions.I conclude by quoting from the Reserve Bank statement on interest rates that was issued on 3 June. It says:_ the Board has been seeking to restrain demand in order to reduce inflation over time._Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  __ the Board's current assessment is that demand growth will be moderate this year.And finally:Should demand not slow as expected _ that outlook would need to be reviewed.The message is crystal clear: if demand starts accelerating again, expect an increased risk of higher interest rates. And the one guaranteed way to increase demand is to erode the surplus; it is to take money away from the surplus. The Leader of the Opposition appears to have nicked his economic policy from some long forgotten 1970s Latin American military dictator. That is the origin of his economic position. Well, Generalissimo, the Australian people will not be very pleased. They will not salute you if your raid on the surplus -  - causes higher interest rates in Australia. That is the path that you are headed down.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, and I point out to the House that, when the demand for this solar panels program and the rebate were seen to be heavily overheating, the responsible course of action was to ensure that the generous rebate went to those who needed it most. One of the things that intrigues me about this debate is that we are really trying to get a little bit too clever with the words that people utter. - And in doing that -  - I refer to comments from the opposition's environment spokesman, Mr Hunt, on ABC radio this morning when he said the program was designed to be demand driven and not capped. That is the essential point here. The government has provided caps of some 6,000 rebates for Australians who are in a position, to who ought to be able to and who want to put solar panels on their roofs. Under the policies of the former government, the rebate that was available without any means testing would have used up the allocation of funding for that program within a remarkably short period of time. To explain even further, our expectation is that Australians who earn below $100,000 will seek to take advantage of the means test and take the rebate. We will monitor the demand for this program closely. We also anticipate that Australians will seek to take advantage of the other programs that the government has and as well show their enthusiasm for solar energy and seek to have solar panels on their roofs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his very clear question. In responding to the member's very clear question, I know that he has a very deep concern for the circumstances of working families in his electorate and particularly providing assistance to working families with the cost of child care. As we have had cause to discuss in this House in the past, the government is determined to build future prosperity by investing in lifting productivity. There is much that needs to be done to lift the productivity performance of our nation. Today's productivity growth is tomorrow's prosperity. This productivity agenda is built on a solid foundation. That foundation is sound economic management and a surplus of $22 billion that fights inflation and puts downward pressure on interest rates. Within the budget measures there is the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget and Other Measures) Bill and it is an important part of the government's productivity and participation measures.The clock is ticking. The members of the Liberal Party have until the end of this month - to the end of June - to choose between responsible economic management and cheap, short-term politics. If they choose to oppose or delay the childcare bill, then they will be putting up in neon lights that they are wreckers of our productivity and participation agenda and they are people who would seek to deny a benefit to working families. What we are looking to deliver on 1 July through this legislation is an increase in the child care tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, up to $7,500 of assistance per child per year. Importantly, this measure will be paid quarterly so families get timely assistance. We want to deliver that measure on 1 July. We know it will provide substantial relief for working families. Last night in speaking in the debate on this bill the shadow minister, the member for Warringah, said:The fact that most people will be better off is beside the point. - I note the contribution of the member for Warringah, a man who dedicated his time as Leader of the House in my memory to fairness and balance in this House! Is that how we recall it? Not quite. That the member for Warringah said in the debate, 'The fact that most people will be better off is beside the point,' is a perspective that the government would like to firmly reject. We think the fact that working families are going to be better off is the point. We want to give them additional assistance with their child care. Obviously, the members opposite - the Liberal Party - do not understand the pressures on working families when it comes to child care. Any delay in passing this legislation will hit working families.Unfortunately, hitting working families would not be out of character, given the opposition's track record on child care. In the 11 years to 2007, the average fee for a child in full-time long day care increased by 76 per cent from $149 per week to $262 per week - a 76 per cent increase. In the 1996 budget, the assistance that the Liberal Party provided with the costs of child care was to freeze childcare assistance payments for two years. They did not understand then in 1996 that working families need assistance and they do not understand it now. We should remind ourselves that, in government, they also removed operational and capital work subsidies for community based centres, forcing a number of centres to reduce in size or close completely and forcing others to raise fees. If that was not enough, they also withdrew funding that was to support the construction of 5,500 new childcare places. Finally, under political pressure, they introduced the child care tax rebate, but then of course members of working families had to wait two years before receiving their first payment. This is a shameful track record on child care. That shameful track record would be added to in another disgraceful episode if the opposition held up our legislation which will bring fee relief to working families.</DOC>

 - The suggestion that a minister has misled the House is a very serious one and should not be made lightly. I was asked yesterday by the member for Dickson why the Office of Parliamentary Counsel was not involved in the drafting of the Fuelwatch legislation. He alleged or implied that there had been some skirting around the process and that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel was not involved in the drafting of the legislation. If there is any misleading of the House going on, it is going on on that side. In Senate estimates last night the Treasury confirmed that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel was involved in the drafting of the legislation.Â  In fact, yesterday I undersold that involvement. It has been confirmed today that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel in fact did all the drafting of the legislation.This was confirmed last night and I double-checked today. This is the advice to me - which I will table in a moment - from Mr Jim Murphy, Executive Director of the Markets Group of the Australian Treasury. He is, in effect, for those members who are not aware, the second most senior member of the Australian Treasury. It reads:Questions have been raised in Parliament regarding the drafting of the Fuelwatch Bills. The drafting of the Fuelwatch Bills was undertaken by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The instructing officers were Treasury officials. This is the normal process used for the drafting of Government legislation.I table that document.I understand the sensitivities of honourable members opposite, who do not want to get on the record the evidence of the Senate estimates for four hours last night and, by my last count, five hours so far today. What we have heard in Senate estimates is that the Australian Treasury endorsed the modelling of the ACCC and recommended Fuelwatch to the Australian government. Remember what we heard last week about how disgraceful it is not to listen to central agencies? Well, the Senate estimates last night heard, and Senator Coonan confirmed this morning, the advice that the Australian Treasury was comfortable with the work of the ACCC. For five hours so far today we have had a powerful argument for Fuelwatch from the ACCC, which those opposite do not want to hear. They can talk about process. We will talk about delivering benefits for the Australian people, which is what Fuelwatch does - as the Australian Treasury said last night and as the ACCC has said this morning.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question and her very real concern for families and older Australians, particularly those living on the Central Coast of New South Wales, who she knows are really facing significant pressure as a result of inflation and of course rising interest rates. We know that inflation is the No. 1 enemy of Australian families and certainly other Australians who are doing it tough: pensioners, carers and others who are on fixed incomes. They are finding it very difficult to make ends meet with rising prices. So we know that the responsibility of the budget is to get this inflation issue under control.Just this morning the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (2008 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2008 went through this House. What we are concerned about is that it is not held up in the Senate by the opposition, because this bill contains an important measure to help rein in spending - that is, the changes to family tax benefit B. If the Liberal and National parties in the Senate decide to delay this legislation until September, it is estimated that it could cost around $28 million. This would be a very substantial price tag for delay in the Senate. We on this side of the House have worked very hard to deliver a $22 billion surplus, primarily to help families and those who are finding it hard to make ends meet, to fight inflation. It is all about making sure we can fight inflation and keep downward pressure on interest rates. If the opposition does decide to block any of these measures in the Senate, it will have a direct and immediate impact on the surplus.We have to be, and we on this side of the parliament intend to be, both economically and socially responsible. If the opposition pursue blocking this measure in the Senate, it will have at least a $28 million impact on the surplus. That will only hurt families, and other Australians who are doing it tough, by making our fight against inflation even more difficult.</DOC>

 - I would refer the honourable member to my second reading speech. I would also refer him to the numerous public comments on this from both me and the Prime Minister. The cabinet took a decision that the implementation costs of Fuelwatch for small business should be zero. Accordingly, that decision was taken in light of the regulatory impact statement. The cabinet weighed up that advice and gave me an instruction that the establishment cost should be zero. Accordingly, the ACCC have changed the model of implementation so that there is no software to be implemented by small business. They will be able to advise of the price on the ACCC's website. They will be able to advise on a toll-free number and they will have zero cost. At the moment, that compares to -  -  - That compares to at the moment where most, not all, service stations notify the website, which was characterised this morning by the Chairman of the ACCC as being anticompetitive, and inform sources of their price changes every time they change prices - as many times as it happens a day. There will be one notification per day to the ACCC. I fail to see how one notification per day to the ACCC on a toll-free number or via email involves compliance costs for small business.The member for O'Connor then left the chamber.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question because, like many people in this House, he has large numbers of people in his electorate who are unable to get the dental care that they need. We have already heard from a number of ministers about the opposition's approach to the budget and the pressure that that is going to put on inflation - the threats that will continue by raiding the budget surplus. But, in addition to those threats, there is an additional threat to the community, and the impact of the opposition's delaying of the budget will come at a very high cost for those many hundreds of thousands of Australians who are waiting for dental care. In this budget we announced two new measures to improve dental care. Together they amount to $780 million worth of investment in dental care. The first is to implement the teen dental plan, a policy we took to the election last year. Starting in July, if the opposition does not persist with its obstructive approach, the government plans to invest $490 million to help more than one million Australian teenagers look after their teeth. Each eligible teenager will receive $150 towards an annual preventative dental check, including an oral examination, a scale and clean and X-rays where they are required. Preventative check-ups will also prevent cavities and other dental diseases and the need for more expensive dental procedures further down the track.The second measure is $290 million to the states and territories to assist in clearing the waiting lists of 650,000 people around the country who are waiting for public dental treatment. We have to remember not only the impact on individuals but that 50,000 people every year end up in our hospitals with dental conditions that could have been prevented. So we know that helping people get early attention for their dental problems not only helps them but takes pressure off our hospitals.So we see that the opposition's approach is not only hurting the surplus and hurting inflation but hurting many hundreds of thousands of people. Interestingly, we know this problem is bad not just because I am telling you it is bad but also because the member for North Sydney has told us how bad it is. On 6 March the member for North Sydney said:Dentistry remains out of the reach to those on low incomes with around 30 per cent of Australians unable to see a dentist because of cost.Yet now we see the opposition wanting to delay this important measure. On 12 March the member for North Sydney said:... 25.5 per cent of Australians have untreated dental decay; one in six Australian adults are limited in what food they can eat because of their teeth; and 50,000 Australians are hospitalised each year with preventable dental disease.I wonder if that sounds familiar to any people on this side of the House, because it seems to me, when I go back and check, that the member for North Sydney was actually quoting from old Labor press releases. He seems to be singing from our songsheet. He is opening his mouth and my voice is coming out. It is quite disconcerting to think of Joe Hockey as the Milli Vanilli of the parliament. It is a worry. Just three months delay of this measure -  - I did not say that, but perhaps he is right - it may be more Meat Loaf than Milli Vanilli. - Just three months delay in this important measure will rob the community of nearly $40 million worth of dental care at a time when we know hundreds of thousands of people need it. Their approach to the budget is a threat to the surplus, it is a threat to inflation and it is a threat to hundreds of thousands of Australians who need dental care and want it as soon as possible.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. I refer to my previous answer. There will be no implementation costs for small business, and as for ongoing costs - one phone call a day, one email a day, with a toll-free number supplied by the ACCC. If the honourable member for Wentworth would like to explain to the House how that involves an ongoing implementation cost - one phone call a day on a toll-free number or one email a day - we would be very glad to hear it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question and for his interest in infrastructure. I actually spent last Sunday in the electorate of the honourable member for Forde looking at the opportunities for an expansion of intermodal transport in the hinterlands of the Gold Coast. Just after that, I spent time in the electorate of the member for McPherson opening the Tugun bypass along with the Queensland Premier.Our budget delivers a $22 billion surplus designed to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. This is a necessary precondition if we are to be able to put aside funds for nation building. The government has taken the tough decisions required to overcome the capacity constraints which are hindering our economy, as the Reserve Bank has identified on more than 20 occasions and as the Reserve Bank once again reminded all who looked at the press release released by the Governor of the Reserve Bank on Tuesday. We have delivered a budget that is economically responsible. The budget represents an important step towards turning around our economic growth prospects in the face of infrastructure bottlenecks and other capacity constraints. Unless we pass the budget bills, the size of the surplus will begin to fall, just between June and September, by at least one-quarter of a billion dollars. This will undermine our nation-building funds - the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund. You cannot put aside money for long-term infrastructure investment unless you have a strong budget surplus. A strong surplus is an essential component of long-term economic prosperity. It is a means to building a modern, highly productive economy.By contrast, the approach that has been adopted by the opposition to our legislative agenda is not driven by a matter of high principle. This is an opposition that still has not come to terms with the judgement made by the Australian public just six months ago. It is prepared to blow a $22 billion hole in the budget and put at risk the money that we need to secure the nation's long-term economic future in order to secure the short-term political future of the Leader of the Opposition. The time has come for the opposition to stop its short-term political games and let us, the government, get on with the business of long-term nation building.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question and for the opportunity to say publicly what I have said privately on this issue in conversations with many members on each side of the House. There are a large number of areas coming up for exceptional circumstances review at the moment. To say that I have had that report for many weeks is not strictly accurate, but you are right - it has been received by me. - Yes, that is all appreciated. The concern is understandable and the concern is real. Many people from outside those regions would have been deceived by seeing images of floods over summer and would have thought that a flood means that a drought is over. It does not necessarily mean that, and it is important that reviews of exceptional circumstances are done accurately and in a timely way to try to give people certainty at the earliest possible opportunity.There is a tension faced at these times - and I was speaking with one member from the opposite side of the House about this earlier today - which is the same tension that was faced by the previous government, which is that you want to make the assessment as early as possible in order to give certainty to people. At the same time, the earlier you make the assessment the higher the risk that you will actually disadvantage people by the answers that are given, if it does not subsequently rain subsequent to the assessment having been made. With that in mind, I expect that I will be able to make announcements following the NRAC reviews in the very near future.The issue of Centrelink officers making information available prior to a decision being made does concern me and I will make some inquiries about that. For the benefit of the House I also add, because there has been some misinformation around about the impact of the drought reviews which are currently underway, that the drought reviews which are currently underway go to what the policy should be for future droughts. For people in the current drought the rules which have applied on a bipartisan basis continue. The NRAC assessments are being done by the same people who were appointed by the previous government under the same rules with the same benefits.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and note his continuing strong interest in and concern about the environment. The United Nations has declared the theme for World Environment Day 2008: 'Kick the habit! Towards a low carbon economy' and for our part the Rudd government is taking a whole-of-government comprehensive approach to the whole-of-planet problem of climate change. Earlier today the Prime Minister spoke in the House about the positive contribution Australian car manufacturers can make in helping the transport industry kick the carbon habit.A further example of the comprehensive approach we are taking in addressing the risks of climate change came with the $2.25 billion Caring for Our Country program designed to build the resilience of our natural and farming landscapes in the face of climate change pressure. I was pleased that this week we could announce a major initiative, the launch of Australia's 25th Indigenous protected area, the Kaanju Ngaachi, Wenlock and Pascoe Rivers Protected Area, covering some 2,000 square kilometres of wet tropical forest country and sand ridge country between Lockhart River, Cullen River and Weipa on Cape York. As well as building nature's buffers against climate change, this brand new protected area will create meaningful work for Indigenous people in some of Australia's most remote areas, helping more communities access the social, economic and educational benefits that IPA communities already experience.The government will establish an emissions trading scheme. Additionally, the government knows that we must act decisively now to slow the rate of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. That is why we are also committed to a range of complementary measures, particularly in the area of energy efficiency, sometimes known as the so-called 'low-hanging fruit'. We want to give Australians the opportunity to pick that low-hanging fruit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save household energy bills.Today the challenge to reduce those emissions on a domestic front was brought home with the release of a new report, Energy use in the Australian residential sector 1986-2020. The bottom line of the report is sobering: a forecast increase in energy usage of some 56 per cent by 2020 with a growth of almost four million homes and 1,000 million square kilometres in that time. But the real news in the report is not the size of the challenge - we have accepted that energy use is increasing; we have known it for some time. It is the fact that we take up the opportunity to enable householders to respond as they use energy by getting access to consumer information with minimum standards for energy use that is a powerful tool for them which encourage innovation and see the deployment of existing technologies so consumers can make smart decisions and achieve fantastic results for the growing number of households and for the environment.The other message from this report is that Australia has lagged behind in energy efficiency improvements. So today I am pleased to report to the House that as well as taking the steps along the path of existing energy efficiency measures, including appliance standards and labels, additionally we have announced important steps in the budget - a total of $1 billion in support for Australian households and communities to tackle climate change. We have also committed $14 million to put the energy efficiency of electrical appliances on the fast track, giving Australians better information as well as providing an incentive for manufacturers and importers to continually improve their products. As well, we are hitting the accelerator pedal with additional initiatives of a new television labelling scheme to enable consumers to identify the most energy efficient sets at point of sale with an expansion of the label to identify super efficient products. There is a new guide to help householders, and in particular renovators, to identify ways to incorporate energy saving measures in their homes, and, with the boom in household renovations, this will be well received. And there is also the acceleration of the phase-out of traditional incandescent light bulbs.Not only are we bringing significant new measures forward; we are also speeding up and strengthening things that were begun earlier. Each of these measures is important. Each of them shows the commitment that the Rudd Labor government has on issues of climate change and on recognising the importance of energy efficiency. Given the debate and the questions that we have had in the House today on the matter of where the opposition has been on climate change and on questions of this sort, I referred in the House the other day to the statement by the member for Flinders when in government concerning the gift of a Wollemi pine tree to the King of Sweden, which was described as a 'symbolic gesture' of action being taken to tackle climate change. I simply say this: imagine the conversation when the member for Flinders had the discussion with his Majesty, the King of Sweden. 'Your Majesty, I am from the Howard government. We won't sign Kyoto. We won't set a target to reduce emissions. We don't like emissions trading very much. We think Al Gore is a fraud. Our backbenchers spend a lot of time writing reports about climate change on other planets. But anyway, here is a Wollemi pine tree as a symbolic gesture of our commitment.' -  - The opposition has been concentrating on the question of means tests for rebates. May I point out that the member for Wentworth has means-tested rebates for solar hot water at the level of $100,000. We have a commitment to the solar industry and to addressing climate change and we have a commitment to ensuring that the Australian people know that on this side of the House we are fair dinkum about these issues, not full of symbolism. This is the place of substance. -  - </DOC>

 - I draw the honourable member's attention to one core fact, and that is the cumulative impact of 12 interest rate rises in a row. Twelve interest rate rises in a row have an impact on the real economy and real perceptions - obviously, a legacy which the member for Higgins is enormously proud of, given it caused him great mirth when I mentioned 12 interest rate rises in a row. For those out there struggling in small business and doing it tough, for those out there who are trying to balance the family budget, let me say that 12 interest rate rises in row add up to a real effect on the economy, which is why this government has a clear-cut plan for dealing with the challenge of inflation.Let me go through it again for the benefit of the member for Cowper. If you allow public spending to rise without constraint, as those opposite now recommend, it flows through to public demand. If that happens, you add fuel to the fires of inflation. And when that happens, you put upward pressure on interest rates. And when that happens, it flows through to the overall growth of the economy, including to the small business sector as well as to economic confidence, through to the ultimate impact on employment. That is the core economic logic here.In January this year, a month after taking office, we on this side of the House articulated a five-point strategy for dealing with inflation. We have implemented that strategy, including through the budget process. Those opposite have a one-point strategy for dealing with inflation: pull out a huge bucket of kerosene and throw it on the inflation fires. It is called the $22 billion raid on the surplus. I challenge those opposite for the first time in the six months that they have been in opposition to advocate a coherent alternative economic strategy aimed at fighting inflation, and that means yielding in this debate your alternative to the $22 billion raid on the surplus that you are contemplating. My challenge to the Leader of the Opposition is to stand at the dispatch box and give us the list of where the offsetting savings are. If he fails to do that it is clear cut: it is a $22 billion raid not just on the surplus but also on a core economic responsibility and therefore an assault on the interests of small business and the general economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. Perhaps a little unusually in this place, I would like to begin answering this question by acknowledging the opposition's position on this matter. We know that in a bid for any event the size of the FIFA World Cup, bipartisan support is incredibly important. It is incredibly important particularly in this bid and at this point I would like to acknowledge a letter from the opposition to the Prime Minister last week which outlines the bipartisan support for the 2018 World Cup bid. We certainly welcome this.I am also aware that there has been some degree of public discussion in recent days regarding both the cost and the process for Australia's bid to host the World Cup in 2018. I would like to take this opportunity to outline some further details on these matters. Recent media speculation has put a figure of $60 million on federal government support for this bid. This is an imaginary figure. No financial commitment has been given at this stage, nor has one been sought by the FFA, but we do continue to have regular discussions with the federations about the best ways that we can support them in this bid. We are only at the beginning of a very lengthy process, and any of these figures which have been quoted widely are both inaccurate and premature.There has also been some debate regarding which is the best state of Australia to bid for the World Cup. The government is advised that FIFA will make a decision on both the 2018 and the 2022 World Cup at the same time. Whilst we have also been informed that bidding for one will not preclude a bid for the other, our sights remain firmly set on 2018. The FFA have advised us that last week, during the FIFA World Congress, they received many supportive messages from a diverse range of countries regarding our intention to bid for 2018. Indeed, we saw that the President of the Italian FA, Giancarlo Abete, committed to supporting the FFA bid last week. Also, Danny Jordaan, the chief executive of South Africa's 2010 organising committee, said:'It's going to be a tough fight, but I think that Australia has a great track record with major events.'Oceania, which has a vote on the FIFA executive, has also said that it is supporting Australia's bid for 2018. Many nations are aware of the growing importance of Asia in world football and that it is the fastest-growing economic power in the world. In fact, we have been telling many countries that 48 per cent of the cumulative TV audience of 26.3 billion for the 2006 World Cup came from Asia. I am sure that this is a fact that is not lost on FIFA executives or its commercial partners.There is also enormous economic benefit if Australia can secure a successful bid. One need only look at the income generated by major sporting events such as the Rugby World Cup or the Sydney Olympics to see how much sporting events can generate for us. We know that, in comparison, the FIFA World Cup is very impressive in this regard. But there are also broader benefits to Australia - in tourism, in trade, in building infrastructure for the future and in further enhancing our reputation as a sporting powerhouse. Bringing the World Cup to Australia will not just be good for football lovers but will be good for our country. We welcome the support of all those who have got behind this campaign and we pledge to continue to support the Football Federation of Australia in this enormous and very exciting endeavour.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. What the government has provided in the budget - and it was a policy we announced before the last election - is $4 million, over four years, of assistance to go to a body that is participated in by the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union, certainly, but also by employers and the fashion industry in general. The purpose of the committee - and I went to the launch - is that they seek to have employers sign up to an accreditation standard which is about how they treat their workers, most particularly on the question of outwork. Having signed that standard, it enables them to display on the garments that they make a No Sweat Shop label. I am sure that there are people around this country, including people sitting in this chamber right now and people in the galleries and people listening to the broadcast, who would if they could, through a label like a No Sweat Shop label, use the power of their purchasing dollar to indicate that they would prefer to buy and wear clothing that has not been made by outworkers in exploitative conditions. Many people would choose to do that. I think that is an important step forward.Many people would have heard it on the radio and it has been investigated by a number of parliamentary committees: the evidence on this is very, very clear. Indeed, until this question, I would have said it was bipartisan policy in this House to provide special provision to outworkers. I note that even in the context of the darkest, darkest days of the Howard government when it was imposing Work Choices on working Australians -  - Even in their darkest, darkest days, they realised that outworkers needed some special protections. I note that the industrial relations extremism they are clearly headed towards -  - is even worse than Work Choices. That is all that can be assumed from this question. But from parliamentary inquiries around the country it is clear that it is almost impossible to get a real count of the number of outworkers because, by definition, the work is hidden. It is in garages. It is in homes. It is paid for in cash. It is paid to people who are exploited. Outworkers have given direct evidence of earning $3, maybe $4, an hour for the work that they do. No-one in this country could say that they have got an absolutely accurate count of the number of outworkers. What do we therefore do? What does anybody working in this policy area do? You make the best possible estimates available to you. - The policy construct here is clear. I think it is wrong and the government thinks it is wrong for women predominantly from non-English-speaking backgrounds -  - mostly recently arrived in migrants, to work sewing at home in conditions where they are exploited. Clearly the opposition does not think that is wrong.</DOC>

 - Climate change is a challenge for the globe, for our region and for our domestic policy settings in Australia. In fact, if we look at the IPCC report and its projections in relation to Australia on climate change, we see it states the following with high confidence:By 2020, significant loss of biodiversity is projected to occur in some ecologically rich sites, including the Great Barrier Reef and Queensland Wet Tropics. By 2030, water security problems are projected to intensify in southern and eastern Australia ... By 2030, production from agriculture and forestry is projected to decline over much of southern and eastern Australia ... By 2050, ongoing coastal development and population growth in some areas of Australia ... are projected to exacerbate risks from sea level rise and increases in the severity and frequency of storms and coastal flooding.All reasonable members of this House would conclude that that represents a stark set of warnings for the nation's future. Those opposite do not believe in planning for the future; they seem to think that that is something exotic. From their 12 years of inertia, we understand why.This government believes in planning for the future. When you receive this sort of stark warning from the IPCC, a responsible government has no recourse but to act. That is why we have embarked upon an approach based on three pillars: one, reducing carbon emissions; two, adaptation; and three, engaging our global partners to ensure that we achieve a genuine global compact on climate change. On the question of reducing carbon emissions, the government's plan is rooted in what we will do on emissions trading - something which those opposite simply ignored, year in, year out, despite recommendations from their own advisers over a long period of time. - I would have thought that even the member for Mayo might have been interested in climate change. It may have been of passing interest to him in his 12 years as foreign minister and in his engagement with many governments and foreign ministers around the world. Maybe it got in the road of a game of tennis here and there - I am not sure. In terms of core business for the nation, climate change was something which the foreign minister should have engaged in, and he failed spectacularly to do so.The course of action embarked upon by our government is as follows. We are acting on an emissions trading regime, on a mandatory renewable energy target and on domestic programs as well. These domestic programs enhance alternative fuels and alternative energy, and include our present engagement with the automobile industry on important programs for the future designed to increase overall fuel efficiency.With solar, there is the $480 million National Solar Schools program, the $150 million low emissions plan for renters and the $300 million Green Loans program, as well as something which we have continued, the solar hot water rebate scheme. That seemed to have a means test in it. How much was it? It was $100,000. I thought that the Leader of the Opposition said today that 'the environment can't be means tested'? Have I missed something? The member for Wentworth, when he was the minister for the environment, means-tested the solar hot water rebate scheme. Stone the crows. Selective memory again, but that is just a matter of detail for those opposite.Our second approach when it comes to climate change is to deal with adaptation, which is absolutely imperative. This is where those in rural and regional Australia are feeling it most. This government, through the actions of the Minister for Climate Change and Water and the minister for agriculture, is at the forefront of negotiating with our rural industry organisations about how we will deal with that challenge.Our third course of action is our global action: what we are doing with the rest of the international community. Unless we bring down global carbon emission, the ultimate impact on our planet will be disastrous. We had to enter into the full sphere of negotiation - not partially, not at the sides and not at the margins, which is what the member for Mayo was so happy to support in times past, but centrally. That had one precondition: ratifying Kyoto. That is why the first action of this government was to ratify the Kyoto protocol, giving us a full seat at the table in global negotiations. If the rest of the world is going to negotiate a global compact which has an effect on Australian industry and international economic circumstances, we want to be full participants in that and not simply at the margins, which is where those opposite were pleased to be.It also affects our relationships with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. We have engaged in further discussions with them about how we can go about protecting the rainforests of those countries to make a contribution there. We have also engaged with the United States. What is interesting in the United States is that we now have a strong commitment for the future from both sides of the aisle, Republican and Democrat. Senator Obama committed to reductions of 80 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050. Senator McCain has previously supported a bill that requires 65 per cent reductions on 2000 levels by 2050. I would suggest to those opposite that they study hard and see where leadership on these questions lies now in the United States. The Republican Party and the Democratic Party are on board. But on the part of the Liberal Party of Australia all we have is continued obfuscation.In fact, six months ago what did we have from those opposite? Six months ago, they did not even believe in climate change. Six months later, 'Whoops; we believe in climate change.' Six months ago, they wanted a nuclear reactor in every backyard, and suddenly they have forgotten about that policy. Six months ago they said that if we ratified Kyoto the economy would collapse. The Leader of the Opposition went on record to say that Australia has rightly refused to sign the Kyoto protocol. It is time that those opposite got real on this. In the United States, Senator Obama and Senator McCain have clear-cut positions of international leadership on climate change. There is none from the Liberal Party of Australia.We had the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, stand up here and say that he did not believe in the human causes of global warming. Do you remember that? It was fewer than 18 months ago. The same Mr Howard stood up in the parliament and said that if Senator Obama or the Democrats won the presidential election in the United States it would be a victory for al-Qaeda. Those opposite stood behind those comments. They stood behind the comments of Mr Howard when he denied any link between human activity and climate change. It is time that those opposite got real. They should join with the government and adopt a realistic posture for engaging the world on long-term solutions for climate change rather than pretend that it is something for which they have no responsibility.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - It is quite plain that working families, working Australians, pensioners and carers are under cost-of-living pressures. That is why the government, through the budget, has introduced a $55 billion family support package. When that starts to flow, from 1 January 2009, its impact for a typical young family will be to deliver some $51.54 per week, as a result of the budget. That contrasts with a proposal from those opposite which represents $2.50 a week if you are filling up with 50 litres - $2.50 a week versus $51.54 a week. I would suggest there is a clear-cut contrast in this.But there is another measure to which I will draw the honourable member's attention, and that is the impact of industrial relations. The industrial relations system implemented by those opposite, called Work Choices, enabled working families struggling with cost-of-living pressures to have their penalty rates stripped away with no compensation and their overtime to be stripped away with no compensation and set up an industrial relations system which compounded the cost-of-living pressures for families and individuals struggling with mortgages, rents, petrol, groceries and the standard impacts on the average family budget.For these reasons, we have acted through the budget in the measures that we have put forward. We are acting in respect of fuel-efficient cars. We are acting in relation to a long-term energy and fuel strategy for Australia, which had not been developed by our predecessors despite the fact that petrol prices had gone up considerably. We have acted through the budget with support measures for the family budget and we have also acted in relation to the industrial relations system - all of these actions impact on the ability of an average family to deal with the challenges which go to handling cost-of-living pressures on the family budget.</DOC>

 - On 3 June 2008 a major gas line on the sea-beach interface at the Apache Energy natural gas facility in WA ruptured resulting in a significant fire and shutdown of the plant. There were 166 people employed on the island of which 152 were evacuated to Perth following the rupture; 14 engineering personnel remained to undertake an on-site assessment. Although it is a great relief that no personnel were injured and all were evacuated safely, the shutdown has had a major impact on the supply of natural gas to Western Australian consumers.The facility supplies around 30 per cent of all the natural gas in WA. The National Offshore Petroleum Safety Authority, NOPSA, is working closely with the WA government and Apache Energy to investigate the safety aspects of this instance and determine how quickly the facilities can be returned to service. However, it does appear that the facility will be out of action for some weeks and possibly some months. The government intends to work closely with the WA government to do what can be done in minimising the impact on consumers, businesses and the economy in general.The government welcomes the response of the major commercial energy users in WA to the disruption of gas supplies with major users reducing their consumption and doing all they can to use alternative fuels where possible. The government strongly encourages larger commercial users in particular to continue to do everything possible to minimise their gas consumption so as to minimise the impact on retail consumers.The government supports the announcement by the Premier of Western Australia, Alan Carpenter, of the establishment of a gas supply disruption recovery committee that will coordinate an overall response to the social and economic impacts which flow from this particular rupture. These include industry concerns over gas shortages causing possible shutdowns and business closures, the potential for job losses, and the flow-on effect to the business sector as well as to the broader community, the effect on essential services including hospitals and food supplies, insurance impacts and the overall impact on growth and the mining industry.The committee will include the direct involvement of a number of Commonwealth government agencies including Centrelink and the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations. As the Deputy Prime Minister and the Acting Prime Minister announced last week, the government also immediately made available Job Search support through Centrelink for those who may be directly affected as a result of the rupture. The government will make further assistance available if the need arises. The Minister for Resources and Energy travelled to Perth on Saturday to meet with the WA Premier to be briefed on the impact of this major disruption of WA's gas supplies. The government will remain in close contact with the government of Western Australia to examine further any other areas where the Australian government can support WA during what is a very difficult time not just for their economy but for industry across the board and for consumers.</DOC>

 - The honourable member will be familiar with the fact that, with the introduction of Fuelwatch, the option lay in the government's proposal under the legislation for rural and regional areas to opt in or out of the system. That is the first point. The second is this: in terms of practical solutions necessary for dealing with what is the greatest global oil shock that the world has seen in the last 30 years, governments across the world are dealing with a range of possible responses.Here in Australia, the various responses that we have put forward - including Fuelwatch, the Petrol Commissioner, and investment in the manufacture of green cars in Australia, as well as a global course of action to place pressure on OPEC to increase the overall oil supply - have met with four responses from those opposite - that is, they don't support it, they don't support it, they don't support it and they don't support it. What we have is 'Captain Negative' opposite, but we are trying to get on with the job of dealing with what is a challenge for the global economy. It is a challenge which has brought forward protests across all developing economies, riots in many, and unprecedented high prices across the world. We are getting on with the business of governing and doing so in a responsible manner.</DOC>

 - The government was elected on a platform of responsible economic management, delivering for working Australians and working families under financial pressure and, on top of that, investing in the future. One of those areas where working families have faced a real challenge in their family budgets is the industrial relations system called Work Choices left to them by our predecessors - an industrial relations system which empowered employers to strip away penalty rates, overtime and other basic additions to their working wage with no compensation whatsoever. That is the industrial relations system those opposite supported; that is the industrial relations system which, to this day, they remain committed to reintroducing should they be returned to office.Therefore, the government have acted on our pre-election commitment to do two things. We have acted, firstly, to abolish AWAs for the future and, secondly, to ensure that we have a fair and flexible industrial relations system for the future. A cornerstone of a fair and flexible industrial relations system of course consists of a basic safety net which applies to all workers in the federal industrial relations system. When you stand back from the industrial relations debate and look at the flow-through impact on the budgets of working families, what you get in your pay packet - in penalty rates, overtime and basic add-on conditions - is very important to your ability to cope with cost-of-living pressures from petrol, from groceries, from food, from rents and from mortgages.When it comes to the impact on mortgages, those opposite, who presided over 10 mortgage increases in a row, should bear in mind the additional burden which their period in government delivered to the families struggling with cost-of-living pressures. So, in addition to the industrial relations pressures, through the system that they presided over and implemented, which impacted working families across the board and which they were committed to continue into the future, there were 10 interest rate rises in a row - all flowing through to workers suffering financial pressure.Prior to the election we promised to get rid of AWAs for the future and through legislation we have honoured that commitment. Beyond that, we said we would also introduce a fair and flexible system, the cornerstone of which is a system of National Employment Standards. Today, the Deputy Prime Minister and I have launched these 10 National Employment Standards. This represents a basic protection for workers right across the country - fairer for workers and simpler for employers. As a simple test of how easy it is to get through this system relative to what preceded it, the equivalent of employment standards in the previous government's regime added up to 149 pages of their so-called Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. What we have launched today, covering 10 National Employment Standards, is a document of just 50 pages.If you go to the content, what we have now is important new protection under the National Employment Standards so that parents of young children have a right to request flexible working arrangements. Secondly, families have 12 months additional parental leave because each parent will have a separate entitlement to up to 12 months unpaid parental leave. Thirdly, employees will have a statutory right to redundancy pay, an award entitlement that was never protected by the previous government. On top of that, employees will have a basic right to workplace information. These standards will also apply to same-sex couples in line with the government's recent decision to remove all forms of discrimination against same-sex couples in areas such as tax, superannuation and employment conditions - and this side of the House is proud of that reform as well.The government remains committed to the implementation of its full industrial relations package. This is part of it. These National Employment Standards are core when it comes to restoring decency to the workplace and to ensure that we have fairness for all workers into the future. It is the first step in constructing this new system - important for the family pay packet and important in terms of the ability of working Australians and working families to deal with the cost-of-living pressures which they are now under.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I tell you what we will not be guaranteeing, and that is that interest rates will be kept at 'record lows'. We will not be guaranteeing that interest rates will be kept at record lows - like the party opposite did, delivering us 10 interest rate rises in a row. We are not in the business of making those sorts of irresponsible guarantees. What we can guarantee is a fair and flexible industrial relations system of which the government is proud. Those opposite stand condemned for an unfair system which stripped basic conditions away from workers. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame over the system they implemented and presided over.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. I know that he is someone deeply committed to fairness and balance in Australian workplaces. Today, as the Prime Minister has said, the government has announced its National Employment Standards - 10 standards for all Australians. Whether someone is working part-time or full-time, they will have the benefit of these 10 National Employment Standards.I particularly want to outline the process that has brought these 10 National Employment Standards to the public. When we first met as the 42nd parliament and the government introduced its transition act to end the making of Australian workplace agreements, the government also publicly announced an exposure draft of its 10 National Employment Standards. That consultative process of an exposure draft was done so that people could have their say about this basic cornerstone of the industrial relations system. One hundred and twenty-nine submissions were received and, as a result of the submissions received, these National Employment Standards have been improved.This stands in stark contrast to the way in which the Liberal Party conducted itself over Work Choices and the so-called Australian Fair Pay and Conditions Standard. Then, apart from a policy wrapped in industrial relations extremism, the Liberal Party did not seek the mandate of the Australian people and it developed its legislation in secret, without consultation, meaning it was complex and technically flawed. This government have taken a different approach. Firstly, we told the Australian people what we stood for in workplace relations; we spelt out in our policies what we were going to introduce, including these 10 National Employment Standards. Secondly, we have made sure that these have been developed in a consultative way, through an exposure draft process which we have taken seriously and responded to.These 10 National Employment Standards are one part of Labor's new safety net. This is a safety net for all Australian workers. Labor will also be introducing, through our award modernisation process being conducted by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, modern, simple awards. The National Employment Standards and the modern, simple awards, which will be for employees who earn $100,000 or less, will come into existence on 1 January 2010.I find it remarkable that those opposite, who did not believe in guaranteeing basic standards for Australian workers, are now asking the kinds of questions that they are. What we can certainly guarantee is that, unlike Work Choices, we will not have statutory individual employment agreements that allow basic conditions to be ripped away. Let us remind ourselves that all this feigned interest now in the conditions of working people -  -  - They chant out in support of Work Choices. We know that they supported Work Choices. They supported a scheme with statutory individual employment agreements that allowed protected award conditions to be ripped away from Australian workers. We know, for example, shift work loadings were excluded in 70 per cent of agreements and penalty rates were excluded in 63 per cent of agreements. That is what they believed in: the rip-off of basic conditions of Australian working families. They believed in it then, they believe in it now and, if they ever have the opportunity, Work Choices would be back. We know this because, when we gave them the opportunity to vote in this House to verify that individual statutory employment agreements would not be reintroduced under a future Liberal government, they refused to vote for that proposition. They believe in Work Choices, they believe in rip-offs and they believe in no-one having any standards, and no cant or hypocrisy from the other side can ever cover that up.</DOC>

 - For those opposite, who presided over 10 interest rate rises in a row, I find it remarkable that they can stand in this place with any skerrick of respectability and produce a lesson on responsible economic management - point 1. Point 2 is: those opposite bequeathed this government inflation at a 16-year high. I would think that those opposite should reflect firmly and squarely on the impact which 16-year high levels of inflation has on the overall trajectory of interest rates. Thirdly, if you have a global oil shock which is the worst in 30 years, impacting economies around the world, I would think that is of some moment. Fourthly, I would think the global financial crisis, which has seen revisions downwards in economic growth in all of our global economic partners, would give pause for thought as well. Instead, those opposite are interested in one thing - cheap tabloid politics, not responsible economic management.</DOC>

 - The budget that we brought down in May is a responsible budget that invests in the future and, most importantly, tackles inflation. It tackles the inflation legacy left to this government by the previous government. It tackles an inflation legacy that was produced by reckless spending and inattention to capacity constraints and an inflation legacy that is eating away at the living standards of working families and which we are determined to tackle. We understand that the price of petrol affects working families. An increase per litre from $1.30 to $1.60 has an impact of about $9 on working families. That is why we are so committed to delivering the tax cuts. -  A typical young family will be $51 per week better off as a result of the budget initiatives which will kick in from 1 July. That is about $1,000 in tax cuts. Compare that $51 to the $2.50 being offered by the Leader of the Opposition - completely uncosted. - Those opposite want to blow a $22 billion hole in the surplus, and nothing could be more guaranteed to put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. Consumer confidence was mentioned before. Eight interest rate rises in three years were delivered courtesy of those opposite - 10 in total under the previous government. They went on a reckless spending spree and put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. D-day has arrived for the opposition. - It is D-day in the Senate today because, if they delay the budget beyond 1 July, it will not be able to go through until September - and Treasury estimates that that will impact on the budget surplus by $280 million.The member for Bowman then left the chamber. - This is completely reckless and irresponsible. Those opposite were talking before about their record in government. When petrol hit $1.35 a litre in June last year, what were the three stooges opposite saying - the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth and the member for Higgins, who are scattered across the front pages of the Fairfax papers? They were saying, 'Working families have never been better off.' They did not think petrol prices were a problem. Those opposite want to blow a hole in the surplus, put upward pressure on inflation and put upward pressure on interest rates. It is completely irresponsible, and they should be condemned for such economic irresponsibility.</DOC>

 - We have no such plans. I find it pretty interesting that, on the question of binge drinking, there is an absolute divide between this side of the House and that side. We actually regard this as a major social problem for the nation. We take seriously the advice of the police commissioners of Australia, who say that we have a huge problem on the streets of our major cities on a Friday night and a Saturday night. - We take seriously the advice of those who run the hospitals in this country, who talk about the crush in their accident and emergency departments on Friday and Saturday nights as very young people come in suffering from all sorts of assaults and bashings as a result of this epidemic of intoxication. On top of that, we take seriously the advice of health professionals.I would also draw this to the attention of the Leader of the Opposition: my understanding is that the investigation being undertaken by the National Health and Medical Research Council was one which began when the former Minister for Health and Ageing was the Minister for Health and Ageing. I would have thought, therefore, that those opposite are either serious about the independent research put forward by these health advisory bodies or they are not. If the former minister for health had serious reservations about the internal methodologies of the NHMRC on these matters, he should have said so then. Obviously, he did not. What we have here is a government determined to act on what is a major social problem for the nation, as opposed to a Liberal Party which, it seems, is now very much acting in cahoots with the major distillers of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Working people across Australia are struggling with rising prices on a range of fronts. Inflation is at a 16-year high - it has reached 4.2 per cent, which is well outside the Reserve Bank target zone. It is being fuelled by a number of factors, including the mining boom and, obviously, international factors affecting the price of petrol. But it has also been affected very substantially by government spending. Government spending in the previous budget - for the financial year that is about to end - was increasing at a rate of over five per cent per annum in real terms, pushing too much money into the economy and pushing interest rates and inflation upward. That is why the government has introduced a strong and tough budget with a surplus of nearly $22 billion, with growth in government spending substantially reduced to a level of one per cent in real terms and government spending as a proportion of the total economy down to the lowest level since 1989-90. We have undertaken $7.3 billion worth of savings, over $5 billion of which are spending cuts.There are serious threats to the fiscal discipline that the government has put in place - and they emanate from the opposition. It is an unusual circumstance. The opposition have, for the time being, absolute majority control of the Senate. That has not happened very often in recent times in Australian politics. They have the ability to decide by themselves, without minor parties, whether or not the government's budget measures pass the Senate. Sadly, the opposition have not yet woken up to the fact that they lost the election. They have not quite realised that they have lost office. They still think that they are the government. They are still hunkered down somewhere in an office in an obscure part of Parliament House trying to write their own budget and rewrite the government's budget. The problem is that they have got so out of practice with savings and fiscal discipline that they have only got one approach - that is, spend more money, let loose, let the money flow, take the reins off and put up inflation and interest rates. Given that their last four budgets had no savings at all, their approach simply means simple outcomes for the Australian people: higher inflation and higher interest rates.Their position might be understandable if they were proposing to take this stance in defence of some fundamental principle - something dear to the heart of the Liberal Party or historically important - or, indeed, if there were a broken promise involved on the part of the government. Neither of those circumstances applies - unless the opposition are suggesting that they hold dear to their hearts the principle of giving teenage girls access to cheap spirits. Or perhaps a tax slug on middle-income earners, because they choose not to take out private health insurance, is a matter of fundamental principle for the Liberal Party. It is difficult to see how they can claim either of these defences on these issues or, indeed, some of the other issues that they have proposed to block - and it is not clear now whether or not they do intend to block them - such as fixing a tax loophole for big resource companies, ensuring that foreigners pay a little bit more for visas to come to Australia and deciding whether millionaires are going to get family payments. These issues are all in play, and the opposition cannot decide what their position is.If there is substantial delay in the Senate, and particularly if measures are blocked, the end result will be an erosion of the surplus - more money coming out of the public sector into the economy and putting upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. If the Liberal Party want to reconsider the position they are taking on these things then it might be worth looking at their history, because the Liberal Party were not always of this view. The Liberal Party did not always see the role of the Senate as being to remake the government's budget. In fact it is not that long ago that the architect of the current fiscal problems that Australia and the government are trying to deal with actually said:Without wit, without any intelligence, without any coherent economic strategy, the opposition sat down and said it would vote against $7.2 billion of measures over four years.But it does not just oppose $7.2 billion over four years; it opposes $19 billion over four years ... This is an opposition which is playing the role of saboteur.Having been unable to fix Australia's budget problem, you are determined to let no-one else do it._Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _This is an opposition which does not want lower interest rates. This is an opposition that does not want sustainable growth.That of course was the member for Higgins on 9 September, 1996.The Liberal opposition did not always believe in having the Senate block measures in the budget. The opposition should take note of these words because it is critical that Australia gets on top of the inflation problem. It is critical that we put downward pressure on interest rates. It is even more important that the budget gets through the Senate intact and that that strict fiscal position can take its effect on the wider economy. If the opposition cannot do the job themselves - if they cannot even contribute intelligently to public debate about how that job might be done - then they should at least have the decency to leave the job up to the people who do want to do it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The government do appreciate that we are, as the Prime Minister said, facing a global fuel shock. It is impacting here as it is impacting around the world. That is why the government are taking active steps to deal with the impact of fuel prices on Australian families, and that is why we are doing everything within our power to act globally as well as to act nationally.The challenge of rising fuel prices was at the centre of discussions with the UK Chancellor, and also with finance ministers at the recent G8 meeting in Osaka. My discussions emphasised the global nature of rising oil prices, and also the impacts they are having on families around the globe. And at the G8 finance ministers meeting I urged the G8 to take collective action to address structural supply-and-demand imbalances in the global oil market. The G8 finance ministers called on oil-producing nations to lift global supply. They also called on the IMF and the IEA to investigate what is going on on the supply side and on the demand side. The government will continue to engage internationally with all of our partners to find lasting solutions to this global problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for what is a very serious question going to the heart of the global oil crisis, which is impacting on not only Australia but also the global community. In that context I am pleased to say that, given the growing concern about the global petroleum market, the decision by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia to call together oil-producing and consuming nations and the industry in Jeddah this coming Sunday is most welcome. I am also pleased to advise the House that the Australian government has received an invitation and the Prime Minister has requested that I represent the Australian community at that very important global meeting.As we all appreciate, Saudi Arabia is seeking to play a constructive role to encourage all the stakeholders to work together in an endeavour to stabilise the world petroleum market and, in doing so, to mitigate the damage to the global community, especially to the economies of developing countries. I take note of its decision of the last couple of days to increase oil production from July by about 500,000 barrels a day as a further important step forward, building on a decision last month for an increase of about 300,000 barrels a day. I indicate to the House that this latest increase will take Saudi Arabian oil production to its highest level since 1981. But I also indicate that those who are prepared to have a serious debate about this issue - unlike the opposition - appreciate that there is no simple solution to the problem of record oil prices and that no one nation can shoulder the burden on its own.There are many factors to be addressed, and the conference in Jeddah this weekend is a constructive start to addressing what is a highly complex issue. The factors include not only issues of supply and demand but also the role of traders and speculators in the market, and problems on the demand side as well as on the supply side. The issues in this debate include global fears about energy security, one of the major issues debated by all communities throughout the world at the moment. They include a focus on such complex issues as instability in exporting nations; the threat of terrorism and infrastructure sabotage - and, just by way of example, in the Niger Delta at the moment production has been reduced by 20 per cent per day because of terrorism, which clearly impacts on global oil supplies; the unfortunate emergence of resource nationalism; a lack of investment; unprecedented global growth; a scramble for resources; a tight oil market with, as I have indicated, less supply than demand; and the fundamental desire of nations to protect their own economic future.When it comes to energy, particularly oil and increasingly gas, the world is unfortunately retreating from the open markets and free trade that we have worked so hard to achieve since the Second World War. On the supply side, for example, more producing countries are nationalising their oil industries and sending away vital foreign investment and industry capability, which is impacting on the global oil price at the moment. As a result, there is limited access to over 85 per cent of the world's oil reserves at the moment. In our own region, 55 per cent of Asian consumption is in markets with some form of subsidy.I hope the conference in Jeddah this weekend enables the global community to start focusing on some of these very serious challenges. We also appreciate that this is important not only to the global community but also to Australia in the fight against inflation - something that unfortunately does not occupy the minds of the opposition, as reflected by their lack of attention to serious budgetary considerations in the Senate at the moment and their desire to destroy the Australian government's endeavour to do the best by the Australian community in the fight against inflation. Unlike the opposition, the Australian government, like the global community, appreciates that the inflation risk is not just of concern here at home but was the main concern for the world's economy discussed by G8 finance ministers in the last couple of days.I say in conclusion: an international effort is going to be required if the market for oil and petroleum products is to accurately reflect demand and supply issues, and the Australian government intends to play a constructive role in this process. We welcome the invitation to attend this very important Jeddah conference. I simply say to the opposition: it is about time you understood that it is a serious debate confronting not only Australia but also the global community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his interest in having state-of-the-art technology in our schools. The government's National Secondary School Computer Fund is about benefiting every secondary school in the country, whatever state they are in, whatever territory they are in, whatever school sector they are in. If I could put that in the words of Mr Bill Daniels, Executive Director of the Independent Schools Council of Australia, the government's plan:... recognises that all schools, government and non-government need support to access state of the art computer technology ...This is a fund that will benefit all schools. This is a fund dedicated to realising the government's vision of a digital education revolution so that secondary students in years 9 to 12 can have access to computers when they need them to learn with - something that they do not have now.I was delighted on 12 June to announce the successful schools in the first round. This is the first step in the digital education revolution. This is the first step in the government's $1.2 billion program. This is the first step in benefiting secondary schools right around the country. This was a round for schools that had a ratio of computers to students of one to eight or worse. They were the schools that were invited to apply; they were the schools that did apply; they were the schools that benefited from this round. There were 896 of them around the country. In benefiting these schools, we said in this first round we wanted to get these schools to achieve an effective ratio of one to two for computers to students. These schools will be able to apply in forthcoming rounds as well but, for schools that had a ratio of computers to students of one to eight or worse, in this first round we wanted to bring them to a ratio of one to two.This has occasioned an expenditure of $116 million of government funds, accessing 116,000 computers for these 896 schools around the country. Seventy-two per cent of the funding in round 1 is going to government schools, nine per cent to independent schools and 19 per cent to Catholic schools. The way this has worked is the government has budgeted a $1,000-per-unit cost for the technology. Of course, many schools in bulk purchasing arrangements will access the technology they want for a lesser cost than that, meaning the balance of the $1,000 can be used for deployment costs. In addition, the government has allocated $11.25 million for professional development for teachers, with that money going through states and territories. We have allocated $650,000 direct for professional development, we have allocated $32.6 million for curriculum that will work with the online technology and we have dedicated $10 million to support mechanisms for this rollout of computers in schools.I want to take this opportunity to thank everybody in the states and territories and the Catholic and independent school sectors who have worked so hard with the government to achieve this result so quickly. This is something that, of course, we have seen the opposition criticise, whinge, carp and moan about. When they were in government, not only did they not do anything to bring computers to students in schools but they apparently did not know that there was a problem. The then Minister for Education, Science and Training, the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on 15 November 2007 said:Now I visit schools across Australia, I'm yet to see a school that is not well served with computers.That was the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the then education minister. -  - Any member of parliament who has visited schools in their own electorate. The national audit shows more than 800 schools that had ratios of worse than one to eight. This is a remarkable statement, a breathtaking statement from a former government that was completely out of touch - an opposition that is completely out of touch. The one thing I can say to this opposition is: if you are not even smart enough to realise there was a problem, then there is no way you are ever going to be a contributor to the solution. The government has the answer, working through our National Secondary Schools Computer Fund, and I am delighted that more than 800 schools are beneficiaries in round 1.</DOC>

 - I understand the matter at issue goes to the preparation of statutory declarations. That is the matter that is subject to a police investigation. It is quite improper to comment further. I would also draw the attention of the House to a statement by the leader of the Liberal Party in New South Wales, Mr O'Farrell, who was asked on ABC Radio on 12 June about the handling of this matter. He said:I think Kevin Rudd's done the right thing in two respects. He has made it clear he wants to lift standards. He has also made it clear that if his MPs don't behave they don't have a future.That is what the Liberal Party says in New South Wales. I wonder what Liberal Party it is in New South Wales these days, but that is the view of one Liberal leader. Obviously there is a different view in this place.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The Australian government condemns absolutely the campaign of intimidation, violence and fear by the brutal Mugabe regime against the people of Zimbabwe. We condemn it absolutely. Following the first round of the presidential and parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe we saw the Mugabe regime seek to rort that election by rorting the count. Now, in the second round of presidential elections - the presidential run-off - we see the Mugabe regime seeking to rort that election by violence and intimidation. Yesterday we saw that culminate in reports of Mr Mugabe saying that, even if he were not successful through intimidation, fear and violence in rorting that election, he would, in any event, proceed to ignore the will of the Zimbabwe people and use violence to ignore it if he so decided.For some time the Australian government has been very concerned about the prospects of a full and free election in Zimbabwe and very concerned about the actions of the regime. There is an array of evidence to show that this is a campaign of violence. The leader of the opposition, the leader of the MDC, Mr Tsvangirai, has been arrested now some five times. The Secretary-General of the opposition party, Mr Tendai Biti, has been under detention for about 72 hours. There is clearly a campaign of state sponsored violence in rural and regional areas and, outrageously, there has been a suspension of humanitarian assistance through non-government organisations, including a suspension of food aid through the World Food Program.Having said that, there are some initiatives which the government has welcomed. Election observers, which were provided by the South African Development Community states, have in recent times been increased from the number at the first ballot to 130, with undertakings by the South African Development Community states that that will be increased to 400. Today the UN Assistant Secretary for Political Affairs, Haile Menkerios, is due to arrive in Zimbabwe. This follows a conversation between Ban Ki-Moon, the UN Secretary-General, and Mr Mugabe at the Food and Agriculture Organisation High Level Conference on Food Security in Rome, which I attended a couple of weeks ago. In discussions between the Secretary-General and Mr Mugabe it was agreed that the UN Assistant Secretary would attend. I hope he is given full and free access to put his view about the campaign of intimidation and violence and have full access so far as election observers are concerned.By way of aside I make the point that it was, frankly, an obscenity that Mr Mugabe attended the food conference in Rome. Here is a person who, when he became leader of his country, inherited one of the world's premier agricultural countries. He has now seen that devastated and now deliberately uses food and food aid as a political weapon against his own people.The Australian government continues with its diplomatic efforts. We have raised these issues with the South African Development Community nation states, with African Union states, with the United Kingdom - as I did with Foreign Secretary Miliband when I was in the United Kingdom recently - and with the new Commonwealth Secretary-General. We have indicated that we are happy to make election observers available if so invited, but we are not expecting such an invitation. At the Rome food conference I announced an additional $8 million worth of humanitarian assistance so far as food is concerned, and I indicated yesterday that the government stands ready to give further consideration to adding to the sanctions that it currently has in place so far as travel and financial matters are concerned.Finally, as the Prime Minister and I said yesterday, the primary responsibility as far as the international community is concerned in efforts to seek to ensure a full, free and fair election in Zimbabwe rests in the first instance on Zimbabwe's neighbours, the South African Development Community states and the African Union. We again urge those nation states to leave no stone unturned to stop the campaign of violence, intimidation and fear and to allow a full, free and fair expression of the will of the people of Zimbabwe.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question. Last week a report was published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health and it showed that the number of young women hospitalised after binge drinking has more than doubled in less than a decade. Between 1998 and 2006 the number of young women aged between 18 and 24 hospitalised for alcohol abuse rose from six per 10,000 people to more than 14.6 per 10,000 people - more than doubling the numbers of people who are hospitalised. One of the report's authors, Michael Livingston, said that three separate studies cited in the research indicated a clear increasing trend in alcohol related harm amongst young people and that these trends are deeply concerning. The emergency room data showed that between 2000 and 2006 there were rapid increases in alcohol presentation rates in people aged between 16 and 24. Their symptoms when they presented at emergency departments included alcohol dependence, mental and behavioural disorder due to alcohol, alcohol poisoning, alcoholic gastritis and alcoholic liver cirrhosis. These figures were based on Victorian figures, but Victoria is not alone. In New South Wales, for example, alcohol related assaults have doubled to more than 20,000 in the last decade. Ask parents of teenagers and young adults what they fear most on a Friday and Saturday night and they will tell you that it is whether their young kids are going to come home safe.Michael Moore, head of the Public Health Association, which publishes the Journal of Public Health, said:Blind Freddy can see there is harmful use amongst teenagers, particularly amongst young women, and it really requires government to take decisive action.While it might be that blind Freddy can see that, it seems that blind Tony cannot. On the weekend, the member for Warringah said that there was not really a problem. And then this morning the Leader of the Opposition had his own scientific advice for the community. And with the evidence based precision that we have come to expect from the Leader of the Opposition, he defined binge drinking as 'really getting stuck into it in a big way'. Thank you very much for that scientific evidence coming from the Leader of the Opposition. In contrast to the Leader of the Opposition's scientific approach, the government is going to await the final report from the National Health and Medical Research Council, when medical experts will announce their new guidelines for alcohol and the level of consumption that puts people at risk. This is a regular occurrence and, as the Prime Minister has already mentioned, the result of a review process that was commenced under the Liberal government.I would like to remind the House that these are guidelines drawn up by medical experts in an independent process with no input from government, as they should be. They aim to provide the community with information about what constitutes a safe level of drinking. They are not laws, they are not rules and they are not government mandated standards of behaviour; they are medical guidelines for how to stay out of harm's way. This side of the House believes that while drinking safely is ultimately the responsibility of individuals, it is important that everybody in the community is well-informed about the health risks and has access to the best medical advice. This medical advice is based on up-to-date scientific evidence. For example, I understand that the new guidelines will have recommendations for children, adolescents, and pregnant and breastfeeding women. This will not be based on the flippant comments of an irresponsible leader who simply says that alcohol is only harmful if you are really getting stuck into it in a big way. Our young people are turning up in hospitals as a result of alcohol abuse, they are hurting each other under the influence of alcohol, they are driving home drunk and they are causing themselves long-term harm. We are determined to side with parents and police commissioners to do something to help tackle this problem. We will not just side with the spirits industry to paper over this problem, which is costing the community $15 billion every year. We see from the weekend that the industry are now channelling their money into running ads for the Liberal Party in Gippsland. Once again, in this debate, you have health experts lining up with the Rudd government to help parents and police. On the other side, you have the distillers and the Liberal Party. You choose! - </DOC>

 - The government, through the budget, has introduced a package of $55 billion in support of families under financial pressure. The government, through the budget, has introduced extra measures to support the financial wellbeing of pensioners and carers. The key question here is: what do you do to practically assist the bottom line for family budgets dealing with the rising cost of petrol, rising interest rates, increases in rents and the rising cost of food? Those opposite managed to deliver us 10 consecutive interest rate rises during the period in which they occupied the treasury bench. The package that we have offered in relation to a typical young family will deliver, through the budget, some $52.50 extra a week. That proposed by those opposite provides $2.50 extra per week. The maths speaks for itself.</DOC>

 - The government was elected on a platform of responsible economic management. The government was elected on a platform of delivering assistance to working Australians under financial pressure. The government was elected on a platform of investing in this country's long-term future. It is on those platforms that the government intends to govern.When it comes to responsible economic management, a core discipline for any government around the world is how to conduct effectively the fight against inflation. Following recent comments by the G8, the IMF, the OECD and the Reserve Bank, and data released by the ABS, all members of this place should be able to reliably conclude that inflation is not a charade and not a fairytale; it is a real economic problem across the global economy, including here in Australia.In fact, when this government was elected we were bequeathed by those departing the treasury bench an inflation rate which stood at a 16-year high. We know the consequences which flow from not acting on inflation. If you have upward pressure on inflation it produces upward pressure on interest rates, which in turn affects all working Australians and businesses, which in time has an effect on the real level of economic activity and a real impact, therefore, on employment. That is the overall consequence of having sat idly by for 12 long years in office while these inflationary pressures built bit by bit by bit. Despite successive warnings by the Reserve Bank of Australia about infrastructure constraints, bottlenecks, the skills shortage and the rest, those opposite failed to act and, as a consequence, the inflation rate was running at record highs when this government assumed office.In addition to that, it is important to reflect on what the G8 finance ministers had to say on 14 June about the serious nature of the inflation threat facing the world. I quote them in their concluding statement:Elevated commodity prices, especially of oil and food, pose a serious challenge to stable growth worldwide, have serious implications for the most vulnerable and may increase global inflationary pressure.That was at the most recent G8 finance ministers meeting, in Osaka. Here at home, Australia is facing its own inflationary challenge, as noted by the Governor of the Reserve Bank last week:_ Australia's inflation rate has risen more than most of those in our usual peer group when measured on a comparable basis._Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  __ the prospect of inflation has presented a larger and more immediate danger to us than it has, thus far, to the US.So said the RBA governor on 13 June.The evidence in relation to the inflation challenge is overwhelming. There is one party in politics which actually appreciates the gravity of the challenge, and it currently sits on the government benches. Then there are those opposite, who regard it as either a charade or a fairytale. The key question is: what we do about it? The government, earlier this year, indicated what its plan of attack was on inflation. A core element of that plan of attack on inflation goes to responsible economic management by delivering a substantial government surplus through the budget. What this government has done - and it is proud of this - is to deliver a $22 billion surplus through the budget. As a consequence of that, we may well ask what the alternative approach is. It is to conduct a $22 billion raid on the surplus, which is the cumulative impact of the measures which those opposite currently stand opposed to.But it is not just about the aggregate dimensions of that problem over the spread of the forward estimates; it is a here-and-now problem as well. If you go to the precise impact of the delaying tactics which the opposition are embarked upon in the Senate - and we are now at D-day when it comes to the Senate - and if you put together these measures which are being blocked by those in the Senate and calculate, as Treasury has done, the cost of this delay out to September, which is the first deliberative occasion on which the Senate can then re-examine these measures, you will see that the government stands to have a further $300 million raid conducted on the surplus. The precise figure calculated by the Treasury is $284 million. What happens is that that $284 million will come straight off the surplus because those opposite cannot make up their mind whether they are prepared to allow the government to embark upon a responsible course of action and deliver the substantial surplus which we judge to be necessary in the overall fight against inflation.So the Liberal Party stands opposed to these measures in the Senate. It is not just blocking or conducting a $22 billion raid on the surplus; in addition to that, the immediate consequence of it so doing is $300 million which will be lost to the surplus, directly off the top, by September. I would appeal to those opposite to come to their senses on this question, because this is a serious business - how you fight the fight against inflation. If you fail to fight the fight against inflation by engineering an appropriate budget surplus through the government sector, you are dealing with potentially huge upward pressure on overall inflation and, as a consequence, upward pressure on interest rates - and we know where that logic goes.This government, elected on a platform of responsible economic management, has done the only responsible thing given the global and national economic circumstances that we assumed, having taken office - that is, to deliver a sizeable surplus. Those opposite have embarked upon an irresponsible course of action: a $22 billion raid on the surplus and $300 million on the trot, on the way through, until September. Those opposite, the Liberal Party, need to understand this: when you are dealing with responsible economic management it is not simply a game of party politics being played; there are real consequences for working Australians. If irresponsible measures continue to be adopted by those opposite, the consequences for inflation, the consequences for interest rates, the consequences for growth and the consequences for jobs are serious indeed.I would appeal to those opposite, on this D-day in the Senate, to come to their senses and for once adopt a responsible course of action when it comes to preserving this nation's long-term economic interests and those of working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, because the truth is that in this budget we cut taxes as a share of the economy. We cut taxes and we reined in the reckless spending of those opposite. It was their reckless spending that put upward pressure on inflation and that produced eight interest rate rises in the last three years. And now they want to do it again. They want to raid the surplus. This afternoon in the Senate they are going to start that process of raiding the surplus. They are going to move against our initiatives that are so important to build a strong surplus, to combat inflation and to put downward pressure on interest rates.I think it is pretty clear, going by the remarks of the member for Wentworth, that he must be the author of this strategy. He is the author of the strategy for the $284 million raid on the surplus that will take place if they delay all of these measures in the Senate at four o'clock this afternoon. We have had some advice on where the member for Wentworth is getting his advice. - We have built a strong surplus in this budget. The Rudd government has built a $22 billion surplus to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. This opposition irresponsibly and recklessly wants to raid that surplus in the Senate this afternoon at 4 pm. Of course, the member for Wentworth is the author of the strategy. - We do have some advice as to where the member for Wentworth gets his positions from, and I think those opposite will be very interested. Last Wednesday, 11 July, at 140 Coppins Street, Richmond, there was a focus group. -  - I am explaining where the member for Wentworth gets his advice to raid the surplus in the Senate at 4 pm this afternoon. - This focus group was conducted by Millward Brown, who work with Crosby Textor. Either he is paying for research on himself or the Liberal Party is doing it, but either way the Leader of the Opposition does not know about it. These were the questions that were asked of the focus group. - I am referring to the member for Wentworth's budget-in-reply speech that he gave in this House. He managed to get a focus group organised to ask them what they thought of it. Do you know what the next question was? It was: what did they think of his website? The next question was: what did they think of his resume? - Certainly. My point is this: the member for Wentworth thinks his resume and his website are more important than the fight against inflation</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, because the government is building a strong surplus of $22 billion to fight inflation and to put downward pressure on interest rates. We had the Reserve Bank minutes released earlier today and they put the position that the fight against inflation remains a very key challenge for this nation - a very important challenge. I will just quote the minutes. They said:... over the past year, inflation had picked up to an uncomfortably high rate, against a background of limited spare capacity and earlier strong growth in demand.As we know, there have been 20 Reserve Bank warnings over a long period of time about bottlenecks in the economy - about capacity constraints - which were ignored by those opposite. That put upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates. Of course, it fell to us from day one to take up this fight against inflation - an inflation legacy left to us by those opposite, who sat around the cabinet table and spent like drunken sailors. It has taken us to rein in that reckless spending and to do something about putting some capacity into the economy, which is why their actions in the Senate are so absolutely reckless - because in this country we do need to tackle inflation to put downward pressure on interest rates, because it is inflation that eats away at the living standards of families and strangles growth. They are completely irresponsible.</DOC>

They do not have a clue what life is like around the kitchen table. They have not got the faintest idea. And it is because they are so out of touch that they brought in Work Choices. Only somebody terminally out of touch could bring in Work Choices to rip away at the wages and working conditions of Australian working families. They have learnt nothing at all. They have demonstrated they are completely out of touch with the lives of average Australians.

 - Inflation in Australia is currently at a 16-year high, at a rate of 4.2 per cent. What that means is that ordinary Australians throughout the country are experiencing rising prices in supermarkets. It appears I have to remind the opposition about or perhaps introduce them to the concept of what a special is because clearly they appear to have no idea. Ordinary Australian working people do know what specials are - there are little labels on the shelves underneath the product with the word 'special' and a price on it - and they have to look for specials because prices are rising. So perhaps you might want to do a little bit of a trip to the supermarkets of Australia yourselves to find out how most Australian working people actually live.It is crucial that we have a tough fiscal position, a strong budget, to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. That is why the government has delivered a $22 billion surplus and that is why we brought spending down from a growth rate of five per cent in the last budget, delivered by the member for Higgins, to a rate of one per cent, and that is why it is crucial that the government's budget legislation is passed in the Senate. Some of the items that the opposition is proposing to block would blow a giant hole in the surplus, and even delaying the key initiatives in the budget - things like the condensate excise initiative, the luxury car tax, the means test for family payments - will blow a significant hole in the surplus; in fact, Treasury calculates about $284 million simply from that delay. The opposition has taken an ultra-populist line in response to the budget. They have thrown responsibility out the window. They are feeling everybody's pain: the teenagers who are losing their access to cheap alcopops, the foreigners who are paying more for their visas, the big resource companies who are losing their tax breaks, the millionaires who are losing their family payments - the opposition is feeling their pain.Yesterday I urged the opposition to heed the wise words of the member for Higgins - admittedly, they were from 12 years ago - and, sadly, it appears that I spoke too soon, because it appears that the honourable member for Higgins has joined the irresponsible populist bandwagon too, which is a source of great distress to me. In today's Financial Review there is an interview with the member for Higgins where it states that he 'warned against an excessive short-term response' to inflation and pointed out that when the CPI had gone negative he did not pump up the economy. Therefore, by implication, if the CPI - the consumer price index - the rate of inflation, goes above the Reserve Bank's target zone, then there is no reason for tightening the budget, there is no reason for strengthening the surplus. Perhaps, as he is the architect of the wasteful, profligate, growing-too-fast budget that this government inherited - the 2007 budget - with five per cent real growth in the middle of a mining boom, perhaps I expected too much from the member for Higgins.Although I certainly do not welcome his recent conversion to the cause of fiscal incontinence, I do note that there is something else happening with the member for Higgins. He has been working hard on his application to join the book club. After all these years of pouring scorn and vitriol on people who write, he has decided, belatedly, he wants to join the book club. As a member of the book club, including, I am sure, various other members - the Treasurer and so on - we welcome the interest of the member for Higgins, but there is one word of caution: we write about issues. It is a pretty safe bet that the member for Higgins's book is going to be about 'me, me, me' and that will be the end of it. It certainly will not have any serious savings initiatives. - The opposition's response to the budget has been all over the place. Their position changes virtually on a daily basis. They are sniping at most of the major initiatives but relentlessly avoiding taking responsibility for the wider picture and relentlessly avoiding taking any clear position on the inflation problem and what the fiscal settings in this nation should be. This is the core question they have to answer - indeed, it is the core question the member for Higgins should be asked to answer: what fiscal settings would be appropriate for dealing with the inflation problem?The government will not be diverted from our task of putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. We intend to do everything necessary and everything possible to preserve the integrity of the surplus and to ensure we have a strict, responsible budget position. Unlike the opposition, who appear not to know what specials in supermarkets are, we understand the pressures that ordinary families in this country are under, we understand the rising prices that they are having to pay and we understand the importance of getting inflation under control. The opposition are putting this at risk - they are putting the government's efforts to put downward pressure on inflation and get the inflation problem under control at risk by their actions in the Senate. They should think again. They should act responsibly in the interests of working people in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Warringah for his question. Obviously the government are a substantial player in the childcare market, and we have a range of policy levers at our disposal because we are a substantial player in the childcare market. On the supply side, the levers at the government's disposal include our election commitment to introduce up to 260 new childcare centres. That is a significant contribution to the childcare industry and the childcare market as we know it. In terms of the locations of those centres, we are looking at establishing new centres in areas where the market is not working. One of the reasons that the market may be perceived to be not working in an area is that there are higher fees than in other locations. When we are working out who should be the providers for those new centres we are obviously going to be assessing diversity of provision and equity of access, including through new private and/or community partners. Significantly, when we are selecting the providers for these new centres, a track record of affordability will be taken into account. So it is a significant policy stream, a significant policy measure, which will make a difference for childcare centres.On the demand side of course we have introduced, through the recent budget, an increase in the childcare tax rebate, which - as I presume the member opposite appreciates - is not income tested. So that is a significant measure on the demand side to assist working families. We are of course reviewing the regulation in the sector to ensure national consistency in quality standards and licensing. Finally, as part of this suite of policy measures, we are looking at the transparency and indeed acting on the transparency of the sector. This is actually implementing a pre-election commitment. I know that it is not fashionable amongst the Liberal Party members to implement pre-election commitments; it is fashionable to make them, to describe them as rock solid, rolled gold and all that sort of thing and then to back down on them later. The member for Warringah would probably remember all about that from the last parliament. I know it is not fashionable with the member for Warringah to make an election commitment and then actually implement it, but the government committed before the election to a major transparency measure to make sure that parents had access to information about fees, availability of places and quality standards.I think the thing that members opposite should be reflecting on, as they show throughout this question time just how out of touch they are, is what a track record of failure it is that, after 12 years in government, they left a situation where parents looking for child care could not get ready information on fees, availability or quality. That is the situation they left after 12 years of inaction; and, as part of a suite of measures dealing with affordability, accessibility and quality, we are acting on it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question because this is a government that does deliver for working families and those finding it tough to make ends meet around the kitchen table. We do understand that, at the end of the week, a lot of people have trouble paying the bills. We absolutely understand why they need to shop for specials. We on this side of the House are absolutely in touch with the fact that people are under tremendous cost-of-living pressure at the moment and that is the reason we are putting so much effort into tackling inflation. That is also why we put so much effort in the budget into delivering the tax cuts from 1 July this year - because prices are going up at the supermarket and at the petrol bowser and inflation is high, as the Reserve Bank has indicated again today. On top of that we have this oil shock going on. So many people do have to shop for specials and that is why they need the tax cuts that we are delivering in this budget.In two weeks time, a young couple earning $87,000 a year will have an extra $20 in their pay cheque each week from tax cuts alone. That will help them. That will help them with the rising cost of living. That will help them with rising petrol prices. But it is not just tax cuts. There is a range of measures we are bringing in that were never contemplated by those opposite while they were in government. A typical young family with two young children will be $51 to $54 per week better off as a result of our initiatives, which will kick in in a fortnight. Let us just take child care. From 1 July this year, this young family will receive a 50 per cent rebate for their children's child care, saving them $24 a week. That recognises cost-of-living pressures. The family will also be eligible for a $375 education tax refund - something the Liberals never delivered. And the Liberals never delivered on child care either. They made people wait. They make them wait initially for 18 months to get some relief for their out-of-pocket childcare costs. We are delivering in all of those areas.Meanwhile, the shadow Treasurer is sitting around organising focus groups asking questions like: do they think he was an old Liberal or a new Liberal? I think we got the answer today from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: he is an out-of-touch Liberal. The pretender from Point Piper is an out-of-touch Liberal, and he is an out-of-touch Liberal because he does not understand that we need to fight inflation and we need to do it for all of those people out there that are being hit by the high cost of living. We have to do it; otherwise, they will face permanently higher interest rates. This team opposite left this country with eight interest rate rises in three years - 10 in total attributable to them. That is their legacy to the Australian people and they still do not get it - they still do not understand that we have to fight inflation to put downward pressure on interest rates. This government will do it, and they will continue to behave recklessly. For doing that they will be condemned by the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to get a question from the shadow minister - absolutely delighted - and I certainly will be answering it. Can I say when it comes to the reaction of the Catholic and independent schools sector to the government's recent announcement of computers in schools, rather than rely on the shadow minister I would prefer to rely on Bill Daniels, the Executive Director of the Independent Schools Council of Australia, and Monsignor Tom Doyle of the National Catholic Education Commission, who have both welcomed this new investment. This new investment was made into schools that applied and were invited to apply because they had a student-to-computer ratio of one to eight or worse - the legacy of the Liberal Party to Australian students in those schools. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Can I answer the honourable member's question this way. Before the election of the Rudd Labor government, independent and Catholic schools were funding the introduction of computers wholly and solely through fees and fundraising. What are they doing now? They have a government that has a National Secondary School Computer Fund of $1.2 billion that is working with them. There was no dedicated fund for computers in schools prior to this government. Prior to this government, schools were left to their own devices. There was no dedicated focus, no care or concern from members opposite about computers in schools - absolutely nothing of substance happening. Here is a government that has come along and is prepared to work in partnership with schools with a $1.2 billion investment. What I can certainly say to members opposite is we understand that schools want assistance from government to get computers into schools. We are providing it and there is no-one on this side of the parliament that is so out of touch that they would utter a statement like that uttered by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She said:_ I'm yet to see a school that is not well served with computers.There is no-one over here that out of touch. We understand schools want assistance, and we are providing it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question; he has been a long-time advocate for the removal of discrimination. Three weeks ago I introduced the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws - Superannuation) Bill. That bill will do nothing more and nothing less than remove discrimination against a group of Australians who for far too long have suffered an injustice and, moreover, will remove discrimination suffered by children brought up in those households. Many members will be disappointed to learn that today the opposition has used its numbers in the Senate to delay passage of this legislation by referring it to a committee without any end date and specifically with a provision that it will not report until subsequent legislation is introduced and considered. - The legislation will not undermine marriage. Both sides of this House have supported legislation that confirms marriage is between a man and a woman; it is the position of both parties. Indeed, so much was acknowledged by the shadow Attorney-General when he was asked about it in a radio interview on 5 June. The question was:Could you answer me and our listeners really, really simply, how a change in a piece of legislation regarding superannuation will in any way question or challenge or chip away at the institution of marriage?And the reply from the shadow Attorney-General was an honest:I don't think it will.One of the main reasons the opposition has referred the legislation to a committee is because of its proposal to have coverage of people in close personal relationships - the example given was of two elderly sisters living together and caring for each other. But we have made it perfectly clear our purpose is to remove discrimination as a matter of principle, and in that process there will most certainly be winners and losers. For instance, two elderly sisters on the age pension would each currently receive $546.80 per fortnight. If, as the opposition proposes, they are recognised as a couple under Commonwealth laws then each would receive $456.80 per fortnight. In other words, they would be $180 worse off per fortnight. Indeed, they would also lose $500 per year in a utilities allowance. We would certainly ask the opposition to have regard to that. They made great play earlier in the year at the prospect of carers suffering a reduction in benefits; this is most clearly something that would reduce the benefits to carers by about $180 per fortnight.There is no question that this delay will cause hardship. It is inappropriate in these matters to be overly dramatic or emotional, but it is unquestionably the case that there is a prospect of superannuants dying before this legislation is passed and their partners or their children being deprived of the benefits of the legislation. Perhaps to avoid embarrassment, perhaps indicating some goodwill on the part of members opposite, it has been proposed that it can be backdated - indeed, I heard an interjection to that effect during my presentation. But the trouble with that is that we are talking about reversionary benefits, benefits that are paid fortnightly or monthly - in other words, sustaining the family - that are a regular income for the family. The delay would effectively deprive or create a hiatus in the income of that family unless and until that legislation is passed. It would also introduce very complex issues with respect to recovery. The law, as I understand it, is that trustees are required to make payments; they have a duty to make payments under the law as it currently stands, and in circumstances where that law was subsequently changed there are very complicated issues regarding recovery.In short: this law will do nothing more and nothing less than remove discrimination against a group of Australians and their children who have suffered an injustice for far too long. Indeed, I think that was recognised, in fairness to him, by the member for Sturt in his contribution in the debate. I would again implore those opposite to support the expeditious passage of this legislation.</DOC>

 - When you are dealing with enterprise bargaining, it follows that these things come in seasons and in sequence. Obviously there will be tips up and tips down in the level of industrial activity. That is the first point. The second point is this: those opposite, having had 12 years to act on the undersupply of skilled labour in this market, should have thought clearly what the consequences were for the economy overall. After all, they received 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank of Australia about infrastructure bottlenecks and skill shortages. They failed to act systematically, and as a result we have these factors at work in the economy today. As a result of that, it does alter the overall bargaining equation. We believe, through the industrial relations system that the government is introducing based on the dual principles of fairness and flexibility, that we will have at its core productivity based wage increases - best for the economy, best for workers, best for global competitiveness. If those opposite, after 12 years, could not act more effectively on providing enough skills for the economy given its long-term needs, then they should hang their heads in shame.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for her question and I also thank her for participating in the launch of the first round of the government's digital education revolution, which happened on 12 June. Through that first round, 896 schools will receive 116,000 computers, including 1,600 for 13 schools in the member for Canberra's own electorate. This is a $116 million investment, the first instalment of our $1.2 billion commitment to bring secondary schools into the 21st century.I thank the member for Lowe for handing to me during the course of question time a letter from one of his principals, Maxine Kohler of the McDonald College. This letter says:I would like to thank you and the federal government for including the McDonald College in the first round of the national secondary school computer rollout. The 86 additional computers will make a very valuable contribution to the learning of our students and the staff is excited about the prospect of this additional education investment.Of course, those words of praise join words of praise from teachers and principals around the country.I was also assisted in the launch of the first round of the digital education revolution by the member for Maribyrnong. I would like to thank him for his participation. At the school we visited, the principal, David Adamson, welcomed the 529 computers his school will receive, saying:We have been held back by a lack of facilities, and this is going to accelerate our progress.This commentary joins the commentary of the Ulverstone High School principal, who said of their 113 new computers:I reckon it's one of those things where any big investment does make a difference.The principal of the Corio Bay Senior College said:Most of our current computers are very old, which makes it difficult for any students who are trying to do online research. It's not really assisted learning if the students are sitting there twiddling their thumbs.She went on to say how pleased she was that Corio Bay Senior College would get 170 new computers through round 1. The principal of San Clemente High School in New South Wales, Tony Kelly, said of the 117 new computers his school will receive:There's no way in the world we could have afforded to pay for them.Bruce Armstrong, the principal of Balwyn High School, described the 533 new computers his school will receive as an exciting opportunity. We also received positive comments from teachers. Victor Davidson, for example, from Birrong Girls High School, said:We've got 210 computers. Now I feel assured my work to get students to engage in ICT is worthwhile.Of course, these words of praise from principals and students echo the words of praise from the leaders of the Independent Schools of Australia and the National Catholic Education Commission, Mr Bill Daniels and Monsignor Tom Doyle respectively, both of whom welcomed this new investment.When we line it up, what do we see? We see the leaders in education welcoming this investment. We see principals welcoming this investment. We see teachers welcoming this investment. We certainly saw some very excited students on launch day welcoming this investment. The only people who are whingeing and carping about this sit over there: the members of the Liberal Party. Amazingly, we have had people like the member for Wannon complaining even though six schools in his electorate will get 280 computers in this first round. The member for Paterson has been complaining, saying that his schools have been 'short-changed' despite the fact that 10 schools in his electorate will receive a total of 1,392 computers. One can only imagine what he thought of the performance of his own government on the basis of that. The member for La Trobe has also complained -  - despite receiving 269 computers for schools in his electorate. This whingeing, carping and moaning is from an out-of-touch opposition that sailed through 12 years of government -  - with education ministers who used to say things like:... I'm yet to see a school that is not well served with computers.Those opposite might be living in a bubble, be out of touch and be unable to join in the spirit of enthusiasm for the digital education revolution, but people who lead schools and who teach in schools understand this is a worthwhile investment. I thank them for working with the government to change our classrooms into 21st century classrooms.</DOC>

 - If you were out there in the business community and had copped 10 successive interest rate rises in a row courtesy of the fiscal indiscipline of those opposite, it would have an effect on your confidence as well. It does not just affect people on mortgages, important as that -  - Thanks very much, Mr Speaker. Firstly, there is an impact on confidence after 10 interest rate rises in a row; and, secondly, when this government assumed office, inflation was running at a 16-year high, and that has an effect on confidence as well. The flow-through effect of that in terms of activity and unemployment, unless you actually turn things around, is there for all to see. That is why this government is committed to undertaking a policy based on fiscal discipline, fiscal rectitude and a $22 billion surplus, in contrast to those opposite, who are in the process of conducting a $22 billion raid.Beyond that, the government can also embark upon a serious program of business deregulation. I draw the attention of honourable members to the work currently underway by the minister for small business through the Council of Australian Governments looking at key critical questions of the compatibility of business regulation right across Australia. For 12 years in office, those opposite had ample opportunity through the Council of Australian Governments to do something cooperative with the states on the business deregulation agenda. If you are a small business trying to become a medium-sized business and operating in one, two or three states, one of the huge barriers to entry is practical questions like the conflicting arrangements for the registration of business names and other conflicting business regulatory arrangements. This government has actually taken this challenge seriously. Currently - before the relevant working group of COAG - we are examining 27 separate items of legislation and regulation which impact right across the business community. That is a practical course of action which we have embarked upon in our first six months in office. After 12 years in office, they had done zip.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for her question and indicate that last week I attended the regular national meeting of police ministers and police commissioners. There was there unanimous agreement that alcohol related violence and binge drinking is the single biggest drain on police resources across the country, particularly on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. One police minister spoke of a recent visit to Los Angeles, where law enforcement authorities apparently expressed amazement that so many Australian venues have 5 am liquor licences. That is something that we are hearing more concern about from our local communities. - In March, the day after the Prime Minister announced a new national strategy to address the binge drinking epidemic, the police commissioner in New South Wales, Andrew Scipione, said that any move to tackle alcohol abuse was a 'wise investment'. He described that abuse as an enormous national problem and he said that 70 per cent of every police engagement with a member of the community in the streets of New South Wales has alcohol as a factor. That is an astounding statistic.Recent research shows that the New South Wales Police Force spends the equivalent of the salaries of 1,000 full-time constables just to deal with alcohol related issues. Two weeks ago, Commissioner Scipione said drinking habits have changed. There had been what he called a normalisation of binge drinking, with many young Australians now going out determined to get drunk whatever the consequences, and that involved both men and women. The commissioner pointed out that he was not himself a wowser. He said it was, however, time to listen to the community and to work to change the drinking culture. Those comments were echoed by commissioners and commanders across the country. Young people who binge drink think they are bulletproof. Young men get into fights and young women are left vulnerable to sexual predators.The link between alcohol use and road trauma is also well known. There is a wealth of evidence to show that a substantial proportion of assaults are alcohol related. A trends and issues paper by the Australian Institute of Criminology is to be released later this month and it will show that recorded assaults have increased steadily over the past 10 years by over 40 per cent. There is recent research which conservatively estimates that alcohol related crime in Australia costs $1.7 billion a year.Nobody wants to spoil the enjoyment of having a few drinks, but moderate consumption is not the problem. Police commissioners have praised the government's recent decision to increase the tax on premixed drinks. We cannot ignore advice from officers who are in the front line dealing with a major national problem. Frankly, criticism of any measure to reduce binge drinking is very hard to fathom. A definition of binge drinking can indeed only assist responsible drinking.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. The issues that he raises are particularly important issues at a time when the nation is experiencing such drought, and they were among the issues that came up at the 2020 Summit. At the 2020 Summit significant discussion took place about the fact that we do have so much more water in the north of the nation and we are experiencing such severe drought in the south of the nation. Of course, it is not simply a case of shifting the agriculture and transplanting it from one part of the country to the other, for the obvious reason that in the north of the country overwhelmingly the rain that does fall falls in particular months of the year and you then have knock-on impacts in terms of what can be grown there with soils as well as one of the critical problems being the increased proliferation of pests and diseases in the north of the country.There has been success with respect to agriculture for some time, with mangoes being grown in the north of the country outside of the sugar regions themselves. More recently, there have been expansions of industries such as the peanut industry across Northern Australia. So it is an issue not simply in Queensland but across the whole of Northern Australia. I have been talking at length and am still working through some proposals with the member for Brand, who has policy carriage in this area in his role as Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Development and Northern Australia.Some of these opportunities may also be advanced in having plant varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases through the development of some GMOs, genetically modified organisms. There may be some further opportunities in the north of Australia coming out of that. With respect to the proliferation of weeds, I am pleased the honourable member refers to the fact that you can actually get around the food versus fuel argument through biofuel options which do provide very real outcomes at the same time in terms of beef production. These are issues that the government is still working through. The honourable member is aware, with respect to biofuels, of some of the work I have reported to the House previously, which is being jointly done by the Minister for Resources and Energy and me.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question. Last Friday the aviation relationship between Australia and the European Union, Australia's largest aviation market, took a significant step forward. European transport ministers approved a mandate for the European Commission to negotiate an EU-wide comprehensive air services agreement with Australia.I welcome this decision as an important step towards a historic open skies agreement which could deliver greater competition, more flights and lower airfares between Australia and EU countries. It is a step that could never have been secured by the previous government. The decision of the Rudd Labor government to ratify the Kyoto protocol was clearly instrumental in achieving a shift in European opinion and a shift in the European agreement to this mandate. An EU-wide comprehensive air services agreement could remove many if not all of the existing limitations for Australian and European airlines operating between Australia and the EU.The Rudd government has actively pursued an open skies agreement and it was discussed when the Prime Minister met with the President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, in Brussels in April of this year. More recently, I hosted a lunch in Parliament House on 5 May where the potential open skies agreement with the EU was discussed with Mr Bruno Julien, the Ambassador and Head of Delegation of the European Commission to Australia and New Zealand, and Mr Francois Descoueyte, the French Ambassador to Australia. Of course, France takes over the presidency of the EU from 1 July.In order to progress the important open skies agreement with the EU, I will be travelling in July to meet with the EU and with the French and German transport ministers. Recent progress with Europe builds on the Rudd government's success in concluding an open skies agreement with the United States. It has been only three months since the Prime Minister signed the Australia-US open skies agreement and the benefits of competition are already being felt. This has the potential to lead to cheaper airfares and a greater variety of cities served. This is a win for consumers, a win for the tourism industry and a win for the Australian aviation industry. Achieving an international air services policy which serves our national interest is a key issue being considered in the development of the government's aviation white paper, which will be finalised by mid-2009.</DOC>

I was in Japan and there were events unfolding back here. What I know for a fact is as follows. My statement at the time was that it appeared that there had been an unacceptable pattern of behaviour in relation to the honourable member. Furthermore, I indicated that the honourable member had agreed that there would be appropriate counselling. Furthermore, I said that it would be proper for all members of parliament to reflect on the fact that no-one is guaranteed of a future in this place. Those have been my consistent comments on this matter since then. They remain my position now and I await the outcome, as all honourable members do, of the police investigation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I was pleased last week to represent Australia at the successful International Support Conference for Afghanistan in Paris. That conference very much underlined the Australian government's approach, which is that in Afghanistan we need to secure two things: firstly, peace and security through combat or military enforcement action; and, secondly, to build the Afghan nation through civil reconstruction.The conference in Paris was a very necessary step in aligning the civilian contribution and the military contribution and an important follow-up to the Bucharest NATO summit. It sent a strong message of international community commitment to Afghanistan's rebuilding, reconstruction and development. Nearly US$20 billion was pledged, including a $250 million contribution from Australia, which of course is in addition to our troop commitment in the south of the Afghanistan, part of which involves a reconstruction task force.Australia joined with the international community in making the point that the time has now come for the Afghan government itself to assume a greater responsibility in the administration of civil reconstruction and to assume a greater responsibility in addressing the major threats to Afghanistan's stability. I made the point to the conference and generally that Australia saw four main threats to Afghanistan's reconstruction: firstly, the ongoing security situation; secondly, the need for the Afghan government to ensure good governance; thirdly, the essential need for building the capacity of state institutions; and, finally, the need to address and attack Afghanistan's significant narcotics problem.The conference underlined these things and also made the point that, in addition to an enhanced international community commitment to this civil reconstruction, there needs to be greater coordination of international efforts. The conference expressed its very strong support for the United Nations Special Representative, Mr Kai Eide, in his role. In the course of the conference I had the opportunity of speaking to Mr Eide and also the Secretary General of NATO, my foreign minister counterparts from the United Kingdom, France, Pakistan and Italy and the Secretary of State of the United States. In these meetings I emphasised Australia's long-term commitment to Afghanistan, including the essential need to parallel-track both military enforcement action and civil reconstruction. I also emphasised Australia's very significant concern about the potential deleterious consequences to our troops in the south of Afghanistan near the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. It is quite clear that the potentially deteriorating situation on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border is a matter which is now of necessary interest not just to Afghanistan and Pakistan but also to the region and the international community generally.I indicated that Australia pledged $250 million for civil reconstruction. We particularly see that as occurring in agriculture, good governance, law enforcement and capacity-building of state institutions. My attendance at the conference as Australia's representative followed upon a trip to Afghanistan, where I had the opportunity of having discussions with the new Commander of the International Security Assistance Force, General McKiernan, about the implementation of the political and military strategy from Bucharest and also the prospects for civil reconstruction. It is true to say that the work being done by Australian troops - both in a military sense and also in a reconstruction sense - in Oruzgan province in southern Afghanistan is very much appreciated by the international security forces and very much admired by NATO members and the international community.In conclusion, I welcome very much the recent announcements from NATO states that their military commitment is being upgraded. I welcome very much the announcement overnight by the British Secretary of State for Defence, Des Browne, of the increase in the United Kingdom's contribution in Afghanistan, which is its largest military contribution. I welcome very much the announcement by the Italian Foreign Minister that the so-called caveats applied to the deployment of Italian forces will now be made significantly more flexible, and I welcomed this in my discussions with Foreign Minister Frattini.It is unambiguously the case that Australia's long-term commitment in Afghanistan, both militarily and in civil reconstruction, is in our national interest. There is absolutely no doubt that it is also in the international community's interest. There is no doubt that Afghanistan, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border area, is currently the international hotbed of terrorism. And that terrorism is potentially quickly mobile - to the north and west for Europe and to the south and east for Asia and Australia. That is why Australia's ongoing, long-term, enduring commitment to Afghanistan is of both a military enforcement and civil reconstruction nature.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I note his strong engagement with the wheat growers in his electorate of Wakefield and their support of the need to reform wheat marketing. More information on the future of this year's wheat crop was made clear at 10 am today with the release of the ABARE Australian crop report. The area sown to wheat is forecast to be a record 14 million hectares for this year 2008-09. The forecast crop is still only a prediction - and, given that we had a bad season in May, it is still being revised and the most recent revision is slightly downwards. The current forecast is for 23.7 million tonnes, a significant increase on last year's harvest of 13 million tonnes.Looking at the future of this year's wheat crop, the most important part of that future - along with the total tonnage - is under what system it will be sold. The new system will, for the first time, allow growers a choice: if they wish to sell through a pooling arrangement then they can do so and if they wish to sell through a different mechanism then they can also do so. Providing this sort of choice for this year's wheat crop is an important part of the future of the crop. Many people have said that these options for the future have only come out of the wheat for weapons scandal, but the warnings actually came much earlier than that. In the year 2000 the Productivity Commission concluded that the benefits of single desk marketing, be it for wheat, sugar, barley or rice, could be achieved without a monopoly buyer or seller. I will quote the Productivity Commission report of 2000:Â ... producers can benefit from the increased range of services provided in a more competitive environment.The national competition policy review, also in the year 2000, eight years ago, concluded that a single-desk operator is less responsive to both its clients and its suppliers. In eight years the warnings have not changed; what has changed is that we no longer have a government willing to neglect and fail to act on difficult economic reforms. The monopoly did let down wheat growers. This is not only about the $300 million in bribes paid to Saddam Hussein. If you look at the 2006 growers report from the Export Wheat Commission, you will see that it found that those who did not export through AWBI were getting higher prices than the AWBI in the container market and that delays in executing a contract for the sale of wheat to India cost growers $9.5 million. This pain to growers under the single desk system will not be part of this year's wheat crop.The 2007 growers report looked at chartering arrangements and found that, for 39 vessel charters, the national pool was $14Â½ million worse off for growers than it would have been if prevailing commercial shipping rates had been used. I have directed the Export Wheat Commission to investigate this issue and I am awaiting their report. The 2007 growers report addendum, released only yesterday, concluded that AWB Ltd's hedging strategies were speculative and placed unacceptable risks in the 2005-06 and 2006-07 national pools. Given that the monopoly has, year after year, let growers down, it is important that, as we wait for the Senate debate on this issue, we also reflect on the response of the Leader of the National Party when I allowed an extra permit through earlier in the year for Glencore to also be allowed to export wheat. What happened there? For the first time in some years, Australian wheat growers were allowed back into the Iraqi market - a benefit again for wheat growers. These are difficult economic reforms. These are challenges that have been put to the previous government dating all the way back to 2000. They are challenges that this parliament and this government are happy to take on. All the evidence points to growers being the beneficiaries of the changes.</DOC>

 - I am more than happy to answer the question. 'Unacceptable' means not acceptable, 'pattern' means a series of events and 'behaviour' means what you do. That is just the truth. As a consequence of that, having observed what transpired in Australia, I therefore took action on that in relation to an agreed activity concerning counselling. That is my answer to the substance of the question. On the other point which was raised, I will add to an answer to an earlier question which was asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She questioned the sequence of a statement I made in Tokyo and a statement made by the member for Robertson. The statement I made in Tokyo was dated 9 June, and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred to it before. A journalist asked me: 'Have you spoken to the member for Robertson? What would you say about what was going on and disciplinary action?' The answer from me was:No I haven't. Secondly I understand my office has been in contact, and thirdly I understand that she has issued a statement, and I draw your attention to that.That is a transcript of me, in Kyoto, on 9 June 2008. There was a media statement from Belinda Neal, the member for Robertson, on Sunday, 8 June 2008. That is the sequence.</DOC>

 - No, they do not reveal that at all. What they actually reveal is the impact of the international financial turbulence from the US subprime crisis. What they really reveal is the impact of eight interest rate rises in the last three years. That is what they reveal. What they reveal is the impact of inflation at a 16-year high, the legacy of those opposite and something for which they refuse to accept any responsibility whatsoever. Of course, what such reports will also reveal in the future is the fact that we have an opposition that is intent on economic vandalism - economic vandalism in the Senate this morning, with measures to delay the introduction of this budget, which will cost the bottom line of the surplus $280-odd million. All those Liberal and National senators voted for higher interest rates in the Senate this morning. They voted for irresponsible spending. But those opposite simply do not get it when it comes to responsible economic management. They think you can go on spending irresponsibly and have no impact on inflation and no impact on consumer confidence.Who was the author of this act of economic vandalism in the Senate this morning? We all know it was the member for Wentworth. Now, we heard about the member for Wentworth yesterday from his sponsored focus groups, and in the press today - The member for O'Connor then left the chamber. - Nothing could affect confidence into the future more than an irresponsible act of economic vandalism such as what we saw from the Liberal and National parties in the Senate today. Of course, this is the strategy of the member for Wentworth. I hope he has had some time to explain to the opposition leader why focus groups were being conducted on his resume, on his website, on his post-budget address. - I was asked about confidence, and I was talking about the irresponsible actions of the Liberal and National parties in the Senate and the impact of them on confidence. Who was the author of this strategy in the Senate? We have a bit more information on the member for Wentworth from that focus group. We have actually got the answers that the people gave. - Mr Speaker, it was a question about confidence, and nothing could be more damaging to confidence than the acts of the Liberal and National parties in the Senate - delaying the budget and ripping $280 million or $290 million off the surplus. And why is this happening? Some of those respondents can tell us. When asked about the member for Wentworth, they said he had no real substance. - </DOC>

 - This is a serious matter for Western Australia, and therefore it is a serious matter for all Australians. The shutdown of the Apache Energy natural gas facility at Varanus Island in WA continues to have a significant impact on the supply of natural gas to WA consumers and to business. The Varanus Island facility supplies about 30 per cent of all WA's natural gas needs. The latest advice I have is that the facility may be out for a number of months. This has the potential to affect the livelihoods of individuals - many workers - as well as businesses.I think that people in the east have not quite caught up with the severity of the impact which this is having across the WA economy. It is huge. Several WA mining and industrial companies, including exporters, have been forced to scale back production because of cuts to gas supplies. Clearly it is important that we work closely with the WA government to assist in managing the impact of this on individuals directly affected by the gas outage, as well as communities.If there is a significant impact on WA economic activity, on growth and on exports from that state, given WA's crucial significance to the overall performance of the Australian economy, there will be wash-through for us all on this over time, but in WA right now it is being felt directly. I spoke with the WA Premier, Alan Carpenter, earlier today to discuss the situation. The Premier has established a gas supply coordination group involving some Commonwealth government agencies, and we believe that that is an appropriate reflection of the level of coordination between the two governments. The group also includes a number of key state government agencies and peak industry bodies such as the Chamber of Commerce and Industry Western Australia, the Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia, the Western Australian Meat Industry Authority and the Western Australian Local Government Association. The gas supply coordination group, which is headed by the Director-General of the Western Australian Department of the Premier and Cabinet, has been asked to focus on a range of supply challenges - including industry concerns that gas shortages will result in shutdowns and business closures, potential job losses, the effect on essential services including food supplies and hospitals and insurance challenges - as well as the overall effect on future economic growth and the mining industry.The Commonwealth will continue to work with the Western Australian state government on the impact across the economy. The Minister for Defence agreed, on Friday last, to surrender an order of six megalitres of diesel for the Royal Australian Navy, which allowed the BP refinery at Kwinana to concentrate on bolstering diesel supplies for Western Australian industry over the coming week. The defence minister has also advised that, if a need arises for additional diesel supplies to be made available, he will consider releasing volumes from the strategic reserve. We will also invoke the provisions of the Liquid Fuel Emergency Act if required. This act provides the Australian government with the authority to prepare for and manage a national liquid fuel supply emergency. During such a situation, the Minister for Resources and Energy can control the production, transfer and stock levels of crude and liquid fuel. We are engaged with the WA government as to the need for this course of action, and at present we are advised by the Premier that action involving the invocation of that act is not required at this time.I have also had discussions with the Premier, Alan Carpenter, about the impact of this gas crisis in Western Australia on individuals and local communities. The Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Prime Minister announced last week that the government had made available JobSearch support through Centrelink for those who may be directly affected as a result of the rupture. Furthermore, the government will maintain close contact with the Western Australian government as it undertakes its own needs analysis of what the impact will be for individuals who lose their jobs and the roll-on impact for families and for community organisations. We stand ready to assist the Western Australian government in dealing with this huge impact, which will flow down to the individual level. Once that needs assessment is concluded, both the Premier of Western Australia and I will make further announcements about further assistance which may be necessary from the Commonwealth government.</DOC>

 - I completely reject such ridiculous accusations from those opposite. It just shows how irresponsible and out of touch they are. Those minutes from the Reserve Bank board yesterday were a very sensible discussion of what is going on in the Australian economy. If you look at what has been going on with confidence and you read closely the Reserve Bank board minutes, you will find the backup for what I just said in my previous answer. What is going on out there? Let us be very serious about analysing this: firstly, record high international oil prices and petrol costs; secondly, the highest inflation in 16 years; thirdly, eight interest rate rises over three years; and, of course, ongoing international financial market turmoil. That is what the government has been dealing with for the past six months, and we inherited from you inflation at a 16-year high, and on day one we put up our hand and accepted responsibility for doing something about it responsibly.What we have had from the opposition during this period have been completely irresponsible and reckless actions, such as the action that we had in the Senate this morning - completely reckless and showing that those opposite have no appreciation whatsoever of what we must do as a country to combat inflation, to maintain sustainable growth and to get interest rates down in the long term. They have no appreciation of that at all.Of course, we are getting some appreciation of why they have no appreciation, because those people in the focus groups really had the Liberal Party nailed. When they were asked about the member for Wentworth, one said, 'He uses situations for his own advantage.' The next one said, 'He bleeds people dry.' - The irresponsibility of this opposition is there for all Australians to see and they should be condemned for their behaviour in the Senate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question and for her particular concern for the charities operating in her electorate, who are doing such an outstanding job for some of the most disadvantaged people in this country. I have been made aware of concerns among many public benevolent institutions and other charities about the impact of the former government's changes to income definitions. These are changes that were introduced by the previous government as part of wide-ranging child support reforms. The changes were detailed two years ago in the Howard government's 2006-07 budget. I will refer to the specific measure in the budget papers from 2006-07. It says that the government - and this, of course, is referring to the previous government:... will align the income definitions used to calculate Child Support and Family Tax Benefit.It goes on to say:The FTB income definition will be broadened to include the gross value of reportable fringe benefits rather than the net value used at present.That is what was said back in 2006-07, when we had a number of people opposite sitting around the cabinet table who would have taken this decision, including the Leader of the Opposition, who, of course, knew all about it. I want to make it absolutely clear that these changes were part of major changes that the previous government wanted to make to child support.What we know is that very little of the impact of this was made clear by the previous minister. I will read from the former minister's fleeting mention of this measure in his second reading speech back in September 2006. He said:The gross value of reportable fringe benefits, rather than the net value, will apply for family tax benefit, as it already does for child support. The changes to income for family tax benefit will also apply for childcare benefit.That is all that was said about this in the second reading speech. Not a word was said about the impact of this measure and how it could hurt people working in public benevolent institutions or in other charities. Now it is the case that the full impact of this measure is becoming clear.I want to reassure those people who are doing such an outstanding job working in public benevolent institutions, in charities or in other parts of the non-government sector that we on this side of the parliament - the new government - certainly value the work that they do. They are working with some of the most disadvantaged people in our community.We are also aware that salary-packaging arrangements are a very significant measure for attracting and retaining staff in the not-for-profit sector. That is why this government intends to take action to address these concerns as a matter of urgency. We are now looking at all of the options that may be available to us to assist the not-for-profit sector to make sure that they are not hurt by these changes. It is our intention to finalise our policy position by the end of this financial year. The changes are due to come into effect on 1 July, so it is imperative that employees in the not-for-profit sector get some reassurance before then.I do want to say, though, to people working in the not-for-profit sector that the payment system through Centrelink is, of course, extremely complex and technical. Centrelink payments are organised months in advance, so I would ask people who are listening today - and whom we are also in touch with - to bear with us as we find the best way through this issue. We are committed to making sure that people working in these public benevolent institutions are not hurt by the former government's changes. We do need to find a solution to this problem and I want to give a reassurance to those working in these organisations that we are committed to urgent action on this issue.The previous government left these important workers in the lurch. They did not explain publicly what they were doing and how it would impact on the not-for-profit sector. This government, by contrast, is very different. We intend to clean up the former government's mess and we will work with the not-for-profit sector, not undermine it.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - Small businesses are the backbone of the Australian economy. Therefore, it is important, as small businesses are key members and participators in the economy, that this government implements a policy of responsible economic management. The core elements of responsible economic management are to ensure that we put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. If you fail to do that, what happens is the reverse - interest rates go up, it affects economic activity and growth and then it affects employment. That is why this government, since the beginning of this year, has embarked upon a clear-cut strategy to fight the fight against inflation. We will continue that fight, even in the absence of support from those opposite. If we fail to do that effectively, the roll-on consequences of further interest rate rises for small business in particular would be very bad indeed. That is why the government has a clear-cut policy on a $22 billion surplus. That is why those opposite are conducting, by reverse strategy, a $22 billion raid on the surplus. The second important contribution which we can make in terms of the impact of small businesses out there earning a living and working hard for their families and for the Australian economy is the work that I referred to yesterday by the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, and that concerns -  -  - I take the interjection, which said that dealing with deregulation is in fact motherhood. I do not think it is motherhood. Dealing with deregulation affects the ability of businesses to conduct their daily business. They say it is motherhood to come up with a proposal which says: 'Why can't we just have a single registration of a business name system in Australia rather than six or eight of them? Why can't we have a system in this country where we move towards a seamless national economy and a seamless national market so that small businesses can grow into medium businesses and can actually expand their operations to different jurisdictions across the country?' That is why we are engaged -  - The third element which I would draw to the attention of the honourable member for McEwen is this: if you speak to small businesses across the country about the impact of the compliance burden of Work Choices on small business, in particular their five-minutes-to-midnight invention of a fairness test and the impact which that had right across the economy in overall business compliance costs, all of these things add together when it comes to your ability to run a small business successfully. So let us aggregate the scorecard. We come into government with inflation running at 16-year highs. We come into government with 10 interest rate rises in a row. We come into government with them having promised that interest rates would be kept at -  Government members - Record lows! - Record lows. Why didn't they enter the chorus of response that interest rates would be kept at -  
Government members - Record lows! - I don't think it was kept at record lows. After 12 years in office there was a failure to act on the overall cry of business for some form of regulatory reform which enables them to get on with the job of running their businesses successfully. Then, as the ultimate icing on the cake, an industrial relations system was imposed in the last period of that government which became more complicated than that of the Soviet Union as a result of the impossible burden which it placed on business and their ability to get simple answers from the regulatory authorities as to whether they were in, out, on top of or underneath the multiple requirements -  - which the member for North Sydney introduced in a flight of blind panic on the eve of the election. So, when we talk about confidence for small business, can I say that the inheritance from those opposite is spectacular in its dimensions in contributing to an overall impact on the ability of business to do its job and, as a consequence, that that does impact on confidence. What we, by contrast, are doing is embarking on a clear-cut strategy on dealing with the budget surplus, a clear-cut strategy on dealing with business deregulation and an industrial relations system which gets it right in terms of a proper balance between fairness and flexibility, including the business sector.</DOC>

 - If we look at the overall global problem of inflation, the governments of the world basically divide into two categories: those which are taking on the inflation challenge and those which are seeking to run away from it. Those opposite join the latter group whilst we on this side of the House are very much in the business of doing what government can to bring down inflationary pressures. If you have inherited 16-year-high inflation rates - because that is the objective economic record of the member for Higgins, a 16-year-high inflation rate; there is no disagreeing with that as it is a fact - then the challenge is what you do about it. You could put your head under the carpet - that is what those opposite are pretending to do at the moment - and blame a Labor government that has been in office for six months after they had 12 years to address supply side constraints in the economy. They had 12 years to deal with the other factors impacting on inflation, like skills and infrastructure, and they did nothing, and in six months - mysteriously - all these things have come home to roost for us, the new Australian Labor government. That is their thesis. It does not even bear logical scrutiny. Serious economic commentators around the world describe the inflation challenge as real. The OECD's most recent economic outlook on 4 June states:To avoid rising inflation expectations causing strong wage growth, monetary conditions need to be kept tight until domestic demand and price pressures have moderated sufficiently. In this context, the stabilising role that fiscal policy should play is welcome.Fiscal policy is budget policy. What is the cornerstone of budget policy? Whether you have a surplus or whether you have a deficit; whether you are going to run a $22 billion surplus or conduct a $22 billion raid on that surplus. We can go also to the minutes released by the Reserve Bank on 3 June. They state:Members observed that the budget surplus as a ratio to GDP was noticeably higher for 2007/08 and 2008/09 than had been expected in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook last October; at that time, a surplus of a bit over 1 per cent of GDP had been projected for both years. Measured in terms of the change in the surplus, fiscal policy was expected to impart a mildly contractionary effect on the economy in 2008/09.You see, responsible economic analysts, regulators and commentators recognise that inflation is a problem and that fiscal policy has a role to play. We on this side of the House have developed such a fiscal policy. The contrast lies in what has happened in the Senate today. The Leader of the Liberal Party - that is, before the member for Wentworth makes his move - has directed his colleagues in the Senate to act in a way which has the effect of stripping away $300 million worth of real money from the budget surplus. A few hours ago in the Senate the coalition used its majority to defer the votes on several key budget measures. This is not an academic exercise; this is a real exercise involving real money - $300 million. It depends entirely where those opposite now go in terms of future votes in the Senate. A $300 million assault on the bottom line means that the task of reducing the overall burden on outlays will become much harder in the future. This is real money. It affects the bottom line. Therefore, I will be looking very keenly to those opposite to come up with any proposal by way of spending cuts.Have we on this side of the House heard a proposal yet for a single savings initiative from those opposite? I cannot remember one from the last budget or the one before because their simple recipe for the future has been, 'Get out the printing press, print some more money, off you go!' It has been as irresponsible as that because their spending initiatives have not been accompanied by savings initiatives. We have come up with billions of dollars of savings initiatives on this side of the House. What is pathetic, Leader of the Opposition, is this: you fail to engage seriously in the economic debate. As those who stand up and seek to represent themselves as the alternative government of Australia, you are required to say, 'We will save here, here and here in order to fund the following initiatives.' By contrast, the Liberal Party, who once said they were the party of natural economic management, say, 'We will spend, spend and spend.'Labor comes up with a $22 billion surplus. Those opposite make a $22 billion raid on that surplus. I draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the action of his colleagues in the Senate. Today has been D-day in the Senate. The Liberal Party have voted against budget measures in the Senate. As a consequence, we will now achieve at least a further $300 million real assault on the budget bottom line. Those opposite stand condemned for this gross act of economic irresponsibility.</DOC>

 - For the period ahead, as I recall them, the numbers have been adjusted: on the inflation front, we have been running at about 4.2 per cent.

 - I thank the member for his question. The government has budgeted for a strong surplus to put downward pressure on inflation and to put downward pressure on interest rates, and also to ensure a buffer against international financial turbulence. We have also been able to put in place the essential investment to build the productive capacity of our economy and to build productivity into the future. We have also put in place tax cuts and our $55 billion working families support package that will give a very significant boost to household incomes after 1 July. There has been some commentary about the Reserve Bank board minutes, from which I quote:As in previous meetings, the central issue was that, over the past year, inflation has picked up to an uncomfortably high rate, against a background of limited ... capacity.Those opposite would like people to believe that suddenly inflation skyrocketed on the morning of 26 November last year. - And interest rates. Of course, it did not. The legacy of those opposite is inflation at a 16-year high. It has fallen to those on this side of the House to tackle that challenge. Our budget did precisely that - building a $22 billion surplus which is now being vandalised in the Senate by those opposite. Of course, we know why that is the case: it is at the instigation of the member for Wentworth. If he spent more time thinking about policies to fight inflation than asking people about his haircut, the inflation-fighting surplus that we have put in place would not have been voted against today. But it gets worse than that. We know why the focus group was taking place. We have got the real answer. We got it from Tony Abbott on 3AW yesterday. This is what Mr Abbott had to say about his leader -  - This is what Mr Abbott, the member for Warringah, had to say about his leader:... that is not to say that everyone is entirely optimistic at all times about the future, because, look, we've done it very tough, but at the next couple of - </DOC>

 - What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition conveniently ignores is the termination point of collective agreements. They come in groups, often in large concentrations, and as a result you may find industrial activity increases at those times. I also return to the other argument I advanced yesterday in this discussion. It goes back to the overall supply of labour - both skilled labour and unskilled labour. Having received 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank on an inadequate supply of labour, an inadequate skills supply in the economy and a lack of infrastructure, and having had 12 years to act on this, I would have thought that those opposite, when they had the opportunity to in government, would have done something by way of a radical investment in skills strategy and a radical investment in infrastructure; instead, they did not. On the question of skills, this government, quite apart from the other initiatives contained in the budget, has now created Skills Australia and will be advancing through the establishment of an $11 billion education investment fund which in part will deal with the future of the TAFE and training system in the country -  - If you are looking at the question of industrial activity, it goes to the overall supply of labour, the overall supply of skilled labour and the termination point of industrial agreements. When you have a large number of agreements terminating at about the same time, it follows that industrial activity may tip up at that particular time. What I am saying to those opposite is that, if you are looking at the overall industrial relations equation, you should do it with a proper debate about the overall supply and demand for labour and skilled labour, as well as the particular arrival of industrial instruments which come up for renewal and negotiation, which is what is occurring at present.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. The government has significantly tightened fiscal policy in order to fight inflation and put downward pressure on interest rates. That has been acknowledged by the Reserve Bank in its minutes that were published yesterday where it referred to the budget as having a 'mildly contractionary effect'. For the benefit of the opposition, that is code for putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. The opposition's approach, by contrast, is to erode and undermine the surplus by blocking and delaying budget legislation in the Senate. The net impact of the actions that the opposition is taking in the Senate would be to significantly reduce the surplus, to allow more public money to be in circulation and to therefore pump up inflation and put upward pressure on interest rates - in effect, to return to the fiscal settings that were previously in place under the member for Higgins and the former government where government spending was increasing at five per cent per annum in real terms.It appears the opposition disputes the argument that the government is putting forward that it is necessary to have a tight budget and a strong surplus in order to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. I admit it is sometimes difficult to tell because the positions advocated by members of the opposition seem to change on an almost daily basis. They are very carefully avoiding stating a position on the overall state of the economy. They are very carefully avoiding stating an overall position with respect to the surplus and what is the right position for the settings of the overall positioning of fiscal policy. But occasional comments from members of the opposition do suggest that they dispute the notion that putting downward pressure on interest rates and inflation is necessary and they dispute the notion that tightening fiscal policy will do that.Earlier this year we had the member for Wentworth saying that the inflation threat was a 'fairytale'. That was followed in very quick order by the Leader of the Opposition suggesting it was a 'charade'. This was punctuated by bizarre suggestions such as those from the member for Mayo that we should spend hundreds of millions of dollars building a giant arts edifice somewhere in the Adelaide Hills. Then, more recently, there were some rather peculiar claims by the two people who were in charge of fiscal policy in the previous government: the member for Higgins and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Minchin, said on AM on Monday that blocking or delaying the government's budget initiatives in the Senate 'won't affect the government's fiscal position whatsoever'. One would wonder why one needs savings initiatives if it does not matter whether or not they happen. Then the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, as quoted in the Financial Review, warned against 'excessive fiscal tightening in response to inflation'.Even today we have seen the member for Wentworth suggest that somehow the government's response to the threat of inflation is in itself the cause of the inflationary problem that we inherited from the former government. The trouble is that we are getting no coherent position from the opposition on fiscal policy at all. What we are seeing is just a random process of sniping at various government initiatives, all of which are part of a broad strategy to have a strong surplus to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. The party that once prided itself on its so-called fiscal discipline and fiscal rigour is degenerating into a completely incoherent rabble on economic policy.It is turning into a rather bad episode of Grumpy Old Men. They are unable to cope with the loss of power and the loss of relevance. They are having lunch, they are playing golf, they are on cruise ships, they are fighting amongst themselves, they are undermining their leader and they are complaining about how difficult life is on $127,000 a year. When they do occasionally engage in the bigger issues in public debate, all we get is a random selection of whinges, gripes and nostalgic reminiscences, the political equivalent of the grumpy old men on TV complaining about the weather, the bad service in restaurants -  -  - Unfortunately, these people are in control of the Senate. They are using their control of the Senate to vent their frustrations and to lay waste to the government's fiscal strategy and the position that is being taken to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. The government is committed to ensuring that we tackle the inflation problem and that we put downward pressure on interest rates. The random acts of sabotage and disruption that the opposition are engaged in in the Senate will do nothing other than erode the efforts of the government to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates.The opposition that at first refused to acknowledge there was a problem, and then said that the problem was caused by the incoming government, now does not quite know what the issue is or what the circumstances are and is trying to destroy the government's fiscal strategy. It is long overdue for the opposition to decide what its position is on the fiscal settings, what it thinks should be done with respect to inflation and interest rates and to allow the government's fiscal position to take effect in order to do the job that the Australian people want - and that is to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates.</DOC>

 - There is an interesting piece of logic in what has just been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. It assumes that the budget outcome for a single aged pensioner is worse than what it was 12 months ago when the Leader of the Opposition and the cabinet put forward their response for pensioners, carers and working families and a whole range of other tax income support measures. This government has brought forward a set of measures worth some $5.2 billion for those seniors receiving payments. - This includes extra payments for seniors - in particular, the one-off payment that we referred to before. For the first time the utilities allowance has been increased from its previous rate of $123 per annum to $500. That is a significant advance. As the government has indicated before, pensioners, carers and those on DSP payments are experiencing great difficulty when it comes to cost-of-living pressures. That is why I have indicated many times in this chamber that the future of income support payments from retirement income payments will be considered by the Henry commission of inquiry as well.I go back to the premise of the Leader of the Opposition's question. He is arguing about the inadequacy of the age pension as it exists now six months after those opposite left office. Pensioners, like everyone else, have experienced 10 interest rate rises in a row, record high inflation in 16 years and, last year alone, an increase in petrol prices by 33 per cent. Those opposite would argue that these cost-of-living pressures mysteriously emerged in the last six months and that somehow this government's budget measures which have enhanced pension payments are somehow worse than those which were brought in 12 months ago by those opposite.I suggest that if the Leader of the Opposition wishes to be a responsible participant in the debate about the future of retirement incomes policy, including the pension, he does so responsibly on the basis of the facts rather than simply throwing forward one set of assertions after another instead of reflecting on what has changed materially against the level of the pension, the ways in which it is indexed, the way in which we have handled the one-off payment, the way in which we have increased the utilities allowance and why we are now having this matter considered for the long term for pensioners and carers through the activities of the Henry commission.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. The government is committed to a transparent and accountable electoral system and to strengthening our democracy and the electoral practices that underpin that. In order to pursue that, the government will be issuing a green paper on electoral reform in two parts in the second half of the year to examine other ways of improving our democratic practice in Australia, because democracy means more than just the superficial structures; it is also the mechanics, the process ensuring that we can all participate equally in our overall democratic system.At the moment there are some urgent repairs required. We have, therefore, introduced the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008 to fix some of the more serious loopholes in the existing system. The opposition, because it unfortunately has the numbers in the Senate, is sending this bill to a committee with a reporting date of 30 June 2009.This bill contains five urgent measures to clean up problems which have been identified with the current funding and disclosure regime. These measures include ensuring that all donations to political parties and candidates over $1,000 are subject to proper public scrutiny, reducing the $10,500 disclosure threshold that now exists. It also includes a twice yearly reporting regime through the Australian Electoral Commission. It also bans overseas and anonymous donations and prevents political parties and candidates making a profit from public funding.The government wants to implement all of these measures by 1 July this year and therefore make the management of the new regime as straightforward as possible for the Australian Electoral Commission over the financial year 2008-09. The measures are straightforward and uncontroversial, or so they should be and so we believe they ought to be. For 2004-05, when the donation disclosure threshold was $1,500, there were 1,286 donor returns lodged with the AEC. For the following financial year, 2005-06, when the previous government raised the disclosure threshold to $10,000, only 317 donor returns were lodged. In the space of a year the number of donor returns subject to public scrutiny dropped by three-quarters. In the following year, 2006-07, the number of donor returns dropped again to 194 - less than one-sixth of the number of donations disclosed when the threshold was $1,500 in 2004-05.No-one, we believed, could reasonably argue that transparency, disclosure and tightening the rules of public accountability are bad things, and nobody could disagree with the need for proper disclosure of sources of funding for election campaigns - or so we thought. But it appears that the opposition and Dr Nelson, the member for Bradfield and Leader of the Opposition, have a problem with this bill. It reflects a longstanding dynamic in Australian politics on these issues: the Liberal Party will always seek to restrict access to the right to vote and always seek to restrict disclosure of political donations. These are the two fundamental positions that always prevail in debates about electoral reform in this country.The opposition is clearly against transparency, accountability and strengthening democracy, and this bill is being sent to the never-never of a prolonged Senate committee process which is not due to report for over a year. Therefore, the reforms cannot be passed by the Senate until roughly September 2009 at the earliest, when the government believes the bill should be put in place by 1 July this year. The opposition wants to delay those reforms until at least September of next year. That is a whole year's worth of a big pile of extra secret donations. That is a whole year's worth of potential for further corruption. The opposition should think very seriously about its position on this issue. I urge the Leader of the Opposition to rethink the opposition's position. The figures speak for themselves: as these rules have been changed by the Liberal Party in government, so the level of transparency and disclosure has disappeared. We are about to reverse that and the opposition should support the changes to the legislation.</DOC>

 - That is a very good question and I will be answering it for you, actually. Thank you very much. Obviously in this House yesterday and in recent days we have been discussing the government's commitment to making a difference in child care - making a difference on affordability, accessibility and quality. On a day on which the only themes apparently tying together the questions from the opposition are hypocrisy on the one hand and confected outrage on the other, I think it is a good day to remind ourselves about the facts in the area of child care.On the question of affordability, the demand side, government's assistance to working parents, this is a government that has budgeted for, and is going to deliver, an increase in the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, a benefit that is not income tested but will be available to working families using child care from 1 July and which will mean more relief for them - more dollars in the purses and wallets of Australian working families. What do we hear from the opposition on this area? Absolutely nothing. Had they been in government, of course, this measure to assist working families would not have been delivered.Then there is the question of transparency. The government is going to ensure that parents can access a website that tells them about fees, availability and quality. According to today's opposition, transparency is something that they do not believe in; transparency is something that they do not care about. This is where the hypocrisy comes in, because of course the former minister for families, Mr Brough, when he said he aspired to introduce a national childcare management system, said the aim of it was to provide the best information on childcare supply, usage and demand data that had ever been available in Australia for families. Those who used to believe in transparency apparently now do not believe in transparency. But the one thing we know about the former minister for families and community services, Mr Brough, is that he never delivered what he promised to deliver, and it falls to this government to make sure that working families have this information.And then there is the question of the supply side. Yesterday I talked in the House about the government's plan to ensure that there are up to 260 new childcare centres around the country. What do we hear from the opposition? When the present Leader of the Opposition was asked, 'What would you think about the idea of government setting up government funded childcare centres in the vicinity of private centres which have increased their fees by too much as a means to put pressure on them?' he said, 'It sounds like an expensive waste of taxpayers' money to make a political point.' New childcare centres, new places and providers selected on the basis of a track record of affordability are things that the Leader of the Opposition is not committed to. He wants to make sure that working families around this country cannot find child care when they need it.And then there is the question of the broad hypocrisy of the opposition about these issues. Now, apparently they feel the pain of working families. The Leader of the Opposition is so overcome by this emotion from time to time he can hardly move. But I and I believe many members in this House would recall a time when the present Leader of the Opposition sat on this side of the parliament. When he did sit on this side of the parliament, he used to sit with the former member for Richmond, Larry Anthony, now replaced of course by the Minister for Ageing. Larry Anthony was in fact his junior minister. - All right. He was on the government front bench with the Leader of the Opposition. Are you denying he was a minister? - Apparently the Leader of the Opposition was never sitting over here. But when the Leader of the Opposition was sitting over here with Larry Anthony, down the bench, let us just look at the track record on affordability. In that time when Larry Anthony was there and the Leader of the Opposition was there, there was a 33 per cent increase in childcare costs to families, according to the ABS.I have been asked about ABC Learning from the opposition backbench, interestingly. This is the same Larry Anthony who, after losing his seat, went straight into a director's role in the private childcare industry - and who for? Maybe you can supply the answer for me. Of course as a director of ABC Learning, where annual reports tell us that Mr Anthony received a $60,000 director's fee and a further $125,000 in consultancy fees from one provider - $185,000 for some part-time work, earnings of a former Howard government minister from the childcare industry. Now, of course, we have his colleague sitting here saying that increasing competition and supply in child care is apparently an expensive waste of taxpayers' money to make a political point. Australian working families who want child care, who want it affordable and who want it at decent quality standards know this is a government that is acting to make a difference and this is an opposition without an idea and with a track record of failure.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is aware of reports in the media that the Murray-Darling Basin governments have ignored scientific advice on the critical state and watering needs of ecosystems in the Lower Lakes and the Coorong. We are aware that that report was prepared by the South Australian Murray-Darling Basin Natural Resources Management Board. I remind the House again that the Australian government has already committed to spending $3.1 billion as part of Water for the Future. We have already completed the first-ever federal government water purchase program, which will put 35 billion litres back into the Murray when water is available. - I advise the member that in March the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council agreed to spend some $6 million to pump water into Lake Albert to manage the impact of low water levels in the lake in order to stabilise acid sulfate levels. It is also the case that the council noted at its most recent meeting that, if dry conditions continued, it might be necessary before its next scheduled meeting to consider implementing other interim options.The ongoing drought is placing stress on communities, industries and the environment, particularly those that are dependent on the River Murray. The government is well aware of that issue, but it needs to be stated clearly in the House that this problem is made more difficult by the lack of available water. In the period from 1997 to 2006 inflows to the Murray River averaged some 49 per cent below the pre-1997 long-term average. Storages in the southern basin are at all-time lows. We have just experienced the fourth driest autumn on record, and the outlook for the remainder of the year is not good. Put simply: there is very little water in the basin at the moment and management options for the Lower Lakes and the Coorong are limited.The commitment of the government to address these issues is absolutely resolute. We have committed $6 million for emergency measures for Lake Albert and a further $5 million to identify the extent of the threat posed by acid sulfate soils and other critical water related threats. Additionally, the basin commission is developing a range of medium- and long-term risk management plans to deal specifically with the Lower Lakes and a report will come to the ministerial council in November 2008. The drought is putting pressure on all aquatic ecosystems. As a consequence, the government is fully committed not only to the $3.1 billion in water purchases but particularly to addressing these critical issues that have been identified at the present point in time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know that, as a health professional before she came to this place, she is particularly concerned about this issue. I think everyone in the House would be aware by now that the government are particularly concerned about the rates of binge drinking in the community. We are worried about a drinking problem and drinking patterns across the country that are costing us $15 billion every year. We are worried about the number of young women aged 18 to 24 being hospitalised for alcohol abuse that has doubled in less than a decade. We are worried that in New South Wales the number of alcohol related assaults has doubled over the last decade to more than 20,000 assaults.But there are some in the community who are not worried about this issue, and most of them are sitting on the opposition benches. We know that the Leader of the Opposition's scientific approach to binge drinking is 'when you're really getting stuck into it'. Compare that with the Newcastle local area commander, Mr Charles Haggett, who says 'the higher levels of intoxication have resulted in higher levels of alcohol related crime'. We know that the member for North Sydney does not think there is a problem. On 30 March he said:_ I don't think you should overplay it. Let's not go over the top.New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione has described alcohol abuse as an 'enormous' national problem. He said:Something like about 70 per cent of every police engagement with a member of the community in the streets of NSW has alcohol as a factor.We know the member for Warringah heartily agrees. A few days ago he accused the government of moral panic on this issue and just yesterday in that interview on 3AW, among the entertaining antidotes that he shared with us about his views of the Leader of the Opposition and others, he said:Despite this being an issue of concern to parents, health experts and police commissioners it's a beat-up, not to put too fine a point on it.Contrast that with what Northern Territory Police Commissioner Paul White said:We're witnessing a disturbing national trend towards greater levels of binge drinking by young people _ Too many young men are drinking heavily and think they're bullet proof, so end up getting involved in fights _ while drunk.In case you are in any doubt about the opposition's flippant approach to binge drinking, I will tell you one more story about the opposition. I am sorry that the member for Hinkler is not here because I have to confess that when I was walking the halls of parliament in the last few weeks I walked past the member for Hinkler's office. I might say that the member for Hinkler last night said he does not want a $5 million GP superclinic in his electorate. I wonder whether there is any electorate over here that might have one instead. In passing, he says he does not want one. -  - Imagine my surprise, coming across in the window of the member for Hinkler's office a life-sized bear. It was not just an ordinary bear; it was actually a white polar bear. It was quite a famous bear - the Bundy bear; the only bear in the country which has his whole life committed to promoting alcohol. -  - Perhaps not the only bear. -  - I certainly will. The point is that we have the opposition with alcohol advertisements in their offices in the parliament; you have us, with the police commissioners, with the parents and with the health professionals, trying to tackle this problem. You and the distillers are the only ones who don't think it is a problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. Mr Speaker, as you would be aware, in accordance with the project intent and contract with the Glasgow University Archaeological Research Division, the Pheasant Wood site has now been closed. Last Friday, on 13 June, a ceremony was held to acknowledge the significance of the ground and to allow the local community to pay respects to those Australian and British soldiers who have lain buried at this site since the Battle of Fromelles in July of 1916. The ceremony was attended by representatives of the British government; the Australian Army; His Excellency Mr David Ritchie, the Australian Ambassador to France; the Commonwealth War Graves Commission; and the local community. It was also attended by Madame de Massiet, the landowner, who, as you would be aware, Mr Speaker, has offered to gift the land in which these fallen soldiers lie to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission - a gesture which I believe all of us in this place are grateful to acknowledge and which I am sure we would all thank her for.Honourable members - Hear, hear! - Moreover, it is a mark of respect typical of the people of France for the loss of so many Australian lives at the time in defending their homeland. The ceremony has also marked the successful completion of the excavation. GUARD was commissioned, as you would be aware, Mr Speaker, to confirm the presence or otherwise of human remains at the site; to determine, if possible, the nationality of those remains; to estimate their number; and, finally, to assess their condition. All of these purposes have been achieved. In fact, along with the discovery of the remains in six of the eight burial pits that were excavated, the archaeological team has located numerous First World War artefacts, amongst them Australian Rising Sun collar badges and two British General Service buttons. This is sufficient for GUARD to confirm that Australian and British soldiers killed at the Battle of Fromelles on 19 July 1916 are present in the pits - that is, that they were never recovered during the 1920s and have remained undisturbed for those 92 years.The number of individuals buried at the site may be as high as several hundred, although we await the detailed report due from the archaeologists to give us a more accurate assessment of the figures. I would point out that this exploratory excavation only exposed 20 per cent of the surface area of each pit, which measure 10 metres by 2.2 metres. It was never intended to be an exhumation. I need to make that very clear. As a result of the nature of the excavation, none of the remains were disturbed in any way.As to what is to happen next, the future of the site - the future of these fallen Australian heroes, who have so long lain unacknowledged on French soil - is not a decision for us alone. We cannot act unilaterally. We need to be mindful of our obligations and mindful that British remains also rest at Pheasant Wood. Future decisions on possible identification and commemoration of remains will be made in agreement with the French and British governments and in consultation with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission pursuant to a 1951 treaty.I should point out that since 1917 the policy of member nations of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has been that, if remains from the two world wars are recovered, they are buried in the closest Commonwealth war grave. I have already spoken twice to the British Under-Secretary of State for Defence and Minister for Veterans, the Hon. Derek Twigg, and will continue to work with him and his government through the next steps. I also know and fully appreciate the incredible interest that so many families hold in this site - families who have long wondered about the fate of their uncles, their grandfathers, their great-grandfathers and their great-uncles. I can assure those families that their interests will figure highly as the governments talk and as we study the technical assessment which has been undertaken by GUARD once we have received it.We all know - and this House certainly knows - that this discovery at Fromelles is momentous. Already, the site has received several significant visitations from people travelling to Fromelles. I point to the Minister for Trade, who visited the site a week or so ago; as well as the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard; and the British minister to whom I have referred, Derek Twigg. I want to publicly commend everyone whose professionalism and dedication have brought us to this point. The work, by its very nature, has been very difficult in the muddy conditions and - I have to say - very emotionally draining on all those involved, particularly the excavation team and the Australian project team. I want to again in this place thank Major General Mike O'Brien, who has coordinated the Army effort over the past weeks. It would be remiss of me if I did not commend again the tireless efforts of Mr Lambis Englezos and his supporters for their dedication in finding the missing at Fromelles. We are all very much indebted to them all. In conclusion, it is worth pointing out that, as a result of the work of Mr Englezos and his relationship with the community at Fromelles, on the anniversary of the battle - on 19 July this year - a replica of Cobbers, a statue at Fromelles, will be unveiled at the shrine in Melbourne. That will be an event of significance, I am sure you will agree. I will keep the House updated as the scientific reports and intergovernmental negotiations continue.</DOC>

 - I am unaware of what advice may have been provided. I am just unaware. Can I say to those opposite on this matter that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition stood in this place yesterday and asked a question about these affairs. She said:I refer the Prime Minister to his statement at a press conference in Japan on 9 June, in answer to questions about the member for Robertson, when the Prime Minister said:... I understand my office has been in contact. And ... I understand she has issued a statement ...The member for Curtin continued:Given that the member for Robertson did not issue a statement until the following afternoon of 10 June, what involvement did the Prime Minister's office have in the preparation of that statement?That is the question asked yesterday. Again:Given that the member for Robertson did not issue a statement until the following afternoon of 10 June ...Therefore, the inference is this. I made a statement in Japan on 9 June and referred to the fact that a statement had been issued. The member for Curtin is saying that the facts were that there was no statement from the member for Robertson until 10 June. That is just untrue. You stood in the chamber yesterday making a complete untruth, and you stand condemned for it.</DOC>

 - We on this side of the House are committed to nation-building infrastructure and we are committed to promoting regional development. It is true that we have been very critical up to this point of the former government's approach, which funded ethanol plants that did not exist, cheese factories that closed down and rail lines that burnt down. But this question provides me with an opportunity to really lift the lid on just how bad the Howard government's approach to infrastructure and regional development was.Less than a month before the election was called, the previous government approved $60,000 under Regional Partnerships for a project in the town of Lock. Lock is a small town on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia. It has a population of some 290 people. It has one hotel, a supermarket, a school, a police station and a post office. The Howard government approved $60,000 for the renovation of one more building in the town of Lock. Regional Partnerships was meant to have lofty goals. When the Howard government created it, they said it was about 'facilitating local investment' and 'promoting links between industry, government and communities'. In fact, Regional Partnerships was so crooked it had an S-bend in it. The $60,000 was approved by the former government to renovate a dunny - a toilet - in the town of Lock. Both sides of the House would agree that toilets are pretty essential. But, when it comes to the divisions between the Commonwealth, the state and local governments, what business is it of the Commonwealth to be building toilets in small communities in South Australia?When it comes to the 290 residents this was a rolled-gold throne, because to produce this toilet it cost $206 for each man, woman and child who lives in Lock. I thought this was a bit odd so I asked the department what the basis for the approval was. It turns out that it was not approved by the department. The department had a look at the Regional Partnerships program guidelines and determined that the dunny in Lock did not meet the guidelines because toilets are clearly a local government responsibility when it comes to public parks. It also did not satisfy the Regional Partnerships program funding criteria so the department recommended against it.You would think that would be the end of the matter - but no. You had the minister, the member for Lyne; Jim Lloyd, the former member for Robertson; and Gary Nairn, the former member for Eden-Monaro, sitting around the ministerial office thinking: 'How do we promote regional development? How do we really do something for regional Australia? We'll approve $60,000 for this dunny in Lock! And we'll overturn the guidelines and the departmental recommendation to do this'. I thought to myself: why would they do something so outrageous? And then I had a look at the electoral map, which was the basis for all their decisions, and I found that the town of Lock is in the electorate of Grey, which had a retiring member, Barry Wakelin. They had polling coming out saying that they were very vulnerable because the sitting Liberal MP was retiring. So a month out from the election the Howard government knew that they were up a certain creek without a paddle - and they were prepared to do anything. They did not just throw the kitchen sink at this proposal; they also threw the dunny! A government that for 12 years ignored serious investment in infrastructure, nation-building and regional development was prepared to flush away taxpayers' dollars on this proposal. The fact is that you have to make choices in budgets. You make real choices. There are finite amounts of funds. And what we saw from those opposite was a preparedness to use taxpayers' funds as if they were their own funds. This is such a serious issue because it indicates exactly how malevolent they were with taxpayers' funds. This government will take regional development seriously. The former government stand condemned for their short-term, politically opportunistic approach.</DOC>

 - If we are seeking to deal responsibly with the greatest oil shock that the world has seen in 30 years, we need to do it comprehensively. That means looking at global supply, it means looking at global demand, it means dealing with a responsible alternative fuel strategy, it means dealing with a responsible approach to fuel efficient vehicles and it also means an appropriate national investment in public transport. These form the structure of a responsible long-term response. Of course there are other responses which go to the nearer to medium term, and that is why we have matters currently being considered by the Henry commission of inquiry. And of course there are those which go immediately to the heart of competition policy, and that is why we put forward proposals such as those which have been advanced by the Assistant Treasurer concerning Fuelwatch.The Leader of the Opposition asks why we are seeking to work with the international community on the global supply of oil. It is for a couple of specific reasons, and I am surprised that this is one of the further measures which the opposition opposes. The opposition opposes the government's actions on Fuelwatch. The opposition opposes the government's plan to work with Toyota to have an Australian manufactured hybrid car. -  - It is interesting that there is a level of ridicule about the future of manufacturing in Australia on the part of those opposite. Those on this side of the House stand for the future of Australian motor vehicle manufacturing; those opposite would simply like to kiss it goodbye. And then we have opposition from those opposite to the government's plan to act internationally in partnership with the G8 and with other oil-consuming countries, including at the conference which is being convened this coming weekend by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Minister for Resources and Energy will be representing the Australian government at the Jeddah energy meeting. On the matters to be addressed at that meeting, these will go to the question of addressing foreign investment restrictions; working with OPEC countries and encouraging investment in additional spare production capacity; improving oil market data transparency; considering refining and other options for increasing middle distillate output in diesel, jet fuel and kerosene; and working with developing countries and the International Energy Agency to address the difficult issue of fuel subsidies and associated budget, balance of trade and inflation pressures. These are responsible matters to be considered in the context of responsible policy.Given their 12 years in office, when many of the problems currently being experienced by motorists in this country were well and truly emerging - remember, oil and petrol prices were up by one-third last year - those opposite rather than being in permanent negative mode should instead adopt a more positive approach. Our argument is that what we need to do on the question of oil and petrol prices is have a range of short-, medium- and long-term measures. That is the responsible, long-term approach. I commend the forthcoming participation by the energy minister in that conference. We look forward to it, together with other international measures, assisting with the overall challenges which the global economy - every economy in the world - now faces with pressures on the global price of oil. When UK motorists today are paying something like $2.35 a litre, those in France are paying $2.95 a litre, we have protests and riots across Europe and we have protests also across our own East Asian hemisphere, this underlines the global dimensions of the problem. This government is fully participating in global responses to the problem and at the same time participating in national responses consistent with the overall challenge of dealing with the long-term price of oil and its impact on working families.</DOC>

 - I think it is important to look at the range of measures which we can deploy responsibly as a government in dealing with what is a global problem. Let us again put it into context: we have the greatest global oil shock the world has faced in 30 years. Therefore, a range of measures - short, medium and long term - are necessary to deal with it. I mentioned before, in my response to the question asked of me by the Leader of the Opposition, about additional global measures. One of those deals with the supply-side measures which will be addressed in part at the upcoming Jeddah conference, which the Minister for Resources and Energy will be attending. Others, on the global demand side, go to measures currently embraced by the International Energy Agency and the G8 to enhance energy efficiency measures in developing countries. When you have this huge surge in demand from China and India and the suck-in of oil from those two burgeoning economies, representing something more than 50 per cent of the overall increase in global demand for oil, it follows logically that that also is having an impact on what is occurring in the overall balance of supply and demand in the global oil market.There is a further factor, though, which I would draw honourable members' attention to, and that goes to increasing concerns across the international community about speculation - that is, excessive speculation within the oil industry itself and increasing evidence that some financial institutions may be trading in oil as an investment like shares and currencies. When we look at international action on these matters we have the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the CFTC, imposing position limits on West Texas Intermediate oil contracts on the London based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The new regulations are an attempt to limit excessive speculation on the price of oil, limiting individual positions in West Texas Intermediate oil contracts on the ICE Futures Europe, which holds up to 30 per cent of total trades. European authorities will also share trading data with their US counterparts to improve transparency.The IMF is also acting in this respect in response to a particular request from the G8. In response to a call from G8 finance ministers, the IMF is currently analysing the real and other financial factors behind the recent surge in oil and commodity prices, their volatility and the effects on the global economy, including the role of speculators. This is an important consideration, because when we look at the overall global analysis of what is a problem for all economies at the moment, whether it is the US Treasury Secretary or the G8 finance ministers, all have expressed deep concerns about this, as does the government of Australia. I quote here the US Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, who said most recently:All the evidence points to ... supply and ... demand as the main cause - of the surge in oil prices. He continues:'I think there's a danger that if people say 'all this is speculators' then we won't do what we need to do. We don't want to misdiagnose the problem.'In other words, it is a complex set of problems on the supply side and the demand side, but there is also an important consideration when it comes to speculation. Therefore, this government, in partnership with foreign governments, will be doing what we can through the councils of the international community to act consistently on the question of the impact of speculation on global oil markets and any artificial manipulation of the global oil price which may occur as a result. That is on the global action front.When it comes to local action, could I simply say this: I still remain puzzled as to why those opposite remain so ideologically opposed to Fuelwatch. The price of petrol in some Sydney service stations yesterday reached $1.70. We understand that yesterday in Sydney there was a difference of about 20c a litre between the lowest and highest petrol price. With those opposite, it depends on who you believe: the Leader of the Opposition or the member for Wentworth, who does not support the Leader of the Opposition's position on this, or the member for Aston, the campaign manager for the member for Higgins, who suggested a third new option when it comes to petrol policy - not 5c but 10c, depending on where you actually stand on this. It is always interesting to identify policy coherence on the part of those opposite.I go to the specifics of what is happening in Sydney at the moment, and I think it is very important that honourable members reflect on this. In South Strathfield yesterday you had a Vartex petrol station charging 164.9c per litre at 1.16 pm while at the nearby Coles Express, along the Hume Highway at South Strathfield, 155.9c per litre was being charged at 1.20 pm. That is a 9c a litre difference. That is in and around Strathfield.In Eastwood yesterday you had an Autodoc petrol station charging 164.9c per litre at 3 pm while the nearby 7-Eleven at Carlingford was charging 155.9c per litre at 12.16 pm. That is also a 9c a litre difference. Then we go to what is occurring in Mosman. In Mosman yesterday there was a BP petrol station charging 171.9c a litre at 1.46 pm, and the nearby 7-Eleven on the corner of Spit Road and Mitchell Road was charging 155.9c a litre at 1.40 pm. That is a 16c a litre difference. Therefore, simply in the space of yesterday in Sydney - given that we have had petrol prices go above 170c today in Sydney - we had in the single suburban areas that I have just referred to price differences of between 9c and 16c a litre. Across the whole metro area, that is some 20c a litre.We on this side of the chamber have this remarkably radical approach that we think consumers should have access to that information! That is our radical approach - we think that consumers should have access to that information. Those opposite are of the view that this should remain the unique property of the oil and petrol companies. Our approach therefore is that a competition policy approach is a very important addition to what is an overall big challenge in terms of families trying to balance the family budget at the moment. Having available data about where you can get the cheapest fuel on a particular day in your locality - that is what Fuelwatch is all about. Those opposite have once again sided with big oil and the big petrol companies and decided that that information should remain uniquely in their possession. We on this side of the House have a different approach, and that is that that information should be provided in a time-real manner to consumers so that they can make the best choices for themselves.When it comes to the difficult question of oil and petrol worldwide, we have a range of measures we will be pursuing as a government: those which apply at the global level concerning supply, demand and speculation; those which also are being considered by the Henry commission; and those which deal in the here and now with the impact of competition policy. These are responsible courses of action given the difficulty which consumers are facing at present in this important area. I contrast that again not just with the overwhelming avalanche of negativity on the part of those opposite but with an overall approach where they will say anything and do anything on the question of oil prices in order to achieve a cheap headline. That is what is governing policy on the part of those opposite. The Leader of the Opposition has one policy concerning 5c a litre. The alternative Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, says that he will not implement it. The campaign manager for the member for Higgins says that he would like to double the amount. What is the position of the opposition on this matter? Our approach is clear cut. The approach of those opposite is characterised not just by negativity but by absolute populism.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I am not aware of any comments yesterday to that effect. I would make a couple of points. I make the points that the Prime Minister made before. The fact is that we are in the middle of a third global oil shock and this is having a tremendous impact on working families and seniors who are trying to pay the bills and fill up the car.We understand the cost pressures on Australian families. That is why we have put additional assistance in our budget for seniors via the increased utilities allowance and it is why we are delivering the tax cuts from 1 July. We understand the pressures on working families. The opposition are terminally out of touch. We had a classic example in the House the other day where the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was turning her nose up at people who shop for specials. We are going to do everything within our power to assist families hit by the increased cost of living. It was central to our program at the last election and that is what we are delivering responsibly in our budget - a budget for which those in the Senate are irresponsibly trying to reduce the surplus. We will have responsible measures to assist Australian families and others who are hit by cost-of-living pressures and we will do it within a responsible budget. There is a very sharp contrast between those on this side of the House and those on the other side.</DOC>

 - I welcome the opportunity to address the very serious issues raised by the member for Dobell. Like many on this side of the House, he understands the complexities of this debate not only from the domestic point of view but also from a global point of view. On that note, I say not only to Australia but to the global community that the Jeddah energy meeting this Sunday is an opportunity for producing and consuming nations, in association with industry, to work towards finding a way forward to express our concern about the uncertainty and volatility of the global petroleum market at the moment. It also enables us to concentrate on the complexities of the debate and the serious issues which confront not only Australia but also the world at large. The facts are rather stark.The oil burden, as a share of global GDP, is fast approaching the level of the 1970s oil crisis, as are real oil prices. As we all know - and as I have expressed to the Prime Minister - there are no simple solutions and, more importantly, no one nation can shoulder the burden of record oil prices. There are five areas that I intend to raise on behalf of the Australian community to seek cooperation of like-minded nations at a Jeddah meeting. These include a need for the global community to urgently address the key issue of foreign investment restrictions. We all know in Australia how important foreign investment has been in the history of our development. We are a welcoming nation to foreign investment and I will rigorously pursue these issues at the Jeddah conference.Secondly, we will work with OPEC countries and encourage investment in additional spare production capacity - it speaks for itself. Thirdly, we will work to improve oil market data transparency. Transparency is the key to a freely operating market system. Fourthly, we will consider refining and other options for increasing middle distillate output, diesel, jet fuel and kerosene, which are exceptionally important to ongoing economic growth in the global community. Fifthly, we will work with developing countries and the International Energy Agency to address the difficult issue of fuel subsidies and associated budget, balance of trade and inflation pressures.While international oil companies are investing as fast as they can, the reality is that unfortunately there are many places in the world where oil is easier and cheaper to produce but access is limited. The important role for national governments such as our own is to work to allow the market to properly perform and remove regulatory impediments to investment and trade - something that Australia prides itself on. - Unfortunately it is something the member for O'Connor does not understand. We operate in a global market driven community. In the meantime, we need to work with the international oil companies and OPEC countries, to encourage them to invest as much as possible in additional production capacity. There is also a need to improve the quality of data available about reserves in OPEC countries and demand in the rapidly growing economies such as China. The non-OECD countries where economic growth is highest are also the most energy intensive. The fuels that are the key to economic growth are the middle distillates - diesel, jet fuel and kerosene. Demand for these fuels is growing much faster than for other refinery products. Refineries around the world have no spare capacity at the moment to increase their output of diesel and jet fuel.Also, these refineries have to cope with changes going to the availability of crude oil, changes which mean there is less potential at the moment for middle distillate production without more hydrotreating and coking. Middle distillates are also the fuels produced in gas to liquids and coal to liquids processes, something the government has spoken about over a considerable period and something the previous government unfortunately neglected as a serious debate.We as a nation will encourage producing nations and the international oil companies to accelerate the development of next generation gas-to-liquids and coal-to-liquids technologies that could reduce cost and, in the case of coal to liquids, improve its environmental credentials. That is why, just as in relation to coal fired power generation, the development of carbon capture and storage technology is important. I am pleased to advise the House that earlier this week the government introduced the carbon capture and storage legislation going to offshore storage of CO2.In conclusion, an international effort is required to address these important issues. I hope the Jeddah energy meeting will be a step in the right direction. Let us ensure that the global community does not waste this opportunity.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Our budget does strike the right balance between delivering for families and investing in the future. That is in stark contrast with what the opposition is up to in the Senate, where it is putting up its hands to vote for higher inflation and higher interest rates. Of course, there is a new development. It has decided to delay the introduction of the withholding tax. This is a real problem - and this has been identified by IFSA - because it may mean that this measure cannot be put in place in the next financial year. So this dramatic cut in the withholding tax, which will bring investment to this country, may not be able to be implemented for a year. This is another example of its economic vandalism. It simply beggars belief that the opposition wants to play politics with a measure as important as this.As I said before, our budget is a responsible budget that delivers for working families because it has lots of benefits for working families. There are those out there who think it is a good budget. In fact, this morning I found on a website some support for our budget. It described the budget as:_ a responsible budget that delivers for working families and invests in the future by (1) funding the substantial $55 billion Working Families Support Package, beginning a new era of responsible long-term investment to strengthen our economy to fight inflation and to meet future challenges.That is a glowing endorsement by any means. Whose website could this have been? It is a website that got a very substantial airing in a recent focus group. It is fantastic to see the glowing endorsement of our budget on the member for Wentworth's website. He is promoting our budget on his website. If our budget is good enough for his website, surely it is good enough to pass the Senate. The member for Wentworth is two clicks away from responsible economic management. He ought to walk up to the Senate and get his colleagues to support our budget.</DOC>

 - I have a copy of the budget papers as well. Isn't he a clever boy? -  - We know that inflation at the moment is 4.2 per cent - the headline rate and the underlying rate. The underlying rate is the highest in 16 years - the legacy of those opposite. They will not put up their hands and accept any responsibility for creating this problem. As I said in the House yesterday, they expect the Australian people to believe that somehow inflationary pressures only began at 9 am on 26 November last year. They did not. They left a legacy of high inflation for this government to tackle. We are out there tackling it and they are trying to sabotage it.</DOC>

 - The government has handed down a tight budget with a $22 billion surplus with the primary objective of putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. Inflation is running at 4.2 per cent - the highest in 16 years - and interest rates have risen 10 times in the last few years. It is true that the government's strategy is threatened - it is threatened in the Senate by the opposition. The opposition's response to the government's budget has been completely incoherent. The opposition have been entirely happy to complain about the effects of individual rising prices - whether of petrol, groceries or other things - but they refuse absolutely to engage in the debate about what the fiscal settings in this nation should be. They are content to express concern about the specifics of inflation but they refuse to say a single thing about the wider problem and they are endeavouring to nobble the government's attempts to come to terms with the inflation problem in the Australian economy.We have heard during the course of this year a variety of views expressed about the inflation problem by the opposition. First, we heard from the member for Wentworth that it was a 'fairytale' and then we heard that it was a 'charade' from the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the National Party at least was prepared to concede that there was an inflation problem, but, in true National Party style, his solution was to spend more money. At least he was honest! Then in more recent times the architect of these problems in the 2007 budget, the member for Higgins, said, 'Don't respond in an excessive way fiscally to the inflation problem.' And, of course, Senator Minchin, the former Leader of the Government in the Senate and my predecessor as finance minister, suggested that blocking budget measures in the Senate would not have an impact on the surplus.I have said in the chamber several times over the last few weeks that these activities by the opposition threaten to put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates, but it is important to underline the fact that there is another dimension to this issue. There is not just a short-term element to the wrecking activities of the opposition in the Senate on this because what they are doing also threatens to undermine the rebuilding of the nation's infrastructure into the long term. They clearly do not understand the short-term impact of eroding the budget surplus on inflation and interest rates, but they also clearly do not realise where the budget surplus is to be invested.You may recall, Mr Speaker, that the government announced in the budget that it would establish three separate infrastructure investments funds - the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund - for the purpose of rebuilding the infrastructure of this nation, to boost the productivity of the Australian economy and to elevate our economic capacity into the longer term. The primary reason we have taken this step is that the Reserve Bank over the last few years on no fewer than 20 occasions warned the former government that capacity constraints on the Australian economy were contributing to pressures on inflation and interest rates. Australia needs to expand its economic capacity and productivity to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates into the future as well and, incidentally, to reduce the urban congestion which is exacerbating the impact of high petrol prices on commuters in our major cities.Money taken from the surplus by the activities of the opposition in the Senate is money that will not end up in these funds. It is money that will not be available to be invested in the nation's universities, hospitals, roads, public transport and ports. These funds are headed towards long-term investment in the nation's infrastructure and the erosion of the surplus by the opposition in the Senate will reduce those funds accordingly. Those people in the community who may be inclined to support the approach that the opposition is taking in the Senate should perhaps bear this in mind: the money that is being knocked off the surplus by the opposition's activities in the Senate is money that could otherwise go to financing a major investment in public transport infrastructure in their area, an upgrade of a public hospital in their region or a new science wing at a university in their area. I urge the opposition to rethink their wrecking tactics in the Senate, to reconsider their refusal to engage in the wider economic debate in this country and to commit, along with the government, to investing in the future of this nation for the long-term prosperity of all Australians.</DOC>

 - As I said yesterday, we have inflation currently running at about 4.2 per cent, which is actually right. I think the key question, as touched on by the Treasurer before, is whether you think inflation is a problem or not. That is actually what is being debated here, and that is what is at stake. There is one side of politics which accepts that there is an inflation problem and there is another side of politics which says that it is a charade and a fairytale. The contrast is absolutely clear-cut. We are acting on the inflation challenge; those opposite are ignoring it.</DOC>

 - In news that may distress or delight, I will not be in parliament next week. It is happy news for some, but, hopefully, Mr Speaker, you will miss me. I will be attending the Australian-American Leadership Dialogue in Washington. It is the 16th dialogue. People would be aware that the Australian-American Leadership Dialogue has served an important role over many years now in building and reinforcing the people-to-people links across our two nations. The Australian-American Leadership Dialogue has always enjoyed strong support from both sides of politics and has always been attended by members from both sides of politics.The dialogue this year will be focusing on a number of contemporary challenges that face both of our nations. Those contemporary challenges include the international economic circumstances. They also include energy, security, international defence cooperation and the major challenge of climate change. I am aware that the dialogue staff working with the US State Department and members of the Bush administration have, in particular, been working hard on bringing the program together, and I thank them for that. The Australian-American alliance has been an enduring feature of this nation's foreign policy. It is supported by both sides of parliament, and our defence relationship with America is very important to us.But beyond our defence relationship, our economic ties, our cultural ties and, most importantly of all, our people-to-people ties bring our nations close together. The Australian-American Leadership Dialogue has played a strong and continuing role in those people-to-people ties. As members of the House may be aware, the dialogue does not just encompass politicians; it has always encompassed leading businesspeople, academics, social commentators and people who work in public policy. Once again, the dialogue in Washington next week will bring together a broad range of Australians meeting with a broad range of our American counterparts.I note that I will be attending the dialogue. I will be accompanied by the Minister for Resources and Energy, the member for Batman, who will also be attending with me. I will be accompanied in terms of the opposition, as I understand it, by the current shadow minister for foreign affairs, the member for Goldstein, and by one of my counterparts, the shadow minister for education, the member for Casey. I understand my immediate predecessor as Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Lyne, will be attending. I understand that the last Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Mayo, will be attending, and I understand that the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, will also be attending.Mr Speaker, should you decide at any point that my absence is distressing you, can I reassure you that in my absence the Prime Minister will be acting as the Minister for Education and will be continuing the implementation of the government's education revolution, and the Minister for Employment Participation will be acting as Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. So should it become necessary to update the House on the location of Work Choices propaganda, or indeed on manifestations of industrial relations extremism by the Liberal Party, the member for Gorton will be available for that purpose. -  - </DOC>

Then it was a fairytale. But did I just hear that inflation now is 'of central importance'? What power does the Crosby Textor focus group machine have? I would suggest to those opposite that it is really important to have a consistent policy.

 - I thank the member for Page for her question and for her very real concern for her pensioners and carers. She certainly understands, as the government does, that pensioners and carers are under significant financial pressure. Whether it is the bills they have to pay, whether it is the cost of petrol or groceries, we certainly understand that whether you are a pensioner or a carer it is hard to make ends meet. While we do understand that there is more that needs to be done in this area, the government is certainly making a start.From today bonus payments to carers and pensioners are starting to be paid. Four-hundred and thirty thousand carers and 2.7 million senior Australians will receive more than $1.8 billion in bonuses from the Australian government. Pensioners will receive a $500 bonus; recipients of carer payment and certain veteran carer pensions will receive $1,000. Carer allowance recipients will also be paid $600 for every eligible care receiver, and where possible these cash deposits will be made directly into bank accounts. Bonus recipients can be reassured that they will not have to pay tax on these bonuses and that the bonuses do not count as income for social security purposes.There is further good news this week for all those eligible seniors and carers who are going to be receiving the June quarter utilities allowance payment. They will be getting $125, their second instalment in the utilities allowance which, under this government, has gone up to $500 per year - a permanent increase. This is the first year that carers will be receiving the utilities allowance. This was an election commitment that we made and which we are now delivering on. The former government excluded carers from the utilities allowance. We do know that this is just the start and that more needs to be done. We also know that to get this job done properly we need to look at it comprehensively. That is why we have announced that the whole area of retirement income and support for carers will be part of the review of the tax and welfare system.I am also asked about other responses to these issues, and I have to say I am still trying to get a handle on the opposition's response to this issue. They do still seem to be all over the shop on the issue of pensions. We know, of course, that as far as the opposition leader is concerned he said not a word in his budget reply about pension levels. However, the day after this budget reply we had the shadow minister for ageing, the member for McPherson, out and about on the post-budget hustings telling anyone who would listen that the opposition would, in fact, be increasing the pension. On that same day we had the shadow Treasurer for the Liberal-National coalition intervening and stating very, very clearly that the opposition had a policy not to increase the pension. The shadow Treasurer, the member for Wentworth, actually said on Steve Price's show on 16 May: 'We have not got a policy to raise the base rate of the pension.' So you would have to say that that was pretty crystal clear - not much wriggle room.So I was very surprised to read in the Age today under the headline 'Nats in pension controversy':The coalition is again mired in conflict over the age pension, with the Nationals candidate in the Gippsland by-election defying his Coalition leaders.Darren Chester called for a $30 increase in the age pension at a candidates' debate yesterday.Yesterday he called for that when he knew full well that the shadow Treasurer for the Liberal and National coalition has said they have no policy whatsoever to increase the base rate of the pension. This really is taking this opposition leader's well-known policy flexibility to a higher level of excess. They have a policy, according to the member for McPherson. They do not have a policy, according to the shadow Treasurer. They do have a policy, according to the National Party candidate down in Gippsland. But, of course, once again we know that the shadow Treasurer is overriding all of that. It really is just getting beyond the pale with the Nationals' candidate playing very, very fast and loose with the truth, trying to say he has got a policy when he knows that he cannot deliver it. Unlike the opposition, this government is serious. We are delivering on the bonus payments. We are delivering the increase in the utilities allowance because we know how hard it is for seniors and carers to make ends meet.</DOC>

 - As I said yesterday, inflation is running at 4.2 per cent and I think what is pretty interesting in this debate is exactly - An opposition member -  - What about your forecast! - Of course the government stands by its forecast. What I think is really interesting is that it is not just the three positions we referred to before. If we go through the evolution of those opposite's position on inflation, the member for Higgins said last year: 'We have got inflation just where we want it.' That was in the middle of last year. That is when they went to those opposite and then said inflation was a fairytale. Then we moved to -  - Then we had this remarkable statement by the shadow Treasurer and prospective leader of the Liberal Party, the member for Wentworth, who said, on 17 March 2008, 'mission accomplished' on inflation -  - Then we had the member for Wentworth say that it was 'mission accomplished' as far as inflation was concerned - until we got to position number 5. And this number 5 today is that it is now of 'central importance'. That is where we have got to: charade, fairytale, central importance. What is pretty interesting, though, on the economic policy stakes is this - from the quite extraordinary website which the Treasurer referred to before - from the alternative leader of the Liberal Party, which advertises the budget of the Australian government. - We have this extraordinary website by the alternative leader of the Liberal Party which advertises the Australian government budget. It has on its front page, of course, the member for Wentworth's address on the budget at the National Press Club, but I do not see any reference to the actual budget reply by the Leader of the Opposition anywhere on the front page of this website - nowhere. There is a dog blog there but no reference to -  - The core debate here is: do you believe that inflation is a real problem and therefore what should government policy be doing about it? We on our side of the House have a clear-cut strategy; those on that side of the House do not have any such strategy. If those opposite in the middle of their interjections had heard what I said before, of course we stand by the budget forecasts.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question. I recognise his principled stand on these issues and, indeed, I am sure he would not mind me mentioning and recognising the principled stand that his immediate predecessor also took on these issues. As I noted earlier this week, some three weeks ago I introduced the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws - Superannuation) Bill 2008 When I introduced that legislation I made clear why the government had intended an implementation date of 1 July. Just to underline the significance of that intention to members, I refer to an email that I received on 15 May this year from Mr John Challis of the ComSuper Action Committee and a long-time campaigner for these reforms. He said:I'm very pleased that the entitlements for ComSuper death benefits will apply from July 1st, 2008. I only have to stay alive until then for my partner to be provided for; a great relief for an 80-year-old!I think that underlines the significance of the urgency in passing this legislation with that succinctly made point. Unfortunately, members would be disappointed to hear that the coalition followed through on its threat to delay the passage of this legislation by referring it to a Senate committee.I note, however, in today's media, that in a Sydney Morning Herald article titled 'Nelson's left flank goes to war over same-sex bill', it is reported that there was at least a partial backdown in an endeavour to dissuade Senator Sue Boyce from crossing the floor. If that is the case, I would congratulate Senator Boyce and I would also commend the member for Sturt and the member for Kooyong for also taking a principled position in this place by arguing for a 1 July commencement date.Many opposition members with all the best will in the world have supported backdating the legislation. I previously outlined the legal complications with that and the injustice of causing a hiatus in income, but it appears that even there the opposition is not consistent in its position because earlier this month the shadow Attorney-General was asked whether the opposition would agree to backdating and he said, 'I am not in a position to give that commitment because no such decision has been made by the coalition.' Again, the coalition on these simple, straightforward matters of principle - removing discrimination - is at sixes and sevens. I would again encourage those opposite to support the expeditious passage of this legislation. I would also commend those opposite who have taken a principled stand. I would encourage them to continue it; the struggle is not over.</DOC>

We have been responsible, we have been disciplined and we have been cleaning up the mess left by those over there, most particularly the member for Higgins and all of those that sat around the cabinet table, who went on an irresponsible spending spree. It has fallen to us on this side of the House to put some responsibility back into the budget. It is one that is recognised by the business community; it is one that is recognised by the Australian people. It is not recognised by those opposite because they have become utterly irresponsible.</DOC>

 - Tomorrow marks the first anniversary of the Northern Territory Emergency Response, and it is an important time for the House to soberly reflect on what progress has been made, both in the Territory and elsewhere, on the critical challenge of closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. As those opposite will know, the government supported the NTER in opposition and welcomes the current opposition's continued support, as the NTER continues to make some progress. Many families in remote communities are reporting that they feel safer because of the increased police presence, reduction in alcohol consumption, more night patrols and safe houses in communities. There are currently some 51 extra police serving in communities that previously had no police presence. That is a good thing. Then, 13,000 people are being income managed in 52 communities, and women in many of these communities say that the new income management arrangements mean they can buy essentials such as food and clothes for their kids. Shopping habits in licensed stores, we are advised, have changed: more is being spent on fresh food and sales of cigarettes have approximately halved. On the nutrition front, school nutrition programs providing breakfast and lunch for children in 49 communities have resulted in a small, but encouraging, increase in school attendance rates, and I think that is something which all members of this place would welcome.Over 11,000 child health checks have identified kids who require surgery. This is a very important finding. Follow-up treatment, including surgery, is underway. Audiology services have been provided to 669 children, non-surgical dental services to 350 children, 46 children have undergone ear, nose and throat surgery and 40 kids have undergone dental surgery. In addition to that, 200 additional teachers are being recruited over the next five years to educate 2,000 young people previously not enrolled, and that again is an important measure, though that is very much a measure in progress.The government is determined to move ahead in doing what it can to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and, consistent with what we said prior to the election, now that this intervention has reached its 12-month point, we will begin a process of formal review of the measures. That measure will take some months. We look forward to the findings of that formal review.In conclusion, when in February we in this place engaged in a bipartisan way on the national apology to Indigenous Australians, that was very much the first step. I think all of us appreciate that. - With respect to those opposite, including the member interjecting, I am seeking to make a bipartisan statement about a matter which I believe the Leader of the Opposition and I have a common interest. It is not only the prosecution of the national apology, which we did on a bipartisan basis in this place, but also a program which aims at closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I have said quite clearly before that the government, when in opposition, supported the intervention. I have said quite clearly before that the government appreciates the continued support of those opposite in this important area of endeavour. That is the spirit in which these remarks are being made.Consistent with the commitments by the government prior to the election, the review process is underway and we look forward to receiving those findings. On the question of the apology, I think we in this place would all agree it was but the beginning, and I think all of us in this place would regard ourselves as having a common objective, which is to do whatever we practically can, through the national government and through the state and territory governments of Australia, to bring about real, measurable, demonstrable progress on closing the gap in education, literacy and numeracy, health outcomes and security outcomes for Indigenous Australians. Today I have simply reflected on the fact that it is the one-year anniversary of the intervention and on the forward measures which the government is proposing both by way of review and continued action.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question about the tourism industry. The tourism industry is a very important section of the Australian community. It represents 480,000 directly employed Australians and it represents $22 billion in export earnings. I also appreciate that the tourism industry today is going through a huge challenge both domestically and internationally. We as a nation are not only facing the challenge of the strength of the Australian dollar, which is having a huge impact on traditional markets such as Japan whilst we try to seize opportunities in new markets such as China and India, but also facing the impact of the oil crisis on the cost of aviation. In the last 12 months alone, the cost of jet fuel has doubled. It is also interesting to note that, for the first time ever, the cost of fuel relative to labour costs in a labour intensive industry has now outstripped the cost of labour.It is in that context that the Australian government is going out of its way to assist the tourist industry, not only through the support of Tourism Australia and its endeavours to put in place a new marketing and creative advertising campaign but also through creating new opportunities through changes in the guidelines for the export market development program. This effectively means the program will no longer just be available to individual tourist operators. The changes are aimed at encouraging regional tourism organisations to work collectively to go beyond Australian shores to actively promote the opportunities in important regions such as the Gold Coast, Northern Queensland, the Hunter region of New South Wales and a number of other regions of Australia which are exceptionally important, because regional employment in the tourism industry is the key to a number of economies.We also appreciate that one of the big attractions for people coming to Australia is not only that they will have a terrific tourism experience but also that Australia is a nation which takes the fight against terrorism seriously. That means that, in terms of border control, we have to make sure that the government is well resourced financially to put in place the best possible organisational response to terrorism. - It is a very serious issue. I can also advise the House that one of the challenging issues confronting the tourism industry at the moment is inflation. The industry are not only experiencing the impact of oil prices, from both a domestic and an international point of view, but also seeing it feed in through increases in the price of food and beverages. They expect us to operate in an economically proper way - and, at a macro level, that is about taking on the fight against inflation. It is for that very reason that the Australian government made some very tough decisions in the recent budget aimed not only at guaranteeing that we deliver every election promise, including the changes to the export market development program, which are of major assistance to the tourism industry -  - I say for the information of the shadow minister that that idea actually came from consultation in Cairns during the course of last year - because we actually get around Australia and talk to tourism operators to work out how we can assist them with fundamental changes to policies to enable them to compete in a tough global market. I simply say in conclusion that we as a government will not only confront the international challenges but also put in place, for the first time in a long time, a new consultative process aimed at facing up to some of the supply-side issues which were neglected by the previous government and held the tourism industry back in recent times - fundamental issues such as infrastructure and the shortage of skilled labour in Australia, which are very much covered by recent budget announcements of the Australian government. -  - Yes, the tourism industry is important. I simply say to the honourable member that, unlike the opposition, the government has no short-term political stunts aimed at assisting the tourism industry in a very tough global world.</DOC>

 - As we mark the 50-day countdown to the Olympics opening ceremony, I was very proud this morning to join with the Prime Minister, as well as the shadow minister for youth and sport, to officially farewell athletes from the Australian Institute of Sport who have been selected for the Olympics and the Paralympics. We are all incredibly proud of the Australian Institute of Sport and its athletes, facilities and staff. It is a great testament to the AIS, which is regarded worldwide as the Harvard of sports academies, that around 200 of the 440 athletes in our Olympic team are expected to be current AIS athletes. In addition, some 24 of the Paralympic athletes so far selected are current or former AIS athletes.While many athletes have already qualified to live their dream, some are still to finalise their selection. As the pinnacle of so many careers is fast approaching, the nation certainly shares the sense of rising excitement and anticipation. We know that they will do Australia proud, as they always do, and that our sport-mad nation will be glued to our televisions cheering on our great athletes. Our government is well aware of the importance of sport and the Olympics to Australians. This year the Australian government has provided almost $216 million to the Australian Sports Commission, of which about $142 million is dedicated to achieving excellence in sport.In addition, we are working to protect the integrity of sport. The Australian government, through ASADA, has invested more than $1 million to ensure that the Australian Olympic team is subject to the most rigorous antidoping measures of all time. As announced earlier this year, for the first time in our history every member of our Olympic team will be tested before Beijing after a historic agreement between the government and the Australian Olympic Committee. This puts our country at the cutting edge of the world antidoping movement. To date, ASADA has completed more than 1,300 tests, covering around 92 per cent of potential Olympians, with around 200 of these samples placed in deep-freeze storage facilities for future testing with new science and new technology. We are firmly committed to protecting the integrity of Australian sport and contributing to global efforts to see international competition untarnished by doping.We all respect the dedication and discipline that our athletes display in order to represent our country on the world stage. I would like to pay tribute to their years of hard work, sacrifice and training. On this 50-day milestone, I am sure that we all wish all of our athletes well for their final days of preparation and for the challenges which lie before them in Beijing at both the Olympics and the Paralympics.</DOC>

As she also knows, the $12.9 million commitment that the government has made to the Water for the Future program is unparalleled in the history of approaches to this issue.

 - I thank the member for Throsby for her question and acknowledge her keen interest in the government's position on opposing the killing of whales. I will be leading Australia's delegation to the International Whaling Commission meeting in Chile, where I will introduce the Australian government's proposal for a new future for the International Whaling Commission - a proposal that has attracted strong support from like-minded nations. This proposal has three elements: internationally agreed cooperative conservation plans for whales; collaborative research programs; and reform of the management of science, including an end to the granting of special permits for so-called scientific whaling. These proposals are underpinned by firm commitments and real science, including an extra $1 million from the government for the Australian Marine Mammal Centre to continue its non-lethal research program and to establish international cooperative research programs and conservation management plans for the great whales of the Southern Ocean.Last Saturday I released a progress report on the global study I have commissioned of the science and economics of whale conservation. This study is bolstering our call for better protection of whales and providing important data to support our case at the IWC. Just this week members may have seen further scientific analysis of the threats climate change poses to whales - in particular, the potential impacts of shrinking Antarctic sea ice on whales' critical habitats. This accumulation of new and existing threats is the reason why we must do all we can and why the government is committed to bringing an end to commercial whaling in all its forms. It is an approach that recognises that it is not good enough to go through the motions - like the last 12 years of ritualised, lacklustre and unfocused policy under the Liberal Party and like the last 12 years of rhetoric and press releases which produced nothing. We accept the need to strive for reform of the IWC and to work both inside and outside the commission to increase the protection of whales. That is why we have embarked on enhanced diplomatic efforts and why we continue to pursue a range of actions the previous government never contemplated.I am surprised that the opposition is not supporting the Rudd Labor government's reform proposals, given we are the only nation with a constructive proposal of this scope on the table at the International Whaling Commission. I look at what happened on the previous government's watch and I see that the number of whales targeted by Japan more than doubled between 2004-05 and 2005-06. It doubled from 440 to more than 900, including a quota of endangered fin whales. That was on the previous government's watch, and that is where we find ourselves today. When the member for Flinders was trying to defend 12 years of inaction, he told the ABC on 15 January:Well, let's be clear that we won every vote in the International Whaling Commission year after year. - But that is wrong. For the record, we need to note that in 2006 anti-whaling countries, including Australia, lost a vote at the IWC - with a simple majority calling for a return to commercial whaling. - All the while, the number of whales targeted doubled between 2004-05 and 2005-06. - We are not pretending that the IWC engagement is going to be easy. - The government is not pretending that the International Whaling Commission engagement is going to be easier, but the government actually do have a policy for reform. We have a constructive approach we are bringing to the table. But all the opposition ever seems to do is to talk down Australia's prospects of success. All we have had from the opposition is negative or confused in approach and, when it comes to confusion, the member for Flinders could not wait for the Oceanic Viking to arrive in the Southern Ocean last January. In fact, he was pleading with the government on 16 January when he said the Oceanic Viking 'must now arrive to not only help monitor and protect the great whales of the south but also to help act as a balance and to keep the peace on the high seas'. Of course, the Oceanic Viking did undertake monitoring and surveillance in the Southern Ocean, something that was never achieved in the 12 previous years of the Liberal government. Then we had the member for Goldstein making his contribution on 15 June about the Australian government's action. He said:It has reduced our credibility, reduced our leverage, our negotiating position in trying to reach a diplomatic solution.I cannot think of a weaker message to be sending on Australia's commitment to whale conservation than what the opposition have been saying, with their confused actions, their negativism and their record of seeing the whale quotas increase by a considerable number on their watch.There is a lot of noise from members opposite because they recognise that their policy on this issue delivered absolutely nothing over 12 years. It is time for them to get serious and to resolve what they actually think about this issue and to look at the substantial engagement that the Rudd government has to get behind the strong proposals to refocus the International Whaling Commission on the conservation of whales - to come in with all of Australia as we chart a new course in the protection of these magnificent sea creatures.</DOC>

 - What distresses me about the question from the Leader of the Opposition is that there seems to be one party in Australian politics that is happy about the fact that there are constraints on global oil supply. There seems to be one party which celebrates the fact that there are difficulties in the overall supply situation - and that is the party opposite - because they see political advantage in it. What we have said consistently is that any responsible long-term approach to the challenge of global oil means dealing with global supply constraints. Furthermore, it means dealing with the demand-side challenges which exist internationally, dealing with alternative fuel strategy within Australia, dealing with greater investment in fuel-efficient vehicles, dealing with necessary long-term investment in public transport and dealing with those measures which assist the family budget to cope with the overall assault on that budget by rising petrol prices, rising food prices and rising rents and mortgages. This is the responsible long-term course of action, and it would be good if those opposite engaged in responsible debate about the long-term challenges for global oil rather than celebrating the fact that there are challenges when it comes to global supply.</DOC>

 - The government is pleased to have participated in the international oil summit in Jeddah over the weekend. This is a government which wishes to be a part of the solution to global oil, not just a part of the problem. We believe in making a positive contribution to dealing with what is the third-greatest oil shock we have seen in modern history and certainly the greatest shock since the 1970s. Governments around the world are struggling with the same challenge, which is why the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, supported by the government of the United Kingdom and other participating states, met in Jeddah over the weekend to discuss a range of matters on both the global supply side and the global demand side.Opening the conference, King Abdullah confirmed that Saudi Arabia had increased its daily production from nine million barrels to 9.7 million barrels. This increase in supply is an important step to put downward pressure on oil prices, but this will be a long-term process. It was welcomed by many nations. Australia was represented at the summit by the Minister for Resources and Energy, who called for action on the supply side, including investment in additional capacity, more efficient production technology and liberalisation of investment restrictions. All these measures are necessary if we are going to deal with longer term constraints to supply. If you look at successive reports by the International Energy Agency and others, our problem lies in the absence of effective levels and intensity of foreign direct investment in many of the world's oil-producing countries. As a result there is inefficiency of extraction and world's second-, third- and fourth-best practice when it comes to getting oil out of the ground and to customers. That is why Minister Ferguson was taking these important contributions to the conference. These sentiments were supported by many other countries and reflected very much in the summit's final communique. The communique recognised that 'an appropriate increase in investment, both upstream and downstream, is necessary to ensure that the markets are supplied in a timely and adequate manner'.The communique also recognised that supply would benefit from enhanced cooperation 'from oil-producing and consuming countries in investment technology and human resource development'. This is an important content of the communique, because of so much national political resistance on the part of OPEC states to liberalising their foreign investment regime. This does not solve all problems on that score, but it pushes the debate one step further in terms of getting greater access to those oil-producing states on the part of greater flows of foreign direct investment.The Jeddah summit also focused on demand-side initiatives to again assist in taking some of the pressure off global oil prices. The final communique called for 'energy efficiency to be promoted in all sectors through passing on market price signals, technology transfer and the sharing of best practices in energy production and consumption'. Australia welcomes global cooperation - the demand-side initiatives as well - especially efforts aimed at increasing energy efficiency.The Jeddah summit also recognised the need for transparency and regulation of financial markets to assist in combating the problem of speculation. The British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, addressed this matter in his speech to the summit. He said:While the price of oil is driven primarily by fundamental demand and supply factors, there has been a substantial growth in financial investor participation in the markets that may be exacerbating the underlying mismatch of supply and demand.The Australian government supports this view - that is why we support the recognition, in the summit's final communique, that the 'quality, completeness and timeliness of oil data should be enhanced with a view to improving market transparency and stability'.The Jeddah summit is one step forward in terms of greater global cooperation on the challenge of meeting what is a demonstrably global oil crisis. There is, however, much more work to be done. As I said in my answer to the earlier question from the Leader of the Opposition, it is critical that we act cooperatively globally with other states, particularly those responsible for the bulk of global oil production and supply. Working with developing countries such as China and India, which represent such a huge proportion of new global demand and therefore push up global prices for oil, is equally important. On the domestic front, it is important to invest appropriately in an alternative fuel strategy and a national energy security strategy for Australia - of a type we do not have and which the government did not inherit when it assumed office only six months ago. It is important that we invest in the future of fuel-efficient cars and public transport.It is also important that we deliver the measures contained in the budget to assist the family budget. A typical young family of mum, dad and two kids is, as a result of the budget measures, $52 a week better off, but, as a consequence of one of the four policies advocated by those opposite on the question of the price of petrol, that family would be $2.50 a week better off. The contrast, I think, is clear.</DOC>

 - One of the interesting things about those opposite in their consistent campaign of negativity on fuel prices is that they do not have sustainable long-term policies on this question. On the one they have put forward we now have four variations of it. We have that one put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. We have another one put forward now by the campaign director for the member for Higgins. We now have a new one put forward by the Leader of the National Party. Then we have the member for Wentworth's position, which is not (a) (b) or (c) above, and when the alternative leader of the Liberal Party assumes the leadership of the Liberal Party it will be 'tick the box' in terms of which of these particular measures might be embraced by those opposite.We have put forward a range of positive policies when it comes to dealing with families and individuals under financial pressure. We have also dealt in the policy domain on the question of fuel efficient cars. We have assisted where we can on the question of greater competition power for consumers. We have also established a petrol price commissioner to ensure that there is appropriate competition policy pressure applied to the oil producers.On the prices just mentioned by the honourable member in the framing of her question, I would simply draw her attention to remarks I made at the end of last week which referred to price variations in metro Sydney in one day of up to 20c a litre and of between 9c and 16c a litre in one suburb or in an area surrounding a suburb. The question I again put to those opposite is: should it not be the case that Australian motorists should have access through Fuelwatch to that information in a time-real way on the same day so that they can shop around for the best deal for petrol? That is what we offer. Those opposite choose to block that measure in the Senate because those opposite are standing on the same side as the big oil companies and against the interests of Australia's average motorist.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I join with the House in welcoming to the floor of the chamber the Indian Minister for External Affairs, Mr Mukherjee. Can I say how appreciative the government is that at this very busy time in Indian politics he has come to Australia for a stand-alone visit to have a formal Australia-India Foreign Ministers Framework Dialogue. This is the first such framework dialogue that Australia and India have had since 2005. The Australian government regards this framework dialogue with India as very, very important.In the first speech I made as foreign minister I made the point that Australia needs to take its relationship with India to a new level. We need to broaden and deepen our relationship with India. Not enough appreciation has been given to the rise of India. In this century, in my view, Australia needs a new relationship with India for a new century. Coming as I do from Western Australia, we tend to look west more often. Now, just as India is looking east with its 'look east' foreign policy approach, so Australia must also look west.This morning Minister Mukherjee and I have had a very, very productive framework dialogue, traversing the depth and breadth of the bilateral relationship, our engagement in regional forums and our approach internationally. When you look at our relationship with India it covers not just economic matters. It is the case that in the last half dozen or so years our economic engagement, led by minerals resources, our trade and our investment, has increased exponentially. This has set the scene for further developing our educational and scientific links, our biotechnology links, our people-to-people links. It has also set the scene for moving the relationship to a new level in the areas of security, strategic, defence and counterterrorism cooperation. One of the very good conversations we had today was about strengthening those links. So the potential is there for Australia to take its relationship with India to the front line of its international partnerships. This is something which has not occurred in the past.It is a matter of regret, I think, that over the last 30 or so years Australia has underappreciated its relationship with India. This is not something we can do for the future. We now need to take our relationship with India to the front line of our international partnerships. In addition to the six other ministerial visits to Australia this year, the External Affairs Minister Mr Mukherjee's visit is the seventh by a minister to Australia, and we welcome this very much. One of the meetings was between the Minister for Trade and his Indian counterpart, Mr Nath, where we agreed that we would conclude the feasibility study for a free-trade agreement by the end of this year - another important aspect of our relationship with India.A wide-ranging communique has been published, but I just draw the attention of the House to some of the announcements effected today as part of that first framework dialogue since 2005. Firstly, the minister and I signed formal treaties so far as extradition and legal mutual assistance are concerned. Secondly, we agreed to step up our strategic and security dialogue by having regular annual talks between the chiefs of our defence forces. Thirdly, we have agreed to strengthen our intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation. Fourthly, we have established a working group on visas, passport and consular matters, with a particular eye for the very large number of Indian students in Australia. Fifthly, we have established a new Australia-India Roundtable. And finally, we have extended our dialogue on food security and industry security matters and on effecting public sector linkages on climate change and water dialogue. These are all significant aspects of our bilateral relationship.So far as regional or international aspects are concerned, I again confirmed to Minister Mukherjee the Australian government's position that when the APEC moratorium ceases in 2010 India should become a member of APEC and I again repeated, both privately to Mr Mukherjee and publicly, Australia's very strong view that the United Nations Security Council should be reformed to reflect the modern day, not the 1940s and 1950s, and that India should be a permanent member of any such reformed Security Council. It is absolutely essential in the course of this century that Australia takes its relationship with India to a new level, that we take our relationship with India to the front line of our international partnerships, and that is what this government, with a willing partner in the government of India, will do.</DOC>

 - The first thing I would say is that the member for Wentworth committed the then government in July last year to the inclusion of the transport sector within the emissions trading scheme. That is the first point. As the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources in the Howard government he said that the transport sector should be included in the emissions trading scheme. That is point one. Is that still the position of those opposite? Is it? I take it by the particularly embarrassed silence of the member for Wentworth that there is a bit of ambiguity about this these days. -  - As the interjectors say, it takes a little more than that to embarrass the member for Wentworth. On the question of emissions trading, we on this side of the House know a simple fact and it is this: the economic cost of inaction on climate change is far greater than the economic cost of action on climate change. We, the government of Australia, are committed to acting responsibly on this matter into the long term; those opposite fiddled for 12 years and said that they had to act on this, to act responsibly, to move themselves into the appropriate international negotiations and to advance the domestic debate on the question of an emissions trading scheme. It was only at five minutes to midnight when their market research demonstrated that they had a problem with their score that we had this flurry of activity. We suddenly had a commitment to do something on an emissions trading scheme. They committed to that. Secondly, as a government they committed to the inclusion of the transport sector.Thirdly, the party of flip, flop, flap do not know where they stand on the emissions trading scheme. We have a clear-cut course of action which is as follows: having assumed government only six months ago - those opposite had 12 years to act - we have indicated that we will be developing a government green paper in response to the initial report delivered by Professor Garnaut. Towards the end of the year we will deliver a white paper in response to that. But I say to those opposite: they have now signalled quite plainly that they are committed to running a scare campaign on climate change. They have committed to running a scare campaign on the emissions trading scheme. They have committed to running a scare campaign because they do not have policies for the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Before I turn to the question of Zimbabwe, I add my words of welcome to those of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the Indian Minister for External Affairs, the Hon. Pranab Mukherjee, who is present in our chamber. You, Sir, are a welcome guest in our country and we look to the further expansion of our relationship with the world's largest democracy.Honourable members - Hear, hear! - On the question of Zimbabwe, honourable members will be aware that the President of the Movement for Democratic Change, Morgan Tsvangirai, announced that he and his party would not be contesting the presidential run-off election in Zimbabwe due on 27 June. In a statement Mr Tsvangirai said that his party could not ask the people of Zimbabwe to cast their votes on 27 June 'when that vote could cost them their lives'. This is how desperate and dangerous the situation has become in Zimbabwe, where the leader of the alternative government in Zimbabwe is saying to his supporters that they should not go out and vote because, effectively, there has been a gun put to their head. That is how disgraceful the situation in Zimbabwe has become under Robert Mugabe.We recognise that Mr Tsvangirai made his decision because a free and fair election in Zimbabwe would not have been possible. The Mugabe regime has recently decided to restrict the monitoring of the 27 June election to a level that would have removed any possibility of effective international scrutiny of this poll, and the regime has been escalating its campaign of violence against the MDC and its supporters. MDC members and supporters have been murdered, detained and tortured. Most recently, President Mugabe said that the MDC would never rule Zimbabwe and he was prepared to go to war to prevent them from doing so. That is of itself an extraordinary statement from a man who pretends to be running a parliamentary democracy. He is not; he has become a dictator.Let us not forget that Morgan Tsvangirai received the most votes in the first round of the presidential elections held on 29 March, and the MDC won the majority of parliamentary seats that were contested at those same elections. There can be no legitimacy to an election stolen by the Mugabe regime through violence and terror. The Australian government condemns the violence and brutal intimidation by the regime. We call on President Mugabe to stop this violence. The people of Zimbabwe must be given the chance to express their free will. The people of Zimbabwe deserve the free expression of that will so that they can give their great country a chance for the future. They must be given a chance to do so free from fear.The international community must continue to pressure the Mugabe regime to stop violence. We welcome the UN Security Council debate on Zimbabwe in New York today. We strongly support a full debate on the situation now in Zimbabwe. Regionally, the Southern African Development Community and the African Union have also made statements on this matter. We welcome the statements made by a number of African leaders in recent days expressing their deep concern about recent events in Zimbabwe. Australia will continue to support their efforts. We will also maintain whatever we can by way of bilateral pressure on the regime in Harare. Since 2002 Australia has had a range of restrictions on contact with Zimbabwe: restrictions on visas for travel to Australia by Zimbabwean ministers and certain Zimbabwean officials; freezes on financial assets; suspension of non-humanitarian aid; prohibition of defence links; suspension of bilateral ministerial contact; the downgrading of cultural links; and a ban on adult students of sanctioned individuals from studying in Australia.We encourage other countries to extend similar levels of sanctions. We are actively considering what further measures may be taken to pressure the Mugabe regime, including revising our list of regime members to whom restrictions apply to ensure that new figures in the regime are covered by that schedule as well. At the same time we continue to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe. It is not their fault that they have the regime that has been imposed on them. In 2007-08 we will provide more than $13 million to Zimbabwe, most of which is for essential food to be delivered through the World Food Program.I believe all members of this House are united in their condemnation of the regime in Zimbabwe. The situation in Zimbabwe is grave and it is becoming worse. The Australian government along with the international community condemns the regime's actions and commits to providing ongoing assistance to the people of Zimbabwe, the victim of their own government's brutality.</DOC>

 - I am surprised that the Leader of the National Party when he was a minister in the previous cabinet did not put that question to the minister for the environment who then (a) supported the introduction of an emissions trading scheme and (b) said that the transport sector should be included. What policy are we now debating against those opposite - the one last year or the one this year? This government intends to proceed responsibly to ensure that we maintain Australia's global economic competitiveness to ensure that Australian working families and individuals are supported through any transition which occurs in the economy. They were our principles in the past and will continue to be our principles in the future - unlike those opposite. I say to each one of them as they embark now on day one of their orchestrated fear campaign on the emissions trading system: a fear campaign is what it is and those opposite know it. - The member for Flinders stands in this place as the alternative minister for the environment. On the question of climate change, the world at present is debating how we deal with global warming: how we bring down carbon emissions into the future; how we do that in concert with other nation states around the world; how we do so as a full participant in the global negotiations on this question; how we do so responsibly in terms of the interests of working Australians as well as Australia's businesses; and how we do that in an appropriate, considered and deliberative fashion. In six months this government has made more progress on these matters than those opposite did in 12 years. They should hang their heads in shame as they embark upon the next fear campaign by the Liberal Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, because next Tuesday week is a very big day for working families in this country. It is the day we begin tipping the scales in their favour. In coming weeks households can look forward to significant financial relief with cost-of-living pressures. A typical young family will be $51.54 per week better off as a result of budget initiatives which will kick in next financial year. Aged pensioners and seniors are receiving their $500 bonus over the next week, and the next instalment in the new $500 utilities allowance is due to be paid in the next fortnight.On this side of the House we do understand that all of those people - seniors and working families - are under price pressures, are under cost-of-living pressures, unlike those opposite who are just playing petty political games. When they were in government they had their opportunity to do something about these cost-of-living pressures, and they did nothing. In fact they said that working Australian families had 'never been better off'. That is what they said. This side of the House is determined to push ahead with tax reforms outlined in the budget, which will provide $46.7 billion of personal income tax cuts over the next four years. For a taxpayer earning $50,000 a year, the tax cuts will deliver an additional $19.23 per week from 1 July 2008. This will increase to $25 a week from 1 July 2009 and $33.65 from 1 July 2010. When they are fully implemented they will amount to a 20 per cent reduction in their tax bill.In addition to that, they will receive some relief because we have increased the Medicare surcharge threshold, something opposed by those on that side of the House. They have the hide to come in here and say that they are in favour of relief and oppose this measure in the budget; so they have no credibility here at all. For a single taxpayer earning just over $50,000 a year, the Medicare levy surcharge will result in a further saving of around $500 on their tax bill.In addition to that, we have the education tax refund. Was that supported by that side of the House?Government members - No! - No. In addition to that, we also have $1.3 billion for the 50 per cent childcare tax rebate. Was that supported by that side of the House?Government members - No! - Of course it was not. These will deliver very significant benefits to working Australian families. Help is on the way. We understand cost-of-living pressures. Those opposite do not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question and his very strong support for pensioners in his local area. Like the member for Dawson, the government certainly does understand that pensioners are doing it tough and are facing very significant cost of living pressures. While we certainly know that there is more to be done, we have made a start. Last week I did inform the House that 2.7 million senior Australians are now beginning to receive $1.8 billion in bonuses from the Australian government so that, by the end of this month, pensioners should have received a $500 bonus - in most cases, directly into their bank accounts. They are also receiving a $125 June quarterly utilities allowance, which of course this government has increased from $107 a year to $500 a year. As I said, the government certainly knows that it is important to be acting to support the needs of pensioners and other Australians, but we also know that more needs to be done. We will be looking very carefully at how to do that through our tax and welfare review.As far as responses are concerned, we in our office have certainly been pleased to have been receiving the calls and cards from pensioners and carers who have received their payment so far. One caller, I am very pleased to inform the House, actually rang to say that the bonus payment had arrived on his 66th birthday and it was the best present ever. Another was off to buy some new clothes. -  - Last week I updated the House on the opposition's ever-evolving response, and I am pleased to hear the opposition. They might have some further ideas from the ones that we have heard so far. Last week I indicated a number of positions we had already heard from the opposition about this very important issue of pension levels. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition had nothing to say about this in his budget reply, even though at the same time we had the opposition spokesperson on ageing out there saying that she did support an increase in the level of the pension.The shadow Treasurer, of course, made it absolutely plain - absolutely crystal clear - on the radio that the opposition had no such policy. This is the shadow Treasurer's view:We have not got a policy to raise the base rate of the pension.Of course, that did not stop the Gippsland Nationals candidate from misleading pensioners and pretending that the coalition would in fact raise pension levels, in a heartless attempt to mislead voters in that by-election. You would think that the Nationals leader might have got out there, like the shadow Treasurer, and tried to correct the record. But, no, the Nationals leader did not do anything of the kind. At least the shadow Treasurer had the courage to get out there and say what the true policy is. But not the Nationals leader; he was out there yesterday on ABC television fuelling the misrepresentation. This is what he had to say on ABC television yesterday:Now we expect our candidates and our members to be proposing new ideas and he's made it clear that he will be bringing that idea to Canberra.Jim Middleton from the ABC asked:But is it an idea, or a policy?Mr Truss answered:Well he's indicated that's a priority for him in Gippsland ...The Nationals leader does not have the bottle to actually front up and tell the people of Gippsland that the coalition policy - the Nationals policy and the Liberal policy - is in fact to not increase the pension. So what the people of Gippsland want to know is the truth. What the people of Gippsland want to know is whether this is coalition policy or not. What we know from the shadow Treasurer is that it is not their policy. It is not the policy, and the Nationals leader should have the courage, should have the bottle, to get out there and tell the truth.Unlike the opposition, this government is paying the bonuses, is increasing the utilities allowance and is making sure that pensioners and carers actually get the increased support that they need.</DOC>

 - I begin by saying this: 12 years. The previous government had 12 years to act on a national broadband network, and after this government has been in office for six months, it is all our fault. When I last looked at the OECD data toward the end of last year I seem to recall that in terms of available bandwidth measures and band speed measures, we were languishing somewhere between the Slovak and Slovenian republics. That is where those opposite, after being in government for 12 years, landed Australia and the Australian economy at the time of the change in government.We have committed to establishing a national broadband network. We regard this as the information highway of the economy of the 21st century. We believe in investing in the future. That is why the government has in fact created three significant funds - the Building Australia Fund of $20 billion; we have established the Education Investment Fund of $11 billion; and we have established a health investment fund of $10 billion - because we believe in investing for Australia's long-term future. Broadband is a part of it.It leaves those of us on this side of the House absolutely speechless that those opposite, who have so demonstrably left our broadband network in such disrepair, could now stand up and weep crocodile tears over it. They stand condemned.</DOC>

 - This government has built a very strong budget surplus - $22 billion - to fight inflation and put downward pressure on interest rates; it is called responsible economic management. - It is a responsible surplus that will put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. It is the sort of responsibility we have not seen from those on the other side. We now have a delay in the Senate and that is going blow something like a $284 million hole in that surplus. They are completely irresponsible.We had an announcement from the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply that he was going to cut some money from the fuel excise. And of course last week we had the member for Aston - the prime supporter on the backbench of the member for Higgins - deciding that he wanted to double it. Then on Sunday we had the leader of the National Party saying that he was going to quadruple it. But of course we know that the member for Wentworth has never supported it at all. On one day they want to cost the budget $1.8 billion, on the next day it is $3.6 billion, and on the following day it is $7.2 billion. All we are getting from those opposite is uncosted proposals.They have worked out how to announce a policy, but they have not worked out how to cost a policy. They have not costed any of their policies. On this side of the House we have a government that is responsible. It has built a strong surplus to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. On the other side of the House we have a body of people who have put forward uncosted, unfunded proposals that put upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.</DOC>

 - There they are, the party of the Iraq war and of Work Choices. They have not changed their stripes one bit. They have also indicated by their votes in this place that, should they win the next election, guess what will be back? Work Choices. And if they win the next election what will be back? AWAs. They have not changed their stripes on any of this.It has been clear-cut in the government's position on industrial relations that we will establish a fair and flexible industrial relations system for the future of this nation. We believe in tipping the scales in favour of working Australians, which is why we have done what we have through the budget measures. A typical young family will be some $52 a week better off, against the $2.50 a week that those opposite offer in part, depending on who you believe on their excise policy. Secondly, and critically, to help working Australians under financial pressure we have changed the industrial relations laws of Australia so that everyone - not just some people - will have their rights protected. This government stands by the industrial relations changes that we have made. They are in the interest of working Australians and working families, and the last time I looked they were fully endorsed by the Australian people at the last election.Of course we will monitor closely what happens in relation to the Qantas dispute. There has of course been a range of disputes with Qantas over the years and a lot of difficult negotiations. We will watch this closely. We understand fully the impact on the airline and the services it provides to Australians and to Australia's tourism industry, which has been doing it very tough recently. That is why the government in part has decided to back the Queensland government in the measures it has adopted in support of the tourism industry in Queensland. On that question, I thank the member for Leichhardt for his strong representations for the tourism interests of North Queensland in particular.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. The government has put in place a tough budget with a strong surplus of nearly $22 billion with the primary purpose of putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. That is the critical focus of the government's fiscal policy. It is true to say that there are threats to the government's fiscal policy, primarily coming from the opposition, especially manifested through their control of the Senate for the remainder of this month. The immediate response from the opposition to the government's budget was to announce a range of positions and commitments that, had they been implemented, would have blown a $22 billion hole in the government's budget surplus over four years. The opposition's position has been changing on almost a daily basis. Almost every time the Leader of the Opposition hops up to speak there is another announcement, another statement and another indication of more free money for anybody who wants it. It is getting so bad that it is pretty hard to keep up.Just when I thought it could not get any worse, lo and behold - you can always rely on them! - up pops the National Party. We know that the Leader of the Opposition indicated that he intends to cut the fuel excise - a promise he will never be able to deliver - then last week we had the member for Aston indicate that he wanted to double the cut in fuel excise that the Leader of the Opposition was promising. Not to be outdone, though, on the weekend, the Leader of the National Party indicated he wanted to quadruple the amount. Needless to say he gave no indication of where the money might come from, no indication of how many billions of dollars a year or how big a hole would be blown through the surplus, and no indication of what savings initiatives or indeed tax increases would be put in place to pay for it. After all, this is the man who indicated in February that the solution to Australia's inflation problem was for the government to spend more money; this is the leader of the party that gave us Regional Partnerships. So perhaps we should not be that surprised. I have something of a soft spot for the National Party. -  - I know that is a bit embarrassing to admit, but I do. I actually once handed out how-to-vote cards for the National Party. I would hasten to add that I was 10 years old at the time and they were a fair dinkum outfit called the Country Party in those days, whereas now, what have we got? The bedraggled, dishevelled, disgruntled little crew up there in what used to be 'cockies corner' is now 'farmer's phone booth'. There are hardly any of them left. They cannot even get the Liberal Party to take them over!An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - I have a word of advice for the Leader of the Opposition. He has problems taking advice from his shadow Treasurer, the member for Wentworth, who clearly has other matters on his mind. The last thing he should do is take financial and fiscal advice from the National Party. The phrase 'sound fiscal management' and the words 'National Party' are rarely found in the same sentence. We are committed on this side of the House to delivering a strong budget with a very substantial surplus that is designed to get inflation under control, to get prices under control and to put strong downward pressure on interest rates. The opposition, including the National Party, are spending all of their time wandering around Australia promising things left, right and centre that they have no hope of ever being able to implement or ever being able to afford.</DOC>

 - It is because we have such respect for the CDF that we reappointed him as the Chief of the Defence Force. He is a fine man and he is doing a fine job as head of the Defence Force. It is one of the reasons why we have also continued, of course, the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Michael L'Estrange, in his position. It is one of the reasons why we have not conducted a Night of the Long Knives against Public Service heads, like those opposite did when they assumed office in 1996. We actually believe in the Westminster system. I am reliably informed by officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet that when cabinet met in a previous age - that is, six months ago - from time to time cabinet might have run a bit late and sometimes officials were kept waiting. It is part and parcel of the process of a busy cabinet schedule. Nothing has changed as far as these arrangements in the government are concerned. Mr Speaker, I draw your attention to the core principle here. Do we respect the independence of the Public Service? Have we maintained the heads of the Commonwealth agencies? When those opposite assumed office, they took out the revolver and shot them one by one by one, creating a climate of fear in the Public Service. That is not the way in which this government proposes to govern.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note that he takes a very keen interest in the opportunities for Australia to advance its economic security through trade, which is in contrast to the other side that have not in this new parliament asked one question on trade, let alone on the Doha Round. Doha is important to conclude. It is doable but it is a very difficult process. It is something that eluded the previous government for seven years. I remind the House that the last time we achieved an outcome in the WTO was under a Labor government, and we are desperately determined to ensure that we achieve an outcome under this government. Why is that important? - It is important because trade actually matters. Over the last 50 years world trade has grown three times faster than world output. Each new round in the WTO, or previously the GATT, has produced a new impetus. This is why the previous government was so neglectful in using its position as chair of the Cairns Group to advance this interest. It has achieved nothing on this front for the past seven years.When you think of it, if world trade is growing at three times the rate of world output, it translates to jobs, it translates to a better current account and it translates to a circumstance in which this nation secures its economic future beyond the resources boom. The other side was content to ride the resources boom rather than secure a future beyond it.As for the steps that have been taken over recent weeks to secure this outcome, I participated in an APEC meeting in Peru followed by an informal meeting of trade ministers in Paris a couple of weeks ago. Importantly, the outcome of both of those meetings gave new impetus, new authority and a new direction to the negotiators in Geneva to move to conclude the round. And over the last fortnight there have been intensive discussions over the phone with many of my ministerial counterparts to achieve that objective.The truth is we are at a crunch point in these negotiations. If we do not conclude the round this year, my fear is that the Doha Round will go into a long-term drift - and that is not in anyone's interest. So every effort must be made to ensure that we take advantage of the political will and the momentum that is there, and, in using the G8 meeting that the Prime Minister will be attending, to drive home the importance of this point of concluding the round.The truth is, with world food prices where they are, this is the best time that we have ever had to get agricultural subsidies down. If we cannot get them down at a time in which growers are receiving the best prices - An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - I notice the comment in the gallery. Let me say -  - that the opportunity that will present itself if we can get the subsidies dropped - An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - If we can reduce the subsidies in the United States that compete with the grain growers - An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - this will be a great outcome. This is the best opportunity ever to achieve that end.I might say in conclusion that, as important as concluding the Doha Round is, it will not be the end of where we need to take the trade agenda. It will provide the new basis, a new platform, on which we can engage the regional architecture as well as the bilateral relationships. The commitment of this government is to do everything necessary to conclude this round because it is in the interests of securing the economic future of this nation and doing it in a way that secures it beyond simple reliance on a resources boom.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. She has been long respected for her role in promoting human rights both within Australia and internationally. Some four weeks ago I introduced the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws - Superannuation) Bill 2008. As members are aware, that bill has been delayed as a result of reference to a Senate committee looking at in particular, among other issues but paramount, the issue as to whether it should be extended to people in a close personal relationship.That is despite the fact that, as reported in an article written by Phillip Coorey of the Sydney Morning Herald on 20 June:In August last year, cabinet - of which the opposition leader was, of course, a member - ... decided against including interdependent couples because it was too hard to quantify how many there were. It was estimated that including interdependents would add between $1.8billion and $10billion to the unfunded superannuation liability.As Mr Coorey indicates, from the other side of the coin:Some people would also be worse off. Two elderly sisters each on a single pension would earn less if classified as a couple.It appears that, indeed, the shadow Treasurer, according to a report in the Australian on 6 June by Patricia Karvelas, also confirmed that decision. He is reported to have told the Convener of the ComSuper Action Committee, John Challis:... it was impossible to calculate the costs and that the Coalition would not include interdependent couples in reforms.It seems that the opposition's position on this matter, and in particular the reference to a Senate committee, has more to do with political procrastination to avoid an issue of some internal political embarrassment. But, fundamentally, what we are talking about here is a matter of principle. It is no more and no less, as I have indicated, than removing discrimination against a group of fellow Australians who have been discriminated against for far too long. We are aware that many opposite support that principle of removing the fundamental issue of discrimination. We encourage them and we urge them to stand up for the expeditious passage of this legislation.</DOC>

 - The farm sector in Australia is doing it particularly tough because of the impact of oil prices and petrol prices. I again draw the attention of those from the farm sector who are listening to the broadcast to one important fact which is of direct relevance to the farm sector - that is, the future of Australia's wheat industry. The Liberal Party of Australia voted with the Australian Labor Party, this government, to pass the new arrangements for the export of Australian wheat, and the National Party opposed. It is very important that some of those opposite do not wish to debate or discuss this - they are split right down the middle on the future of this critical $4 billion export crop. It should be placed on the record that the Liberals voted with Labor against the Nationals on this reform for the future.The second point is this -  - In our discussions with farm organisations, not only have they been concerned about the future of the wheat export industry; they are concerned also about their farm input costs. They are concerned about the cost of fuel. They are concerned about the cost of fertilisers. I have some news for those opposite. These concerns did not mysteriously materialise on 3 December last year. In my own discussions with representatives of the farm sector in recent years -  - The honourable member for Riverina will know this full well - the representations that all of us have received is that the cost of fertiliser has been ballooning for not just many weeks, for not just many months but for many years. It is a huge impact on the overall cost structure of farmers out there who are doing it tough, trying to earn a living off the land at a time of enormous change. In particular, the change is affecting rural Australia coming off the worst drought in the century and the rolling impact of water.My colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is in close consultation with farm organisations - An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - together with his Liberal Party colleague, particularly on the wheat sector. That may be disconcerting to those opposite, to all those Liberal Party members in regional areas who voted with the Labor government to change the single desk - I know it is painful for that to be said - but my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has been in active consultation with rural organisations about their cost structures and, furthermore, about the future of the farm sector.An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - We intend to work with the rural sector through their peak industry organisations. I draw the attention of honourable members opposite to the response by the National Farmers Federation and others to the government's budget as it relates to the rural sector and in particular to the farm sector. We intend to cooperate with that sector into the future.</DOC>

 - I appreciate the fact that the Council of Australian Governments invokes such mirth on the part of those opposite, but it actually is the best vehicle available to the national government to prosecute real, lasting, microeconomic reform. This government is committed to a program of economic reform. Those opposite shake their heads because they do not believe that economic reform is important. This government is committed to building a stronger, fairer Australia capable of dealing with the challenges of the 21st century. When it comes to the economic challenge it is this: first, a policy of responsible economic management, and that is why we are committed to a $22 billion surplus as opposed to a $22 billion raid on the surplus by those opposite, because we know what happens then - it puts upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates, upward pressure which working families and businesses across the country, including in the farm sector, cannot cope with. That is responsible economic management. The second principle is a program of economic reform. Economic reform died under the previous government. Economic reform was not prosecuted through the councils of the Federation. When it comes to economic reform, ensuring that we are creating the platform for long-term productivity growth is one of the hallmark considerations of what any national government of Australia should be about. We know that productivity growth has been in some strife in recent years, and as a consequence it is important for us to look at the long-term platforms for rebuilding long-term productivity growth.How do we go about doing that? Firstly, we invest in an education revolution: we invest in education, skills and training to make sure that the next generation of Australians and this generation of Australians have the skills necessary to globally compete and to ensure that our firms remain at the cutting edge of the global economy. Beyond the education revolution, we also need in this country a radical new national investment in infrastructure. That is why this government has established not only the Education Investment Fund of $11 billion for the future but also, for the first time in the nation's history, an infrastructure fund of $20 billion - the Building Australia Fund - because we believe in ensuring that this country's long-term infrastructure has the national government investing in it as well. We are not playing a blame game as those opposite, including the member for Paterson, simply choose to do - blame the states and territories while nothing happened. That is the second element of an economic reform program.The third element is how we deal with a complex set of regulations which currently stands in the way of businesses across this nation in the challenge of building their businesses from small businesses to medium businesses and to large businesses operating across the nation. That comes to the whole challenge of how we build a seamless national economy. How do we create a seamless national market? For 12 years in office those opposite sat back and could not reflect on the enormous cost impost on business of having this plethora of regulations affecting businesses, and it leaves those of us on the side of the House speechless. Calls by the Business Council of Australia and by the peak industry bodies over such a long period of time to act in this regard were clarion clear. Those opposite did nothing about it. This government, through the Council of Australian Governments, has embarked on a program of regulatory reform through the Business Regulation and Competition Working Group, which is chaired by the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. Currently we have on the agenda 27 areas of regulatory reform - 27 areas of reform which should have been done and dusted by those opposite at least in the first five years that they were in office. Certainly in their 12 years of office, you would have thought that some progress would have been made.On the question of what reforms are being demanded by business across the country, occupational health and safety laws, business name registration and trades licensing are all important to reduce the inconsistencies which are unnecessary between state and territory jurisdictions and to make it easier for the free movement of capital and the free movement of labour across this national economy. The Productivity Commission has already calculated what a great yield to overall gross domestic product and economic growth would come about as a consequence of this. That is why this government recognises that the Council of Australian Governments is the vehicle for handling these challenges for the future. It was ignored by our predecessors and is embraced by us because we want to see reform of specific purpose payments. We also want to see a reform of the way in which the Commonwealth makes payments to the states more generally. We want to see reform which encourages the states to embrace fully the national reform projects which we have allocated for them, including in the critical area of regulatory reform, to boost long-term productivity growth and produce long-term economic growth. -  - Someone derisively says, 'What about the summit?' The call for a 2020 seamless national economy was the clarion clear call by business across the summit. Why is it that after 12 years those opposite made no progress in this space? We convened a group of Australia's business leaders from right across the nation. Their demand of us was to work on tax and on the question of a seamless national economy. They want that established as a clear-cut national objective for us all. That is why this government has decided to act on this. The big challenges are getting the tax system right in the long term - fundamental tax reform not even broached by those opposite; getting the microeconomic reform agenda right, including through COAG, including through what we do in the overall regulatory reform space; and, thirdly, how we embrace the overarching reform which is necessary in emissions trading to deal with climate change, the great economic challenge of our generation as well as the great environmental challenge of our generation. That is where this government's energies are concentrated - getting these things right for the future: big challenges like tax, big challenges like economic reform, big challenges like using COAG to reduce the regulatory burden on business and big challenges like developing an emissions trading scheme. This government has embarked upon this course of action because Australia needs long-term planning. COAG, a forum which brings together every government in the country - six states, two territories and the Commonwealth - is the vehicle for advancing so much of this economic reform agenda. We are putting our shoulder to the wheel; those opposite for 12 years were asleep at the wheel. I would encourage those opposite to get behind the COAG reform process necessary for the economy, necessary for business and necessary for national labour market mobility.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - On the question of watching, what occurred on the opposition's watch when they were in government for over 12 years was a series of increases in the price of petrol, including an increase in the oil price by one-third in the 12-month period prior to the last election. That is the first point. The second point is that what the government has said consistently is that when it comes to enhancing the competition policy powers available to consumers we will do that which is possible. We said that we would establish a petrol commissioner and we have done that. We said that we were committed to the introduction of Fuelwatch. Those opposite oppose it.We believe that these are modest positive measures that assist motorists to make an informed choice about where to get the cheapest petrol on a particular day. I say to those opposite: what is wrong with a motorist in any city in the country knowing on a particular day where they can get the cheapest petrol? What is wrong with them having access to that information? What we do know about those opposite is that they want the big oil companies to have that information but they want consumers not to have that information.</DOC>

 - Climate change is a great economic and environmental challenge for this generation of Australians. In fact it is a challenge that has stared in the face of governments around the world since the states of the world gathered together and put together the Kyoto protocol and realised that we had a challenge that goes beyond any one nation state to fix. That is why the nations of the world agreed to ratify Kyoto, with the exception of one or two. When the opposition were in government they were one of those two. They said that the only way to fix climate change was for Australia to act unilaterally out there and not in concert with the rest of the international community.If you are looking at the overall challenges of climate change, I think it is important to note that those opposite are now part of the climate change sceptics brigade mark 2. What we have here quite plainly with this new fear campaign on emissions trading is this: we have the return of the Kyoto sceptics in their new fear campaign on climate change and on emissions trading. That is what this is all about.I suggest to those opposite that they soberly look at the economic cost. We know that they have no interest in the environmental consequences. They simply look at the flow-through effects in terms of the potential economic cost. I quote from the Preston and Jones report for the CSIRO in 2006, which is when those opposite were in the midst of their 12 years in government. It states that with a less than one degree temperature rise the snow covered area of the Australian Alps will shrink by 10 to 40 per cent by the turn of this century. That will have a huge impact on Australian tourism. The CSIRO report further states: with a warming of between two and three degrees, almost all of the Great Barrier Reef will be bleached every year; 80 per cent of Kakadu's freshwater wetlands will be lost to a 30 centimetre rise in sea level; with a three to four degree rise in temperature, Murray-Darling river flows could fall by almost a half - between 16 and 48 per cent.For those opposite who say that they have a particularly keen interest in representing the interests of rural Australia, let us look at the effect on primary industries. I will quote from figures provided by the Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO in 2007. They stated that climate modelling by the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology suggests rainfall in southern Australia could be reduced by up to 10 per cent by 2030 and by up to 20 per cent by 2050. Furthermore, CSIRO in 2006 stated that livestock heat stress leads to a decline in milk production flowing from the effect which climate change has on temperature rises; that there will be a high annual cost of approximately $12 million a year to manage the southward spread of the Queensland fruit fly; and that with a warming of between two and three degrees there will be a 40 per cent reduction in livestock carrying capacity for native pasture lands. These are significant effects for rural Australia, and because they affect rural Australia they will have widespread effects on the entire national economy.Let us go to the effects on human health. Annual heatwave deaths in Brisbane will increase from 134 today to between 165 and 189. Furthermore, a Climate Institute report of 2007 states that the southward spread of malaria receptive zones -  -  - These figures are from CSIRO reports, Climate Institute reports and various other reports. So CSIRO is spreading a scare campaign according to those opposite.Then we have a further report from the Climate Institute of 1,200 to 1,400 more heat related deaths a year in major population centres. Putting all those things into their global context - the impact of overall temperature rises - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggests that the global economic costs associated with an increase in average global temperatures of 2.5 degrees could cost between 1.5 per cent and two per cent of global GDP a year. The case on this question is clear for those who are responsible about long-term planning for Australia's economy, long-term planning for the future of our rural industries, long-term planning for the future of our public health and long-term planning in terms of what needs to be done to mitigate and adapt to climate change.This government came to the election with a very clear-cut policy. We would ratify Kyoto. Those opposite remained committed to opposing the ratification of Kyoto. Prior to the election we were committed to the introduction of something called an emissions-trading scheme. Prior to the election, those opposite were also committed to the introduction of an emissions-trading scheme. Prior to the election, those opposite committed further on the question of an ETS. They said that the transport sector should be included in that ETS - and the member for Wentworth seeks to hide once again in his notes. The bottom line is that, if you are responsible about long-term planning for the environment, it means embracing these long-term challenges.We have a clear-cut strategy for dealing with climate change, a clear-cut strategy for dealing with emissions trading and a clear-cut strategy when it comes to acting on new technologies which assist in dealing with what is not just a global problem but -  - a national problem as well. These strategies includes a half-billion-dollar clean coal fund, a half-billion-dollar renewable energy fund and a $240 million clean business fund. These are in addition to our commitment to introduce an emissions trading scheme - a responsible, market based way of dealing with the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions.I say to those opposite that this should be a challenge which transcends politics. This is a challenge for the globe and for the nation which is so intergenerational in its scope that people should start working together on it. Instead, those opposite, since they have lodged in opposition ranks, have decided that this once again is simply a platform for the short-term playing of party politics, rather than long-term planning for the nation's future. This government is committed to taking long-term, responsible action to deal with the challenge of climate change. I appeal to those opposite to abandon their current commitment to a fear campaign. It may be politically attractive for them once again to see the return of the Kyoto sceptics through their current campaign of fear on emissions trading. I would commend them instead to the challenges which their children and grandchildren face and ask them to act responsibly in their interest, the planet's interest and in the interest of the Australia economy.</DOC>

 - One of the things which has had an impact on consumer prices across the country is 10 interest rate rises in a row. If you have 10 interest rate rises in a row from a party in government which said that they would keep interest rates at - Government members - Record lows! - What did they say they would keep interest rates at?Government members - Record lows! - Did they honour that commitment?Government members - No! - No, they did not. I say to those opposite that, when it comes to making commitments like that on interest rates, you should hang your heads in collective shame. That was part and parcel of the collective strategy of those opposite to seek to win the 2004 election. Those opposite stand condemned for their inaction.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for what is a very important question. Climate change is the biggest economic challenge that the global community faces. Under this government, Australia is rising to that challenge - unlike the climate change sceptics opposite, who put it in the too-hard basket for 12 years. It is the case that the economic costs of inaction are greater than the costs of action. Left unaddressed, climate change will undermine economic growth and destroy our way of life. Climate change threatens agricultural exports worth $27 billion. The costs of extreme weather alone could reach between 0.5 per cent and one per cent of world GDP by the middle of the century. We need to change the way the economy works, to move from a high-emissions economy to a low-emissions economy. Reducing carbon emissions is a growth strategy for the future. Not acting is what destroys growth and prosperity into the future.The best way to address carbon emissions is through an emissions-trading scheme. Introducing one of these is difficult. We do not pretend otherwise. Tough decisions will need to be made, because major economic reform is never easy. Major economic reform requires courage, leadership and purpose. The longer we delay, the more it will cost. Just imagine what this country might have been like if back then, five years ago, the former government had had the courage to introduce an emissions-trading scheme when it went to the cabinet, when they had the opportunity to grasp the future, and they squibbed it. This government says we have no choice but to act.There are some opposite who once thought that an emissions-trading scheme was something that was worth while. That was when they had some faint connection to economic credibility. In fact, the member for Wentworth's website - and I do not know if he showed this to the focus group or not - had this to say: 'Australia's emissions-trading scheme will be the most comprehensive in the world.' - There is a lot more yet, boy. Of course, we have had some remarkable backflips from those opposite, particularly from the member for Wentworth. The member for Wentworth said inflation was a fairy story. Remember when he said that, on inflation, it was 'mission accomplished'? In the House he said that it was 'mission accomplished'. Then he came to the House last week and suddenly admitted that inflation may have been a central challenge. He is someone who will say anything and do anything. This morning on Sky TV he was interviewed by Kieran Gilbert. This is what Kieran Gilbert said the then Minister for the Environment and Water Resources said in 2007:By bringing transport fuels into the Australian emissions trading system consumers will be given greater incentive to improve the energy efficiency of their transport choices.Kieran Gilbert said, 'Who said that?' Mr Turnbull said, 'No, that was Howard government policy.' Who was the environment minister back when they were talking about an emissions-trading system? Was it the member for Curtin? No. Was it the member for North Sydney? 
Government members - No. - Who was it? It was the member for Wentworth. That is what he said: 'By bringing transport fuels into the Australian emissions-trading system consumers will be given greater incentive to improve their energy efficiency and transport choices.' That is what he had to say. He is trying to crab-walk away from the Howard government policy that he was claiming credit for only last year. What does this demonstrate? That those opposite are completely spineless when it comes to facing up to the great challenges of the future. They are yesterday's men and women in every sense. They are economic and environmental Neanderthals. We had all these old arguments from them before. We had them against Kyoto. They do not have one ounce of policy courage when it comes to facing up to this challenge of climate change. They are simply prepared to be irresponsible, to play short-term politics and to sell the nation's future down the drain. They should be condemned.</DOC>

 - I think one of the things about child care to understand is what happened with the increase in childcare costs over the period during which those opposite were in power. The average fee for a child in full-time long day care increased by almost 80 per cent. The government has a plan for investing in child care some $2.4 billion over the next four years. It includes the establishment of up to 260 additional childcare centres across the country; the childcare tax rebate going from 30 per cent to 50 per cent; universal access to 15 hours of affordable early learning for all children in the year before formal schooling, access that meets the needs of working parents; and also our commitment to act on this in the long term. No-one likes to see the cost of child care going up - this government does not like to see it going up either - but there are ways in which you can handle it. The government has responded in terms of its family support package, which is some $55 billion in the most recent budget; income tax cuts, which flow through from 1 July; as well as the increase in the childcare tax rebate.I refer to the typical young family of a mother and father with one child at preschool and one at primary school. If you look at the overall flow-through effect for that family, it is some $52 a week. This does not solve all cost of living challenges at all but we believe on this side of the House that it is a responsible course of action to assist families and individuals under financial pressure at this time, including the pressure that occurs as a consequence of childcare cost increases.I will add one further comment on the affordability of child care, and that is the matter of the input costs which childcare providers are now confronted with, as well as the cost of labour. We have had a gross shortage of qualified workers in this sector for a long period of time, which is why the government has been so keen to additionally invest in this part of the equation as well. - No, the objective is to actually increase the supply of qualified childcare workers to the sector. If you have an adverse balance of supply and demand in that sector, obviously it provides a further cost pressure for providers.The other thing I would say to those opposite is: reflect on the history. When those opposite were first elected, they froze childcare assistance payments for two years, they removed operational and capital works subsidies for community based centres, which forced a number of centres to reduce in size or close completely, and they withdrew funding that was to support the construction of 5,500 new childcare places. When they finally introduced the childcare tax rebate in 2004, they made families wait two years before receiving their first payment. That is what those opposite did in their first few years. In the first six months of our government's tenure, our action in terms of the childcare tax rebate, in addition to the input measures we have put in place for those working in this sector and those who need training in this sector, is a solid start, but there is still much more to do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question, and I acknowledge his strong engagement with the primary producers in his own electorate, particularly the dairy farmers in Colac whom he has previously taken me out to meet. Yesterday the coalition scare campaign about responding to climate change got underway again. The opposition spent the last day denying that their climate change policy had changed and they spent the last decade denying that the climate itself had changed. Their approach very much was on the basis that if they can pretend that nothing is happening then maybe nothing will be happening. It is like a child in the playground who covers their eyes and thinks that all the bad things will go away. They ignored the fact that the cost of inaction is so much greater than the cost of action. They had the view that if you do not mention climate change, if you do not talk about it, if you pretend it is not happening, then it will all go away. They became so arrogant as to believe that the climate was actually waiting for the mandate of the previous government before it would feel it had permission to vary in any way.But what actually is disturbing is the work that ABARE did at the end of last year looking at what is likely to happen to a series of key commodities if we do nothing. Over a series of key agricultural products there is an estimate of nine to 10 per cent reduction in total production by 2030, or around $4.2 billion in today's terms, and 13 to 19 per cent reduction in production by 2050. In exports the ABARE data was even more disturbing. Australian agricultural exports of key commodities are projected to decline by between 11 per cent and 63 per cent by 2030, and by up to 79 per cent by 2050. The research went through commodity by commodity what will happen if we do nothing. Wheat takes a hit of 9.2 per cent by 2030 and 13 per cent by 2050. Dairy is down by 9Â½ per cent by 2030 and 18 per cent by 2050. It goes through sugar, beef and sheep meat.The good news on all these projections is that all the modelling is based on something that, when ABARE started doing this work, was a reasonable assumption and that was that the Australian government would do nothing. That was a reasonable presumption 12 months ago. The good news is that it is not a reasonable presumption any more.The NFF themselves have stated that climate change is possibly the biggest risk facing Australian farmers in the coming century. Against that now we have a series of long-term plans from this government to help our farmers prepare for a future with climate change. Australia's Farming Future provides $130 million over four years and involves long-term planning, long-term changes to help people adapt to the challenges ahead, research and productivity programs looking at issues like soil carbon and emissions reduction and making sure that with the global issues our farmers are facing we have a government squarely focused not on a fear campaign - the opposition's approach - but on making the hard decisions in order to provide a secure farming future.</DOC>

 - I am aware that Qantas's licensed aircraft maintenance engineers took protected industrial action on Monday, 23rd, and that further protected action comprising work stoppages and overtime bans has been notified for today, Tuesday, 24th, and Friday, 27 June. This action has been taken as part of collective agreement negotiations between the licensed aircraft maintenance engineers and Qantas. - I am glad for the interjection from the member of Curtin because we should all pay attention to this fact -  - this action is occurring under the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act that were passed by the previous government. That is the first point. Furthermore, I understand from reports that there is no dispute, that the work stoppages have been notified in accordance with the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act and therefore this industrial action is lawful and protected under that act. This is ultimately a matter that can be determined by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission under the law if that becomes necessary.As I said yesterday in the House, when it comes to the impact of this and other factors on the tourism industry across Australia it is important for this government to engage in appropriate forms of further advertising Australia as a desirable international tourism destination. That is really important. I ask those opposite to reflect seriously on their campaign, 'So Where the Bloody Hell Are You?' In every place I have visited in the world, that campaign has been basically described as an absolute rolled gold disaster. I think those opposite should reflect on their expenditure of government funds on a campaign which did not yield a significant benefit to the Australian tourism industry. - This government is now seeking to re-examine that because Australian tourism deserves better than that which the honourable member up the back there gave to us when she was minister for tourism. That campaign was a rolled gold disaster. I am talking about the research upon which this campaign was actually engaged. This is a major industry for Australia; it deserves considered and reasonable and substantial support from government over time. We will be doing that. As an interim measure we have done that in part in North Queensland, based on the interventions of the member for Leichhardt. There is still much more to be done.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for her question. This government is indeed committed to tackling climate change. We regard climate change as the moral challenge for our generation. Climate change is a threat to our economic prosperity, and pretending there is not a problem or leaving it to future generations to solve is not an option. The transport sector, which contributes around 14 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions, must be a part of any climate change strategy. The government is currently working through the design aspects of the ETS. We will be releasing a green paper in July. For the ETS to be effective we know that it needs to have as broad a coverage as possible. Exempting or shielding sectors of the economy from the ETS will increase costs for the sectors which are included. The government is aiming to get the best results on climate whilst minimising pressures on working families and the risk to the economy.What we know, not just from domestic reports but also from reports such as that done by Stern, is that the sooner you take action the lower the cost will be. Those opposite denied that climate change was a problem for 12 years. They opposed ratifying Kyoto. They opposed an ETS; they said it was just a tax and it should be opposed. But in the lead-up to last year's election they had a change of heart. They tried to convince the Australian public that they were serious about climate change. The member for Wentworth's own climate change policy released on behalf of the government of the day, which the Treasurer has outlined, said this about transport:By bringing transport fuels into the Australian emissions trading system, consumers will be given ... greater incentive to improve the energy efficiency of their transport choices.Economics 1A, and said by the member for Wentworth as part of their policy. We know from the Treasurer that today on Sky News the member for Wentworth said this in rejecting an ETS involving transport: 'It was the Howard government's policy' - as if it had nothing to do with him. But he actually went further. In the same interview he said the emissions-trading scheme was 'part of our policy last year and it remains -  - Today in the same interview the member for Wentworth said that the emissions-trading scheme was 'part of our policy and it remains our policy today'. So here you have it: it does not matter that there has been no change in the threat to climate change; it just matters that there has been a change because now, instead of being the government, they are the opposition, so any principle just goes out the window. It does not matter if the member for Wentworth contradicts his colleagues. It does not matter if the member for Wentworth contradicts himself: last year - 'transport should be in'; this year - 'it should not be in'. It does not even matter if he contradicts himself because this is the new Liberal Party. This is the Liberal Party that does not stand for anything. This is a party of 'back to the future': we are now back to the days when climate change does not need addressing. The only future that they are concerned about is the future of the Leader of the Opposition, which is why the Leader of the Opposition has to appeal to the dinosaurs on his back bench who have made him the leader and who are climate change sceptics. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to be taken seriously and if the shadow Treasurer wants to be taken seriously they should be supporting and acknowledging that market based mechanisms are the least-cost way of addressing climate change. That is why the government are addressing this issue. That is why we are taking action. That is why we will be introducing an emissions-trading scheme.</DOC>

 - It is interesting that after we just heard the minister for infrastructure outline the amazing change of position on the part of the opposition after the election compared with their position on climate change prior to the election we are seeing something similar from the opposition with regard to the role of state governments in the nation's economy. It is not that long ago that the member for Higgins was up here at this dispatch box as Treasurer lecturing the states for their failure to invest in infrastructure. - It is not that long ago that the member for Higgins was standing at this dispatch box lecturing the states about their alleged failure to invest in infrastructure. What has happened in the ensuing time, of course, is that the states have made provision for substantial increases in their investment in infrastructure. - I would point out finally that the state budgets are in recurrent operating surpluses. We do not have any concerns about the operational positions of the states and the state budgets. - They are investing in the infrastructure, something that the former government failed to do for 12 years. - If you would like an observation about the inflationary significance of these issues -  - If you would like some assistance on the question of the significance of these matters with respect to inflation, I would draw your attention to the fact that the Reserve Bank, over a period of three or four years, on no less than 20 occasions warned the former Howard government about the inadequate investment in infrastructure in Australia. It warned the former government that it was failing to provide for appropriate investment in infrastructure, thereby leading to serious capacity constraints, and with substantial increases in money coming into the Australian economy as a result of the mining boom this was generating serious, substantial inflationary pressures. Investing in infrastructure, whether it be by state governments or the national government, is crucial to the long-term economic future of this country. I applaud the state governments for picking up their responsibilities. This government is also picking up its responsibilities in investing in infrastructure after 12 years of complete neglect.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Can I update the House on developments overnight and update the House following the report to the House yesterday by the Prime Minister. Members will of course be aware that Mr Tsvangirai has withdrawn from the second round presidential run-off ballot on the 27th of this month. The Australian government of course understands, respects and supports that decision. There was no prospect of a full, free and fair election. There was no prospect that in the unlikely event in those circumstances that Mr Tsvangirai would prevail. There was no prospect that the brutal Mugabe regime would respect the will of the people, and obviously the only prospect which Mr Tsvangirai saw was the continuation of the state-sponsored campaign of oppression and violence. Regrettably, overnight, obviously fearing for his own personal safety, Mr Tsvangirai has sought and been granted refuge in the Dutch embassy in Harare. We of course welcome the fact that the Netherlands has undertaken that role.In a very bleak and grim picture there are some welcoming developments. The Australian government welcomes very much the statement overnight by the UN Secretary-General, Mr Ban Ki-moon, and we welcome the consideration by the UN Security Council, this morning Australia time, and the statement released following consideration by the Security Council of Zimbabwe by the current President of the Security Council. It is worth while, I think, to quote from some of the Secretary-General's remarks and also to quote from the statement released by the President of the Security Council. Overnight the Secretary-General referred to:... the understandable decision of the Opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai to withdraw from the run-off election scheduled for this Friday ...He continued:... conditions do not exist for free and fair elections right now in Zimbabwe. There has been too much violence, too much intimidation.The Secretary-General went on to refer to:The campaign of threat and intimidation ... against the very spirit of democracy.He further said:... violence and intimidation must stop.He also said:The people of Zimbabwe have a right to live in peace and security, to enjoy the protections of the rule of law.He indicated that, having been in close contact with a number of African leaders, his view was:... the elections should be postponed until the right conditions are in place. I would strongly discourage the authorities from going ahead with the run-off on Friday.The Australian government strongly agrees with that sentiment. I am sure all members of the House do.Following a report by the UN Secretariat to the Security Council, this morning's Canberra Times reported that the President of the Security Council released a very strong statement in respect of Zimbabwe. Again, I think it is worth while quoting it in part to the House. He said:The Security Council condemns the campaign of violence against the political opposition ahead of the second round of the Presidential elections scheduled for 27 June ...The Security Council further condemns the actions of the Government of Zimbabwe that have denied its political opponents the right to campaign freely, and calls upon the Government of Zimbabwe to stop the violence, to cease political intimidation, to end the restrictions on the right of assembly and to release the political leaders who have been detained ...The Security Council regrets that the campaign of violence and the restrictions on the political opposition have made it impossible for a free and fair election to take place on 27 June ...The Security Council calls on the Zimbabwean authorities to cooperate fully with all efforts, including through the UN, aimed at finding a peaceful way forward, through dialogue between the parties ...The Australian government strongly supports the view that there is no point to a second round run-off on Friday of this week. The brutal Mugabe regime has no electoral or democratic legitimacy so far as Zimbabwe is concerned.I also welcome, in the last 24 hours or so, much more robust statements and interest by the Southern African Development Community states and the African Union states. I very much welcome the very strong remarks by the President of the Southern African Development Community, the President of Zambia, President Mwanawasa, and I welcome very much the statements by the President of the African Union, the President of Tanzania, Mr Kikwete. I note that the Southern African Development Community foreign ministers met in Angola yesterday, and we very much await a readout of those reports. Can I say that the Australian government regard those statements as very welcome, very robust and, frankly, overdue. But we welcome them very much. There now appears to be a growing chorus from the African states that the campaign of intimidation in Zimbabwe has to cease.The Australian government continues its diplomatic efforts. We strongly support the statements of the Secretary-General. We strongly support the statement by the Security Council. And yesterday I instructed our posts in Africa to discuss with their counterparts in the Southern African Development Community states the plans by those member states in relation to Zimbabwe and to register Australia's very strong view that Mr Mugabe had deprived himself of any legitimacy whatsoever, the need for a full, free and fair election in Zimbabwe and Australia's ongoing support to ensure a political outcome in Zimbabwe which meets the will of the Zimbabwe people. I hope that the consideration of this matter before the Security Council leads to a turning point where Zimbabwe's neighbouring African states take up the primary responsibility of ensuring that the brutal Mugabe regime stops its campaign of intimidation and violence and we have some prospects of the people of Zimbabwe expressing their will through a ballot and having that will respected.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The opposition can do nothing but sneer at average Australian families who do the shopping. They have a snobby disdain for the fact that people out there might be interested in where they can buy a special. That was absolutely on display in this House last week by the member for Curtin - the snobby disdain for the fact that I have had a price watch operating in my electorate since 1993. It is staffed by a band of loyal volunteers who have supplied information to people in my electorate who want that information and who have come to rely on it. - Yes, I was asked about the local price watch activities of my team and my volunteers. I think the question demonstrates a lot about the mindset of those opposite. It was those opposite who only last year said working Australian families have never been better off. That is what they were saying last year. This year we have the so-called concern for cost-of-living pressures from fuel and from the supermarket. I know what they were saying last year about our activities when we were talking about the things that really mattered to Australian families - and the government are still talking about those things. We are putting in place policies to deal with them, but I will come to those in a moment. There seems to be a competition on the other side of the House. They are trying to outdo the former Prime Minister's comment that working families had never been better off. We have had, since the election, the comment from the member for North Sydney that he did not know what was happening under Work Choices. Do you remember that? He had no idea that people's wages and working conditions were being ripped away under Work Choices. Of course, we had, in the middle of last year, the comment by the former Treasurer that he had inflation right where he wanted it -  - just at a time when inflation was building to a 16-year high. Of course, to top it off, the doozy of them all was the comment by the member for Wentworth in this House that when it came to inflation at a 16-year high -  - it was mission accomplished. - If the member for Wentworth spent less time in focus groups, less time in front of the mirror and more time with working families he would understand the importance of supporting our inflation fighting budget. That is what he would understand and he would be backing us in the Senate to push through the building of our surplus so that we can put downward pressure on inflation and do something fundamentally for working families.</DOC>

 - Very simply, we are going to tip the scales in favour of working families - that happens from 1 July - because for the first time in a long time we are going to deliver tax cuts which go to low- and middle-income earners. That was something that could not be delivered by the previous government in 12 years. Not only are we going to deliver substantial tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners but we are going to deliver an education tax rebate. That is something the other side could never have delivered. We are going to deliver a 50 per cent childcare tax rebate, something that was never delivered by those on the other side of the parliament. We absolutely understand that families and seniors are under cost-of-living pressures and that is why from 1 July we will be delivering our tax cuts, our seniors bonuses and increases in the utilities allowances. We understand that they need support, and this government is delivering it.</DOC>

We said we would be making an investment from the public resource in excess of $4 billion and we would do so in partnership with the private sector. We stand by that commitment; there is a competitive process underway. It is the right way ahead because we believe in investing in the future. As I said to this House yesterday, this government is not prepared to stand idly by while this country's available bandwidth and speed languishes between the Slovak Republic and Slovenia.

 - Members will be aware of newspaper reports today on the outlook for Australian minerals and energy exports from a report from the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics which indicates an expected 50 per cent increase to $178 billion in export income for Australia in the 2008-09 year from minerals and energy exports. That is a huge increase in the amount of money coming into Australia through these exports projected for the forthcoming financial year.That is great news for Australia. That money will flow through the Australian economy not just to the companies involved but to their shareholders and employees, to contractors and to small businesses - and it will gradually spread across much of the economy. That is good news for most Australians. It does, however, underline the importance of the ongoing battle against inflation and of the need to have a strong budget surplus and to put strong downward pressure on inflation. Typical demand driven inflation, of course, consists of too much money chasing too few goods and services. In an economy that is running at close to full capacity - as the Australian economy currently is - if you have such a substantial injection of additional funds into the economy without a matching increase in economic capacity, inevitably inflationary pressures build. The serious risk for our economy is that that will end in a wage and price spiral and that inflation will become embedded and therefore you will end up with significantly higher interest rates.It is, therefore, absolutely critical that as well as getting the benefits from this huge surge in our national income we have very strong anti-inflationary measures in place in order to ensure that it does not fuel inflation - that we get the benefits without the potential downsides of higher inflation and higher interest rates. That is why the government has put in place three key strategies in the budget in order to fight inflation. First, we have a very, very substantial surplus, much larger than was initially projected for the forthcoming year in the budget last year by the previous government. And, indeed, we are reducing the rate of growth in government spending from five per cent per annum down to one per cent per annum. Second, we have put in place three large long-term infrastructure investment funds - the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund - to provide for the long-term investment in the nation's economic capacity that will help us to grow in a sustainable way into the future. We have also put in place other initiatives designed to improve economic capacity, such as the increase in the childcare tax rebate to encourage greater participation in the workforce and, indeed, the education tax credit to encourage parents to invest in their kids' education.Third, as has been indicated by the Treasurer, we have put in place very substantial tax cuts that will also boost participation but that, primarily, will help to cushion the burden on individual taxpayers and their families from rising prices that we are endeavouring to deal with as part of that inflation threat that we have inherited from the former government.The opposition's reaction to the government's budget strategy in dealing with what is a very serious inflation challenge has been spectacularly boneheaded. They have tried on every front imaginable to unravel the surplus - to erode that substantial surplus that the government has put in place as the bedrock of its efforts to put downward pressure on inflation - and they have tried to jeopardise the investment funds that we are putting in place to invest in economic capacity for the future. There has been something of a competition on the part of members of the opposition as to who can come up with the biggest or the best fuel excise policy. We have now got no fewer than five different fuel excise policies on the part of the opposition. Malcolm says nothing, Brendan says five -  - Sorry, the member for Wentworth says nothing, the Leader of the Opposition says five, the member for Aston says 10 - he is still out there promoting his policy - we have got the leader of the National Party promoting 20, and the member for Tangney has today got his own version that nobody can quite work out. That is typical of the member for Tangney - it is Triton or Mars or somewhere that he is inhabiting. The member for Tangney has got a policy position about the GST and the excise that nobody can quite work out, but it is number 5. It appears that there is hardly a member of the opposition who has not got their own personalised, customised fuel excise policy. There are undoubtedly going to be more to come.We face a very serious inflation challenge in this nation. The government has a strong budget in position to deal with that challenge, with a strong surplus and long-term investment in the nation's economic capacity to enable us to take the benefit of those huge additional funds flowing through our economy without fuelling inflation and very substantial tax cuts to ease the burden on working people, who are coping with higher prices as a result of those inflationary pressures. We are committed to delivering that budget. I would call on the opposition to get its act together, to get a single policy and a single position not just on petrol but on all other things - including what the budget position should be - to advocate that forcefully and to pass the budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. The Rudd government's first budget was indeed centred on strengthening our economy by investing in national and local infrastructure. When it comes to local government funding, in the coming financial year the government will deliver $1.9 billion in financial assistance grants to Australia's local governments. We will also provide $350 million in the coming year to local councils for the Roads to Recovery program, and our $512 million Housing Affordability Fund will provide grants mainly to local councils to fast-track housing approvals and to fund community infrastructure.It was not surprising, therefore, that the Australian Local Government Association welcomed the budget and particularly the announced Building Australia Fund. The ALGA president, Paul Bell, said:Local government welcomes this initiative as a sensible investment of budget surpluses that will stand Australia in good stead in the long term.The role of local councils in maintaining local water, road, building and community infrastructure certainly cannot be underestimated. For example, local councils are responsible for some 657,000 kilometres of road across Australia. Often it is local government that will control the last kilometre from the highway to the port. That is critical in terms of dealing with our infrastructure bottlenecks. That is why the government has put local government at the heart of its nation-building agenda.We have to engage all three tiers of government as well as the private sector in cooperation. That is what we are doing with the creation of Infrastructure Australia. That is why we appointed a nominee of local government, Professor Peter Newman, to the advisory council of Infrastructure Australia. It will help guide allocations from the government's $20 billion Building Australia Fund.But, of course, that fund is only possible because of the surplus and the good economic management of the budget produced by the Treasurer. The opposition are threatening to blow a $22 billion hole in that surplus. Every dollar that is taken away from the surplus is a dollar less to build the long-term future and to deal with capacity constraints in the economy. The threats of those opposite in opposing the government's budget measures are a direct threat to the nation-building agenda that this government has. I call upon the opposition to show some economic responsibility. It is not too late; the Senate is still sitting. It is not too late to ensure that there is a change of heart and to pass the government's responsible budget.</DOC>

 - I will set out the facts of this important matter. Yesterday, in light of matters in the public domain and following consultation with the Prime Minister, I sought advice from my department as to the appropriate course of action to pursue with respect to these matters. These matters, as members are aware, are the subject of investigation by the New South Wales Police. I will quote from the letter of advice I received from my department:Under the arrangements which exist between the Commonwealth and the state of New South Wales, New South Wales Police are able to investigate and charge people with Commonwealth offences.The advice continued:Where New South Wales Police are already conducting an investigation, the usual practice for the Australian Federal Police, if the same events or circumstances are referred to it, is to liaise with the New South Wales Police to see if it can provide any assistance in relation to the investigation. This arrangement avoids unnecessary duplication of work and inconvenience to the people and witnesses involved in the investigation. - I thank the honourable Leader of the Opposition for the point he made. As I said at the outset, in light of matters in the public domain, I am outlining for the benefit of the House the action I took. Obviously matters in the public domain over the weekend and indeed yesterday motivated the course of action that I have taken. I am outlining to the House the very important matter. I will continue to quote the advice from my department:In these circumstances, I advise that an appropriate course of action for you to take at this stage would be to request the Australian Federal Police to contact the New South Wales Police to ascertain whether they would be assisted by the Australian Federal Police conducting an investigation as well.I, in turn, acting on that advice, wrote to Commissioner Mick Keelty. In the concluding paragraph I said:In light of the fact that the investigation and matters now in the public domain over the weekend and yesterday -  - I again refer to matters now in the public domain and, for the benefit of members opposite and in response to the interjection from the member for North Sydney, I continue with the advice - I would appreciate you considering liaising with the New South Wales Police Commissioner to confirm the extent of their investigation and whether those investigations would be assisted by an investigation conducted by the Australian Federal Police.That communication occurred earlier today between Mick Keelty, the Australian Federal Police commissioner, and the New South Wales Police commissioner, Andrew Scipione, and they in turn issued a statement -  - That communication issued today is material for honourable members in respect of this important matter. The advice from the New South Wales Police is that the commissioners have agreed that New South Wales Police will remain in charge of the investigation until its conclusion, which is expected to be in the near future.That is the point I would draw to the attention of all honourable members. We have in this country complete operational independence of the Australian Federal Police force. That is confirmed by section 37 of the Australian Federal Police Act. We also have, significantly, a presumption of innocence. I have communicated to honourable members, and deliberately so, the extent of the investigation that is occurring and the fact that the New South Wales Police are investigating this matter. - In those circumstances, it is quite inappropriate, I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to purport to have a trial by this parliament in circumstances where the matter is being investigated by the New South Wales Police. If I can provide advice to honourable members opposite, the appropriate course of action here is to let the professional police forces undertake their investigation without political interference.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Dobell for his question. I know with his background and the community's interest that he has always taken a keen interest in healthcare matters. This morning I had the pleasure of launching Australia's health 2008, the nation's premier health report card compiled by the Institute of Health and Welfare. It is an authoritative report and I congratulate all of those involved in the mammoth task of researching, collecting and preparing it.Based on the report, one fact is very clear, and that is that our health needs in this country are changing. GPs are increasingly working on chronic diseases as the burden of chronic diseases continues to increase exponentially. Each year there are 676,000 preventable hospitalisations. Most worrying of all, this report shows that in the eight years from 1997 to 2005 the supply of primary care doctors like GPs fell by nine per cent across the country.These facts lead me to a number of conclusions. First of all, we need to refocus our health system to deal with the new tsunami of chronic diseases that is currently washing over us. This reshaping of the health system must concentrate on the need to keep people well and out of hospital, taking pressure off our already strained hospital system. We of course need to better equip GPs to tackle chronic diseases, and as the shortage of GPs becomes a more significant problem and more families are turned away from GP surgeries, with individuals ending up in hospital instead because they cannot get front-line care, we must examine new ways to utilise our health workforce and we must also look at how we can relieve the burden of red tape on GPs.These conclusions are based on the raw facts that are in the report, and it turns out that the community agrees with these facts. Members might be aware that the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission has been travelling around Australia in the last few weeks hearing from members of the public about their ideas on health. Dr Bennett, the chair of this commission, has provided some information about what these consultations have revealed, and some of the community views that she reports are resurfacing time and time again are about the need to keep people well and out of hospital, about placing a greater focus on prevention and about the desire for a one-stop shop where people can access a local GP as well as other health professionals. In other words, there is a great deal of crossover between what the facts are telling us we need and what the community is telling us they want.It is this combination, expert evidence as well as grassroots testimony, that is driving our government's health policy. It is why we are investing $275 million in GP superclinics, it is why we have established a national preventive health task force, it is why we are committed to developing the first ever primary healthcare strategy for this country and it is why this morning I spoke about the need for us to rethink the gatekeeper model of primary health care. To really improve our health system we need to make the best use of the skills and qualifications of all of our health professionals, be they GPs, nurses or allied health professionals. We on this side of the House want people to have more access to health care, not to lock them out of it. The evidence that an organisation like the Institute of Health and Welfare provides is vital in informing these debates, and once again I want to congratulate the many people at the institute for the very hard work involved in the production of this important report.</DOC>

 - I would say this to all honourable members participating in this debate: these are most serious matters. Furthermore, that is why this government believes in due process. That is, furthermore, why this government believes in allowing an independent police investigation to proceed politically unmolested. Furthermore, I would ask those opposite to reflect on how they handled these circumstances only last year, when there was a police investigation underway into the member for Moreton, the member for Bowman and the member for Bonner. What happened on that occasion was that the then member for Moreton used the platform of the parliament to launch a direct attack on the police who were conducting that investigation. That is not proper.Furthermore, I would draw honourable member's attention to this fact: there is an importance which should be attached to due process. We on this side of the House will adhere to due process proceeding. The honourable Attorney-General has outlined the processes concerning the police investigation. We will await the outcome of those investigations and we will act appropriately in response to the conclusion of those investigations. That is the right course of action. The wrong course of action was that which was sanctioned by those opposite when they used the platform of the parliament, I presume authorised by the Prime Minister of the day, to directly attack the Australian Federal Police in the midst of the conduct of an investigation.For the benefit of the Leader of the Opposition, I would say this: the member for Robertson has advised the Leader of the House that she will not be chairing the House of Representatives standing committee while this process ensues and that she will be donating the allowance as chair of that committee to a local charity until such time as the investigations are concluded.</DOC>

 - This government, as it embraces the challenges for the next six months of the year, is dealing with the underlying challenge of long-term tax reform. That is why we have commissioned the Henry commission of inquiry. Coming out of the 2020 Summit was a call for this nation, for the first time in a quarter of a century, to undertake a root and branch analysis of the tax system, the income support system and the retirement income system. This is a major item of economic reform. Secondly, we are also looking at the great economic reform task of business deregulation. That is the task in which the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy is currently engaged; I referred to it yesterday in answer to a question in the House. Again the call from the 2020 Summit was: how in this place do we go about creating a seamless national economy, a seamless national market, as an important element of microeconomic reform?Beyond that, we will also, in the next six months, be dealing with the great reform challenge that is climate change and in particular the emissions-trading scheme. This is a comprehensive piece of reform. It is complex. It involves not just our international negotiations through the Kyoto and post-Kyoto process; it involves the negotiation here, domestically, of an appropriate responsible emissions trading scheme for the future. That is the right course of action and we believe that is the responsible reform oriented course of action in which any properly-minded government of this country would proceed.Beyond these areas of reform, there is another third basket of reform in which we are collectively engaged - that is, the reform of the federation itself. If there is one thing which we as members on this side of the House have heard from our constituents over a long period of time it is this: will you bring an end to the blame game between Canberra and the states? Will you bring an end to the blame game so that real progress can be achieved in health, in hospitals, in schools, in universities, in our TAFE colleges, in vocational education and training, in water and in our management of the natural and national resources of our country and, furthermore, will you bring an end to the blame game when it comes to Indigenous affairs? Housing - the list goes on.These are important matters which affect the daily lives of working Australians across our nation. You can either have an approach that it is best to preserve this old, tired, worn-out political script which says, 'I don't want to act on this nationally; it's all too hard. Instead, I want to blame somebody else - a state government here, a territory government there or a local government there,' or have the approach adopted by this government, which says, 'Let us as a nation work together. Let us as a nation pull in the one direction. Let us as a nation act on the big challenges in health reform, in education reform, in climate change, in infrastructure, in business regulation, in competition reform, in housing and in Indigenous affairs.' These reforms affect the lives of so many Australians.That is the work program which we have established for the Council of Australian Governments. This Council of Australian Governments, in the course of a 12-month period, will be meeting on five occasions. We met within two weeks of the government forming office last year. We met again in March. There is a meeting coming up early in July. We will meet again in September-October and again in November. On the agenda we are dealing with the critical future of the Australian healthcare agreement. We are dealing also with the future of education, including vocational education and training. We are also dealing with critical decisions which will affect housing, homelessness and, on top of that, what we do with the future of Indigenous affairs.This is an important area of incomplete microeconomic reform for the nation. I would say to those opposite that this is where the real action lies for so many Australians, waiting for governments at last to cooperate with each other and to address and deal with in a sustainable, long-term fashion these huge challenges facing our people, as opposed to simply playing short-term, opportunistic politics.On the question of the construction of public finances, we have had this ramshackle system of payments between the Commonwealth and the states, between some 90 specific purpose payments, each with their own implementation machinery, each involving waste and duplication. Instead, this government is committed to the comprehensive reform of the payment system between Canberra and the states when it comes to the future of specific purpose payments.There is a large program of reform to be undertaken through COAG. It affects the lives of working Australians. I would commend those opposite to, rather than permanently disappear down the sink hole of opportunistic politics which has a 12-hour news cycle, instead lift their eyes to the nation's long-term needs, lift their eyes instead to the challenges on climate change, lift their eyes instead to the challenges of long-term tax reform, lift their eyes to the long-term challenges of microeconomic reform and lift their eyes to the challenge of fixing the federation.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. I am happy to talk about climate change at any time because, unlike those opposite, I have had a consistent position on climate change. Since I arrived in this chamber I have been talking about climate change. Since I arrived in this chamber I have been saying that to address climate change we need a whole-of-government response. That of course must include a response that looks at transport. Transport produces about 14 per cent of our total emissions and therefore we need to consider transport as an option. But there has been some confusion from those opposite about transport and climate change. Last night I watched The 7.30 Report. Forget Grey's Anatomy; last night we had 'Greg's Anatomy' all over Kerry O'Brien's desk as the member for Flinders dissembled on climate change. He argued that, yes, climate change was important and, yes, transport should be considered as part of it but, no, the opposition are not really sure what their position is. That is what the member for Flinders said. Then I thought: The 7.30 Report is a tough gig sometimes with Kerry O'Brien and it might get better overnight. So I listened to AM this morning. - I certainly am being relevant, Mr Speaker. The question was about climate change and transport and I am happy to talk about climate change and transport. When those opposite do interviews - whether it is on The 7.30 Report, sweating more than a sumo wrestler in a sauna, or on AM - after having listened to those interviews, I have no idea what their position is. - The fact is that the shadow minister has at least six positions that he has put forward on climate change - more positions than the Kama Sutra. - Come in spinner - the man who wants to address climate change from space! That is their solution. - When it comes to transport, we on this side of the House are taking action. We have the green car plan and we have cleaner fuels. We on this side of the House understand the need to address transport and climate change in our cities. Whether it be the urban congestion of cars going nowhere and emitting greenhouse gases or the public transport in our cities, we are addressing transport and climate change across the board. - I was quite happy to talk about what we are doing on transport and climate change. What I will not do - and they know I will not do it, as they did not - is discuss cabinet meetings. They know that. They know the question is out of order. They know that I would be breaching the law to talk about what happens at cabinet meetings. My position on climate change is very clear, as is the position of the Rudd Labor government. We will take action - as we did with the first act of this new government, which was to ratify the Kyoto protocol. We will take action, we will continue to take action and we will do this to redress the 12 years of inaction and denial from those opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. It is a very important question, because members on this side of the House understand that climate change is the biggest economic challenge the global community faces. Delaying action on climate change will cost our economy dearly. The Stern review estimated that if we do not act the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least five per cent of global per capita consumption now and forever. It is that serious.The Australian Business Roundtable on Climate Change has stated that delaying action will increase the impact of climate change on the community and the likelihood of a disruptive shock to the Australian economy. The business roundtable also stated that the longer we delay acting, the more expensive it becomes for business and for the wider Australian economy.As the infrastructure minister was saying before, had those on the other side of the parliament acted some time ago - some five years ago - when a submission on emissions trading was taken to the cabinet, this country would be a lot better off. We must deal with this issue - it is urgent - and the best way to deal with this issue is through an emissions-trading system. So when it comes to climate change we need to act with resolve, we need to act with courage and we need to act with consistency.All we have had from the member for Flinders is flip-flopping around - joined of course by the member for Wentworth. The member for Flinders has had six different positions in two years. In November 2006 he said he was opposed to an emissions-trading scheme, calling it the wrong way to tackle climate change. Then, in June 2007, he supported the Howard government policy to introduce an emissions-trading scheme. Then of course, in February 2008, he was opposed to an emissions-trading scheme again. In May 2008 he said:Perhaps the most important domestic policy in recent years has been the decision by the Howard government that Australia will implement a national carbon trading system.Think about that. That was in May 2008, but this is what we got from the member for Flinders in June 2008. On Radio National he said, 'The answer is simple, we have not made a decision yet.' That is what he said on Radio National in May.And of course we had his final position out there on the doorstep this morning. We had the shadow minister and member for Flinders out there saying that he was going to walk away from it again. He said there was going to be no commitment prior to 2011 - he was going to delay the start date. So he is for it, then he is against it, then he is for it and then he is against it. This is what he said. He said this this morning on the doorstep: 'We will look at the timing following Garnaut.' This is a guy who has made a career criss-crossing the country in his hemp underpants pretending to be the green conscience of the Liberal Party. So we have had three policies every year - six policies in total.This morning I noticed a quote in the Australian that there would be 'a lot of push-back' in the party room over the need for an ETS. I say to those opposite who are pushing back that you will not have to wait long because you will get another position from the member for Flinders. We on this side of the House take climate change very seriously. It requires courage and it requires consistency and that is what will be delivered by the Rudd government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The first point to be made is that Professor Garnaut's recommendations and his report are just that. This government has a green-paper process in train, which will be completed when the green paper is published at the end of July. It will canvass all of the options in the presentation, preparation and decisions that will be taken on an emissions-trading scheme. We will take advice not only from Professor Garnaut but also from the Treasury modelling and we will present all of the options in our green paper.We will take our decisions in the national interest. We do not necessarily have to agree with every recommendation that was put forward by Professor Garnaut. We will take our time to consult widely with the community, we will take our time to look at the most objective evidence that is available and we will take our decision in the national interest - in the interests of the whole of the Australian people, including those in the member for McMillan's electorate.</DOC>

 - There is no doubt in the climate change debate that Australia, and our farmers in particular, is in a worse position because there was a delay of more than 10 years in responding to the issue. For the last decade, the contribution of those opposite to the challenge of climate change was to delay - to deny that there was a problem at all. And, when the evidence became overwhelming, they said, 'Let's just delay any response.'We were waiting and waiting, and now I notice that on the front page of today's Australian there is a key engagement going on from the members opposite in this debate, which is to ask the question: 'Do you reckon we could delay even longer? Do you reckon we could now delay beyond 2010 - to 2011, 2012 or maybe 2013? How much longer can we continue to delay any sort of response about helping farmers prepare for climate change?' I wonder how much longer they will continue to fail to understand that the truth is that, with every year we delay our response, it just gets harder. How much better would it be now for farmers had there been responses to climate change a decade ago? Or should we keep waiting? Would they like to continue delaying? Should we perhaps keep waiting to act until 2020, when extreme fire danger days are predicted to increase by between 15 and 65 per cent? Should we keep waiting until 2030, when Australian production of key commodities is set to fall by nine to 10 per cent? Do those opposite think we should keep waiting until 2050, when south-western Australia is projected to have 30 per cent less rainfall during winter and spring? Perhaps we should wait until 2070, when the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology have predicted there will be 80 per cent more drought months for those same areas. Should we just keep on waiting for more major weather events - whether it be the next extreme flood, the next Cyclone Larry or the next seemingly endless drought?You see, when you wait to respond to climate change, it is not just that the problem does not go away; the problem actually gets worse. That is why we are committed to research and development as part of the four-year $130 million Australia's Farming Future initiative, to be directed towards research which helps prepare our primary industries for the challenges of adapting to climate change and reducing the sector's emissions and to deal with the fact that under every projection for climate change we get told we will have longer and deeper droughts, we will have higher temperatures, we will have more major weather events and we will have an increased proliferation of pests, weeds and diseases. That is under every projection that is looked at.The research needs to include issues like the following. How could we improve soil carbon levels, and what is the potential to trade improved soil as an offset? How can we reduce methane emissions in livestock, through options like changing their feed, breeding differently, increasing growth rates and immunising to protect against the microbes which make the methane in the guts of cattle? How could genetically modified crops possibly form part of the jigsaw in dealing with a more variable climate - for example, through adaptation, through drought-resistant grain varieties, through the mitigation of emissions or through varieties which require lower levels of fertiliser? The cost of doing nothing is so much greater than the cost of taking action now. Our farmers would be in a much better position if this research had begun a decade ago. This government, in preparing for Australia's farming future, says that the days of preparing for that future - the days of delay - are over and the days of acting have arrived.</DOC>

 - I am aware that the honourable member has made comments to the media today about some of the diesel rebate issues and some of the impacts that is having on the fishing sector. I think the issue to which he points is a significant one to the extent that, in the fishing industry, one of their prime inputs is the cost of fuel. This is one of those areas where the issues of climate change, fuel prices and food prices all intersect. These are challenges being faced around the world. What we have seen is that the increase in fuel prices around the world has gone onto the input prices throughout agriculture, throughout fisheries and throughout forestry. The specific example of fisheries goes very much to the fuel question, which goes to the issues that have been reported in the press and on the radio today. The issues which go to agriculture include those inputs plus the interrelated issues of fertiliser.In relation to the issues referred to in today's media concerning the rebate - which I mentioned earlier - I am not going to pretend that any of the improvements there provide some sort of complete solution for the fishing industry. I am not going to pretend that having some policy levers providing some level of relief actually put the industry in a positive frame at the moment. They are facing very real difficulties. There are areas where there can be limited assistance given by the government, but at the same time we all have to be completely up-front about the fact that our primary producers, because of world oil prices and world input prices, are facing extremely tough times.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to again get a question about transport and climate change, and I thank the member for Forde for his question. We know that infrastructure and transport have to be a part of the climate change strategy. That is why we included reference to climate change as a consideration in the Infrastructure Australia legislation. We know, for example, that our national freight task is due to double in the next 20 years and we know that we have to improve efficiency in roads and rail.Today, with the ARTC, I launched a new digital system that will cut travel times for both passenger and freight trains going from Sydney to Brisbane by 45 minutes. Members might ask: how can that occur? It is because, previously, we had a staff and token technology system which had operated since the 1890s - 1850s technology operating since the 1890s. What trains would have to do every 20 kilometres between Casino in New South Wales and Acacia Ridge in Brisbane was stop. The driver would have to get out, grab a widget like the one I am holding - this is the Casino to Kyogle loop widget - put it in and make sure that it was registered on a machine that stood some five feet high. The fact is that stopping every 20 kilometres for 15 minutes is extraordinarily inefficient.That is why the government are taking on the economic reform challenge when it comes to transport. What we did today was launch new digital technology that completes the track so that it can be controlled from Newcastle. What we are doing is moving from the dinosaur age to the digital age, and we need to do that across the board. We know that, in May, rail freight volumes were the highest in our history - the greatest amount of freight carried by rail in our history.These are the sorts of practical measures that we need if we are going to address climate change. This morning I also chaired a meeting of the working group of the Australian Transport Council looking at a national strategy when it comes to rail, shipping and road safety to get harmonisation and make sure that we get efficiencies, whether they be in road or rail.This new digital technology is part of the $2.1 billion that is being invested to bring rail into the 21st century. Those opposite sat back and denied climate change, denied the need for economic reform and did nothing about it. We on this side are taking practical action to make sure that we address all of these issues. That will not only benefit us with regard to climate change but also have substantial benefits for our economic productivity.</DOC>

 - It is pretty interesting to look at the whole debate on climate change and on emissions trading, because last year we had many contributions on this debate, including by the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard -  - It goes directly to the question. Mr Howard told the Melbourne Press Club - I presume, representing the Howard Liberal government - on 17 July last year:Now we must position Australia for a low carbon future. We face a major new reform challenge in designing an emissions trading system and setting a long-term goal for reducing our emissions in the absence of a global carbon scheme.These decisions will be amongst the most important Australia takes in the next decade._Reducing carbon emissions will mean higher energy and petrol prices. Australians need to understand that.That was the former, Liberal Prime Minister of Australia last year. Therefore I would draw the attention of those opposite, firstly, to the position adopted by the former Prime Minister in announcing the position of the government then and, secondly, to the position which was put forward by the member for Wentworth, which is that -  - Furthermore, on 3 June last year, the former Prime Minister said:Significantly reducing emissions will mean higher costs for businesses and households, there is no escaping that _That is what the former Prime Minister had to say. Then we had the member for Wentworth as environment minister representing what I understood was Howard government policy but not Liberal Party policy. That was the position that we had from the member for Wentworth yesterday.The government recognises the importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport, which currently comprise around 14 per cent of Australia's total emissions. By bringing transport fuels into the Australian emissions-trading system, consumers will be given greater incentive to improve the energy efficiency of their transport choices.So let us just put all of this into context. The former Prime Minister said in the middle of last year, when the coalition spoke of their intention to introduce an emissions-trading scheme, that action in these areas would increase energy costs. Furthermore, they said that they would include transport within the emissions-trading scheme. And yet we have an entire question time strategy - the new chapter in the fear campaign being launched by those opposite - about the impact of emissions trading on petrol prices. We have a very clear-cut process to unfold an emissions-trading scheme in Australia: (1) we are going to have a green paper later, in July; (2) -  -  - Well, this is a considered way in which to develop public policy, because it is a serious public policy challenge for the future: (1) we are going to have a green paper in July; (2) by the end of the year we anticipate having a white paper in response to that, and we will canvass all of the relevant matters concerning the future of the emissions-trading scheme in those papers.Of course the position adopted by the former Prime Minister is right. If you adopt a position of acting on climate change it does have an impact on energy prices. That is just the truth. He said it then; we say it now. What is the difference between us and them now? We have a plan of action to deal with this in the future. Those opposite have decided that this is a matter which they intend to turn into short-term political advantage. Those opposite are committed to a fear campaign. What we have is a return of the climate change sceptics, a return of the Kyoto sceptics, from a party which will do anything and say anything in order to obtain political advantage. Our government has a plan of action on climate change; you have nothing but short-term political opportunism.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I draw honourable members' attention to the report released today by the Queensland government on the effects of climate change in Queensland. I would ask coalition members who come from Queensland to pay particular attention to what this report has to say. The report, Climate change in Queensland: what the science is telling us, compiled by the Queensland government's Office of Climate Change, outlines the potential impacts for Queensland in a number of areas. These include (1) a tendency for less rainfall, (2) more severe droughts, (3) sea levels rising, (4) more intense tropical cyclones and (5) increased risk of storm surge. Climate change, therefore, as a consequence of these impacts, represents not just a direct environmental assault on the planet and on our country - and in this case the analysis relates to Queensland - but consequential economic effects as well.Remember that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that temperatures could go up by 2.5 degrees and that would of itself result in an impact on global GDP of between 1.5 and two per cent. That is a most significant impact when it comes to the overall performance of the global economy. Those opposite continue to argue that somehow this does not represent a fundamental economic challenge for Australia to get right for the future and for the world to get right for the future. We say that this is a fundamental economic challenge and that it requires, therefore, a considered policy response.If you look at Australia, you see that the economic costs that would be borne would obviously fall to Australian farmers, the tourism sector and our key export industries, and there would be higher insurance premiums and public health outcomes. Look at the impact, for example, on our natural heritage and the consequential impact which would then flow to Australian tourism. The CSIRO estimates that if temperatures rose by between two and three degrees then 80 per cent of Kakadu's freshwater wetlands would be lost due to rising sea levels. Furthermore, according to the CSIRO, under those circumstances almost all of the Great Barrier Reef would be bleached. On top of that, the Queensland climate change report released today reminds us of the value of the Great Barrier Reef - over $4.9 billion in tourism and employment for around 60,000 people - and the danger it faces from climate change. That is the impact on our natural environment and the consequential impact also on tourism.If you turn then to agriculture, ABARE's analysis estimates that a changing climate could reduce wheat, beef, dairy and sugar production by an estimated nine to 10 per cent by 2030 and by 13 to 19 per cent by 2050. ABARE also finds that exports of these key commodities could decline by as much as 63 per cent by 2030 and as much as 79 per cent by 2050. Furthermore, CSIRO estimates that flows into the Murray-Darling would fall by 10 to 25 per cent if temperatures rose by between one and two degrees. Therefore, we have the overall economic impact, the impact on our natural environment, the consequential impact on tourism and, flowing through from that, the cost also to Australia's primary producers and our exports in that sector as well.Then there is public health. The potential cost there is significant. According to the Climate Institute in the CSIRO, a one- to two-degree increase in temperatures will lead to the southwards spread of malaria-receptive zones and 1,200 to 1,400 more heat related deaths a year in major population centres. On top of that again, a two- to three-degree increase in temperatures would cause the spread of dengue fever transmission zones as far as Brisbane.We take these technical reports seriously. The government listens to what the science is saying. The government pays attention to what these reports say about the economic cost to Australia, the cost in particular to agriculture, the cost in particular to our tourism sector and the cost to public health over time as well. That is why Australia needs a forward-looking strategy to deal with climate change. That is why we have established a half-billion-dollar Clean Coal Fund; that is why we have established a half-billion-dollar Renewable Energy Fund; that is why we have established a quarter-billion-dollar Clean Business Fund; that is why we have a commitment to increase the renewable energy target for the country; and that is why we have a commitment, unlike those opposite, to introduce an emissions-trading scheme, because an emissions-trading scheme is a core part of providing the market based responses for dealing with the overall challenge of greenhouse gas emissions into the future.An emissions-trading scheme will help Australia transition to a lower carbon economy, an economy which can then also participate in environmental industries of the future. The government will use revenue from the ETS to help Australians, households and business cope with the costs and invest in cleaner energy options. The government will assist families, pensioners and carers, including low-income households, to adjust to any impact of carbon prices. At the same time, we will be helping Australian families to take practical action in their own homes to use energy more efficiently and to save on their energy bills.These are practical courses of action. We have an integrated strategy concerned with the investment in new technologies, the promotion of renewable energy, the implementation of an emissions-trading scheme as well as arrangements contained within that scheme to ease any transition burden for households and for business.I was also asked about what alternative views exist on this matter. I would simply ask those opposite one question: would they consider their responsibilities to the nation in constructively engaging in this debate about Australia's environmental and economic future as opposed to the campaign of fear which they have launched this week? It is a fear campaign which is designed purely to advance their own political interests, from a party which increasingly shows itself prepared to do anything and say anything in order to gain a political advantage or to gain a headline.I conclude with this. Those opposite, barely 12 months ago, stood up and said to the nation that they would (a) implement an emissions-trading scheme and (b) they would include transport. And 12 months later what are they doing? They are simply cutting and trimming because they see some political advantage in so doing. We have a clear-cut plan for the future to deal with this. Those opposite are caught on the horns of their own political dilemma and are internally divided. The member for Wentworth has yet to give us any explanation as to why he has not stood up to the Leader of the Opposition and maintained the integrity of the position which he put forward on behalf of the Liberal government of Australia barely 12 months ago.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for his question. This question was in fact asked by the shadow Treasurer, the member for Wentworth, some weeks ago, and I will give the same answer. You are not quoting comparable statistics - you are not quoting the comparable figures from the two different measures that are available. I would suggest to the member for Dickson that before he takes up these issues he should actually consult the budget papers and get the correct figures.The government has a serious inflation challenge that it is dealing with in the course of the budget. The opposition - apparently it has another position on inflation today - is trying to block significant initiatives through the Senate. We have reduced the rate of spending growth that we inherited from the previous government from around five per cent per annum to one per cent per annum for the 2008-09 budget. That is putting substantial downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. - It is very difficult to work out what the opposition's view of the world is. Apparently a five per cent real growth budget last year was not inflationary and did not matter, but now it is suggesting that something of the same dimension, which it incorrectly suggests is going to occur next year, would be a problem. Perhaps it would be good for all concerned if the member for Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Dickson got together and actually confronted the question of what their macroeconomic management position is - the position that they adopt with respect to the size of the surplus, what the budget projections should be, and what position the opposition should be taking with respect to macroeconomic management and the fiscal settings - instead of contradictory sniping, taking one position today and the opposite position tomorrow. It would do everybody in this House and public debate in this nation a great service if the Liberal Party, which for so long has prided itself on being supposedly the great economic manager of this country, would actually take a position on the question of economic management.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question. The government has built a strong budget surplus of $22 billion. It is absolutely essential to fighting inflation and putting downward pressure on interest rates. Of course, those opposite are intent on punching a huge hole in that surplus which is so essential in the fight against inflation and putting downward pressure on interest rates. As we know, they are currently delaying measures in the Senate worth something like $284 million. But it gets worse, and it gets worse by the day. Last week the opposition blocked measures worth $25 million a month which are needed to fund the Rudd government's Teen Dental Plan. I can give the House an update on the opposition's latest act of economic vandalism. Last night alone in the Senate the opposition opposed measures that will cost the budget $117 million. 
Government members - Shame! - Shame! That is quite a night's work, isn't it - $117 million? Among the measures they blocked was a new compliance regime to stamp out rorting of welfare benefits. And, as a consequence of their action in the Senate, employees in the charitable sector could lose up to $100 a fortnight because the opposition may block a bill containing Labor's urgent amendments to protect employees from the Howard government's 2006 FBT changes. That will be on their heads. That is the extent to which they are prepared to be bloody-minded and to punch a hole in the surplus. The opposition's blocking of these measures will prevent the government from undertaking simple checks to determine whether individuals satisfy the income test for the Commonwealth seniors health card - checks that they themselves undertook when they were in government. This is an opposition that do not know where they are going. They certainly do not understand the inflation challenge that this country faces. We understand disciplined economic management; they do not. We understand cracking down on welfare rorts; they do not. Their rank opportunism is vandalising the budget in the Senate and putting at risk the fight against inflation.</DOC>

 - I find it remarkable that in this whole debate about binge drinking and what governments can productively do to bring this problem back under control we have a clear choice between the two sides of politics: a government prepared to act and those opposite prepared purely to play politics with this, and politics of the lowest common denominator. That is the bottom line here. We have a policy to deal with binge drinking. We have more to do on this front. It is a problem brought to the government's attention by police commissioners, health authorities and various state government authorities across the country. The last time I looked - and it is a position also on the question of the tax measure as it relates to alcopops - the position we have taken on alcopops was completely endorsed by the former senator in the gallery who has just been referred to; namely, former Senator John Herron -  - The more Joe shouts out loud the more we know Joe does not like to hear it. That is basically the bottom line. We believe that these measures can be conducted currently within the set of arrangements which apply to the legal drinking age in Australia. We have no plans for changes on that score. We will, however, have much more to say on the whole question of dealing with the challenge of binge drinking. But I go back to the first premise: we take the advice from the police commissioners and the health authorities seriously. We are acting on the problem of binge drinking. Those opposite say, 'Don't worry about it. You can't do anything about it. Simply tolerate what's occurring at present,' and in fact at the edge say, 'Well, there's not really much of a problem at all.' There is a very clear alternative here: a Labor government with a plan of action on binge drinking, with still much more to do, and those opposite who are content to sit idly by, do nothing and simply engage in opportunistic politics on the way through. Frankly, on this they stand condemned.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question, because she, like other members of the government, was deeply concerned when just a few weeks ago we were made aware of the impact of a change to the definition of income used by family assistance law that was made by the previous government. This was a change made by the previous government about two years ago. In its 2006-07 budget, the previous government announced changes regarding the treatment of fringe benefits. If this measure is not reversed, it will have a devastating impact on the charitable sector. Families could face being up to $100 a fortnight worse off.At the time that the measures were introduced, many in the not-for-profit sector and the Labor opposition were not aware of the impact of these changes, and the previous Howard government certainly made no effort to publicly explain the impact on the not-for-profit sector. The government have moved quickly. We have moved urgent amendments to restore the use of net reportable fringe benefits for the calculation of income in family assistance law for things like family tax benefit and childcare benefit. The amendments are being made to a budget bill under my portfolio that is currently before the Senate. What we saw last night from the opposition, in what can only be described as a petty political stunt, was them moving to block other elements of this very important budget bill in the Senate. 'Why?' you might ask. They say that it is because they oppose simple checks on whether people are still eligible for the Commonwealth seniors health card.I want to share a little bit of history on this very important issue. The previous government actually undertook a compliance check back in 2006 on this question of eligibility for the Commonwealth seniors health card. There was in fact data-matching of names and addresses between the tax office and Centrelink conducted by the previous government. They identified 28,000 cardholders with income above the qualifying income limits, and the previous government subsequently cancelled those people's cards. So when they were in government they were prepared to do the things that are necessary to make sure that only those who are eligible for the card actually keep their card, but now they are in opposition, of course, all they want to do is play petty politics with a very important bill.The previous government's measure in fact only found about 70 per cent of the ineligible cardholders, and it was not an ongoing measure. The proposal that is in this very important bill in the Senate will provide an ongoing regular checking mechanism. These are just compliance checks that are currently used in other parts of the social security system for other family assistance payments - checks that are all about making sure that eligibility for assistance means that only those who are eligible get that assistance. What we are seeking to do is collect tax file numbers to make sure that only those who have income under the cut-off point actually get to keep the Commonwealth seniors health card and retain the use of that card. Nothing could be fairer than that. When they were in government they thought that this was a fair approach. Now that they are in opposition, all they want to do is play silly games with what is a very, very important piece of legislation.The opposition's amendments to this bill are unacceptable to the government because we want to protect the integrity of the social security system. I will just repeat what the Treasurer said a few moments ago: blocking this bill will put at risk the changes to fringe benefits that will make sure we can protect workers in the church and charitable sector. So time is of the essence. If this bill does not get through the Senate, we will not be able to make sure that people in the church and charitable sector are not up to $100 a fortnight worse off from next week. So we do need an urgent change to this law. Now is not the time for the opposition to play silly political games in the Senate. What we need is for this bill to get through the parliament so that we can protect people in the church and charitable sector, who are doing such an important job in our community.</DOC>

 - I would have thought that the member for Curtin would have listened to my answer yesterday which said that the current action, which is protected industrial action, occurs under their existing legislation. Therefore, under those circumstances, what should they have done with their laws in the past - under that logic - to have prevented this protected industrial action? I would suggest that those opposite reflect long and hard on the laws under which this protected industrial action is occurring. Secondly, what I would say is that the Australian government of course urges all parties engaging in industrial disputation to exercise restraint. These are difficult times for people to negotiate their way through collective agreements which are up for renegotiation. We all have aggregate and macroeconomic responsibilities as well. But, on the question of this particular matter and the circumstances under which this protected industrial action occurs, I would have thought that the shadow minister for workplace relations would have known what her own laws were.The last thing I would say is this: it would be very useful, if the member for Curtin asked another question on this, to clarify once and for all whether, if and when those opposite are returned to political office as the government of Australia, they will restore Work Choices. Will they restore AWAs? The position we were left with as of the last time this matter was debated in this chamber was a clear understanding, here in this chamber, that Work Choices was on its way back. Let us have some clarity from them on Work Choices; let us have some clarity from them on budget discipline; let us have some clarity from them on the question of the emissions-trading scheme; let us have some clarity from them on the question of means testing when it comes to income support payments; let us have, for once in the period that they have been in opposition, clarity on a core policy challenge for the future. On this, as with everything else, they are six of one and half a dozen of the other, are on both sides of the fence and cannot make up their mind.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. The government's budget has three critical aspects that are designed to tackle the very serious inflation challenge facing Australia: first, a very substantial surplus, nearly $22 billion, designed to dampen public sector demand; second, the creation of three long-term infrastructure investment funds, with over $40 billion, that are designed to put investment into the economic capacity of the country for the longer term; and, third, tax cuts that will help ordinary working families deal with the price pressures that are resulting from the inflation problem. Unfortunately, the opposition is delaying and obstructing budget measures in the Senate. We have just heard of one example. That threatens the government's strategy to deal with inflation, both in the short term and in the longer term. It threatens the ability of the budget to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates generally, but it also threatens the flow of money into those long-term investment funds.We saw this morning something of an insight into the underlying rationale behind the opposition's position on the budget. There was a very interesting article in the Sydney Morning Herald by the member for Wentworth. It appears that the focus group report is finally in, and he is quick out of the blocks with a few of those crucial words that no doubt have come out of the focus group, like 'leadership', 'competence' and 'confidence'. There are a couple of interesting quotes that I would like to read to the House in this article:Confidence has to be based on consistency and competence - a real ability to deal with the big issues and take decisive action.In criticising the government and the government's economic management stance, he says:Where is the consistency? Where is the predictability?Unfortunately for the member for Wentworth, not everybody sees him as quite the paragon of consistency that he clearly regards himself as. He has something of a track record of inconsistency. He used to be a republican leader; then he cuddled up to the monarchists. He used to support having transport as part of an emissions-trading scheme; now he opposes transport being in a scheme. He opposed cutting the fuel excise; now he supports it. He came to Canberra as a great supporter of getting rid of discrimination against same-sex couples; now he is participating in an effort in the Senate to block the government's efforts to do precisely that. So, if consistency is the member for Wentworth's strong point, he clearly has a bit of a problem with some of his weaker points.Unfortunately, his approach has infected the rest of the opposition. They have been in opposition for only about six months. They have had one position on bringing back Work Choices. They have had two positions on the reform of alcopop taxes: first they were for; then they were against. They have had three positions on means testing the baby bonus: first they were against it; then they were for it; then they were against it again. They have had four positions on inflation: first it was a fairytale; then it was a challenge; then, again, it was a charade; then, again, it was a problem. They have had five positions on fuel excise and petrol: zero, five, 10, 20 and a special mystery formula being worked on by the member for Tangney that no doubt will be revealed in due course. Finally, they have had six different positions on pensions - so many that I do not have time to outline them. They have not quite got to the partridge in the pear tree, but they are getting there.Consistency does matter. Consistency does matter in economic management and it does matter in fiscal policy. The budget is consistently targeted at addressing the inflation challenge that Australia faces. It is targeted to address that challenge through a very substantial surplus to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates, through large investment funds that will enable Australia to invest in the economic capacity in the longer term that will help us to put downward pressure on inflation in the future and, finally, through a $55 billion package for working families and working people, at the centre of which are very substantial tax cuts. I very much welcome the opposition's discovery of the virtues of consistency. I will welcome it even more when they start acting in the same way.</DOC>

 - Firstly, this protected industrial action occurs under the existing industrial relations laws of the previous government. Secondly, those negotiations are underway. It is regrettable that industrial action occurs. It disrupts the economy. The government accepts that. The government recognises that. More broadly, on the question of the impact on tourism, the government remains committed to acting with the tourism sector to ensure that the best support for the Australian tourism industry is provided.I say to those opposite that I do not recall them in the past ever waving their hands in the air when protected industrial action occurred under these laws on previous occasions. They did not. Therefore, I would suggest that there is a gross inconsistency in the position they are adopting on this matter. I think the nation would be serviced very well if the alternative government of Australia could answer clearly once and for all: are they still the party of Work Choices? Are they still the party of AWAs? Are they still the party which strips away penalty rates and overtime from working families and working Australians? I would suggest in the absence of any answer to the contrary that their answer to that is still, 'Yes, yes and yes.' It would be very useful for the Australian nation to know formally from the Leader of the Opposition whether Work Choices is still the position of the Liberal Party of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question and recognise her longstanding experience and interest in the financial sector. Australia has great potential to be the funds management hub of Asia, but that potential has been held back by the previous government's failure to give Australia a competitive tax regime and to remove other impediments which stop the Australian funds management industry competing on a level playing field. If we can attract more funds to be managed in Australia, we will be creating well-paid, interesting jobs for our young people and promoting financial services and exports. The Australian funds management industry has several advantages over our competitors. They have built up great skills since the Keating government introduced compulsory superannuation, and we have the fourth largest pool of funds under management in the world.Funds under management in Asia are growing exponentially, but the Australian industry is not capitalising on that growth because the shackles of an uncompetitive tax regime have not been taken off. But I am pleased to report to the House that last Thursday night the Senate passed legislation which reduces Australia's withholding tax rate. Despite the reservations that were expressed by the shadow Assistant Treasurer in this House, the Senate passed the legislation last Thursday. I am pleased to report that Australia will go from having the highest withholding tax rate in the world to one of the lowest, in three years. We will go from being one of the most uncompetitive tax regimes in the world to the most competitive in the course of three years.But it is not just the uncompetitive tax rates when it comes to the Australian funds management industry; there is also the complexity and burden of Australia's tax regime. It is vital that we have a simple and transparent tax regime for Australia. The rules that apply to managed funds are burdensome and complex, but the government has begun to reform the part of the tax act which applies these burdensome and complex rules to the funds management industry. We are moving to correct the worst anomalies in this part of the tax act.In the longer term, we need a specifically designed tax regime for the funds management sector. Other countries have done it. The United States has done it. New Zealand has done it. Canada has done it. The United Kingdom has done it. But the previous government simply failed to do it. We are doing it. The first reference of the new government to the Board of Taxation was a specifically designed, purpose-built funds management tax regime.But there is more to do. We need to work with the sector to identify areas that are holding back the ability to compete. I am pleased to inform the House that in Sydney on 31 July the federal government and the New South Wales government will be holding a financial services hub summit, which will be opened by the Prime Minister, to build on the work that this government have already done which the previous government failed to do over 12 years, to work with industry, academics and government to determine what else needs to be done to build on the work and reform we have already embraced in six months in office. More has been done in those six months than was done in the 12 years of the coalition government.It falls to government to take long-term, tough decisions to build Australia's economic future. Cheap populism will not build a financial services hub and cheap populism will not create well-paid and interesting jobs for Australians, but serious policy development will. That is what the previous government failed to do. That is what we will continue to do.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question, because he takes these matters seriously. He seeks to seriously reflect the concerns which he identifies in his community. These are legitimate questions to be asked. On the first point that he raises, which is how these matters can be best deliberated, including the taxation treatment of fuel, the Treasurer has already indicated that these matters are subject to inquiry as part of the Henry commission. Therefore we await with interest its deliberations on this matter. Also the Treasurer has indicated that the Henry commission may report sequentially over time between now and when it is due to complete its final report by the end of next year. So these matters should be considered in their totality, which is one of the reasons why the Treasurer, I and the cabinet agreed that it would be appropriate to consider this through that particular form.Secondly, the honourable member refers to the overriding effect of the current global oil shock. As the honourable member knows, this is the greatest oil shock the world has seen in 30 years. It is of a similar order of magnitude to the ones that we saw in the early seventies and the late seventies. Therefore, the price signals it is sending out to the entire economy, as the member anticipates in his question, are of themselves huge.The question we need to address, however, in the case of emissions trading is: what do we do in terms of Australia's future between now and 2050? How do we construct a long-term climate change regime and a regime which affects the long-term reduction in greenhouse gas emissions across that spectrum of time? That is the negotiation which we are currently conducting globally with other partner economies around the world, because we all know that, if the country is to be serious and the world is to be serious about bringing down greenhouse gas emissions, what we do independently, nationally, as Australia is one thing, but we represent a small percentage of global emissions. What we do in partnership with other states is critical. What is on the table with other states is: how do we actually construct a system of global caps on greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2020 and 2050 and as a globe compact on that? Irrespective of the intermediate fluctuations in oil prices by other factors, including supply and demand factors in the Middle East, energy efficiency measures and the rest, this regime has to be constructed for its own intrinsic environmental merit. That is the regime which has been negotiated through Kyoto. That is what we are seeking to negotiate through Kyoto Plus.So I would say in response to the honourable member's question, which is a serious question: this has to be done on a disciplined basis for the long term, beyond the current impact of price fluctuations of this global oil shock. The final thing I would say on the global oil shock itself - not directly relevant to what the member has just asked - is that every government the Treasurer, I and others have been speaking to around the world in recent days is wrestling with the parallel challenges of how to deal with this on the one hand at the same time as dealing with their long-term obligations to the planet and the next generation when it comes to bringing down greenhouse gas emissions and avoiding the environmental and economic consequences I referred to in my earlier answer to a question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. She knows how important it is to have an effective employment services system in this country to help job seekers and indeed to help employers. The government is committed to getting more Australians into work. But we also want to alleviate the skill crisis - the skill crisis, of course, that was ignored by those opposite. We know that there were 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank of Australia and there were warnings from the Business Council of Australia, and the previous government did nothing to attend to this particular crisis.While I was reviewing the employment services system, among others I spoke to employers and their peak employer bodies to find out what was missing from the current Job Network system. I am afraid I have to tell the House that I discovered that what was missing was exactly what employers needed - that is, work-ready employees with the skills to fill existing vacancies.In response to this particular problem, the government's new employment services system will be more effective for employers, particularly small business. It will provide the flexibility to tailor assistance to the individual needs of the job seeker. We must aim to ensure they really are ready for work when they turn up at the employer's door. That is why the Rudd government, through the Productivity Places Program, is committed to massively boosting training places for job seekers in specific skills employers need.Over the next five years we are rolling out 238,000 training places for job seekers at an expense of $880 million. Employment providers will be required to develop a strategy to meet the needs of local employers, like employers in Newcastle and other areas of the country, and will be rewarded with higher outcome fees where the provider has worked with the employer to fill the vacancy. The government will also be investing in employer brokers who will work with employment service providers and registered training organisations to connect industries that need staff with appropriately qualified job seekers. We have already received, I am glad to say, some positive feedback about these plans from employer bodies. In their submission on the proposed new system, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have said:ACCI welcomes the Australian government's new employment services model and the greater emphasis on meeting industry demand and the provision of employment services.They went on:ACCI commends the new employment services model in tying incentive payments to placements made by employment service providers that replaces the former model of making a payment regardless of how the employment outcome is achieved.We are very happy with those comments made by ACCI and others who have responded to the new model announced by this government. This approach stands in stark contrast to that of those opposite. As we know, they sat back for 12 years and did nothing with respect to the skill crisis in this country. The previous government thought they could sit back - like a lot of Tory governments do - and let the commodities boom fix the problems of this nation. They failed to attend to this particular matter. The Rudd government will not fail in that regard. We will be focusing on this issue. The government is modernising its employment services system by changing the focus to skill up the workers, to engage with employers and, indeed, to provide real incentives for providers to get people into jobs that industry need to fill.</DOC>

We are currently discussing when both of us will visit not only those lakes but other challenged areas along the Murray, as it affects South Australia. Furthermore, once the parliament rises, I will be making an early visit to Western Australia to speak with the Premier of Western Australia about the challenges concerning WA gas.

 - The government was elected on a platform of building a stronger Australia, a fairer Australia and an Australia capable of investing in this country's future challenges in order to secure a future for the nation. That is why, as we embark upon the period ahead, we have a big agenda of reform ahead of us. We have a program of economic reform and we have already referred in question time today to the large amount of work which will be done through the Henry commission. We have long-term tax reform. Remember the call out of the 2020 Summit that it is time, after a quarter of a century, to look at a root and branch review of the tax system, and the other call from the 2020 Summit, which is how we go about establishing a seamless national economy and a seamless national market. Work is now underway by the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy, together with his state and territory colleagues, on doing something about the huge regulatory burden faced by businesses across this country operating in different jurisdictions.Another part of our economic growth agenda is this: with an eye to the future, identifying those future sectors of our economy which can be the growth platforms of the 21st century, I draw honourable members' attention in particular to the remarks made by the Assistant Treasurer in question time today, because the financial services sector is a huge growth platform for the future. Our funds management industry - courtesy of Keating government superannuation reforms, which have resulted in a trillion dollars currently under management in the Australian funds management industry - I am advised, is the fourth largest by quantum in the world. The challenge we face for the future is how to platform that into a new export business for Australia. We on this side of the House, in six months, have engineered a set of tax reform proposals, the likes of which were never dreamed of, let alone advanced, by those opposite after 12 years in office - on the withholding tax, a reduction from 30 per cent down to 15 per cent and down to 7Â½ per cent. These proposals are designed to enable our funds managers to become new export businesses for Australia, taking advantage of the time zone advantage we have with the huge economies of East Asia and the retirement pension funds which are going to emerge from those economies.We also have a big reform agenda on emissions trading, one which the government is determined to prosecute and which those opposite are simply determined to oppose. Then we have a further reform agenda, a third big reform agenda in COAG: the reform of the federation itself. This is where many of my ministerial colleagues have been active with their state and territory counterparts in recent weeks and months to bring about reforms of direct relevance to working households, pensioners and carers across the country. For example, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs recently, on 30 May, concluded an agreement on a $1.9 billion funding boost to disability support services. This is a major initiative. This new partnership with the states and territories will deliver more than 24,500 additional disability places, including 2,300 in-home support services, 2,300 supported accommodation places, 9,900 individual support packages and 10,000 much needed respite places in the range of forms which currently exist across the country. These are big reforms engineered through the architecture of a cooperative federalism as part of our federalism reform agenda.These are very important changes for so many Australians who depend on us making the Federation work, rather than simply turning it into a platform for further exercising of the blame game which characterised the political modus operandi of the previous government. In the spirit of cooperation with the states and territories, we have also sought to complement what states and territories are currently doing in relation to provision of autism services. I draw attention today to an important announcement made by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, and the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, the member for Maribyrnong, of a new program, a $190 million package of services, to support children with autism.Under the four-year Helping Children with Autism package, to be rolled out from next month, an estimated 9,000 children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder will be eligible to receive up to $12,000 over two years before - and this is the critical bit - they go to primary school. Parents will now be able to choose the early intervention measures that best suit their kids, from a range of authorised service providers. Through this package we will be providing some 40 new autism advisers across Australia to ensure that this advice is provided in those early, critical stages of a child's development when autism has first been diagnosed. Furthermore, for those who have direct concern for rural and remote Australia, families in these areas will be eligible for an additional $2,000 to help their children benefit from early intervention services. This is a very good package of reforms. It is designed to help those mums and dads struggling with the challenges of kids with autism and the particular needs that they have. The new package of support for families with children with an autism spectrum disorder is designed to complement the existing activities of states and territories for kids with these disabilities in the school system, by providing these services before those kids get to school.I thank the minister and the member for Maribyrnong for the work that they have done on this initiative - in particular, the member for Maribyrnong, who has done a lot of consultation work with the autism community across the country. This has taken a lot of time to develop; it has involved detailed negotiations. I thank him and the minister for the work they have done with the sector on this. The reason I raise this in the House today is simply to underline one point: you can either prosecute a robust agenda of reforming the Federation - one of the big reform agendas which this government will prosecute in order to deliver practical benefits to those who need disability services in Australia, and in particular those who need autism services - or you can simply perpetuate the politics of the blame game. We are proud of the policy agenda, the reform agenda, we have embarked upon for the period ahead. It is robust on economic reform, robust on the emissions-trading scheme and robust on reforming the Federation, delivering for families and those with disabilities on the way through.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - The government has said consistently that determination of the scope of the emissions-trading scheme and those sectors of the economy that will be included in it will be determined as a consequence of the green paper and white paper process that will ensue during the second half of this year. We have said that repeatedly and we restate it again. On the question of the inclusion of the transport sector and liquid fuels, the most definitive statement we have had is that by the former Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Mr Turnbull, who stated on behalf of the Howard government in July last year that the transport sector should be in.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Climate change is among the most pressing economic challenges facing the world today and is among the most pressing long-term economic challenges facing Australia. All are familiar with the fact that the economic cost of inaction on climate change is far greater than the economic cost of action on climate change. - I would draw attention to a new report from the CSIRO that was released today. On the question of the economic and employment impacts of climate change, the report underlines that by acting on climate change we can create new opportunities for economic growth and for employment. I draw honourable members' attention to this report because it is a contribution to the debate. The report is entitled Growing the green collar economy: skills and labour challenges in reducing our greenhouse emissions and national environmental footprint.The CSIRO analysis, which is a report to the Dusseldorp Skills Forum, is based on the most recent economic modelling. Using two different economic models, the CSIRO has found that, if Australia takes significant action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, national employment will still increase by between 2.5 million and 3.3 million over the next two decades; secondly, jobs in sectors that are currently high carbon emitters, like transport, construction, agriculture, manufacturing and mining, are forecast to grow strongly as well in the next decade; and, furthermore, in high environmental impact industries, 3.25 million workers will need to be equipped with new more sustainable skills. In dealing with these challenges, there are two options facing those of us charged with national political responsibility. Either you prepare Australia for this future or you stick your head in the sand, which would be to run away from the problem. - To quote the Executive Director of the Dusseldorp Skills Forum in the report today:Climate change is both our greatest economic risk and, ironically, a great economic opportunity. But only if the Australian workforce is properly skilled and resourced to underpin truly sustainable industries and workplaces.In the debate this week on climate change and an emissions-trading scheme there has been a great deal of proper emphasis on the economic cost of inaction - the cost that will be borne by the Australian economy on the part of our farmers, the tourism sector, through the consequences that flow for public health outcomes and also, to mention something that we have not touched on in this debate before, the long-term consequences for insurance premiums. All of these represent impacts that will have to be dealt with. Whether it concerns Kakadu, whether it is to do with the impact of drought on our rural commodity exports or whether it is the impact on public health, we believe that the economic case for action is clear-cut. This is an economic policy challenge. If we stick our heads in the sand, these things will come to affect us and those who follow us - our children and our grandchildren - and it will affect, long term, the health of the Australian economy.That is why we have embarked on a course of policy action to deal with these challenges. We have committed ourselves to increasing the renewable energy target. We have committed ourselves to a half-billion dollar Renewable Energy Fund, a half-billion dollar National Clean Coal Fund and a quarter of a billion dollar Clean Business Fund. As well, we have committed ourselves to the introduction of a market based way of dealing with bringing down greenhouse gas emissions over time - an emissions-trading scheme. Our objective is clear: it is to bring down emissions over time. We are deploying these multiple areas of policy to do that. And in managing the transition to a lower carbon economy we will act in a responsible and equitable fashion to support working families, pensioners, carers and low-income Australians throughout the transition process. We will also provide support to business through the transition process.Our position is clear and our timetable for this is clear. We are seeking to do this in a consultative fashion, not just with industry but across the wider community. It is a most complex task and, had it been begun during the 12 years when those opposite occupied the treasury bench - and begun in earnest - Australia would be better placed than it currently finds itself.I was also asked to contrast this with policies that are very much located in the past. I draw honourable members' attention to the clarity of the approach we are bringing to bear in this national debate on the one hand and the absolute absence of clarity on the part of those opposite. Were this not such a significant national debate, we could simply push that to one side, but this will be a major economic debate for the second half of this year and beyond because it will affect us long term.What we have on the part of those opposite is absolute policy incoherence. I cannot make hide nor hair of it, because we have the member for Wentworth saying that he supports the inclusion of petrol in an emissions-trading scheme. He said that in July 2007 but when asked about whether it was Liberal Party policy today he said, 'That was Howard government policy.' I do not know what it is today, but it was Howard government policy. He then went on in an interview - I emphasise to all those opposite - that it was the whole government policy on the part of the Howard government, including presumably the current Leader of the Opposition, who was a member of the cabinet which determined their approach to climate change and emissions trading in the middle of last year. It was a reminder from the member for Wentworth that they were all on board for that one.Then we tried to seek further clarity as to where policy stands now, so we turned to the member for Flinders. The member for Flinders is even more illuminating on this question, because when asked whether emissions trading is now a part of Liberal policy for the future - when challenged on this in an interview the other day - he said that ETS is their policy. It is their policy. So we are now getting to the stage where it was Howard government policy; we do not know whether it is going to continue to be Howard government policy.The member for Flinders, their spokesman on the environment, says it is their policy but we are not quite sure what part of it is their policy, because he was asked the critical question whether, in fact, fuel should be left out. This is the debate, and those opposite, by virtue of their questions in parliament today, are implying that fuel should be left out. That is the fear campaign they have launched. So here, in the ultimate clarification of policy, the member for Flinders, their spokesman on the environment, was asked this clear-cut question:So you are clearly arguing that fuel should be left out?Answer from Mr Hunt:No, we are going to make a final decision in due course ...So we are not sure whether they are going to have an emissions-trading scheme. Some say that it was Howard government policy; some say it still is Liberal Party policy in opposition. But on the question of the inclusion of petrol, based on all the questions I heard this week, I thought we could assume that it was out. Now we think that - at least on the current formulation of the leadership - but, no, the member for Flinders says, 'We're going to make a final decision in due course.' It would be good if we had some clarity on this, so in further search of clarity on this question -  -  - There is always a great barometer of how things are going on the part of those opposite: it is called 'the Hockey volume barometer'. The louder Joe yells you know the worse it is getting.On the question of clarity on this we had to go, again, to what the current Leader of the Opposition had to say about this. I understand that it was in an interview today. There you go; it is from the Liberal Party of Australia. If you want some clarity about what their position on emissions trading is, and their position on what the impact of energy prices would be - because that has been the other thrust of their questioning this week - the Leader of the Opposition said this in response to a question:The fact of it is that if we go, as we will, as we must, as we will and we will pay a price as a nation as we should - This interview was this morning. I actually had them double-check the transcript to make sure this was accurate - for a genuinely global response. One of the consequences of that will be an increase in the price of energy - electricity bills for households and petrol and fuels that we use ...In other words, their position is -  -  - The member for Tangney then left the chamber. - So, in a vain search for clarity on the part of their actual position on (a) climate change, (b) emissions trading, (c) the inclusion of petrol, and (d) the implication for petrol and energy prices, members opposite and in fact the entire House could be, shall we say, well understood if we had some confusion on this question, because frankly it is difficult to discern where those opposite stand on one of the critical policy challenges for the year ahead. The interview concludes on a question where again the Leader of the Opposition was asked about their position on emissions trading and his definitive response was:In government we believed in an emissions-trading scheme - 'We believed in an emissions-trading scheme'! He went on:... now ... we too believe that an emissions-trading scheme, assuming the rest of the world is able to work with us in an emissions-trading scheme, is the way to go. -  - On this other critical question of an emissions-trading scheme the Leader of the Opposition said today that they believe in one but only when the rest of the world acts. Let us go back to their environment spokesperson who said in May that Australia should not wait until a genuinely global agreement has been negotiated. In other words, whether it is on support for an ETS at all, the inclusion of petrol, the impact of price or whether an ETS should be brought in prior to or subsequent to the establishment of global arrangements on this score, we have at least three conflicting positions on the part of those opposite.This is a serious debate for the nation's future. It has huge economic implications for the nation. It has huge implications in terms of the environment itself. We are proceeding in a calm, measured, responsible way through our deliberative processes with industry. Across the other side of the parliamentary chamber today, and in recent days and weeks, we have an absolute policy shambles - there is not a skerrick of consistency on any element of these policies. I would invite those opposite to participate in a sober national debate on this rather than simply degenerate into the fear campaign and the scare campaign which those opposite have embarked upon. It is not worthy of them, it is not worthy of this parliament and it is not worthy of the future of the national economy.</DOC>

 - One of the things which presented itself as I ran through some of the transcripts of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Flinders today, speaking on what to do about the price of fuel and about climate change, was the issue of greater reliance on fuel-efficient cars. That is part of their policy. On that we have acted. You asked what specific action we have taken. We, through industry policy in cooperation with Toyota, will now have for the first time a hybrid car manufactured in this country. We believe in manufacturing policy; those opposite do not. That is one step forward.Secondly, we have the Building Australia Fund to invest in public transport. That is a policy on our part not on the part of those opposite. Thirdly, in supporting working families and pensioners and carers, we have a $55 billion income support package in the budget. For a typical young family this will mean $52 a week, against the $2.50 per week offered by the policy of those opposite on the question of excise - that is, depending on whether it is the Leader of the Opposition's policy; the member for Wentworth's policy, which is to oppose it; the member for Aston's policy, which is to double it; or the Leader of the National Party's policy, which is to quadruple it. And we do not know which policy currently stands.So whether it is in terms of direct income support, investment in fuel-efficient cars, acting responsibly on the future of public transport or doing the right thing in the long term on climate change and emissions trading this is the right group of policy settings for Australia - as opposed to those opposite, who have embarked on one thing and one thing alone: a fear campaign, a scare campaign. They will say anything and do anything to grab a headline in tomorrow's newspapers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, because this government does understand that the cost of inaction on climate change is far greater than the cost of action. We also understand that there are great economic opportunities for Australia in the move from the high-emissions economy of the past to a low-emissions economy of the future. The CSIRO report that the Prime Minister was talking about before is very important. I want to quote from that for a moment. It says:There is a triple-dividend of greater wellbeing, cost-saving and greater competitiveness and reduced environmental impact to be earned if measures would be taken to support the skill revolution required for a low-carbon, environmentally sound society.This again highlights how important and how economically responsible it is to tackle climate change. It also highlights the need for an emissions-trading system - that is the responsible thing to do. Of course an emissions-trading system will limit the amount of carbon we produce by creating a cost to those producing the carbon emissions - that is true. But it will allow households, business and industry to choose the best ways to cut these omissions. To do that we do need an emissions-trading scheme that has a broad coverage. The wider the coverage the more the burden of emissions reduction is shared across the economy and so the lower the total cost to the economy.In designing an emissions-trading scheme we will be mindful of advice - we will be mindful of Treasury modelling, international research and of course the academic work of Professor Garnaut. The government's green paper on the emissions-trading scheme will be released in mid-July and it will form the basis for an initial round of formal consultation with business, the social sector and the wider community.Those opposite have no coherent approach to this at all. They have failed to provide any leadership in this area. As I said the other day, they are the Neanderthals of climate change. They are simply stuck in the past. There has been backflip after backflip. The backflips on the other side are truly of Olympic proportions. First of all is the timing backflip. They said 2011 this morning, and yesterday they again pushed the timeline out. Backflip No. 2 is the petrol backflip, because now petrol is out, but of course the member for Wentworth said it was in. Of course, there is now the China backflip. Before, they were going to move ahead without China and India; now they want to wait for China and India. Of course, these are truly spectacular backflips. The backflips of the Liberal Party, as I said before, are of Olympic proportions. The timing backflip, the petrol backflip and the China and India backflips condemn them for being unable to meet the very big challenges of the future.</DOC>

 - From the honourable member for Curtin, who disparages shoppers who go in search of specials, I find that absolutely remarkable. I think the most out-of-touch question I have heard from the Liberal Party all year was the one earlier this week or last week - whenever it was - when she actively disparaged people who go out there in search of specials. The average annual growth in food prices for the 10 years to the March quarter of 2008 was 3.9 per cent, compared to three per cent for headline CPI. - Average annual growth in the period from March 2006 to March 2008 was 5.1 per cent for food, compared with 3.3 per cent for the CPI. One might ask: between March 2006 and March 2008 - three months into our government but almost two years of their government - if 5.1 per cent was the average food increase in that period, what by way of any assistance to the competition policy powers available to consumers did those opposite do? Nothing. They simply adopted a position where they disparage those who go in search of specials and disparage the efforts of the member for Lilley, the Treasurer, who has been active in this field ever since I have known him, as a member of parliament with his constituents on the north side of Brisbane, to assist them with their own hunt for the best grocery prices in his community.In the 12 months to March 2008, food prices increased by 5.7 per cent due to strong increases in the prices of dairy and related products and, of course, increases in bread and cereal products. Working families, working Australians, pensioners and carers are feeling all of these costs. As a result, on 22 January, a month or two after we took office, the government directed the ACCC to commence a formal inquiry into grocery prices and to report its findings by 31 July 2008. I notice that, despite all the powers available within the ACCC, in the period of 12 years when those opposite were in office - including the last two years when grocery prices went up by 5.1 per cent, a couple of percentage points in excess of the regular CPI - those opposite did absolutely nothing. What we have asked is for the ACCC to conduct a formal inquiry into grocery prices. Furthermore, the government has instructed the ACCC to take a broad approach to its inquiry so that all aspects of the supply chain are included, from the farm gate to the checkout counter, to ensure that families are getting the best deal possible at the supermarket. The ACCC is considering the industry's current structure and the nature of competition within it at the supply, wholesale and retail levels in order to determine the transparency of what is going on. It is also considering mergers and acquisitions by national retailers. The ACCC has received some 190 submissions from a variety of stakeholders in response to the issues paper which it has released. The ACCC has conducted a number of public hearings across rural and metropolitan areas. The government has also asked the ACCC to undertake a monthly survey of grocery prices for a typical shopping basket of goods across Australia and to establish a dedicated website on grocery prices.We have always said about grocery prices, and Fuelwatch in relation to the price of petrol, that we are committed to a set of modest measures to give consumers more information and, as a consequence, more power. As a consequence, we believe these are modest steps forward, as we have always indicated, in stark contrast to those opposite, who for 12 long years in office washed their hands of all responsibility. The honourable member who asked the question has done so, I think, with absolute temerity given her derisory remarks about working Australians who every week look for their specials and go out to balance their family budgets.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for the question. This morning, as I was reading Stock and Land - which I do now in the morning; I am a recent convert to Stock and Land - on page 8 there was an article on some of the latest research coming out today from the CSIRO. The research, by the CSIRO's Dr Mark Howden, outlines in pretty stark terms the potential of climate change for Australian agriculture. It goes through the risks and the opportunities to particular industries and through how farmers can adapt to the challenges of climate change.I noticed from comments made this morning by the Leader of the Opposition that he does not think it is all that appropriate for the government to be talking about the risks, as though the risks and danger of climate change are purely some sort of sneaky government plot. If the Leader of the Opposition is looking for a sneaky plot, I suggest he just turn around, and he will find one directly behind him right now. The Leader of the Opposition apparently thinks it is some sort of sneaky plot to acknowledge research by leading scientific bodies, like the CRC for National Plant Biosecurity, that shows that sleeper pests and weeds that are not currently a problem could become one with warmer temperatures or that weeds, which metabolise CO2 faster, will have the upper hand in a CO2-rich environment. I presume the Leader of the Opposition thinks it is some sort of sneaky plot to listen to joint research by the CSIRO, the Bushfire CRC and the Bureau of Meteorology showing that the number of days of extreme fire danger experienced each year in Australia could increase by 65 per cent by 2020 and up to 300 per cent by 2050. Whenever a bushfire goes through, that is when fireweed and other weeds are the first to come back. But there is also good news in a report by the CSIRO released today. I will quote it, as I am sure honourable members have already read Stock and Land today:The good news, Dr Howden said, is that Australian agriculture is already used to coping with adversity and climate risk; and that the nation has a strong underlying research base.The bad news is that Australia has been politically slow to accept the threat of climate change, 'putting us a decade behind where we could be.'I quote: 'a decade behind where we could be'. The CSIRO report found that, to protect against pests, diseases and weeds in a changing climate, we have to maintain and improve our quarantine capabilities. We have to improve the effectiveness of pest, disease and weed management practices. The report also found a range of specific actions which could be put forward to farmers so that they can be better informed when they make choices about what to do on their own land.If all of this is a sneaky plot then we are colluding with some of the world's best scientific minds. If the Leader of the Opposition is right, then this is a conspiracy which involves the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology, the National Farmers Federation, all the state farming bodies and pretty much every government in the world. Everybody is in on it except him. And you know what? When you see a conspiracy everywhere you look, maybe you have got to wonder if you are the problem.The government knows that Australian farmers can adapt to climate change if they are given access to the best information we can give them. Under no circumstances will we be telling farmers what to do. They make the choices as to what to do on their own land. But it is the Australian government's responsibility to be clear about the risks, to be clear about the opportunities and to make clear to our farmers the best options to ensure a successful future in the face of climate change.</DOC>

 - I would have thought that as shadow Treasurer the member for Wentworth would have reached a conclusion about the intersection of 10 interest rate rises in a row with the cumulative confidence of the business community, because what those interest rate rises add up to is a huge additional cost to the operation of a business. They also affect, of course, consumers - those who buy the goods and services produced by businesses - and, as a result, that washes through in terms of the impact on the economy.The second factor I would draw to the honourable member's attention - and I would draw his attention to the impacts outlined in parallel business confidence surveys in many OECD countries at present - is the wash-through effect of the global financial crisis and the global oil crisis: the third great global oil shock in 30 years, the biggest global oil shock in 30 years. We had interest rate rises, 10 in a row under the previous government - having promised us that interest rates would be kept at? Government members - Record lows! - Were they kept at record lows? Government members - No! Opposition members - Yes! - Did I hear someone opposite say yes? Name them! Was that Joe? - I have a question for the member for North Sydney, which is: if they were going to be kept at record lows, and that undertaking was given at the end of 2004, what was it that happened in 2005, 2006 and 2007? 
Government members - They went up! - Maybe it was a mirage, all of those interest rate rises in a row. I would say to the member for Wentworth, as he plots and schemes over the break in his preparation to take over the Liberal leadership, that, on the basic question of what impacts on confidence: there is the impact of a succession of interest rate rises, the impact of the global economy on the basis of what is happening with global financial markets still and, on top of that, the impact we have seen of global oil prices.Our alternative is responsible economic management, which is why we have brought about a $22 billion surplus on which a Liberal Party raid is being conducted at the moment in the Senate, on this last day that the Senate sits - a $22 billion raid on the surplus. If there is one sure-fire way to put upward pressure on inflation, upward pressure on interest rates and, as a consequence, affect confidence in the real economy, it is to pursue such a policy of continued economic irresponsibility. I would have thought the member for Wentworth would be aware of those basic facts. Perhaps his energies have been directed in another direction in recent weeks and days.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. Last night Dr Thomas Fingar, Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis and Chairman of the National Intelligence Council in the US, gave a statement entitled National intelligence assessment on the national security implications of global climate change to 2030 to a United States congressional committee. In his statement, he said:From a national security perspective, climate change has the potential to affect lives (for example, through food and water shortages, increased health problems including the spread of disease, and increased potential for conflict), property (for example through ground subsidence, flooding, coastal erosion, and extreme weather events), and other security interests.Dr Fingar specifically referred to the circumstances of Australia and New Zealand in his statement. In view of the significance of that statement, I table it.Those views have also been outlined and formed by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, who said in a report earlier this year called Taking a punch: building a more resilient Australia:Climate change will compound the risks of disruption and have a direct influence on the type, scale and frequency of disasters and emergencies Australia will face, including increased flooding, more frequent and intense storms, lightning events and bushfires.Indeed, last September, members interested - and that should be all of us - would recall the significant statements made by the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Mick Keelty, and also the Chief of the Defence Force, Angus Houston. Mick Keelty said in his speech:... if only some and not all of this occurs - that is, the consequences of climate change - climate change is going to be the security issue of the 21st century.In responding to those speeches at the time, the then Minister for Defence, the current Leader of the Opposition, said - and appropriately so:If you think about the security challenges that we face in the future, obviously, population shifts associated with any one of a number of causes including climate change is one of them.That was a specific and an appropriate acknowledgement. It is now completely irresponsible for the opposition to effectively be running interference on measures to address climate change and to be avoiding the security challenges of climate change. The Rudd government is determined to confront these significant security challenges head on.</DOC>

 - Following the earlier question from the honourable member for Wentworth concerning the impact on rents and housing costs generally, I would have thought there was an axiomatic relationship between interest rate rises and those costs. Therefore the proper question in economic policy is: what do you do to make it less likely in the future that there are further interest rate rises? The answer to that is called responsible fiscal policy. The answer to that does not lie in continuing the fiscal policy settings of the type that we inherited from our predecessors.As the finance minister has repeatedly advised the House, with expenditure running in excess of five per cent of annual growth at the time at which this government assumed office, had that been perpetrated in the current financial year by this government then the impact of that on total final demand in the economy would have been unhelpful in terms of the overall inflationary pressures in the economy. In fact, it would have been more than unhelpful; it would have been decisively negative. It would have made the task of maintaining current interest rate policy settings on the part of the Reserve Bank even more difficult. Therefore, we believe that the responsible course of action when it comes to dealing with pressures in the housing sector is first and foremost to make sure that you have a responsible economic policy which does not put further upward pressure on interest rates and further upward pressure on inflation and, through that, further upward pressure on interest rates.The second point in answer to the honourable member's question goes to how you deal effectively with those who are suffering from housing policy stress, those who are finding it difficult to cope with housing policy challenges into the future. What do you actually do through housing policy itself? The question related to interest rates and rents; therefore, the question deals with what you are going to do about housing more generally.For the first time in 12 years the government of Australia has a housing minister. Those opposite did not have one. That was the priority they attached to the housing portfolio. They did not have a housing minister, they did not have a housing portfolio and we know for a fact that they never had a housing policy. What we have done by contrast is put forward some $1Â½ billion-plus of housing programs which deal with, firstly, assisting first home buyers to accumulate enough savings to put a deposit on a home, because that is very difficult; and, secondly, investing in bringing down some of the infrastructure charges, particularly those impacting on new housing developments around the country. That is another half a billion dollars-plus program that we have put forward.There is a third policy, specifically in relation to the point raised by the honourable member for Farrer, which goes to rents, and affordable rents. In our work around the community it is quite plain that this is a situation faced not just by those paying mortgages or seeking to save for mortgages but by those currently paying rents and facing huge challenges in balancing the family budget on that score, which is why we have introduced a half-a-billion-dollar National Rental Affordability Scheme with the intention of making it possible for private sector investors in the sector to create a large number of additional units - over time, 50,000 units - of affordable rental accommodation across the country. These are practical measures in the housing policy space.But I go back to my first premise. None of this is possible unless you have responsible economic management, and you do not have responsible economic management if in the current environment you are launching a $22 billion raid on the surplus, because the impact of that is to put further upward pressure on interest rates, which is disastrous for all people out there in the economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question. I am sure every single member of this House joins with me in horror at the reports that are coming out from various parts of Australia demonstrating terrible stories of child neglect and abuse. To be confronted with the horror of malnutrition and starvation of children I think is shaking every one of us to our foundations. I think we would all agree that, understandably, Australians want to know just how this can continue to be happening and also want to know what each and every one of us at this level of government and in the states and territories are going to do about it.As I am sure everybody here understands, these cases are now subject to police investigations, so of course I cannot comment on any of the individual cases. What I can say - and I am sure once again it is something that we all feel very strongly about - is that child abuse is a crime. It is a crime that must see the people who are perpetrating it punished. As a nation, we not only need to see the people perpetrating it punished; we also need to do a much better job of protecting our children from abuse and neglect. As we all know, including those of us who are parents or aunties or uncles, we want each and every one of our children to grow up in a safe, happy and healthy environment.It is the case that the levels of child abuse are at an alarming high. Just last year there were around 60,000 cases across Australia where authorities found that a child was likely to be harmed, abused or neglected. What I think shocks us all is that these rates have doubled over the last decade. Of course, governments cannot replace the job that responsible parents have to do. But one of the things that is our responsibility is stepping in where there is evidence of neglect or abuse.One of the things that has come out from the reports over the last few days is the very clear need to have much better sharing of child protection information both within and across jurisdictions. We certainly intend for this to be a very important aspect of the new national child protection framework as a way in which the Australian government can provide leadership on the critical issue of child protection.In addition to the vital role of information sharing, the framework will include better prevention, better integration of services, improving responses for children in care and children coming out of care, improving responses for Indigenous children and, most critically, attracting and retaining the right workforce so that we can have effective child protection systems across the country.Under the new national child protection framework, the Australian government is also giving state and territory child welfare authorities the power to advise Centrelink to quarantine various welfare payments to make sure that that money is being spent in the interests of children. We have committed some additional funding in the recent budget to this welfare reform agenda to make sure that our children are protected and that they are going to school.These are very challenging issues that confront every single one of us here today, and I think everybody here also knows that there are no simple solutions to these very complex issues. As I said before, parents will always have the primary responsibility for caring for and protecting their children, but state, territory and national governments have a responsibility to step in where children are at risk of neglect or abuse. We all have to do more to make sure that the cases we have seen in recent days stop falling through the cracks that exist in the system. I am sure that together we can make some improvements for the children who have been so badly treated in our community.</DOC>

 - As I indicated in responses to questions on industrial relations from the honourable member early in the week, the first thing that the country needs is the implementation of a fair and flexible industrial relations system. Secondly, the current level of industrial disputation occurs under the existing set of laws - otherwise called the continuation of those which we inherited from the previous government - which provide for recognised industrial action. The third point is that individual industrial negotiations - the content of those negotiations, the way in which they are conducted and the negotiating leverage - are affected by the overall supply and demand for labour and skilled labour in the economy. If you fail to invest over such a long period of time in an effective skills policy for the economy, it has a direct impact on the labour market.I would suggest to those opposite that, if they were genuinely seriously concerned about advancing the debate on the supply of skilled labour to the Australian workforce and its direct consequence on the conduct of industrial negotiations, it would have been wiser for them to have paid close attention to the 20 warnings they received from the Reserve Bank on the question of investment in skills and infrastructure to deal with long-term inflationary challenges.When those opposite respond with such feigned outrage on this question, I draw their attention to a long perusal of the Reserve Bank documents over a long period of time where one after another those warnings were made. Had they acted on that and acted on infrastructure, not only would it have had an effect on long-term inflationary pressures in the economy, which is the burden of the Reserve Bank's advice, but, in terms of the specific matter raised by the honourable member for Curtin, it would have been of material relevance as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his concern on these matters. There are in fact a number of members of the opposition who are supporters of removing discrimination from Commonwealth laws. At one point, some were very strong supporters indeed. For instance, there was an article published in the Sydney Morning Herald on 13 August last year entitled, 'Turnbull takes on mission for gay and lesbian rights'. In terms of advancing that mission, it said:Malcolm Turnbull has embarked on a personal crusade to convince his cabinet colleagues to allow same-sex couples the same legal and financial rights as heterosexual married and de facto couples.Indeed, consistent with those views, during the election campaign, in an interview with the Wentworth Courier he is reported to have said in response to a question about removing discrimination:This is a policy initiative that I have championed for a long time.We have got a champion for the cause here! Again, consistent with those views, on the front page of a newsletter to the electorate of the member for Wentworth - I assume this was during the election campaign - which again highlighted the article from the Sydney Morning Herald, the honourable member for Wentworth was quoted as saying:While some important reforms to superannuation have been made there remain a number of legal and financial rights available to heterosexual couples not available to same-sex couples. That is not fair, and since my election I have sought to address and overcome this discrimination. I have pledged to continue this fight until justice is done.That article has a reference to an annual dinner and the honourable member is quoted in his newsletter as saying, 'We both enjoyed the Aurora annual dinner a few weeks ago and I was pleased that the auction item which I donated - dinner with me and Lucy - raised around $6,000 for Aurora' - a very worthy organisation. It is a wonderful thing that some people can afford $6,000 for a dinner. That is a terrific thing, and I am sure it was a wonderful dinner. But the reality is that as a result of the opposition delaying the passage of this legislation - the Commonwealth reforms to remove same-sex discrimination from superannuation laws - there will be many people who will be unable to afford dinner, and that potentially includes children. In the assessment of focus groups on this self-proclaimed champion on these issues, I think they would find a very lacklustre crusade and a very disappointing mission. I remind the honourable member of the commitment he gave to his electorate and I look forward to the opposition supporting this legislation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The government's budget measures relating to pensioners and carers have been detailed on a number of occasions by the Treasurer and me. They cover what we have done on the utilities allowance and additional assistance with telephone connections - internet connections for older people - and a range of other measures as well for pensioners, carers and those on the DSP. There are some 2.2 million age pensioners in the country, some 700,000-plus on the DSP and a significant number of carers. These are a very important group of Australians and we are therefore working through not just the budget measures which have been delivered - and many of those payments have already commenced - but also long-term retirement incomes policy. We have put that before the Henry commission to ensure that that can be appropriately deliberated on in the context of overall tax reform which we need to do in the long term.I find it puzzling that the member for McPherson would stand up and ask this question on the matter of pensions. When asked in a debate, 'Was it Liberal Party policy to increase the base rate of the pension?' the honourable member for McPherson said yes. It lasted as a Liberal Party commitment for about 30 minutes, because, when challenged about the new policy on pensions advocated by the member for McPherson, the member for Wentworth - the alternative leader of the Liberal Party - said about half an hour later, 'Well, we have not got a policy to raise the base rate of the pension.'Â  So from Steve Price, 'So you don't have a policy that supports a rise in the base rate of the pension?' the answer from Malcolm Turnbull was, 'No, we have not formed a new policy.' 'The opposition is now endorsing an increase in the base rate of the pension' - that is what Margaret May said. 'Yes, absolutely'.What you had within one day was the classic flip, flop, flap we have seen from those opposite, not just on the question of pensions policy but also on the question of excise: 5c, 10c, 20c, no sense! On the question of the means testing of social security payments: do they believe in means testing or do they not believe in means testing? Are we going to have an emissions-trading scheme? Are we going to have one before the rest of the world? Are we going to have one with the rest of the world? Are we going to include petrol? Some say yes; others say no. The opposition - the Liberal Party - is an absolute shambles on every element of public policy.Â  Those opposite should use the July and August period to bring about some policy coherence, rather than embark upon the politics of smear and fear, which are their first courses of action.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Through the budget, we have built a $22 billion surplus to fight inflation and put downward pressure on interest rates. The opposition, through their irresponsible actions up in the Senate, are trying to punch a huge hole in that surplus. Let us have a look at what they are blocking. They are blocking increasing the Medicare levy surcharge threshold, which will remove a tax slug on middle-income earners. That is what they are doing - effectively a tax increase. They are also politicking with the condensate measure, which could cost the budget $177 million in terms of delay; if blocked altogether, it could cost the budget to $2.5 billion. How irresponsible is that? Their delay on the luxury car tax threatens a $22 million hole from delay, but if it is blocked it will cost $555 million.Something rare happened in the House last night. There was 10 minutes of economic responsibility from the Liberal Party. After seven months of irresponsibility, we had 10 minutes of responsibility last night. Last night they let through an important compliance measure to stop rorting in the welfare system. They were going to block it but, when we highlighted it, they were shamed into supporting it. Good on them - 10 minutes in seven months is not bad!Perhaps the member for Wentworth ought to convene another focus group. He can ask them what they want the Liberal Party to do. What would families want? They would want lower inflation. They would want lower interest rates. All of that is threatened by the actions of the Liberal Party in the Senate. We on this side of the House understand the importance of fighting inflation. We understand the importance of getting interest rates down. What the Liberal Party is doing in the Senate is pushing up inflation and interest rates. It has a chance this afternoon to stand up in the Senate and be responsible. Let this vital legislation through and send it down to the House so that the Australian people can get full responsibility from their government - a full attack on inflation, doing something about interest rates in the long term. The Liberal Party is completely irresponsible.</DOC>

 - Brendan, if I were you, mate, when it comes to watching, I would be watching my back! I would be watching my back very closely over the next few months. Up there, over there and even over here - you have been a bad boy, Joe!The government makes no excuse for commissioning expert advice on future policy settings when we need it. My recollection is that it said in the set of annual reports tabled by the previous government at the end of last year that there were something in the order of 400 to 500-plus reports, inquiries and commissions undertaken by those opposite in the last financial year alone. That is an extraordinary number. So I would suggest to those opposite it is not abnormal for the executive in government to seek professional advice. We are in exactly the same category and we are doing that through commissions of inquiry and the like. For example, we make no excuse for the fact that in the 2020 Summit there was a national call for us, after 12 years of inaction, to work towards -  - a seamless national economy, a seamless national market, and also to undertake the first root and branch review of Australia's national taxation system in a quarter of a century. We make no apology at all for the fact that we have commissioned Ken Henry of the Treasury to undertake the Henry commission of inquiry. Our tax system - The member for Cowan then left the chamber. - our income support system and our retirement income system need a root and branch review for their long-term future. We make no apology for the fact that we have also commissioned external advice to assist us with the large, long-term policy reform process which emissions trading represents. A question was asked about why we are seeking this advice now. Those opposite did not use their 12 years in office to act productively on climate change. Rather, they swept the issue away, only to panic at five minutes to midnight and do a little bit on emissions trading and then walk away from it after the election. That is another reason why we have been required to commission external advice on various aspects of the emissions trading and climate change debate. We make no apology for the way in which we intend to govern. We make no apology for the fact that we are governing for Australia's long-term future. We make no apology for the fact that our horizon for this country is very much what we can do for Australia in the decade ahead and not just in the week or month ahead or the next focus group ahead, as seems to be the preoccupation of the member for Wentworth. Instead, we will plan for Australia's long-term future. We intend to govern for Australia's long-term future. I would suggest that those opposite are very much anchored in the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question. Today is the last day of the budget session, and it is therefore appropriate to take stock of the budget and, indeed, the opposition's response to the budget. The budget had three central features: a $22-billion surplus designed to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates; over $40 billion invested in three large funds for the investment in infrastructure that this country has lacked for so long and so desperately needs from its national government to increase our economic capacity; and a $55-billion package of initiatives for working people, including at the heart of those initiatives very substantial tax cuts.The opposition response to the budget has consisted of a number of things. First, a complete and utter refusal to engage in debate about the macroeconomic settings in Australia - a complete refusal to indicate what level of surplus they believe is appropriate to fight inflation and to put downward pressure on interest rates and a complete refusal to engage in debate about investment in the nation's long-term future through investment in infrastructure and skills. The second element of their response has been to take as many positions as possible on issues in order to avoid the responsibility and the scrutiny of having a single position and in order to cover up the fact that they are engaged in a life and death internal struggle over the leadership of the Liberal Party - not just between the member for Wentworth and the Leader of the Opposition but also with the member for Higgins lurking in the background, hoping against hope that the world economy will collapse, that circumstances will change and that the entire Australian nation will come begging at his door asking him to fulfil the mantle that has always been his by birthright. So the Leader of the Opposition not only has to deal with the member for Wentworth snapping at him day in, day out; he also has the member for Higgins waiting, hoping, that the world economy will collapse. The third element of their response has been to block and delay budget initiatives to undermine the government's inflation-fighting settings and to undermine the government's long-term investment in infrastructure and skills.In fact, the opposition has just blocked another budget savings measure in the Senate - the measure to end tax deductibility for donations to political parties. We might ask why they have done this. We might ask: who benefits from this? Are these donations being made predominantly by low-income people? Are they being made by working people, by battling working families? I do not think so. They are being made by high-income earners - by the kind of people that we all know the Liberal Party truly represents. That is who they are being made by. -  - We need to see this action to block a significant savings measure in the budget in the context of another decision taken by the Liberal Party, the opposition, a couple of weeks ago to send off to a committee for over a year a measure to reduce the threshold for disclosure of political donations from the current $10,000 figure. They are committed to achieving a situation where wealthy Australians can make big political donations in secret and get a free kick from the tax commissioner at the same time.In conclusion, the random sniping at the budget measures that we have seen from the opposition is unworthy of a party that seeks to form government. If you parade yourself around, as the Leader of the Opposition does, as the alternative government - and that is a phrase that he likes to use - you have a responsibility to act like an alternative government. It is not a badge you put on yourself; it is a badge that you earn. You earn that by engaging with the debate on the big issues that are facing this country. That is when you are entitled to call yourself an alternative government. The Rudd government is addressing the big issues facing Australia: investing in infrastructure, building a high-speed broadband network, tackling the skills crisis, putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates, tackling climate change, reintroducing fairness into the workplace and getting better living standards for working people in this country. I will leave it to the Australian people to decide who the serious players are in Australian politics. It is certainly not the opposition. I call on them to stop their blocking and obstructive tactics and to engage in the debate about the future of this nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. Today I am very pleased to announce that the government has met yet another of its election commitments: an official national observance day of the Battle for Australia. Members on all sides would be aware of the push over a number of years for a better understanding of what occurred around Australia, and particularly to our north, during the Pacific war. I note that we are talking about a national mobilisation that involved the entire population of some seven million people. With respect to this initiative, the battles normally referred to are those that occurred on the Kokoda Track and around Papua New Guinea and Northern Australia - and members know of the terrible bombings; there were over 60 in Darwin and hundreds were killed - as well as the Battle of the Coral Sea and various others around Northern Australia. To recognise this officially was a commitment made some years ago by the Labor Party when it was in opposition, and it remained part of our policy at the last election. The official promulgation of this day, as authorised by the Governor-General, therefore meets a commitment that was an important part of our program.I want to particularly acknowledge the work of the RSL and the Battle for Australia national committee, whom I had the pleasure of having a cup of tea with this morning as part of this announcement. They, and many World War II veterans, are very pleased to see this initiative coming to fruition. There will be a series of activities and commemorations occurring around the date - which will be the first Wednesday in September each year - to acknowledge the sacrifice, courage and national effort that we can all be proud of. I urge all members, and I am sure all members will know that we have taken this decision, to ensure that this day is properly commemorated and properly acknowledged and that there is a better understanding of what occurred to our forebears when they defended our country at a time of very great need.</DOC>

 - You would think the honourable member would know - although this seems to indicate that he does not - that, when we are dealing with large-scale programs in government, letters are electronically generated and the details are provided through the department in order to ensure that the details are provided to the groups. They are electronic signatures. - In those circumstances, as the member for Dunkley would know, this is a standard process employed by the department. It has been employed on more than one occasion in the past - and is certainly what occurred in his ministry - for grant programs of this nature. -  - This gives me an opportunity to say that this government is very proud of what it is doing to assist veterans in our community. This government fully supports providing assistance to communities and ex-service organisations through the grant programs provided by my department. Those departmental funds are provided on behalf of the government to very many important groups.The member for Fadden then left the chamber. - The question I have to ask the member is: is he serious about informing groups in his own area or is he just trying to score a cheap political point? -  - If he were serious about ensuring that these matters were handled correctly and sensitively then he might have raised this with me privately. He chose not to and he sought to make a grubby political point. This is not the first time for that side of the House, as we can tell from the interjection before provided by someone in the advisers' box. But, once again, these things sometimes happen.The programs we are talking about here provide excellent support to the ex-service community. They are certainly welcomed on this side of the House. If they are not by that side of the House, they ought to make that clear. I am very proud to be the minister delivering a budget on behalf of this government at a record level, building on the commitments we made in opposition that were belatedly endorsed by the now opposition when they were the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is committed to a program of long-term reform for the nation. Part of that reform program is what we do in partnership with the states and territories. Of course, the government in its first six months in office has been focused on honouring its pre-election commitments. The government has been focusing on the delivery of a sound and responsible budget.Prior to the election we said to the Australian people that we would bring forward a $44 billion tax package for Australians. As a result of the election we have honoured that commitment. Prior to the election we said that we would increase the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. Since the election we have honoured that commitment. Prior to the election we said we would introduce an education tax refund. Subsequent to the election, through the budget we have honoured that commitment. We said prior to the election that, when it comes to the future of the hospital system, we would assist by investing funds to deal with elective surgery waiting lists for the public hospital system of Australia. Subsequent to the election we have honoured that commitment by investing $300 million to try to reduce those elective surgery waiting lists.Prior to the election we said that we would embark upon an education revolution by investing in computers and schools and, since the election, we have provided the first tranche of grants to more than 800 schools across the nation. Prior to the election we said that we would begin work on a rollout of trades training centres for Australian secondary schools across the nation and, subsequent to the election, we are honouring that commitment. Prior to the election we said that we would invest in the capital needs of Australia's universities and, in our first budget, we have honoured that commitment by delivering a half billion dollar additional allocation to Australia's 30-plus universities.Prior to the election we said that we would invest in the nation's infrastructure. Since the election we have established Infrastructure Australia. We have established the Building Australia Fund and we have allocated $20 billion to that fund. Prior to the election we said that we would invest in the nation's long-term education future and, since the budget and since the election, we have established an $11 billion Education Investment Fund. We said prior to the election that we would not pass the buck on the future of the public hospitals system, that we would invest in their capital needs in the future. Since the election we have, through the budget, established a $10 billion hospital investment fund for the future. Prior to the election we said that we would make it impossible for people like the member for Menzies to prosecute -  - Each of these measures, at least in large part, deals with cooperation with the states and territories invariably through the COAG process, and I can understand why members opposite could not understand what cooperation meant, because their preferred default position in politics is always the blame game. Prior to the election - and I am glad the member for Menzies has taken an intervention - we committed to making it impossible to make AWAs in the future and, since the election, we have honoured that commitment. Prior to the election we said that we would introduce national employment standards and, since the election, we have honoured that commitment. Prior to the election we said that we would ratify -  - Prior to the election we also, as a responsible party in government, said that we would not engage in conduct of the type that we saw from the member for Menzies during the election campaign in relation to certain groups within this country. Any civilised country would not do that. -  - The other thing we said prior to the election was that we would withdraw our combat forces from Iraq. We have honoured that commitment. Prior to the election we said in relation to the states and territories that a framework for responsible economic management -  - It seems to be difficult for those opposite to contemplate a list of positive achievements that deal with the future of the nation. A permanent psychology of negativity permeates those opposite. We said prior to the election that we were engaged -  - In dealing with the future of the Federation, the cornerstone of that, of course, is the soundness of public finances. -  - The fundamentals for the future of the Federation consist in the sound management of the national finances of Australia. Prior to the election we committed to govern on the question of public finance as economic and fiscal conservatives. Since the election, to the chagrin of those opposite, we have honoured that commitment with a $22 billion surplus in contrast to a proposed $22 billion raid on that surplus by those opposite. We are implementing our pre-election commitments. We have brought down a responsible budget, and we are engaged in a big policy agenda for the future. The member for Hume and the member for Tangney then left the chamber. 
 - In building on these foundations of a sound budget, a responsible budget, and looking to the future reform agenda for the period ahead: firstly, there is the tax reform agenda, through the Henry commission; secondly, there are the emissions trading reforms, which we have been debating in part in this chamber during the course of this day and which are of great consequence to the country's future economic direction; and, thirdly, there is the bold program of microeconomic reform that will be advanced through the Council of Australian Governments. COAG is designed to be a workforce for the nation and should be used as such. That is why, when this government came in, we planned ahead and commissioned five meetings of the Council of Australian Governments, starting from the end of last year. Working groups on health and ageing, the productivity agenda, climate change and water, infrastructure, business regulation and competition, housing and Indigenous reform -  - That is why when we met as COAG we agreed to establish those seven working groups - positive programs of long-term economic and social reform of a type which those opposite could not spell, let alone execute. And building on that, as of the March 2008 COAG, the Commonwealth provided a meaty allocation of $1 billion to relieve pressure on public hospitals, reversing the national trend of Commonwealth cutbacks to public hospitals - something which those opposite would prefer not to hear about. Secondly, despite the fact that they made great fanfare last year about the establishment of a Murray-Darling reform commission and a single entity for the governance of the basin, it took this government at the March 2008 COAG to establish that single entity. On top of that, COAG agreed on a national registration and accreditation system for health professionals as a major step in health workforce reform. Furthermore, on the business deregulation front, 27 areas of work were commissioned. And furthermore again, COAG agreed to the distribution of $150 million to build homes for homeless people.This is a solid policy program of reform. It is about the nation's future. It is about governments working with each other rather than just blaming each other. It is about where Australia wants to be in three years time, in five years time and in 10 years time. It responds to a deep mood in the country where people are fed up to the back teeth of governments simply blaming each other for everything that goes wrong. Instead, they have an expectation that people will behave maturely and responsibly in cooperation to provide answers, not excuses, to the long-term, intractable problems which our nation faces.As we approach the 3 July meeting of COAG, again this program of reform faces the nation and we will be embracing it once again across the policy agenda. We will be dealing with early childhood education but also with the future of the skills agenda and the deregulation agenda. Those opposite prefer instead the politics of smear and fear. I recall those opposite saying that they were united by one thing - hatred, hatred of the Labor Party. What unites this side of politics is a positive vision for the nation's future. We are committed to it and we will implement it. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - The challenges we face as an economy are in part globally driven and are in part a product of some of the economic conditions we inherited. That is just the truth of it. Let's go to the global conditions. The global economic conditions, which have come off the back of the global financial crisis starting in August of last year, 12 months ago, continue to wash through. We have revisions down for growth forecasts in the United States, across the European Union, in Japan and also in the wider East Asian area as well. The roll-on consequences of that therefore are that we have a lesser pace of economic activity than was projected 12 months ago. That is just the facts as they present themselves. The other factor alive in the global economy is of course global oil prices. We have this significant spike in global oil prices in recent months, the third great oil shock since the two great oil shocks of the 1970s. That in turn has fuelled a further factor in overall global economic conditions which is, of course, the hike in global food prices. These factors combined have brought about significant pressures across the global economy.That is what has happened globally. Then we go to the factors that we have inherited locally, here in Australia, as of the end of last year. There are three very uncomfortable facts that I would present to those opposite. One is this: when this government assumed office eight months ago after those opposite had spent 12 years in office, we inherited inflation running at a 16-year high. Secondly, we inherited a record from those opposite of 10 interest rate rises in a row. That is what happens when you allow inflation to get out of control; that is what happens when you put all the pressure on monetary policy through a slack fiscal policy - you get 10 interest rate rises in a row. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, as he begins to lecture the House on economic policy: look carefully into the eyes of Australian mums and dads and those who are seeking to make ends meet out there and ask them about the cumulative impact of 10 interest rate rises in a row. It is significant. Thirdly, at the point at which this government took over, those interest rates were the second highest in the developed world.There are three facts: firstly, we had inflation running at a 16-year high; secondly, we had 10 interest rate rises in a row; and, thirdly, we had the second highest interest rates in the developed world. Those are the economic conditions that this government inherited, which is why, as we approached the budget this year, having been in office for less than six months, the overall call on us from the country at large was a policy of responsible economic management grounded in a strong budget surplus. We delivered that with a $22 billion surplus. That surplus has subsequently been the subject of, shall we say, an attempted raid by those opposite, and it is going to be very interesting indeed to see where the credibility stakes now hang in this place in terms of those opposite and their behaviour in the Senate as they begin to launch their assault on this nation's best fiscal preparedness for what will be uncertain global economic times ahead.</DOC>

 - The challenges that have been reflected around the country have also been reflected abroad. The most recent revisions to growth projections in the United States, according to the IMF bulletin of July 2008, are for growth to be just 1.3 per cent. European countries are forecast to grow at just 1.7 per cent and Japan is forecast to grow at 1.5 per cent. Of course, in recent times we have seen negative quarters of growth from a number of developed economies as well. These are very difficult global economic circumstances due to the factors that I referred to. Therefore, the challenge that we face is what sort of policy response we adopt nationally and internationally in response to these difficult economic circumstances.Firstly, on the question of the global financial crisis, objectively there is a problem in terms of credit availability. That is true. That is why the Treasurer and other representatives of the government have been actively engaged in the international financial forums, including the Financial Stability Forum and the G-20 as well as the IMF, to embrace a series of prospective reforms for the global financial system aimed at acting on regulatory transparency across global financial markets. We face a real challenge on this score because if global political leaders do not lend their political support to the reform proposals coming out of the international financial institutions then the problems which have become alive through the US subprime crisis will continue for longer than they need to. That is the objective we have for credit availability and the cost of credit.Because of its impact on the real economy, you therefore have a roll-on consequence for confidence in the global economy as well. Whether you are looking at business and consumer confidence indicators in the United States, in the United Kingdom, in continental Europe or elsewhere, what we have is a roll-on assault on confidence across the global economy. Here in Australia our response is anchored, of course, in the strong budget outcome which we delivered as a result of the Treasurer's statement to the parliament in May - that $22 billion budget surplus which I referred to before. Secondly, in order to assist working families, pensioners and carers across this country we have also, through the budget, delivered a $55 billion working family support package, in addition to further payments for pensioners, for carers and for those on the disability support pension.There are many people across this country who counselled us prior to the delivery of the May budget that it would be irresponsible to deliver on tax cuts. We believe that those tax cuts were the right policy setting and we certainly believe that it is the right policy setting now because families, individuals, pensioners and carers in the Australian community are doing it tough. Therefore, by producing on the one hand a fiscally responsible document based on a $22 billion surplus - through a disciplined approach to spending control as reflected in the actions of the finance minister and the Treasurer in the preparation of the budget outcome - we were able to deliver on those significant tax cuts, as well as other payments to working families, pensioners and carers.The third reason why we have confidence in our economic course ahead for Australia is that in the East Asian hemisphere we continue to be the beneficiaries of significantly high terms of trade because of the prices that continue to be generated for our commodity exports in this part of the world. Finally, we have in this country - and we should be proud of this fact - first-class economic and financial regulators. If we look at some of the regulatory performances elsewhere on the planet in recent times, I think that the performance on the part of our regulators has been first class, and that provides us with confidence going forward. We therefore have crafted an economic policy direction about which we have confidence for the future. We believe, therefore, that we can see Australia through these times of global economic uncertainty and that the Australian economy will emerge through these difficulties in a strong condition.In terms of the threats which we face to that course of action, I return to the matter I touched on before, and that is the impending assault on this government's budget surplus. If there is a single lesson which comes out of the global economic conditions which we have had to confront in recent times, it is that a strong fiscal position providing the government with a strong fiscal buffer to deal with contingencies as they arise is of fundamental importance. We have brought about a $22 billion budget surplus. We were still able to deliver a $55 million package for working families and additional payments for pensioners and carers. On top of that, we set aside funds for three major investment funds for the future: for infrastructure, for education and for health and hospitals. But if you start to eke away and undermine and cause to be threatened the fiscal surplus which the government delivers through the budget then these certainties begin to be removed. The Liberals at present are threatening at least a $3.7 billion hole in the budget and it depends, of course, on their internal political deliberations as to how much higher that will go. But we have now reached the point of truth and honesty: what will the Liberals now do in the Senate? Will they take the side of economic responsibility and side with the government in ensuring that we have a strong fiscal buffer for the future or will they take the path of economic irresponsibility, take the path of short-term populist politics instead and conduct a populist driven assault on the budget bottom line? That is the course of action, they are the choices, which those opposite face, and their statements to date give us no confidence at all.I conclude with this: in these difficult economic times the worst thing you can do is blow a hole in the budget. If you are facing uncertain global economic times ahead, the worst thing you can do is send a message of uncertainty to the international economic and financial community about whether this government's budget is going to pass the parliament and whether its surplus is going to remain intact. In times of global economic uncertainty, governments and economies around the world look for signs and clear demonstrations of strength and resolve. We have produced that through the budget, but that certainty and resolve is now under threat by those opposite as they seek to assault the budget surplus which we so carefully crafted in the budget of May.</DOC>

 - It is pretty interesting to watch the unfolding barney among those opposite on the future of the CPRS, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and its application across the economy. I presume the reference here on the part of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is in relation to the proposed new taxation arrangements for condensate. I say to those opposite that either you are serious about economic responsibility or you are not. I say to those opposite, as they seek to pursue populist politics on this, that either you are serious about adhering to the budget bottom line or you are going to continue to allow a tax loophole for a particular category of production to sustain itself into the future, a tax concession introduced at the original time for a specific purpose which has now expired.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Our budget struck the right balance, given the difficult global conditions out there and the difficult domestic conditions that we inherited. That is why we built a strong surplus. We built a strong surplus, a $22 billion surplus, as a buffer against international turmoil and to fund the investment for the future that those opposite would never fund. - We built it also to make room for the Working Families Support Package, $7 billion in tax cuts this year, $10 billion next year and $14 billion the year after. In addition to that, we will provide extra relief for families, particularly when it comes to child care. The approach that we adopted in our first budget has been strongly endorsed by the International Monetary Fund. I will just go through and read what they had to say: 'The reduction in public spending growth in the latest budget illustrates the government's commitment to help reduce inflation,' and 'will take pressure off monetary policy in the near term'. That is what the IMF had to say about our budget.Those opposite had a lot to say about our budget as well. I recall the member for Wentworth, for example, saying before the budget that we did not need to cut. The member for Wentworth said we did not need to build a big surplus. Mr Speaker, you might then recall that after the budget he said, 'Oh no, they did not cut hard enough; what we needed to do was to have a bigger surplus.' Of course, now the member for Wentworth's position is we do not need a big surplus. He has got it wrong three times in a row. He is out there trying to argue that we do not need a significant surplus in these global conditions. We do. They are trying to blow a $6.2 billion hole in the surplus. We have heard today that they are going to block the condensate measure. We have heard that today. This is the height of economic irresponsibility, given the global conditions that we are facing at the moment. It is about time they put the national interest before their short-term political interest.</DOC>

 - The first thing it does is build our surplus - absolutely critical in this environment. Let me tell you about this -  -  - In May we delivered a responsible budget, a budget to build a $22 billion surplus to act as a buffer against international uncertainty and to fund global investment into the future. But it was also a budget which cut tax. Tax as a percentage of GDP came down; it came down overall. Those people over there cannot accept the fact that we brought down a responsible budget that built a significant surplus to tackle inflation, to fund investment for the future and to deliver fairness to working families. - But what do they choose? They choose to stand up for people buying luxury cars but not for lower interest rates for working families. That is where they are. They choose to stand up for particular oil companies instead of standing up for Australian families who need lower interest rates and critical investment in education and infrastructure. That is where they are. They are not with the working families of Australia who are getting the tax cuts that they made them wait years and years and years for. They are out there defending the alcohol industry, they are out there defending the luxury car industry and they are out there defending windfall profits for oil companies. We know whose side they are on, and it is not the Australian people's.</DOC>

 - It is very important to pass these budget measures in full, to provide a buffer against global turmoil, to ensure the Reserve Bank has room to move. What those opposite want to forget about is the 12 interest rate rises on the trot - 10 of them under them. That is what has put Australian families under tremendous financial pressure. Their 10 interest rate rises in a row are slowing the Australian economy, and they will not admit to that. This is happening at a time of great global uncertainty, and the one thing this nation needs in these circumstances is a strong surplus - a strong surplus to give the Reserve Bank room to move so it can take pressure off interest rates to get those financial pressures off Australian families. And what are we getting from those opposite? They are going to vandalise the surplus at this stage to the tune of possibly $6 billion.Now I have heard it all from the Leader of the Opposition. He had this to say on Sunday. He said he was not in the business of 'writing blank cheques' and he was not into 'knee-jerk responses'. The farce over their response to all these budget measures has gone on for weeks but now we know where they stand. They stand with the alcohol industry against doing something against teenage binge drinking. They stand with the luxury car industry. They do not stand with this side of the House, which wants to put downward pressure on interest rates for working families. Now we find they are going to defend the indefensible: they are going to continue with a huge tax break for one particular oil company at the expense of the Australian people.I do not really know anymore who takes the decisions over on their side of the House. You have got the Leader of the Opposition, one of the three stooges, who can't do his job; you have got the member for Wentworth, who can't get the job; and of course you have got the member for Higgins, who hasn't got the courage to take the job. - The member for North Sydney then left the chamber. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. We now have a fourth position. The question was about inflation. It is a very serious question, because we are dealing with a serious inflationary problem in this country. It reached a 16-year high in October, November and December last year. Those opposite may want to deny that they had anything to do with it or that their policies had contributed to it. But we are dealing with it, which is what we did in our budget on 13 May, which was to build up a significant surplus, to restrain public demand and to stop their reckless spending in the interests of Australians who are carrying very, very high mortgage rates. The legacy of those opposite is 10 interest rate rises in a row and absolutely fantastic financial pressure on Australian families. They might want to pretend that the election did not happen last year on 24 November. They might like to pretend it did not occur at the end of last year. They might like everyone out there to believe that, suddenly, inflation just emerged on 25 November last year. They might like to pretend that it did not happen. Well, it did and we are dealing with it. One of the ways we are dealing with it is by building a significant surplus. -  - That is right - we are. We have responsibilities to fulfil to the Australian people. The irresponsible actions of the opposition in the Senate will plunder that surplus, will limit the capacity of the government to deal with inflationary pressures and will limit the capacity of the Reserve Bank. That will be on the heads of all of those opposite if they continue with this sort of irresponsible behaviour. But it gets worse than that. They will not put up their hands and accept responsibility for inflation being at a 16-year high. They will not put up their hands and accept any responsibility for the capacity constraints in the Australian economy, which are feeding through into inflation. They now want to deny that there are international and global factors which are slowing the Australian economy and which are also putting upward pressure on rates domestically. They simply want to deny that.The member for Higgins said last week that, if he were in office now, the international financial crisis would not have happened. He said that, if he were in office now, there would not be a crisis in our stock markets. That is how ridiculous the opposition have become - no credibility and no consistency. On this side of the House we will do the responsible thing, and the responsible thing was done on 13 May in our budget - producing a sizeable surplus, putting in place spending and planning for the long term. Their short-term politics are playing havoc with the national interest. They should get on our side in the Senate and support our surplus.</DOC>

 - As I indicated earlier, in the budget we reduced taxation overall. The tax to GDP ratio went down. That might be another inconvenient fact which those opposite want to stick their heads in the sand and ignore, but it is a fact. But what is even worse is that they are not prepared to face up to their responsibilities when it comes to dealing with teenage binge drinking. They will not face up to that at all. This government will face up to it, because the loophole left by the former Treasurer led to an explosion in teenage binge drinking when it came to alcopops. A 250 per cent increase - we are dealing with it in a responsible way. We are dealing with it with the support of the police commissioners and with the support of all the responsible health authorities out there. But, once again, we have this rank irresponsibility from those opposite, which reflects very poorly on them and shows that there is not a shred of economic credibility left in any of them.The member for Kalgoorlie then left the chamber</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. There are a number of reasons why it is very important to have a strong surplus in the budget settings. There are a couple that are particularly import-ant. Firstly, this is in order to ensure that the budget is putting downward pressure on interest rates. We inherited an inflationary bud-get setting, with spending growing at five per cent per annum in real terms. We have shifted that growth down to one per cent per annum. Secondly, it is very important that we have a strong surplus to build the infrastructure investment funds that the government has put in place: the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund, which will invest in the long-term productive infrastructure that this nation needs to invest in. It will invest in national broadband, it will invest in major upgrades of hospitals, it will invest in new university infrastructure and it will invest in major transport - road and rail - infra-structure around this nation. That is why the emphasis in the budget was on the long-term economic prosperity of this country - not the irresponsible, short-term, politically-driven spending that had characterised recent budgets.The opposition is threatening to blow a serious hole in this surplus by its behaviour in the Senate. It is seeking to undermine the government's efforts to assist the Reserve Bank in the struggle to keep interest rates as low as possible, and it is also seeking to undermine the government's ability to build the surpluses that will be invested in that long-term infrastructure for the nation's future. I note that the opposition appear to believe that, somehow, nothing that has happened since 24 November reflects in any way on anything that they did before 24 November of last year. Alan Mitchell, a respected commentator in the Financial Review, who has, from time to time, criticised Labor governments rather vociferously - and who certainly could not be seen as a biased commentator - observed on 6 August:If any politician is to blame for the current tight monetary policy and its consequences, it is Peter Costello.It is Peter Costello, the member for Higgins. So much for the suggestion that, somehow, the 12 interest rate increases in a row can be retrospectively attributed to the Rudd government.I note that, on the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition was calling on the government to make a major economic statement about the issues facing the nation. I think Laurie Oakes deserves a Gold Logie for keeping a straight face while he was interviewing him in response to this statement. It is the best example of projection that I have ever seen. There is definitely a need for a major economic statement in this parliament, but it is a statement from the opposition that is definitely needed. It is very clear where the government stands on the major issues of the day, whether it is the size of the budget sur-plus, cuts in government spending, climate change or investment in skills and infrastructure. But we do not know what the opposition believe is the appropriate level of the surplus. We do not know what they think the right setting for fiscal policy is. We do not know where spending cuts are going to be made by the opposition to pay for the billions and billions of dollars that they have already made in spending promises since the election. We do not know what agenda they have for long-term investment in the nation's infrastructure. We do not know what tax reform plans they have, and we certainly do not know what their climate change strategy is because we are not even sure whether they believe climate change is real or not.I note that the opposition is clothing its vandalism in the Senate in the guise of tax reform. I would make two points. One of the initiatives the opposition is opposing is, in fact, to remove a tax slug on middle-income Australians - namely, the Medicare surcharge levy, which was introduced by the government to apply to high-income earners. Because it was not indexed it has gradually come to apply to people earning $50,000 per year, who the opposition apparently still seems to think are high-income earners. Finally, Mr Speaker, if you look at the statistics in the budget papers you will see that the proportion of the nation's economy going in tax from the federal government for this financial year, for the next one, for the one after that and the one after that is lower in each case than every one of the last six budgets of the Howard-Costello era. The tax take is lower under the Rudd government. It will continue to be lower.</DOC>

 - The most fundamental thing that we can do to reduce inflation is to build a significant budget surplus - absolutely. What we have got to do is make our economy much more productive. We have got to do something about the capacity constraints in this economy that were left to us by the previous government. The 20 warnings that the shadow minister opposite ignored when he was a minister of the Crown in the transport area signify more than anything the abject neglect of those opposite when it comes to real, longstanding, lasting action in the transport industry. Whilst they are frustrating our surplus, whilst they are blowing a hole in it, they cannot lecture anyone about inflation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. We are addressing the consequences of more than a decade of neglect in our skills system, which has led to a skills crisis around the nation. And of course when skills are short, when the economy is running at capacity, that does put upwards pressure on inflation and interest rates. As a Western Australian member, the member for Hasluck would see this on display in her state - people crying out for skilled labour and unable to get it, and all as a consequence of more than a decade of neglect.We have moved immediately to address skills shortages and the skills crisis through our Productivity Places Program, and I am pleased to report to the House that students con-tinue to take up these places. So far, around 42,000 people have enrolled in training through the program. These places started becoming available in April, and around 4,400 job seekers have finished their train-ing. So this is an urgent response to the skills crisis created by the neglect of the Liberal Party.If we are going to have a skills system which meets the needs of the future then people need to be trained in first-class, 21st century facilities. A huge problem around the country is that people are being trained in facilities better suited to the fifties and sixties than to the 21st century. You cannot learn modern-day skills if you do not have good facilities and good equipment to learn them on. The government has moved to immediately invest in the capital of our training system so people can learn in modern facilities with modern equipment.On 15 July, I was pleased to announce the successful schools for our first round of trades training centre funding; more than $90 million of funding was awarded to 34 projects involving 96 schools. I am also very pleased to inform the House that applications are open for the second round of funding. They opened on 23 July and will close on 17 October. There is $300 million available for allocation in that round - a huge investment in the training capacity of our schools.But, beyond our schools, we need to renew our vocational education and training system throughout. We need to make sure that the places where adults train are up to the standards of the 21st century. I am asked about the dangers facing our desire to invest in the vocational education and training system. I regret to inform the House that there is a big danger facing new investment in vocational education and training. We, in the recent budget, created a new Education Investment Fund, an $11 billion fund to renew capital in higher education and vocational education and training. That fund is in part the recipient of moneys from the budget surplus. In particular, $5 billion for the fund is coming from the surpluses in 2007-08 and 2008-09. So now we have not only the spectre of the Liberal Party in government giving this nation a skills crisis but also the spectre of them punching a hole in the surplus that is going into the Education Investment Fund, amongst other funds, to meet the long-term needs of this nation.The Liberal Party were never known for long-term planning; that is why we got the skills crisis. We are trying to renew our higher education and vocational education and training systems for the long term. In order to do that, our surpluses are going into nation-building funds, including the Education Investment Fund. In an act of economic vandalism, the Liberal Party, sitting opposite, are punching a hole in that surplus, and that means they are punching a hole in our ability to develop the productive capacity of our economy for the long term. What that means of course is that a huge hole in the budget surplus is going to cost this nation productive capacity in the long term. It is economic vandalism today and economic vandalism tomorrow from the Liberal Party. They are throwing the skills toolbox out the window for short-term politics, and Australians will judge them by it.</DOC>

 - The facts are very simple. Tax as a percentage of GDP in the budget is 23.8 per cent, down from 24.7 per cent. You can selectively quote any figure you like but you cannot escape from that one fact. While we are on it, the opposition are in here saying that they do not agree with tax increases anywhere. What about your proposal to abolish what we are going to do about the Medicare levy surcharge, imposing another tax on Australians? They are all hypocrites; they are all over the place; they do not have a standard position on anything.</DOC>

 - On budget night this government produced a responsible budget, and part of that, at its core, was the $22 billion surplus and the funds that were set aside for the future - for future education infrastructure, for future health infrastructure and, with the Building Australia Fund, for future infrastructure investment in broadband, roads, rail and ports. That investment was a direct response to the fact that the Reserve Bank had warned on 20 separate occasions of the capacity constraints in the economy placing pressure on inflation and interest rates and reducing our productivity.We also, of course, have established Infrastructure Australia, a body consisting of the private sector as well as levels of government, to develop and produce an infrastructure priority list in time for the COAG meeting in March 2009. But you cannot put funds from the surplus into funds to produce long-term investments if you then undermine the surplus. What those opposite are threatening to do - block the budget bills - will put a $6-plus billion potential hole in our surplus, therefore undermining our ability to invest in our long-term future. If these budget bills are not passed, funding for critical infrastructure will be lost.On budget night we also announced a number of feasibility studies into the sorts of nation-building projects that are required. The Gateway Motorway missing links in Brisbane - is that project necessary or not? The western metro in Sydney, the east-west link in Melbourne or public transport in Adelaide - all of these issues are potential investments based upon these feasibility studies. But you cannot invest for the future if you are undermining the budget surplus today. This government is absolutely committed to laying down the tracks for future investment in infrastructure. The opposition seem determined to derail our efforts by undermining the surplus. I call upon them to move on from their 12 years of inaction on infrastructure investment and not block budget measures in a way that is totally economically irresponsible not just for today but for our future economic prosperity.</DOC>

 - For the benefit and the information of those opposite, as we said at the time of the budget, the future dispensation of those funds from the Education Investment Fund, the Building Australia Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund will be done through the budget process in an entirely responsible fashion. That is the first point. The second point is this: we as a government believe in investing in this nation's economic future; we as a government believe in acting on the nation's infrastructure bottlenecks; we as a government believe in acting on the skills crisis. And do you know something? To do that does not come from nothing. It does not come cheap. You have to actually invest and lay money aside for it.If there is one howling critique out there in the community of those opposite as they, led by the member for Higgins, presided over this tidal wave of cash coming into the Australian economy off the back of the resources boom it is this: what did you do by way of productive investment for the future with that bucketload of cash? Answer: zero. That is despite the fact that they received 20 warnings from the Reserve Bank of Australia about infrastructure bottlenecks and skills crises and those two factors in turn further fuelling inflationary pressures in the economy and putting upward pressure on interest rates.So there are two core reasons to have acted responsibly in this fashion: the first is to do something about the macro economy - that is, to act on the overall supply-side constraints in the economy which are so much part and parcel of the 20 Reserve Bank warnings that those opposite ignored - and the second is to act decisively on the skills and infrastructure inputs for long-term productivity growth in the economy by setting aside investment funds for the future.In terms of macroeconomic responsibility, I also draw the attention of those opposite to the International Monetary Fund article IV consultation with Australia. It says in its bulletin released on 9 July:The reduction in public spending growth in the latest budget illustrates the government's commitment to help reduce inflation.I go to this question about the funds in question:Saving some of the revenue from the commodity price boom in three new funds will take pressure off monetary policy in the near term and enable increased infrastructure investment over the medium term.Those are exactly the economic policy underpinnings of what we are doing through this. I ask those opposite: why was it, year after year from 2001 on, when the coffers of this country ran full with the taxation receipts off the resources boom, that you did not invest it, as did other sensible, resource rich economies in the world, in the long-term productive capacity of Australia? You failed to do so. This government has the economic vision to act in this space, and you are condemned for failing to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for the question and actually thank her also for recently hosting the cabinet in her electorate and for hosting one of a number of GP superclinic consultations that have been held around the country. Over the last eight weeks, a lot has been happening in health. In particular, on 1 July a range of our election commitments signalled new services becoming available for Australians. These include $150 for a preventative dental check for teenagers under our new Medicare Teen Dental Plan. In just its first month, one in five dentists has already seen teenagers to conduct these checks. From 1 July, free health checks are being provided for four-year-olds - for those children who are getting ready to go to school - to make sure that they are healthy, happy and ready to learn. From 1 July, $400 is available for breast prostheses for women who have had a mastectomy and previously had to find the money to pay for those prostheses.So far, all of these initiatives, plus a range of others, are going well. After just six months of operation, our elective surgery plan has already delivered 14,000 extra procedures, well over half the target set for this year. After years of stagnation and frustration in the sector, we delivered a $136 million plan to boost organ donation across the country and save lives. Just last week, while I was in Western Australia, we launched our Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden program, so schools are now able to indicate their interest in becoming a demonstration school as part of our strategy to fight obesity amongst young children. Also last week, we announced $50 million of funding to improve cancer research, including support for Australian researchers to take part in the largest ever international effort to unlock the genetic secrets of cancer.I am sure nobody on the other side, let alone on our side, in this House would disagree that these are good initiatives, but the problem is that it is measures like these that are under threat because of the economic irresponsibility of the opposition. The government has built a budget surplus - the Treasurer has already taken the House through that - but if the opposition is determined to blow a huge hole in the budget we will not be able to keep providing many of the sorts of services I have just listed. If those opposite continue to oppose the Medicare levy surcharge, if they continue to refuse to remove a tax burden from people who are under pressure from the cost of living and if they are determined to side with the alcohol industry to play cheap politics, these sorts of initiatives are under threat. In the budget, we announced that a portion of our surplus would be invested in a new $10 billion Health and Hospitals Fund - the largest Australian investment in health infrastructure ever - but if the opposition continues to rip money from the surplus it is turning its back on that fund and all the benefits that it could deliver.Just think for a moment what that $10 billion could pay for: several state-of-the-art, major metropolitan hospitals; $6.2 billion, if all of the threats are followed through with, to fund over 600 GP superclinics across the country or unprecedented levels of investment in medical research facilities. This is not the time for us to be putting the economy at risk. It is not the time for us to be baulking at investing in the health system that was neglected for so long under the previous government. We need responsible economic management. We need people to think for the long term so we can deliver for the health and hospital infrastructure that is needed. We do not need these short-term, cheap political stunts from the opposition.</DOC>

 - It just shows that those opposite have not got a clue when it comes to the very basic elements of national economic policy - no understanding of the role of fiscal policy and no understanding of the role of monetary policy. I have already quoted what the IMF had to say about our budget and the role that it played in taking pressure off the Reserve Bank to get itself in a position to loosen monetary policy. Our surplus is absolutely fundamental in that and, if those opposite think they can blow a $6 billion hole in our surplus and it may not have any ramifications for future Reserve Bank decisions, they have another think coming. They are living on a different planet. We do still have in this community a substantial inflation challenge. One of the reasons the Reserve Bank is able to talk as it has been talking in recent times is that we put our budget together to take pressure off the Reserve Bank. - We said from day one we would tackle the inflation challenge. It was the right thing to do by the country. It was the right thing to do to get downward pressure on inflation so we could get downward pressure on interest rates. And that is what we have been doing, because we are dealing with the legacy of the 10 interest rate rises that occurred under the former government that have pushed interest rates to record highs. Those interest rates at record highs are slowing our economy and slowing our economy precisely at the time that international circumstances are also impacting. That is why the decisions taken in the Liberal party room yesterday are so utterly irresponsible and why those opposite should be condemned for their irresponsible behaviour.</DOC>

 - I thank my Victorian colleague the member for Corio for that question. Today the Victorian government has announced a significant package of reforms aimed at dramatically increasing the number of people able to access training and upgrade their skills. Of course, the Rudd Labor government is committed to reform of the nation's training system to drive productivity growth, increase workforce participation and address skills shortages. I have already outlined to the House some of the major new investments we are making which are threatened by those opposite, but amongst the reforms we want to achieve apart from those new investments is to ensure that Australia has a training system that is truly responsive to the needs of people and industry.We understand the need to build a highly skilled workforce to drive productivity and low inflationary growth in a modern economy. Of course, that was a reform direction neglected day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year by the Liberal Party when it was in office. We understand that, to grow our productive capacity and to compete in the international market, we depend increasingly on the supply of skilled workers, the availability of specialist knowledge and our innovation performance. This is true across all industries. It is true in financial services, in manufacturing, in mining, in health, in hospitality and in education. Lifting productivity and participation is essential for the future of this country and its long-term growth.Just as Australian businesses cannot compete if they are hamstrung by poor infrastructure, Australian businesses cannot compete if they are hamstrung by a lack of skilled labour. The Rudd government is committed to establishing a flexible national training system as a central priority. To do so, we are working cooperatively with state and territory governments through the Council of Australian Governments to deliver solutions to the nation's skills shortage. The Rudd Labor government does not believe in a 'one size fits all' approach, but we are committed to supporting all reforms that honour our election commitments to ensure we have a flexible and responsive training system for the future. We believe there are a number of ways the training sector can rise to these challenges, a number of roads of reform.To ensure that cost is not a barrier to students accessing training and that every Australian has the opportunity to improve their skills, irrespective of their own financial resources, I have announced today that the Commonwealth will support Victoria in the introduction of an income-contingent loan scheme for government-subsidised diploma and advanced diploma students. The Commonwealth will also meet the administrative costs of the scheme and we will not charge a loan fee to students. This will increase access for those without financial resources, boost the quality of courses and expand the number of places for students. It means more opportunities, more quality courses and more places for students. It also overcomes the current division between some diploma and advanced diploma courses which are VET FEE-HELP courses and others which are not. We currently have a fragmented system where some diploma courses and some advanced diploma courses are covered with VET FEE-HELP and some of them do not qualify.It may be staggering to realise, but there are around five million working-age Australians without a qualification at the certificate III level or above. We need to fix that through our education revolution. Can I congratulate Victoria on their commitment to increase investment and drive reform. They are working with the Rudd Labor government, and we will be working -  - with other states and territories on reform drives to improve our vocational education and training system. I know solving the skills crisis bores those opposite, but we are fixing 12 years of their neglect with an important step forward today in partnership with Victoria - something they clearly do not care about. Victorians will note their contempt for the skills development of Victorians.</DOC>

 - The government at present is engaged with the states, through the Council of Australian Governments, in a fundamental reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations. First of all, what we have done with our state colleagues is engage in a negotiation to collapse the number of specific-purpose payments from something near a hundred to something of a more manageable size. We are doing that because of the enormous compliance costs and therefore waste of taxpayers' money which exist in servicing each of those individual, fragmented specific-purpose payments. This, of course, was not of interest to the previous government, not of interest to the previous Treasurer, because it was simply allowed to languish there, despite the enormous inefficiencies of the system.That is one element of reform - collapse the number of specific-purpose payments and cut out the waste and duplication involved in the administration of those payments to the states. We are talking about tens of billions of dollars. The second reform is this: through national partnership payments, we intend to engage with the states and territories on specific new arrangements to encourage new areas of national economic reform in education, in health and in other areas, including Indigenous policy. This, we think, is an intelligent way to bring about a genuine program of long-term reform in the nation. That is why we will be embracing that as one of the frameworks that we will take to the next Council of Australian Governments and the one after that.I say in passing that we are turning the Council of Australian Governments into a workhorse for the federation, making it work and making it deliver results. Hard and grafting though the negotiations may be, we are producing results on the question of the Murray-Darling, results on the question of elective surgery and results on the question of the deregulation of business overregulation - again left unattended by those opposite because they simply found it too ho hum, too boring and, frankly, too inconsequential to worry about. We do not think that any of those things are inconsequential.As far as the payments to the three major investment funds for the future are concerned, we have made it quite clear that these are to drive future infrastructure development across Australia - new education infrastructure across Australia, for TAFEs and for universities, as well as for hospitals. As the Minister for Health and Ageing has just said, we are embarking, from the Commonwealth's point of view, on the single largest investment fund ever seen for the nation's public hospital system. Those opposite sought to withdraw Commonwealth activity from that area rather than add to it.Of course, as we deliberate on the use of those funds and consider the applications that come to the government through the advisory mechanism established under Infrastructure Australia, we will be entirely mindful of what co-investment arrangements state governments may wish to embrace. If you want to do something about infrastructure, for example, and the Building Australia Fund, and you want to know what states are going to do off their own kick and what they cannot do, we will not do what our predecessors did and say, 'So long, urban congestion is not a problem for us and we do not care.' The member for Higgins famously said that urban water was not a problem and it was simply buck-passed to the states. We have a different view, and that is Infrastructure Australia, the Building Australia Fund, $20 billion and, on top of that, a rational, reasoned approach through the advisory mechanism set up under Infrastructure Australia to properly disburse these funds. We will therefore act on one of the great constraints in the Australian economy.It is also important in the macroeconomic debate to take away supply-side constraints that have acted on inflation. It is the right course of action. Those opposite should think long and hard about their use of the term 'slush fund' in reference to an investment mechanism that will help Australians across the country dealing with challenges on their roads, dealing with challenges in their urban infrastructure, dealing with challenges in their ports and dealing with the fact that they gave this country one of the worst broadband networks in the developed world. It is as slow as the network in Slovakia but not quite as slow as the network in Slovenia. We intend to act on these things. Those opposite choose to bury their heads in the sand. That is why after 12 years of inaction on infrastructure - on investment in education infrastructure and investment in hospital infrastructure - we have a plan for the future. Those opposite have nothing but a rolling excuse for inertia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I begin by congratulating the wonderful Australian team for its inspiring Olympic performance. I think we all agree that the team has represented our nation with great honour and distinction. Of over 200 nations to compete in China, to finish sixth on the medal tally is a remarkable achievement and one that we should all be celebrating. Much to the disappointment of the House, I do not intend to name all of our medal recipients and all of those who com-peted on behalf of our country, nor do I have the opportunity to share all of the inspiring stories such as that of the truly heroic Anna Meares. But I will add my congratulations to those that have already been offered by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition.For the record, Australia won medals in 14 sports, which is the same number of sports as in Athens. We had 136 individual medallists in the team of 435. Incidentally, in comparison, Great Britain had 74 individual medallists. That again illustrates what a truly amazing performance Australia put in. I congratulate John Coates and the Australian Olympic Committee as well as the vast number of coaches, support staff and managers who have all given their time to assist our fabulous team. I thank those at the Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport who have worked so long and hard on behalf the government - both past and present - to prepare our teams and to support them while in China. I commend the wonderful parents and family members of our athletes. Of course, I also commend the magnificent athletes themselves who have filled so many of us with pride and inspiration. They truly are remarkable ambassadors for our nation. The government has made very clear its intention to remain close and very strong supporters of them long into the future. - I invite the member opposite to ask a question if he would like to discuss funding issues further. I am more than happy to discuss our government's intention to maintain our commitment to our athletes.Of course, much was also achieved off the sporting field. This government is working to promote sport across Australia from the grassroots to the elite level not only every four years at the Olympics when the eyes of the world shine on sport but indeed every year, all year around. We recognise that sport is incredibly powerful in delivering healthy role models for our community, addressing obesity levels and preventable diseases, promoting social inclusion and achieving educational outcomes. The Olympic Games is a time when many stakeholders from the sporting community gather in one venue and much can be achieved through negotiation with other government representatives or other stakeholders and sporting officials. I had the opportunity whilst in China to chair a meeting of the Commonwealth sports ministers. It is with great pleasure that I can report back to the parliament on a number of very important issues that were successfully resolved at the meeting. At the Commonwealth sports ministers meeting we agreed to a communique which, amongst other issues, strengthened the resolve of governments to tackle doping in sport in our regions - something that the member opposite might think is lightweight but that we think is very important to supporting and maintaining the integrity of sport. Whilst developed nations often need to take the lead on these issues, we must remain focused on ensuring that developing nations have also got successful antidoping measures in place in order to ensure that our athletes are competing on a level playing field.We gave our ongoing support to the work of the regional antidoping offices in Africa, the Caribbean and Oceania. We also recommended greater cooperation and information sharing amongst Commonwealth countries through the establishment of a new sports adviser position for the Commonwealth. We recognise that sport can be a mechanism for social change and economic advancement, particularly in developing countries. So this was an opportunity for us to have a look at some very successful programs across the Commonwealth such as the healthy benefits of sport in the Caribbean, the inclusive benefits of sport in India, an Australian program which is running in South Africa to increase participation rates, as well as the educational initiatives which are being progressed in the United Kingdom. It was agreed that we would work more cooperatively and share information rather than each of us reinventing the wheel on this. I also had the opportunity to meet with the British sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe. This meeting gained some coverage as a result of some other discussions which took place there. I would like to inform the House today that during that meeting we learned of -  -  - I would like to share with the House that this government is committed to promoting the position of women in Australian sport. I note that when the Senate did an inquiry into this issue a couple of years ago the previous government left the report sitting on a shelf gathering dust. I had the opportunity to discuss with the British sports minister our work and our commitment to promoting women in Australian sport. We have committed to working with the United Kingdom to progress these issues and ensure that we can strengthen this.We celebrate the success of the Olympics and of the Australian Olympic team. I would like to extend my heartfelt welcome home to them and wish them a well-earned break. Equally, I assure the parliament that this government is committed to ensuring that the energy and inspiration which have been provided by our athletes at the Olympic Games will be continually built upon, and we will ensure that we use that to continue to bring our sporting structures, from grassroots to elite level, up to the position where we can continue to prepare Australia for the challenges that will face us in the future.</DOC>

 - As Prime Minister of the country, I take responsibility for all the news in this country on the economy - good news, difficult news and bad news. That is what political leadership is about. Secondly, I would say this: in terms of statements made by the Leader of the Opposition, what I will not be saying is what someone said in a different place, in a different space but from this side of the parliament at that time, and that is that working families have never been better off. Our attitude is simply this -  -  - Our attitude is simply this: you can engage in that sort of political language, as Mr Howard as Prime Minister did, or you can engage in some very direct conversation with the Australian people about the challenges that we face, and the challenges we face are substantial. They are challenges which are substantial, derivative of what is occurring in the international economy. They are challenges which are substantial on the basis of the legacy of 12 years of neglect we inherited from those opposite. They are substantial because of the 10 interest rate rises that we had in a row, and substantial also because of the impact which those 10 interest rate rises in a row had on the level of activity in the Australian economy and, on top of that, on the overall confidence on the part of business and consumers in the economy.So either you can engage in some basic, straight conversation with the Australian people about the difficulties which exist in the Australian economy today or you can engage in the extravagant rhetoric of which those in the past were past masters. Our preference is very much the former, and this is why we will be upfront with the Australian people about the challenges Australia faces. We will be upfront with the Australian people about how we intend to deal with those challenges. We will be upfront with the Australian people about, for example, the fact that, if we are going to bring down greenhouse gas emissions, that will cost the economy, rather than pretending that it somehow can be done in a cost-free fashion. I believe the best way forward is to be upfront and straight with the Australian people about the challenges they face rather than plucking statements out of the air, as those opposition are so given to do.</DOC>

 - In terms of dealing practically with the challenges Australia faces for its economy and its long-term future, education is front and centre. If you go to our response to the economic challenges of today, they come at, at least, two or three levels. One level is our approach of responsible economic management to deal with global economic circumstances, anchored in a strong budget surplus, in order to put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. And, coming off the back of 10 interest rate rises in a row, that is a responsible, prudent course of action, as opposed to that advocated by those opposite. That is one level of response.The second, of course, is to make sure that we are investing in this economy's long-term future. Our long-term future as an economy depends on how we generate long-term productivity growth. We know from the data that productivity growth has been slowing in recent years, and we know for a fact that the absence of investment in skills, education and training, together with an absence of investment in infrastructure, have been among the main drivers in the supply-side constraints in the economy which have put, in fact, upward pressure on inflation and interest rates in recent years - the subject of 20 consecutive warnings from the Reserve Bank of Australia to those opposite when they were in office and about which they did nothing.By contrast, this government has a clear-cut course of action. When it comes to education, our course of action is this. We, through the budget, have outlined our fiscal intent to lay aside $11 billion in an education investment fund -  -  - I notice again a reference to slush funds by those opposite. So, when these moneys from this fund flow to a university or a TAFE college in the electorate of the honourable member who was intervening then, I presume they will not welcome that injection of funds - is that correct? Is it correct that, when it comes to an investment from the Building Australia Fund to meet high-speed broadband needs in the rural and regional electorates of Australia represented in part by the National Party, I can take it that those opposite will say, 'No, we don't want the connection; we actually want to make sure that internet speeds in rural and regional Australia remain as slow as they are now'? Is that what you are saying? Are you saying that, when the Building Australia Fund is dedicated to dealing with the challenges of urban congestion, those opposite will say, 'Oh no, we don't want that investment here. We want people simply to stay in their cars, day in, day out'? I think those opposite speak with forked tongues. When it comes to these investment funds for the future, whether that investment is in education, health or infrastructure, we have a plan for the future - as opposed to an excuse for inertia, which those opposite have.On the education revolution, the big challenge is this: what do we do to make sure that those kids attending schools across Australia have the best quality education possible? Our starting point as a Labor government is this: it does not matter where you come from, what side of the tracks you have grown up on, you should have, through the school system, the best opportunity possible to make the most of your life. That is what galvanises us as a Labor government.How do we do that across the school systems of the country? You can either do as our predecessors did and say, 'Not our problem; we'll blame the states,' or you can engage in a creative dialogue with the states about how you can make it better. And that is what I was outlining today in an address to the National Press Club. What we have said is that we intend to embrace a reform agenda for the future on quality education for Australian schools, quality teaching for Australian schools and quality leadership for Australian schools, to ensure that we have, also, proper transparency in the public reporting of the performance of Australian schools, and, on top of that again, that we have an ability to fund and to invest in those most disadvantaged schools, to ensure that they get the best teachers, the best resources possible, to lift them to the standards of other schools.This quality education reform agenda, which I and the Deputy Prime Minister have outlined today and on previous days, is an important next step in the education revolution that we have planned for this nation. An education revolution is necessary because we have an ambition for Australia to have, with our workforce, the best educated, best trained, best skilled workforce in the world. But you cannot just pull that out of thin air. You have to put money to the task, and you have got to put quality reforms in place as well. And the qualitative reforms that we have put forward are robust and strong.We will engage the states and territories in the months ahead on negotiations about two new national policy partnerships: one on quality teaching, the other on those financially disadvantaged schools in low socioeconomic areas. And, on top of that, through the proposed new national education agreement, we will make it a condition of that agreement to ensure that schools in the future are performing at an optimum qualitative level for the needs of kids right across the country.These are well thought out, concrete plans for the future. These are planned proposals with money attached. There are conditionalities attached. But our end point is clear. How do we make sure that kids in schools across the country - in the rural and regional electorates of Australia, in outer metropolitan Australia and in inner-city Australia - have the best opportunity possible to make the absolute best of their lives? We do not intend to say, 'This is a problem for the states; this is a problem for the territories; this is a problem for anyone else apart from us.' Instead, we are putting our shoulder to the wheel: more funds to be addressed to and injected into the school system, but based on clear-cut quality benchmarks, to ensure that we have the best teachers possible, that we have the best school leadership possible, and that we have the most appropriate funding injection possible for the most disadvantaged schools, because that is part and parcel of securing our country's long-term economic future.</DOC>

 - In preparing for the address to the National Press Club, the departmental advisers came forth with a list, I thought, of 24 reports on teaching quality prepared for the government which preceded us. And I would ask the people of Australia: what happened to those 24 reports? What happened in terms of the implementation of the recommendations which came from them? What happened?What I can say is that this government has not an excuse for inertia but a clear plan for the future. If those opposite were serious about those reforms, if those opposite were serious about the recommendations that came to them before, they would have done one of two things: they would have put their money where their mouth was and engaged the states in a real dialogue about investing in the school's future or they would have simply stumped up to the dispatch box and said that, for them, it was a political stunt. Absent co-investment is what it added up to. There were 24 reports - somewhat analogous, I have got to say, to all those warnings that the Reserve Bank gave the previous government about the challenges of inflation. It goes to a character failing of the previous government.There were all of these reports rolling in the door but, at the end of the day, the previous government of Australia was not faintly interested in taking those recommendations forward and making something of them in terms of a reform agenda for the future. Worst of all, at a time when there was cash rolling in the door through the resources boom, the previous government did not use it to invest in the school needs of the future but instead squandered it through one act of consumption after another. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame.</DOC>

 - Thank you to the member for Deakin. I know he has a deep interest in education. I welcome the fact that the Leader of the Opposition asked a question on education today, because it means that during the life of this parliament we have now seen one question on education from the shadow minister for education and one question from the Leader of the Opposition. I think that tells everyone everything they need to know about the level of interest of the Liberal Party in education. They do not care; they never did.In office, they never acted on the question of teacher quality. We know from the research around the world that nothing matters more to the ability of a student to learn in a classroom than the quality of the teacher standing in front of them. We are determined to enter a new national partnership with our state and territory colleagues and with the Catholic and independent school systems to improve teacher quality around this nation.When we are improving teacher quality around this nation we will draw on the best learning across the world. In particular, we are drawing on approaches from the United Kingdom and the United States, through the Teach First and Teach for America programs, which have brought some of the best and brightest graduates in those countries into teaching. Whilst we have some great teachers in this country, I do not think any Australian today could say as a standard that the best and brightest graduates in our universities today aspire to go teaching. In part I suspect that is because for more than the last decade the Howard government talked teaching down.We want to make sure that the best teachers are recognised and rewarded. We want to make sure that the best teachers stay at the front of Australian classrooms, that their accomplishments are recognized and that they know they are valued by the Australian community. - I am asked what approaches are effective and what approaches are ineffective. Let me remind the House of the ineffective approaches of the former government. What did they do? They talked about teacher quality and did nothing. Indeed the Leader of the Opposition has been interjecting across the table, asking me, 'Did you read my second reading speech when I was education minister?' Well, frankly, who cares? Your second reading speech did not improve teacher quality, because you never got anything done. The last education minister of the Howard government, the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition, came up with what I suspect would make the list of one of the stupidest public policy ideas since Federation. Her idea about teacher performance pay was to correlate it with raw scores so that, if you were in an advantaged school, where kids were the easiest to teach, you would earn a fortune and, if you were in a disadvantaged school, you would miss out on the reward. She wanted to create a system which would move the best teachers to the schools where their skills were needed the least - one of the stupidest ideas ever floated in Australian public policy.These ineffective approaches of the past have been discarded. The decade of talk and inaction is over. The Rudd Labor government is going to act on teacher quality. We are going to get something done. The fact that the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition got nothing done across six years should tell every Australian that the Liberal Party will never do anything about education that truly matters.</DOC>

 - The government welcomes the question. The reason we welcome the question is that it goes to a core element of the fact that we have an agenda for the future of education and those opposite do not. What we said in this place and in the national debate last year, as part of that education revolution that Australia needs to boost long-term productivity growth, to boost the performance of our schools and to provide the kids of working families across the country with an opportunity to get ahead, was to make sure that we had a digital revolution in the classroom.There are two problems with that. One of the problems is that the nation lacks a high-speed national broadband network. That is problem No. 1. I would have thought that after 12 years those opposite might have lifted their finger on this, but no, not for the likes of them. We had about 16 different broadband policies from those opposite. Not one of them actually contributed to anything much that any of us could measure. That is problem No. 1. Problem No. 2 is that, when it comes to the ability of kids to connect to the digital economy and the digital education revolution in their classroom, there is an absence of sufficient computers. What we put forward is a practical plan of action on both.In eight months in office, we have our program advancing for the national broadband network and, as that negotiation continues with the private sector, already we have gone through the first round of the allocation of funding and of the provision of grants to schools for the purchase of computers. I am advised by the Minister for Education and Deputy Prime Minister that already we have provided grants to 896 schools across the country for 116,000 computers. Given that we have, from memory, 2,685 secondary schools in Australia and in our first six months or so in office we have reached an agreement through the good offices of the minister to provide grants to 896 schools for the provision of 116,000 computers, here is my challenge to the shadow minister opposite. I presume that for those schools which might be in or near his electorate he would like to send the cheque back. Is that right? -  - You only have two, so would you like the money to go back? Is the response from the honourable member who is interjecting that he would like the money to go back? Therefore, what I would say -  - I have to say that recently I was in the electorate of the honourable member for Dawson, up in Mackay, in Queensland, and went to a school. From memory, it was a Christian Brothers school; is that right? The grant was, from memory, one of three grants which had already been provided in that electorate for a couple of non-government schools and a government school. The response from the principals concerned was: 'Thank God we've got some funding support to do this. Thank God we've got it.' I would challenge those opposite -  - as they have led so massively with their chins on this question, to go to 896 principals across the country and ask this question: would they like to send the cheque back? Or I would challenge them, in those electorates, to then stand up and say, 'You and this community don't deserve to have this extra funding for computers on the desks of your secondary school students.'What we have here is a pathetic attempt by those opposite to camouflage one thing: 12 years of inaction and a failure to use the resources which came into the country's economy, into the public coffers of Australia, through the resources boom and to invest that in Australia's long-term education and infrastructure needs. We are proud of our commitment on computers in schools. We are proud of our commitment to bring about a digital revolution in Australia's schools. We are proud of our commitments for a reform program for quality education. We have an agenda for the future. You have an excuse for the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for that question. The Australian government is very committed to strengthening relations with Brazil. Australia wants to have an enhanced partnership with Brazil. I advise the House that this is also Brazil's view - that Brazil wants to have an enhanced partnership with Australia. Brazil wants to strengthen its bilateral relations with Australia. This is as a result of the visit to Australia this week of External Relations Minister Amorim, and I am very pleased to join with the Speaker to welcome Minister Amorim and the Brazilian Ambassador to Australia, Ambassador de Mello Barreto, to the floor of the chamber.Minister Amorim has been in Australia for a couple of days. Yesterday he had a very successful meeting with the Minister for Trade, Mr Crean, where the renewed commitment of both Australia and Brazil to breathe life back into the Doha Round was agreed. We very strongly support the measures and the efforts of Brazil to ensure that, before the end of this year, we get a positive outcome from the Doha Round. Last night I hosted for the minister a dinner at which we saw the array of Australian social and economic prowess and we saw the links between Australia and Brazil - academic, scientific and technological, investment and trade, energy, resources and the like. This morning we had a very successful formal bilateral meeting from which the joint communique indicates our joint desire to take our relationship with Brazil to an Enhanced Partnership, and we have charged our respective ambassadors and officials with the job of devising a plan of action across the array of interests between Australia and Brazil.I think it is true to say that, in recent years, the people-to-people contact and the trade and investment contact between Australia and Brazil have advanced beyond the government-to-government contacts and the nation-to-nation contacts. We see, for example, close contact and cooperation now between our minerals resources industries. Brazil has 12,000 students in Australia - a very significant number. Also, the scientific and technological relationships between our two countries are growing, particularly in agriculture and agricultural related areas. It is time we reflected this with enhanced nation-to-nation and government-to-government relations.This is the first visit by a Brazilian minister to Australia in the course of this government's term. It is the second visit to Australia of a Brazilian foreign minister, and I am pleased to advise the House that both visits were by Minister Amorim, who came in 1993 and 1994. This is his second stint as foreign minister. In the interim, he came to Australia on a number of occasions as a member of the Canberra Commission. One of the matters we spoke about today was Australia's and Brazil's joint commitment to the non-proliferation treaty and our commitment to disarmament.It is also the case, regrettably, that a Brazilian President has not visited Australia and an Australian Prime Minister has not visited Brazil. It has been agreed between the Prime Minister and President Lula that this will be rectified. The plan of action to be devised by officials, Minister Amorim and me will be presented to the President of Brazil and the Prime Minister to really take the relationship to an enhanced level.Brazil and Australia have a lot in common. One thing we have in common is that we are the two largest nation states in the Southern Hemisphere. Brazil is now emerging as a significant economic, strategic and political influence. Brazil, like Australia, is a committed multilateralist, and we value very much the joint approach that Australia and Brazil take to our conduct and our activity in the United Nations. We are both strong supporters of United Nations Security Council reform. We also value very much Brazil's activity in the Doha Round as a strong and active participant in the WTO.I conclude by making the point that Minister Amorim and I have agreed in principle that, given that Brazil will host the 2014 World Cup, Minister Amorim will see what assistance he can render to Australia in our endeavour to host the 2018 World Cup. I have indicated to the minister that, should Brazil be successful in gaining the 2016 Olympics, we will of course give every advice and support, following our very successful experience from the Sydney Olympics. It has been a very productive visit by Minister Amorim, and we look forward very much to the enhanced partnership between Australia and Brazil.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. On the question of responsibility for the economy, as I said before in answer to a question from the Leader of the Opposition, as Prime Minister of the country I accept responsibility for good news and bad news, and I will continue to do that. That is the first point. The second point to address is: what are the contributing factors to the state of the economy in this country and the state of confidence? Firstly, you have the global factors I have referred to on a number of occasions here at the despatch box and the fact that the global financial crisis continues to wash through the global financial system and the real economy. Secondly, here in Australia we have had some other factors, and they are those of a domestic nature - that is, the overhang due to the fact that, at the time we were elected, we had inflation running at 16-year highs. As a result of that, we had 10 interest rate rises in a row - delivering to the people of Australia the second highest interest rates in the developed world. That results in a second, separate Australian factor at work in the overall confidence equation.Through responsible fiscal policy and through the budget that we announced in May, we have sought to do what we can responsibly through fiscal policy to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. Interest rates are a huge factor out there in the real economy and also have an impact on confidence. That is the responsible course of action to address the problem that the previous government left us. The irresponsible response to the problem which the previous government left us is to ignore it and to compound it. That is the strategy that has been recommended by those opposite - in other words, how do you add fuel to the fire? Instead of taking a fiscally conservative position through a robust budget surplus, their response is simply to say, 'Let's have a further spending spree.'On the question of spending sprees, those opposite really should have a long, hard look at themselves. At the time we came into office, government spending was running at between four and five per cent growth on the part of those opposite. We have reduced that to just on one per cent. In fact, had we run spending - and this is a very interesting figure - at the same growth level that those opposite had it running at for the last several years, it would have cost taxpayers an extra $23 billion worth of outlays. If we exhibited the same indiscipline on spending that we inherited from those opposite and kept it running into the future - that is, running at four per cent real - it would have equated to a $23 billion extra bill for taxpayers.Our response has been through the budget process to instead take a hard look at savings, which is what we did in generating $33 billion in savings, to ensure that our new spending initiatives of $24.7 billion were met by savings. I conclude by saying that, when it comes to the challenges which we face for the future -  - The Leader of the Opposition comes in on cue: 'Tax increases.' Why is that in terms of tax as a proportion of gross domestic product -  -  - What other measure is there, other than tax as a proportion of gross domestic product? It is called the tax intensity of the economy. What we have done is reduce tax to GDP -  -  - They really do not like this, do they? - Tax to GDP has now been reduced under us to 23.8 per cent of GDP and in the 2007-08 budget to 24.7 per cent of GDP. In 2004-05 it was 24.9 per cent of GDP - quite extraordinary. In fact, had we kept tax as a percentage of GDP at the Liberal Party level, do you know how much more we would have collected in tax? We would have collected $30.5 billion. So, had we maintained the spending discipline that we inherited from those opposite, we would have been hitting taxpayers for another $23 billion worth of outlays. Had we maintained the tax discipline of those opposite - which, frankly, is to tax the billyo out of the community and the business community out there - we would have whacked them with an extra $30.5 billion in tax. I would suggest that those opposite have a long, close, hard look at themselves in terms of their record.I would again challenge those opposite as they contemplate their mission of economic vandalism in the Senate to instead join with the government in a strategy of responsible economic management to make sure that we, through fiscal policy, maintain the integrity of the budget surplus in order to provide Australia with a decent economic buffer in the uncertain global economic times which we face.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The global economy is in a difficult position. We face some of the most difficult global conditions we have seen in very many years. That is the cold, hard reality, no matter how much those opposite want to deny it. The global credit crunch and the oil price shock in the system have had a dramatic impact on the global economy. Of course, it is slowing growth, it is pushing up borrowing costs for both businesses and households, and it is most certainly impacting upon consumer confidence right around the world. Let us just have a look at some of the outcomes around the world, Mr Speaker. Japan's economy has contracted by 0.6 per cent; Germany's economy has contracted by 0.5 per cent; France's economy has contracted by 0.3 per cent; Italy's economy has contracted by 0.3 per cent; and Canada's economy has contracted by 0.1 per cent in the March quarter.The good news is that we are in a far better position than all of these countries because our underlying economic fundamentals are strong. There are some things that we cannot control and there are many things that we can control. Of course, what we can control is a disciplined economic policy and we can put together a very strong surplus - a $22 billion surplus. We can put money into investment funds which can drive the productive capacity of our economy. We can do all of those things. That is why it is so stunning that our surplus should be under attack in the Senate when it is so necessary to put downward pressure on inflation and so necessary to make the necessary investments in education and infrastructure.This government has an agenda for the future; but of course those opposite have nothing at all, just irresponsible political games. Yesterday in the House there was some confusion in the opposition. We had the Leader of the Opposition in the MPI debate saying that the economy was heading for a hard landing and, of course, we had the Treasury spokesman saying directly the opposite. It is simply extraordinary that the Leader of the Opposition should trash the economy for 15 minutes. And, of course, then we had the Treasury spokesman saying that that is what he should not be doing at all.What we need from the opposition is some responsibility to pass the budget in the Senate so that we can strengthen our economic foundations. We want some responsibility from the opposition - and we are not getting it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his first question in the parliament and I extend to him respect for having stood in the chamber for the first time to ask a question.On the question of pensioners, if the honourable member had listened to the remarks that I just made at the National Press Club then he would know that I went through the fact that we have provided through the budget $7.5 billion worth of additional allocations to pensioners, carers and those on the disability support pension. The way in which that is being delivered in part is through the utilities allowance - which in the past was paid by the previous government and ran, I think, at something in excess of $100 a year. This is to be increased by a factor of almost $400 to $500 a year, and we have made that now for the first time a consistent annual payment. That represents a large slice of the amount which we paid. Furthermore, there was of course the one-off pensioners bonus that has been the subject of considerable discussion in this place - a bonus which was, on a one-off basis, introduced by the previous government for the two previous budgets, as I understand it, but not prior to that and was never announced as a permanent measure.The other thing that we have done to assist pensioners is to increase the telephone allowance by some 50 per cent, particularly to assist pensioners with the start-up costs associated with getting an internet connection at home - because often what we find in representations we have received around country is that pensioners, often separated from their kids in this vast country of ours, are looking for a bit of help in getting an internet connection at home, because a lot of correspondence and keeping in touch is conducted that way these days. So that is another practical measure that we have put forward. Also, we have made a separate allocation of funds - from recollection, some $50 million - to various seniors groups and associations around the country to assist them with providing in-house training opportunities for pensioners to assist them with the use of the internet at home.These are practical measures which we have sought to help with. But, as I have said at this dispatch box on many occasions, we on this side of the House are fully seized of the fact that pensioners need to have their long-term payments put onto a more secure footing. That is why we have commissioned, through the Henry commission of inquiry, a detailed examination of the future of the tax income support and retirement incomes policy. That is due to report in the case of retirement incomes policy, or the pensions component of it, by February of next year.Again I would draw the honourable gentleman's attention to the fact that, in the previous 12 years when his own political party were in office, in coalition with the Liberal Party, I do not recall any fundamental, far-reaching reform or examination of the nation's pension scheme. I just don't. I would suggest that those opposite who now stand and seek to preach from a high point on this question take a long, cold, hard look at their record on this question. To assume, as the honourable gentleman has in his question, that cost of living pressures for pensioners have emerged in a matter of the last six to eight months is simply not true. They have certainly spiked in recent times because of factors like petrol and groceries that we have referred to in debates in this chamber, but the increased cost impact on the ability of single aged pensioners and married couples who are pensioners to survive on the basis of the age pension has been a challenge for a long, long time. Anyone who contributes honestly to this debate and any member in this parliament who has been in contact with their local seniors groups would know this from years gone by.There is an inherent dishonesty in the proposition being put by those opposite, which is that this situation has mysteriously emerged in the last few months. It has not. It has been an emerging problem for a long, long time. The difference is that we have commissioned a mechanism to examine this from the ground up, and it will report by February next year, which will be within 12 months of us taking office. My question to those opposite is: what did you do in 12 years? I do not remember them doing anything in 12 years. I would say to them: please get your own house in order on this question before seeking to advance a debate like this, and put forward a concrete policy on the future of the pension. I seem to remember a concrete policy being put forward by the opposition on the pension - I think by the relevant shadow minister. It was in a radio interview some months ago. From memory, it lasted about 42 minutes - maybe it was 43 minutes - before being slapped down by the member for Wentworth. If those opposite wish to credibly engage in the debate on pensions, which is a very important debate for those most vulnerable Australians, then I would suggest they get real and put some policy on the table rather than engaging in simply opportunistic politics.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. The government's budget charts a course for long-term sustainable growth for the Australian economy. We are, as the Treasurer has outlined, working our way through very difficult international circumstances, and we are dealing with mistakes of the past, both domestically and internationally. The government's sights are set very firmly and very clearly on Australia's long-term economic interests. We are absolutely committed to laying the foundations for long-term sustainable growth for Australia's future.It is unsustainable to run government spending at a rate of five per cent real increase at a time when there is a mining boom and when gross domestic product is growing in the vicinity of four per cent. It is unsustainable to have four budgets in a row with no savings put forward in them. It is unsustainable to waste huge sums of taxpayers' money on politically driven grants programs. It is unsustainable to fail to tackle the major infrastructure problems that the Australian economy is faced with and to fail to take initiatives with respect to our congested cities and our overcrowded hospitals. It is unsustainable to allow our universities and our research institutions to wither on the vine. It is unsustainable to allow Australia to languish at 17th in the world in terms of access to broadband and, most particularly, it is unsustainable to ignore the threat of climate change.The budget is the first step by the government in dealing with these major long-term challenges facing Australia and moving to a sustainable, long-term growth path. It is a package, because we have to have, as well as the initiatives to deal with these long-term economic challenges, a strong surplus that puts downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. We have to do both in this budget. Unfortunately, the opposition have chosen to play short-term, populist politics with this package. They are endeavouring to pick the package apart and to blow holes in the government's surplus. This will have the effect of undermining the government's efforts to put downward pressure on interest rates and it will also have the longer term effect of undermining the ability of the government to address these long-term economic challenges facing the Australian nation.There are a lot of strengths in the Australian economy, as the Treasurer has just indicated - particularly in comparison with many other economies around the world that are suffering from the same adverse international pressures that the Australian economy is suffering from. We are benefiting from a once-in-a-generation resources boom, but there are serious long-term challenges that we have to face in this nation, and that is what the Rudd government's first budget is directed at tackling. Our export performance outside the mining sector has languished for the last seven or eight years. We still have a very high current account deficit. We have levels of skills and education that are below those of comparable countries. We have major cities creaking at the seams due to inadequate infrastructure. We need to further increase our workforce participation rates in order to meet the challenges of the ageing of the population and we need to lift our savings performance. These are all key, long-term things that we have to do to improve the performance of the Australian economy, and it is these objectives to which the settings of the budget for 2008 are directed.The government is committed to tackling these long-term challenges. I would call on the opposition to abandon its short-term sniping and mindless populist politics and engage in the debate about the long-term future of the Australian economy and the underlying structural factors that will deliver prosperity and security for our children and their children - because they are the issues that we all in this parliament, on both sides of the chamber, ultimately have responsibility for. They are the things that our budget is directed at addressing. I would urge the opposition to pass the budget and engage in a serious and constructive debate about these fundamentally important issues for the future of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Dental care is a major concern, particularly after 12 years of neglect under the previous government. Indeed, it was the Howard government that scrapped the Commonwealth dental scheme, which caused so many difficulties particularly for older people right throughout our community and which has caused so many health problems as well. Dental concerns are not just about poor teeth; they can also lead to future, serious medical problems. It was a major concern that for 12 long years the Howard government neglected that.The Rudd government are committed to making sure that right throughout this nation there is better access to dental care, firstly through our Teen Dental Plan, but also through our plan to bring back the Commonwealth dental plan, which will enable older Australians to have access to a dentist, which they were not able to get for so many years. Many older Australians have told me how desperate they were to have a federal government that listened to their concerns in relation to dental care. We have certainly listened, as is shown through our dental plans for older Australians and also our Teen Dental Plan.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question. He is in a neighbouring seat to my seat of Rankin and he has also been a very successful small businessman. As a former successful small businessman, the member for Forde, all members on this side of the House and, I hope, members on the other side of the House, understand that high interest rates are harmful to the prospects of small business.The economic situation that prevailed at the time of the change of government was essentially this: there was a lot of spending going on in the economy and it was crashing up against capacity constraints - that is, the capacity of the Australian economy to supply that spending. In response to that situation, the Rudd government brought down the May budget, which sought to do this: to ease those capacity constraints by investing in infrastructure and by investing in skills creation, and also to reduce the call on spending. If we can reduce the call on spending, we can reduce the inflationary pressures. A government can do that through a budget by cutting government spending and building a strong surplus.What did in fact the budget do? It cut government spending from unsustainable growth of five per cent per annum - to be precise, 5.2 per cent per annum - under the previous government to just over one per cent per annum, and it built a very strong surplus of $22 billion, which is the second biggest surplus in 37 years. The purpose of this is to reduce the pressure on inflation by reducing the call of the government on spending and the capacity of the economy to supply it. That all makes good economic sense and it was necessary because we did inherit, whether the opposition likes it or not, the highest underlying inflation rate in 16 years. The inflation-targeting Reserve Bank was obliged to increase interest rates not once, not twice, but 10 times - 10 times - under the coalition government. So concerned was it with the inflationary situation that it had to increase interest rates 10 times.We are now doing what a smart and responsible government would do, and that is reducing the pressure on government spending and therefore reducing pressure on inflation and pressure on interest rates. But what is the coalition's response? Cheap political opportunism. In the Senate, the coalition is refusing to pass very important parts of this federal budget and in doing so it is jeopardising the prospects of small business, because an inflation-targeting Reserve Bank is going to say in these circumstances that, if there is no reduction in inflationary pressures, it will be in a position where it will not necessarily be able to provide the interest rate relief that the constituents and the small businesses in Forde and all parts of Australia desperately need. Small businesses would be the victims of the political opportunism of the coalition. I note what the shadow small business minister said, and I am afraid I am going to have to read it out. It is very short. He said, 'We certainly won't be doing anything to jeopardise the government's financial position.' You will not be doing anything to jeopardise the government's financial position? You are blocking key parts of the budget. That statement was made on 19 August. It did not last two days. Most of the commitments of this coalition do not last to the end of the day. The government is acting responsibly; the coalition is acting irresponsibly.But the damage to small business from the coalition's opportunism does not stop there. Why? Because we heard from the member for Stirling yesterday, who was complaining about the creation of what he calls slush funds through the Council of Australian Governments. The minister for finance and I are co-chairing one of the seven working groups which are dedicated to the task of reducing red tape in 27 different areas of business regulation. What we are seeking to do is to reverse the damage done to small business and other businesses from what the Business Council of Australia has described in a recent report as the 'creeping reregulation of business' which occurred under the coalition, and I quote this: 'an example of how the benefits of past reforms can be quietly eroded over time, over 12 years through the creeping reregulation of Australian business.' The Prime Minister and the Rudd government have embarked on an ambitious program of reducing business regulation in 27 areas, and what is it described as? A slush fund. We are trying to create a seamless national economy - an open, competitive economy. You are supposed to be the Liberal Party in support of free enterprise, in support of openness and competition. You criticise our budget, you try to block key elements of the budget and you describe the COAG business regulation reform process as the creation of a slush fund. The coalition is engaging in rank political opportunism, while the Rudd Labor government are creating a strong economy for the future of all businesses in Australia, including the 1.9 million small businesses we are proud to represent.</DOC>

 - As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would be aware, the parameters in the budget papers show a slight upward movement in the unemployment rate. During this year the RBA also projected a slight softening of the labour market. Having said that, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would also be aware that the last set of employment numbers received was actually strong, went above market expectations and in particular showed more growth in full-time jobs than people were expecting. We understand, of course, that there are some pockets of companies with particular redundancy problems and lay-offs. - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his assistance, and I understand that each and every unemployed Australian is a person and they deserve our compassion and support and, most particularly, an employment services system that works to meet their needs. One of the reforms that this government is engaging in is to ensure, on the next major tender of the Job Network, which happens on 1 July next year, that they get a better employment services system to meet their needs. I am of course acutely aware that when companies announce redundancy programs - and they happen for all sorts of reasons - that causes human suffering. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition would be aware, in those circumstances the federal government has a number of programs, including programs to assist with entitlements. - Can I conclude where I started. The budget papers do show a slight upwards revision in the unemployment rate before -  - I know the budget papers are not the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's favourite topic, because she is on a strategy with her colleagues to punch a hole in those budget papers in an act of economic irresponsibility. But, in terms of answering the question, the budget forecasts are for a revision to 4Â¾ per cent in the unemployment rate. - The RBA has also talked about the unemployment rate. Having said that, I note the last employment numbers were strong and above market forecasts. When individual companies announce redundancies and lay-offs, of course the government monitor that. We respond with employment services that make a difference. We have the GEER Scheme to make a difference in circumstances of unpaid entitlements.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. When we look back to last week, to Vietnam Veterans Day on 18 August, I think I can say on behalf of the entire House that it is a time to commemorate the courage and sacrifice of the many Australians who fought in that war so long ago. As the House would be aware, some 60,000 Australians were part of the in-country and logistical support that was provided through that longest of conflicts that Australia has been involved in. Some 520 Australians paid the ultimate sacrifice, and some 2,400 were wounded.Of course, this occasion is also the 42nd anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. Although it is the Battle of Long Tan that we commemorate on this day, we also commemorate the sacrifice of all Vietnam veterans. We also commemorate Coral and Balmoral, Binh Bah and the range of other engagements that occurred and remember the sacrifice of all involved. But on this occasion, the 42nd anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, we also address an issue that has been a matter of some concern to veterans of Long Tan for many, many years. The Battle of Long Tan was a savage engagement - it involved helicopters, artillery and infantry. At the end of the day, a number of recommendations were made and a number of awards were given. But the fact of the matter is that changes were also made around the recommendations that were made at the time. This has been a matter of concern to those involved for quite a long period of time. It has been an issue which, it is fair to say, has dogged veterans' affairs ministers over the years because of the very stoic, determined actions of the commander at that battle, then Major Harry Smith, who believed that a wrong had been done and who was determined to see that it was righted. I would have to say, if I were ever in a situation where I needed someone to stick by me in a fight, Harry Smith is exactly the guy that I would want. There is no doubt that he would do the job, as he did back at that time.I will not go into the issues of what occurred at the time, or what has occurred since, other than to say that the inquiry that took place was necessary - and it was long overdue. One of the last acts of the previous government was to commence that inquiry, and I congratulate them on that, although I have to say - and I have been on the record as saying it for a long time now - it should have happened a lot earlier. Part of the pressure from this side of the House that occurred with respect to the need for an independent inquiry came from members such as the former member for Cowan, Graham Edwards, the member for Brisbane, Arch Bevis, and the member for Ballarat, Catherine King. I was very pleased to make that part of a push in our policy in the lead-up to the election.That independent inquiry came down with a series of recommendations, and the government endorsed the key recommendations. Others we referred to the independent tribunal which has recently been set up under the auspices of the member for Eden-Monaro, the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support. The key recommendations that have been acted upon at this time, and the key actions being taken by the government, relate to the upgrading - in modern terms - of the medallic recognition of the leader of that battle, then Major Harry Smith, to the Star of Gallantry - one level below a VC but a very significant award - and of two of his platoon commanders, Dave Sabben and Geoff Kendall, to the Medal of Gallantry. I put on the record my congratulations for the long-overdue recognition of these men. I would also like to make it clear - something that I have to say about Harry Smith - that Harry said to me on many occasions that these issues were not about these men as individuals but about the recognition of the gallantry of their men. These medallic recognitions are awarded on the basis of their leadership and the gallantry of their men. That is what they did so long ago, and that is what they see this as being in recognition of today.In addition, the government took the decision that the unit citation, which we believe was granted at the time by the South Vietnamese government, should be allowed to be worn now. It is an extension of what the previous government did around some of the medals in that area some years ago. I believe it is a logical conclusion to what occurred, and I think it also gives very appropriate recognition of the circumstances of all in D Company at that time. I am sure I join with the House in congratulating those involved by saying that we honour their courage and sacrifice at this time. I see this very much as being recognition of the entire effort of the Australians who fought, died or were wounded in the Vietnam War. We should take this time to remember them in this House.Honourable members - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question, and I will explain the matter again. -  - I am glad you have read the budget, because that is reassuring me a little bit, as you go around punching a hole in its surplus. The forecast in the budget papers is for a revision upwards in the unemployment rate to 4.75 per cent. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may also be aware that in its latest statement on monetary policy the RBA stated - and this is actually the employment growth figure - that annual employment growth is forecast to average three-quarters of a per cent over the next year before gradually picking up. They are the forecasts in the budget papers, and they are the reflections of the RBA on the question of what is going to happen with employment growth.As I indicated to the Leader of the Opposition - admittedly in response to an interjection from the Leader of the Opposition - we are of course concerned about the circumstance of every person who loses a job. In order to respond to the circumstance of Australians who lose a job when there is a company that announces that there will be a retrenchment of a number of workers, there is of course an immediate response in terms of employment assistance and the like. There is, from time to time, a need to access the GEER Scheme if people are not going to receive their full entitlements. The question of redundancy entitlements is very important to this government; that is why we are seeking to protect them through our fair and balanced industrial relations system, because they were not protected under Work Choices. Of course the government is also strengthening our employment services through the redesign and retendering of the Job Network.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Longman for that question and acknowledge that he has indeed, for many years now, taken a special interest in the problem of drug abuse. I believe he and his wife, Karen, have for 14 years been engaged in that kind of education in the schools of the honourable member's electorate.On the very eve of the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games, the Australian Federal Police and Customs held a press conference to announce the result of an intense 12-month investigation that they called Operation Inca, which led to the world's largest ever ecstasy bust. It was a gold medal result. The statistics are quite hard to comprehend. Hidden in 3,000 tins of tomatoes were 4.4 tonnes of ecstasy tablets, 15 million tablets, worth $440 million. For good measure, there were also 150 kilograms of cocaine hidden with bags of coffee beans. That is an amazing, indeed world-class, result for our law enforcement agencies, and therefore for the Australian community.It began as a snippet of information received 12 months ago by the Victoria Police, who passed it on to Australian Customs. Customs narrowed down shipments, which were coming from Italy, to 800 shipping containers and then made an initial detection. That of itself was a most significant technical achievement, but, building on that very good work, a tactical decision was made by the agencies not to make that discovery public. Instead, our agencies decided to conduct further investigations and began working with law enforcement partners in Europe. It turned out to be a very wise decision because it led to the dismantling of a large global criminal syndicate. Not that it was an easy matter; 400 AFP officers took part at various times in the operation. It involved 185,000 telephone intercepts and 10,000 hours of surveillance. On the day of the operation, officers arrested 20 people across Australia in four states, some of them, the House will recall, with a very high profile indeed, and a total of 25 people have now been charged. In addition, there was a coordinated operation in Europe with warrants executed in Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy.As Commissioner Keelty indicated at the time, the minds of investigators were seized by the knowledge that the syndicate could continue to operate for a year after importing 4.4 tonnes of narcotics and losing them. Only a major global syndicate has the resources to write off a loss like that. The commissioner made the sobering observation that it is the premium price that young people in Australia are prepared to pay for ecstasy that is driving up demand. He said: If you think it through there are not many boardrooms in Australia where you would write off half a billion dollars worth of a commodity and continue your business. 
_Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _What we have to do is reach out to the youth of this country and reduce demand.In the last six weeks alone - in other words, in the period in significant part after the dramatic detections that I have been speaking of - law enforcement in Australia has been at its most effective in dealing with the threat of drugs. It has made seizures of more than 8.5 tonnes of illicit drugs.Detections that substantial do not happen by chance, and they are a demonstration of the targeting and detection capabilities of Customs combined with the exceptional intelligence and investigation capabilities of the AFP, state police and the Crime Commission and, not least, the anti-money-laundering agency, AUSTRAC, together with all of the international partners of those organisations. Our agencies are not only protecting the community - I might say it is estimated that the Melbourne seizure prevented $2 billion worth of harm in our community when you take into account the health effects and so on. Of course our agencies are, at the same time, making Australia a hostile environment to drug dealers. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in its 2008 World drug report released in June, concluded that general drug use in Australia fell over the last year, as did the trafficking of heroin, morphine, cannabis and ecstasy to Australia. The Australian authorities - the AFP, Customs and the others - will continue to cooperate and share investigations and information with their international networks to good end, and we congratulate all who have been concerned in these recent successful operations on their professionalism.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question because Fuelwatch is a very important means by which we can empower consumers to get a better deal at the petrol bowser, as indeed they have been getting in Western Australia for a long time. As I understand it, today in metropolitan Sydney the difference between the minimum and maximum rate being charged at the bowser is something like 27c a litre, so you can easily save $10 a tank.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. Energy efficiency is a key plank in the government's comprehensive approach to tackling dangerous climate change following 12 years of neglect by the Liberal-National Party coalition in seriously addressing this issue at all. The carbon pollution reduction scheme is the centrepiece of the government's approach, but it must be complemented by measures which remove obstacles to the uptake of energy efficiency, particularly through the early years of adjustment. Up until now, energy efficiency, sometimes called the 'low-hanging fruit', has been fragmented and uncoordinated at the national level, a legacy of the failure of those opposite to address this issue. International Energy Agency indicators show that Australia's improvements in energy efficiency between 1990 and 2005 lagged well behind other OECD countries. It is a test of any government to see whether they take up the opportunities to pick that low-hanging fruit, but for 12 years we saw nothing.Importantly, action on energy efficiency lowers the cost of reducing carbon pollution and has additional benefits for energy security for business and also for cost-of-living pressures. The government's green paper provides a commitment to assist Australian households to take practical action on reducing their energy use, saving on energy bills and making a fair dinkum contribution to tackling climate change. I have been undertaking a series of roundtables with the community, NGOs, business groups and industry on practical action and solutions for households. The messages coming through loud and clear are that there are plenty of solutions around. We are listening to those messages and they will inform the household assistance measures the government will detail as we move towards a carbon pollution reduction scheme white paper.This government is already helping households make smarter choices on energy-efficient products such as televisions. We are raising the profile of renewable energy with some 1,600 schools around Australia already having registered to become solar schools. In the first year of the Rudd Labor government there will be more Commonwealth funding for solar power and more solar installations than in any year in Australia's history. I have got to say that the opposition has been completely caught out and exposed on this issue - and it has been confronted with the facts. When you get past all the stunts from the opposition, from the member for Flinders, here are the facts. On 21 May the member for Flinders said in relation to solar panels:_ few people, if any, are signing on to new solar panel contracts.The fact is that, in that same week, we received 445 applications, the third highest number in the program's history. On 16 June the Leader of the Opposition said:There are few new customers signing up for solar panels.That was the week when we received 565 applications, another new record for applications for solar panels. And so it goes on. The fact is that, when it comes to climate change and those important issues that attach to it, the opposition never paid much attention. In fact, they spent 12 years ignoring climate change - and we know that they are still ignoring the evidence. I noticed that an anonymous coalition MP was quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald as saying:_ 70 per cent either does not believe in climate change or is plain sceptical.Seventy per cent of opposition members is a high figure, but I guess it explains why they have had some 15 different positions on the carbon pollution reduction scheme. That opposition MP went on to say at the time of the backflip on emissions last year:We were staring at an electoral abyss. We had to pretend we cared.Professor Garnaut has introduced us to the 'prisoner's dilemma' in relation to climate change, but I think it is time we introduced the Australian public to the coalition's dilemma on climate change: they are still sceptical and now they have to pretend they care. I do not know who that anonymous MP was. Was it the member for Wentworth? Was it the member for Flinders? Was it the Leader of the Opposition? Was it Senator Minchin? I suppose we could ask them. But, if we asked them, we would get four different answers - and two of them would involve nuclear. At the end of the day, pretending to care is not a sufficient basis for constructing real policy on dealing with climate change because the Australian community does care and the Rudd Labor government will deliver climate change solutions to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Members would be aware that overnight the Russian President, President Medvedev, indicated that the Russian Federation had recognised the independence of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, often known as the separatist region of Georgia. Australia does not support such recognition. That is Australia's longstanding position. Australia recognises the territorial sovereignty of Georgia over the provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The declaration by the Russian Federation is not a helpful contribution to tensions in that area of the world and not a helpful contribution to international relations. Indeed, some might say that such a declaration was provocative. It does not help the standing of the Russian Federation. In the Australian government's view, it diminishes and lowers its standing.Members would recall that earlier this month, following the incursion of Georgian forces into South Ossetia, the Russian Federation deployed a large-scale military offensive in Georgia, not restricted to South Ossetia. That large-scale military offensive implemented and effected large-scale devastation upon parts of Georgia, including military and economic points. We saw, regrettably, civilian casualties and a large number of displaced persons, as a consequence of which the Australian government announced humanitarian assistance of a million dollars through relevant international agencies.The actions of the Russian Federation in this respect were clearly disproportionate. We welcomed very much the efforts of President Sarkozy, the President of France, in his position as European Union chair, and the Finnish Foreign Minister, my counterpart from Finland, in his position as chair of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in effecting a ceasefire agreement between Georgia and the Russian Federation. Regrettably, Russia has not abided by that ceasefire and, as we have done publicly and through officials in both Canberra and Moscow, we again call upon the Russian Federation to return its troops to the positions they occupied prior to the commencement of hostilities on 6 and 7 August.The Russian Federation is a significant and influential player in world affairs. It is essential that it engages in dialogue and peaceful conduct. We urge the Russian Federation to abide by the ceasefire brokered by President Sarkozy and return its forces to those positions, and to engage fully in international affairs through the relevant regional multilateral forums - through discussion, not through the disproportionate use of military force of arms.</DOC>

 - I am always pleased when those opposite raise the question of the conditions of our workforce and those conditions under which our employees in Australia actually work, because it goes to the heart of the industrial relations system which those opposite bequeathed to those in the Australian workforce after their period in office. If you go down to some basic facts and figures concerning the impact of Work Choices, there was a sample which was undertaken when the previous government was in office, between April and October 2006. Eighty-nine per cent of those AWAs removed at least one award condition that the previous government's advertising said had been protected; 31 per cent of those AWAs took away rest breaks; 49 per cent took away overtime loadings; 63 per cent removed incentive based payments and bonuses; 65 per cent removed penalty rates; and 70 per cent took away shiftwork loadings.When we are dealing with the challenges of the overall economy and its future direction, first and foremost is responsible economic management to ensure that we are putting in place the right economic conditions for the future to make sure that we can continue to generate economic growth. That is the first responsibility. Secondly, that flows through also to the employment challenges facing this economy and other economies around the world. These are tough challenges which small businesses and the rest of the economy are now facing off the back of both international challenges from the global economy and a high-interest-rate regime which this government and the country inherited from those opposite. But, thirdly, looking at the future and the impact of the economy on individual working families, let no-one in this parliament and no-one in this country forget precisely what set of industrial relations working conditions those in Australia had to live under with those opposite. That is why this government has, through its first instrument of legislation, sought to begin the process of rolling back exactly the set of industrial relations arrangements they had in this country: unfair, unacceptable and un-Australian.</DOC>

 - What is interesting when the word 'education' is raised in this chamber is that it brings about peals of laughter from those opposite. They regard this as somehow secondary or irrelevant to the country's future. I would suggest to those opposite that, if there is to be a serious debate about the future direction of the economy, that should in turn focus on how you go about setting up long-term productivity growth in this economy. If you look at the productivity growth numbers which have been generated in recent years, we have seen them go down from plus three to plus two to plus one, with no strategy on the part of those opposite to turn around labour productivity growth. We know that non-inflationary growth in the economy can only be effectively generated by productivity growth. That is what it is all about. But, in response to repeated warnings from the Reserve Bank, some 20 warnings about problems with infrastructure bottlenecks and skills constraints across the economy, we had no action from those opposite.What we have done instead is said that our government is committed to an education revolution and proudly so. It is not only an instrument to advance the educational opportunities of kids right across the country but also a long-term investment in our country's economic future. Yesterday I announced a further chapter in the education revolution concerning the quality of our education system. If there is one single quote which I would ask those opposite to reflect on if they are serious about their engagement on education and the economy into the future, it is this: 'The quality of an education system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers.' Research clearly demonstrates that the quality of instruction is the single greatest influence within schools on student performance. Countries like Korea, Finland and Singapore all recruit their teachers from the top-performing university graduates. It is no surprise, therefore, that, when we go to the international performance benchmarking, their students get the best results when it comes to international testing.We also know that right across Australia some schools are struggling to recruit motivated, highly qualified, highly effective teachers, particularly those in the areas of greatest disadvantage. Those opposite talked long and hard for 12 years about this but did practically nothing in this area - talking about quality education; doing nothing of substance about quality education. During their period in office they commissioned a total of 24 reports on teaching alone, some 220 sets of recommendations. You have to ask yourself: where did that all end up at the end of the day in terms of real changes on the ground in classrooms and with teachers?We are working through the Council of Australian Governments on a practical program of reform to make sure that our kids in the classroom have a decent pathway to the future. One of the areas of reform we are looking at is: how do we ensure that we get the best quality teachers deployed into those schools of greatest disadvantage? How do you do that?We have looked around the world for other examples. We have looked in America. Teach For America is an example of such an innovative approach. Since 1990, more than 14,000 young Americans have completed Teach For America placements in US schools, and it is now highly sought after, with more than 19,000 applications for 1,500 places a year. Recruits to Teach For America receive five weeks of intensive training and are then placed in disadvantaged schools. Research shows that Teach For America members have a positive effect on the performance of individual students within those schools. The incremental impact of having a Teach For America corps member has been three times the incremental impact of having a teacher with three or more years experience. The objective here is to get your most highly trained, highest qualified tertiary graduates into the classroom.Teach First in the United Kingdom has a similar approach. It takes top new graduates from universities such as Cambridge and Oxford, provides them with six weeks training, then places them in hard-to-staff schools in disadvantaged areas. The graduates typically teach for a couple of years only before embarking subsequently on careers as lawyers, doctors or professionals. This program has also been highly sought after, not only because it allows graduates to have a more direct contribution to the community but also because it enables blue-chip companies in the United Kingdom to be engaged in the active encouragement of these young professionals to pursue a career in teaching and then to move off into the professions - but critically a significant proportion remain in teaching.It is this sort of partnership between schools and government and corporations that we wish to embrace here as part of our response for the quality teaching revolution which we believe now needs to occur in Australia. In Australia also, corporates have taken a big interest in their possible contribution. I recognise publicly the contribution of the Australian Business and Community Network. It has a membership of some 29 leading Australian companies, including companies like KPMG, the Commonwealth Bank, UBS and Channel 10. Through this network, employees of these firms help with mentoring students, mentoring teachers and principals and helping kids with their reading. The Australian Industry Group is also an important contributor in this area through its Adopt a School program, where companies and schools work together to provide opportunities which broaden the experience of students and help them prepare for the world of work.The government's agenda is clear-cut. An education revolution is necessary in order to bring about long-term productivity growth in the Australian economy. Those opposite had 12 years to act on this - report after report after report gathering dust, more dust and more dust again on the shelves, recommendations not resulting in concrete action. This government intends to get on with the job of reforming the nation's education system and reforming the quality of teaching within our schools, and we therefore will be prosecuting this bold agenda of reform - in contrast to the 12 lost years which those opposite presided over.</DOC>

 - The question of petrol and grocery prices and their impact on working families, pensioners and carers is of continuing concern for all Australians. It is of continuing concern to all those in government in Australia. - That is the first principle. The second thing is to recognise that there are practical things which governments can do in response, in our case beginning with, through the budget, ensuring that we can implement a $55 billion Working Families Support Package, which we legislated. Secondly, we have a $7.5 billion additional set of payments for pensioners, carers and those on the disability support pension. These are practical steps forward. In terms of the factors impacting on oil prices, let us simply be realistic about the fact that global oil prices are out there affecting all economies across the world. If those opposite have a particular solution as to how to quarantine this economy from the roll-on impact of changes in the global price of oil, I am all ears. -  - I hear lots of opportunistic political pointscoring; I do not see a practical plan of action on this. We have one when it comes to providing consumers with a real opportunity to choose where they purchase their petrol. Those opposite have chosen to side with big oil against the consumers. When it comes to the range of other measures which are before us, they have consistently chosen to take sides with the big supermarket chains, with the big oil companies, with the private health insurance companies, against the interests of individual consumers. We stand for giving more power to consumers. They stand for denying consumers that power. We stand for a principle of responsible budget management which delivers a significant package of tax relief measures as well as additional payments for pensioners, carers and DSP recipients and beyond that.For 12 years, those opposite sat there and did nothing about any fundamental reform to the pension. They sat there and did nothing. The pretence line and the hypocrisy line from those opposite is that, mysteriously, cost-of-living pressures emerged in the last six to eight months affecting pensioners. That is just unsustainable and unbelievable and they stand condemned for their 12 years of inaction.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I know he has a deep interest in our education revolution and in making sure that every Australian student gets the best possible start in life. It was my pleasure earlier today - with the Prime Minister; the member for Canberra, Annette Ellis; and the ACT Minister for Education and Training, Andrew Barr - to visit Gordon Primary School. There we saw some bright young people working hard on their numeracy, working hard on their maths, doing calculations in their head that I think many members of this House would find quite challenging. One of the things that was absolutely reinforced when we saw those young people at work was that every Australian child deserves to be in a great school, every Australian child should get a great education.I was pleased that this morning, when visiting that school, the Prime Minister and I were able to announce a practical measure to make a difference on literacy and numeracy. That is a school which is going to benefit from $40 million of pilot programs, part of our $577 million dedicated to literacy and numeracy. And that school is particularly going to benefit through an allocation of $286,920 to help it further the numeracy program that it has there and which we saw in operation today.The announcement that we made today is for $40 million for pilot programs around the country in 29 schools - schools in all states and territories and in all school systems. This is a first practical step in our $577 million literacy and numeracy plan. It was great to be at that school today. Seeing those children reinforces the message that the Prime Minister put yesterday, which is: we need a revolution in the quality of Australian schooling right throughout this nation. Whether we are talking about literacy or whether we are talking about numeracy, we know that there is more to do. If I could give the House one statistic which should cause it to reflect on the need to focus on quality in schooling, to focus on quality in teaching, and to focus on a new national arrangement for schools in disadvantaged communities, it would be this statistic. If we look at OECD information, in 2006 Australia was significantly outperformed in reading performance by five countries: Korea; Finland; Hong Kong, China; Canada and New Zealand. In 2000, only Finland outscored Australia. This is graphic proof that, when it comes to education standards, standing still is going backwards. It is graphic proof that, when it comes to the education standards of the world and of our competitors, unless we further invest this nation will go backwards.As the Prime Minister outlined yesterday, we are committed to a new era of quality in Australian schools. We are committed to a new era of transparency. We are committed to a new era - an education revolution - that will ensure that, whether a child is from the most humble of backgrounds or the most advantaged, they will go to a great school. I have been amazed to see the reaction of the opposition to this. We saw the Leader of the Opposition leader go out and basically say, 'I tried to do a bit of this and I failed.' We did not need the opposition leader to confirm that he is a failure. Every Australian student and every Australian parent already knew that he was a failed education minister. And, in case there was any doubt, members of his backbench make sure that members of the media understand it every day. We are leaving that era of failure behind us to deliver an education revolution so that every child goes to a great school and every child gets a great education.</DOC>

 - I note in one of the surveys released today about the state of confidence in general, particular reference is made to interest rates being too high. That is what it says. That is obviously a key factor here. On that score, I would draw the attention of honourable members opposite to the fact that interest rates did not start going up in November 2007. Interest rates went up 10 times under the member for Higgins. The member for Higgins delivered to this economy the second highest interest rates in the developed world and the highest inflation rate in 16 years. - I am glad that he has come to life in the chamber as, slowly but surely, he moves his way from the back of the chamber to the front of the chamber - we think. The bottom line is: the cumulative effect of 10 interest rate rises has an effect on confidence. When you look more broadly at what is happening in the global economy, and you look at confidence levels in the global economy, in the US the most prominent measure of consumer confidence has fallen more than 50 per cent since the global turbulence began and it is around its lowest in 16 years. In the United Kingdom, consumer confidence has fallen to its lowest level in 16 years. In New Zealand, confidence has fallen to its lowest level in 17 years. When you look at all these factors combined, you see the impact of what is happening with the global financial crisis right across the developed economies of the world.But here is the kicker for Australia - delivered by the member for Higgins when he was Treasurer. If you deliver a series of 10 interest rate rises in a row, it has an impact on confidence. That is what has happened. The key question is: what do you do about it? Do you bury your head in the sand or embark upon a course of action? We have embarked on a course of action anchored in a budget surplus of $22 billion, in a productivity reform agenda through a skills revolution, in dealing with infrastructure bottlenecks and in dealing with deregulation. This is a practical agenda of reform for the future, as opposed to the member for Higgins, who sits back, waiting for events to unfold, almost like a smiling predator - some said 'assassin'; I would not go that far - almost bleakly anticipating the rollout of what happens across the global economy and forgetting the fact that, in the case of these domestic economic conditions, he is a principal contributor.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I welcome that question, because the government is delivering substantial assistance to families, first of all, through the tax cuts. But the government is committed to delivering an education revolution. In addition to providing extra resources for the education system, we are also committed to helping parents with the everyday costs of their children: $4.4 billion to create a new education tax refund - 1.3 million families and 2.7 million students. Eligible families will be able to receive a 50 per cent refund every year for key education expenses - laptops, stationery, school textbooks. All of those families eligible for family tax benefit A will be eligible for the education tax refund: $375 for each child undertaking primary studies; $750 for each child at secondary school. Of course, what parents need to do is to keep their receipts because they will be able to provide those and have the moneys returned in their 2008-09 income tax return. This is a very important initiative for Australian families, particularly when they are under considerable financial pressure. We on this side of the House are getting on with the job of assisting parents with the cost of their children's education, as well as providing additional assistance to the education system itself.</DOC>

 - The national government is responsible for fiscal policy and, through the agency of the Reserve Bank, for monetary policy. It follows as a logical consequence of that that, when you are going through difficult global and national economic times, the national government will be held accountable. We accept responsibility for that; there are no two ways about that.But can I also draw the honourable member's attention to some other data which he did not seem to want to emphasise today, and that is data on the private capital expenditure index. According to the ABS data today, the private capital expenditure capex rose by a stronger than expected 5.7 per cent in the June 2008 quarter to be 8.1 per cent higher than a year ago, following a revised one per cent increase in the March quarter. I would ask this question: why is it that, when there is positive economic data out there, those opposite find no reason to embrace that in their argument at all? They may have a passing interest in talking this economy down, a process begun early this year by the member for North Sydney and continued by the member for Wentworth, with the selective selection of ABS data which happens to be out.There are challenges facing the international economy and there are challenges facing the domestic economy. I would draw honourable members' attention to the fact that, internationally, six of the seven major economies in the OECD - those of the United Kingdom, Italy, Canada, Germany, France and Japan - have in the last six months generated either zero growth or negative growth in a particular economic quarter. That is actually what is happening in the global economy. Therefore, the roll-on consequences of contracting growth globally, and with our principal economic partners, is going to have an effect here. But, again, those opposite, apart from acting as political predators or, as some would say, as political vultures on the question of the current state of the global economy, should be asking the practical question, the real question, which is: what are you going to do about it?The first discipline is responsible economic management through a $22 billion budget surplus to give us a buffer for the future. What is the response on the part of those opposite? 'How do you tear that surplus apart?' If they were to embrace that course of action through the Senate, it would do compound the problems left to us by the member for Higgins. It would compound the overall pressure on public demand to the extent that it would make it less likely that we would see interest rate reductions in the future - and that is what the economy needs.Secondly, you deal with the substantial and continuing economic reform agenda with the government, which has one organising principle: boosting long-term productivity growth. The productivity growth agenda forms the core of this government's economic reform agenda, anchored in an education revolution, anchored in an infrastructure revolution and anchored in a program of business deregulation. Those opposite allowed these three areas of reform to gather dust on the shelves. We have a plan for the future; those opposite simply have an excuse for the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and his ongoing interest in infrastructure issues. We do indeed face huge transport challenges in this country: a freight task that will double over the next decade, congestion costs that are increasing and greenhouse emissions that are growing. We need a comprehensive plan to tackle these challenges, and rail must be a part of the solution.Last night I attended the Australasian Railway Association dinner. It was a great night, and I congratulate the industry on their presentation on the state of rail and its future challenges. I was pleased to see so many of my parliamentary colleagues there. Indeed, there were more than 30 members of the coalition there last night to hear the presentation about rail. That is almost half the party room. The member for Wentworth, unfortunately, was not there, but perhaps he should have been - to talk to his caucus colleagues. He did not have to resign from the economics committee to get extra time to talk to his caucus colleagues; he could just go to more functions on a Wednesday night. From their attendance last night, you would think that the coalition had a great interest in rail. But look at the legacy that we have inherited. The rail share of the freight market -  
An opposition member - Do you have any plans for rail? - Absolutely. And I am talking about not just our plans but also the risk to our plans, which was part of the question. But at least they got the right question; that was better than the deputy leader the other day. At least they are somewhat on track.The fact is that we inherited a real problem with the industry. The rail share of the freight market has fallen in every single corridor on the east coast. Trains spend up to 10 hours sitting in Sydney because there are no dedicated freight lines - none. That is their record. But worse than all their neglect in the past is their attitude towards the future. We have built a surplus with a purpose. We have put $20 billion into the Building Australia Fund. It will invest in infrastructure to lock in our future prosperity. Part of that has to be about our rail future. Yet, while we listened and ate last night, they were planning to starve the industry of funds by blocking budget measures. Every cent that they knock off the surplus is money that cannot be used to clear rail bottlenecks in Sydney.Every time that they vote no in the Senate, they are saying no to providing solutions to deal with traffic congestion in our major cities. Every time they block a budget measure, that is less funds to deal with public transport. We know that they do not believe in public transport, but we on this side do. They should pass our budget to make sure that these funds can be available for long-term infrastructure spending. That is why they should pass our budget. It is not good enough to just go along to dinners on a Wednesday night in Canberra because you have nothing to do; you actually have to front up to the policy challenges. They left a dreadful legacy when it comes to rail. This government is committed to turning that around, and we want the opportunity to have our Building Australia Fund left intact so that it can be spent on long-term infrastructure.</DOC>

 - As I have said before at the dispatch box, as Prime Minister of Australia I accept responsibility for the good news and the bad news on the Australian economy. I accept responsibility for the good news in terms of other policy developments which we are embracing and for where we need to make improvements. That is just what I describe as a sensible exercise in levelling with the Australian people.The truth of the matter is that we have big challenges ahead, partly compounded by what is going on globally and partly compounded by the inertia on the part of those opposite for 12 years. But the key thing, as I have said to those opposite before, is this: what is your plan of action for the future? We have a plan of action for the future based on responsible economic management. The Liberal Party oppose that. We have a plan of action for the future on a productivity revolution. The Liberal Party oppose that. We wish to implement a quality education reform program. The Liberal Party, it seems, now oppose that. I find that remarkable. We have a proposal for an infrastructure revolution in Australia, of which the minister has just spoken, based on a $20 billion infrastructure investment fund. Those opposite, it seems, oppose that because they describe it as a slush fund. We have a reform program in social policy as well - when it comes to homelessness, when it comes to closing the gap and when it comes to the fundamental reform of Australia's pension system. I presume those opposite oppose that as well.The key thing in all these challenges is whether you have a positive plan for the future. We have such a plan. We have such a bold reform plan. I would suggest to those opposite that the best thing they could do to help with the overall direction of inflation and the overall direction of interest rates is to tell their colleagues in the red chamber over in that direction to get behind the government's program, to get behind the budget surplus and to deliver a responsible economic outcome for the country.</DOC>

 - I want to take this opportunity to remind the House about some commitments that were made during the election last year. We announced that, if we formed government, we would put $290 million into a new Commonwealth Dental Health Program to help reduce the public waiting lists that have grown to over 650,000 people across the country courtesy of the neglect of those opposite. We also announced that we would be delivering a Medicare Teen Dental Plan, providing over a million eligible teenagers with access to preventative dental checks.At the same time, we made public - in fact, we made clear in this House - that we would abolish the Howard government's poorly targeted and failing chronic disease dental scheme. This is a scheme that as of June this year, despite its four years of operation, had not helped a single child under the age of 14 in all of South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. This was a shameful, poorly targeted program under which a multimillionaire could get assistance but a pensioner with a toothache could not. We gave Australians a choice at the last election, and they chose our better targeted dental policies and an investment of $780 million into dental care. But the opposition's economic vandalism - an affection, it seems, for more and more cheap and short-term politics in the Senate - is putting at risk these policies.I would like to put on the table today the number of public dental services and the funding that was scheduled to go to each state and territory under the Commonwealth dental scheme that the opposition is putting in jeopardy: in New South Wales, over $90 million to pay for 327,000 extra services; in Victoria, over $72 million to pay for a quarter of a million extra services; in Queensland, more than $52 million to pay for nearly 200,000 services; in Western Australia, $23 million to pay for 82,000 services; in South Australia, $24 million to pay for more than 85,000 services; in Tasmania - including the electorate of the member for Bass, who asked the question - over $10 million for 30,000 services; in the Australian Capital Territory, nearly $5 million for 15,000 services; and in the Northern Territory, nearly $5 million for 10,000 services.These very services that the public voted for are being put in jeopardy because some of the funds that were going to pay for them are being blocked by the opposition in the Senate. We made it clear that in funding our dental programs we would redirect some of the money from the Liberal scheme to the Labor program. We made a choice and so did the public. But it appears that it is impossible for those opposite to make that choice. I feel like we are back in the old days, with the Liberal Party opposing us putting money into public dental schemes. It is just like the old days - everything old is new; Brendan Nelson is on the same old bandwagon as John Howard and the Liberals are blocking money going into public dental services.Initially they campaigned against our program, but now they are backing it. They are claiming that they can be economically responsible, but at the same time they want to continue with their old program. They just love to walk both sides of the street, but they cannot have it both ways. Their action is threatening our program. I say to them: when it comes to dental care, the Australian people were offered a choice. The Australian people made a choice. Why can't the Liberals?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Can I express my concern for the individuals and the families caught up in that circumstance. I am sure that as the local member he too is very deeply concerned. On the question of jobs and employment generally, obviously, as the Prime Minister said earlier in question time, we are in a world of global economic uncertainty. We are in a domestic economy where we have had rising interest rates and, yes, that shows. That shows in the real economy and sometimes, tragically, it shows in the form of job losses.But what I can certainly assure the member is this: one of the things we were elected to do and one of the things we are most certainly committed to doing is to make sure that Australians who find themselves in that situation get treated fairly and decently. I accept that the member is a new member in this House and perhaps he may not know, but under the industrial relations policy of the former government, the Liberal government, under the Work Choices extremism that the Liberal Party brought to this country and still supports, it was always possible for an employee to have their entitlements to redundancy pay ripped away without a cent of compensation. That was the workplace relations policy the Liberal Party took to the last election. It is the one your political party supports.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Hasluck for her question. I was in Hasluck earlier this month and saw firsthand her extraordinary efforts on behalf of her constituents. She is a very strong advocate indeed and was lobbying very strongly for her local area to benefit from the Rudd Labor government's housing affordability measures. The government made clear before the last election that housing affordability would be a key priority. We recognised that strong action was needed to overcome many years of neglect in the area of housing affordability. The May budget funded our commitments in full and delivered $2.2 billion worth of new investment in the area of housing affordability. It was the first budget in over a decade to deliver new spending in this area.First home saver accounts, for example, will be available from October this year. The new accounts will provide a simple, tax-effective way for Australians to save a bigger deposit for their first home through a combination of government contribution and low taxes. The government is investing $1.2 billion in these new accounts and will provide a 17 per cent contribution on the first $5,000 of individual savings made each year. This means that anyone who is contributing $5,000 to their account will receive an $850 deposit from the government. As we get closer to October, I would urge people who are interested in these new accounts to contact their banks and talk about the availability of the accounts. I am particularly thinking of young people, perhaps starting in their first job. They should think very seriously about putting aside $10 or $20 a week and, as their wage increases over the years, putting more into those accounts so that by the time they reach the age of 25 or 30 and are thinking about buying their first house they will have a nice little nest egg ready.Look at the National Rental Affordability Scheme, our $623 million scheme to help build 50,000 new, affordable rental properties around the country. These properties will rent for 20 per cent below the market rent for a particular area and residents will still be eligible for Commonwealth rent assistance, making the properties even more affordable. On 24 July the Treasurer and I launched the first round of expressions of interest for the National Rental Affordability Scheme, and the applications are coming in. There has been a strong interest from institutional investors and from community housing groups who want to build bigger portfolios of affordable housing. These new homes will make a huge difference to people who are struggling in the private rental market.I will also say something on our Housing Affordability Fund. Our $512 million Housing Affordability Fund will lower the cost of building new homes, particularly at the entry level of the market. Thirty million dollars of this new fund has already been distributed to advance electronic development assessment. Earlier this month I announced further funding for the states and territories to roll out new electronic development with councils in their areas. There are no overnight solutions to the housing affordability problems that we have inherited. The mayors from South-East Queensland who were in the gallery earlier today, and who are here lobbying, know as well as we do on this side of the chamber the pressures that working families are facing in terms of housing affordability.Our agenda depends on a strong surplus, and the best thing the opposition could do would be to stop their attempts to block $6.2 billion worth of our surplus. We understand on this side of the chamber that many Australians are facing cost-of-living pressures, including in the area of housing affordability. We know how important it is to pass the budget in full so that we can continue our vital work helping Australian working families find an affordable place to buy or rent.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. One of the critical challenges facing the government is rebuilding Australia's infrastructure, a task for which the previous government effectively denied any responsibility. As a result, the Rudd government has inherited a situation of congested cities, dilapidated university infrastructure and third-rate broadband infrastructure.The government are committed to playing our part in renewing this infrastructure across the country, to rebuilding the sinews and arteries of our nation's economy and to delivering the future economic prosperity that we all aspire to. Therefore, as a centrepiece of the budget - which we are still struggling to get through this parliament - we have established three major infrastructure funds, with $41 billion to be funded from this year's and next year's surplus, to finance long-term infrastructure projects, to rebuild our dilapidated university infrastructure, to improve the transport efficiency of our cities, to lower business costs, to ensure that commuters can have shorter commutes and lower their petrol costs as a result of better transport infrastructure, to ensure that Australians will enjoy world-class, accessible, affordable broadband and to rebuild our public hospital system.The opposition dismisses these funds as 'slush funds', in a complete denial of the facts and a complete denial of reality. The money in these funds will be managed by the Future Fund, with a board that was appointed by the then government and which we endorsed at the time. The moneys will be disbursed over the long term, and there will be options for future surpluses to be paid into the funds in due course. Decisions will be guided by expert, arms-length advice from independent bodies like Infrastructure Australia. They will be subject to the Council of Australian Governments and the Loan Council to ensure that state effort is maintained, that we do not allow the states to drop the ball in their efforts, and that the economy has the capacity to deliver.I notice that over the last day or two the opposition have suddenly discovered an interest in jobs. It would be worth them noting that one of the key drivers of long-term employment opportunity is infrastructure. Infrastructure is central. If you want a small example, have a look at the beneficial impact that the Western Ring Road has had in the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne on employment opportunities in those regions. The Western Ring Road was constructed by the former Labor government - the Hawke and Keating government. I would also remind them that we live in a market economy, where employment goes up and down in individual companies. Some of us have long memories. Some of us remember things like the collapse of Ansett and the loss of 15,000 jobs because of the former Liberal government's refusal to allow Singapore Airlines to take over Ansett. Some of us have long memories about some of the events that occurred under the former Liberal governments - National Textiles is another example. So, before you get too precious in pursuing these arguments, perhaps you should remember some of your own track records.There has been a considerable amount of debate about the actions of the Liberal Party in the Senate in seeking to pursue their smash-and-grab raid on the government's budget - particularly focused on the government's efforts to ensure that the budget is putting downward pressure on interest rates. There is another crucially important dimension to this issue, and that is that they are raiding the infrastructure funds that the government is establishing to rebuild this nation's infrastructure. The $6 billion or so that is in jeopardy as a result of the actions of the opposition in the Senate is $6 billion that cannot help to contribute to the building of the north-south bypass tunnel in Brisbane. It will not be available to contribute to the construction of the Footscray to Caulfield rail link in Melbourne. It will not be available to help in the construction of a world-class broadband network for regional Australia. It will not be available to help in the construction of new university facilities in this country.This is the consequence of the actions of the Liberal Party in the Senate. These infrastructure funds, which are for long-term investment in infrastructure, will generate employment opportunities for Australians and generate long-term economic prosperity for our children. It is high time that the opposition rethought its approach and understood that it, too, has responsibilities for the future of this country and the future of our children and their economic opportunities, which are so dependent on our ability to have world-class infrastructure.</DOC>

 - I am disappointed to have to report to the House that the government's plans to introduce cost recovery for the PBS listing process has today been voted down in the other place. This is the latest act of economic vandalism by those opposite, and it will result in another $51 million in lost revenue over the forward estimates - blowing an even bigger hole in the budget surplus. I want to highlight to the House - because it is even more disappointing to have to report - that this is not just one of our policies that the opposition are opposing; this is actually one of the Liberal government's policies that they are now voting against. In fact, when they were sitting on the other side of the House, they thought this was such a good idea that they actually banked the savings in their own budget last year. But now they are in opposition, now there is an opportunity to side with big industry, here they are opposing it.This is a policy that the Liberal government was so fond of that it banked the savings in 2007-08 and never even introduced any legislation into the parliament. And now what do we find? We introduce the legislation into the parliament and you have voted against it. The one thing that we can say for sure is that the Liberal Party does not know what it stands for anymore. The Liberal Party does not know if it should vote for its own policies; it does not know if it should vote for our policies. It does not have any decent policy proposal. It is certainly not standing for economic responsibility. It seems to me that the only thing the Liberal Party knows is that, if there is a big industry involved, it is going to be on that side. - It does not matter if it is the insurance industry against taxpayers or if it is the distillers against parents and the police. In this instance, it is lining up with an $18 billion pharmaceutical industry and blowing a $51 million hole in our budget.</DOC>

We actually understand that people, when they can save a few cents at the petrol bowser, think it is worth while; they think it does make a difference. If you can save 20c on a litre of petrol, that is a terrific thing. Yesterday in Sydney you could have saved 27c a litre. I think in Sydney today it is about 22c.

 - May I thank the member for Solomon for his question. The member for Solomon of course has a passionate commitment towards Indigenous job seekers, not only in Darwin but also beyond Darwin, and I thank him for the question. On 13 February the Prime Minister stood in this place on this spot on behalf of the nation apologising to the Indigenous Australians for the grief, suffering and loss that they endured. That apology was a historic and healing moment in this country. But the government believes that this apology must be accompanied by even greater substance. In particular, the government is committed to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in the areas of life expectancy, educational achievement and employment outcomes. That is why we welcome and commend Andrew Forrest and his initiative to work with corporate Australia to provide 50,000 employment opportunities for Indigenous Australians. In doing so, I thank and acknowledge the great work already undertaken by employers in this field. There are, of course, many employers working in this area, but there is a lot more to be done.We are aware that the Australian Employment Covenant is a bold challenge. Let me say that it will be supported by the Rudd government. We will work very closely with the covenant group and its supporters in the private and philanthropic sectors in pursuit of this worthy goal. The government will provide relevant accredited training and ongoing mentoring to ensure that Indigenous job seekers are given the support and skills they need to get a job and to keep a job. It is crucial for those many highly disadvantaged job seekers - who may have limited literacy and numeracy skills, who may have confronted awful experiences of domestic violence, who may have experienced social dysfunction or, indeed, who may not even comprehend, in the true sense, what paid work is all about - including, unfortunately, Indigenous job-seekers, that they can see that they have a future. One of the most powerful ways we can convince job seekers that they have a genuine chance is to give them a clear path between where they stand now and where that job lies. Because the Australian Employment Covenant is asking for undertakings from the corporate sector, it provides that type of opportunity for Indigenous jobseekers. That provides a better life for those Indigenous people, and it is for that reason this government will support this noble endeavour.</DOC>

 - What we have always said is that we stand for any measure which gives consumers some more power. That means enabling consumers across the country to have access to information online which tells them which of the individual chains - Coles, Woolies, Aldi or others - offer the best deal over time against a given set of baskets of goods. There are, from memory, some 62 different regions sampling some 600 supermarkets on a regular basis and, again from memory, there are about six or seven baskets of goods. All this is designed to do is to provide a bit extra by way of consumer power and a bit more by way of consumer choice.On the question that the honourable member raises about bringing down grocery prices, those opposite will well recall the ridicule heaped on the Labor Party, the Treasurer and I while in opposition by the member for Higgins when he specifically refused to provide such undertakings. They ridiculed us in opposition, and of course they have forgotten now that the tables have changed because it suits their political purpose to verbal us in a different direction. But if there is one key theme emerging from all of this - and I think the Minister for Health and Ageing got it absolutely right before - whether it is with the big pharmaceutical companies, whether it is with the very big private health insurance companies, whether it is with the big oil companies or whether it is with the big supermarket chains, we always know who is going to line up on behalf of the consumers and who is going to line up on behalf of big business. The Liberals cannot shake their age-old habit of lining up with big business, for which they stand. - Yes.The member for Dickson then left the chamber.An incident having occurred in the gallery - The member for Fadden then left the chamber.The member for Warringah then left the chamber.An incident having occurred in the gallery - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question and her very real interest in improving the living conditions of Indigenous people in Australia. Any of us who have been to the APY lands in remote South Australia would know that improving the living conditions is absolutely vital, particularly for the children living in those communities. Just two weeks ago I went to the APY lands with the South Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation and met with a number of community members and the executive of the APY lands.There is no question that the housing conditions on the APY lands are nothing short of appalling. The essential services are either nonexistent or in serious disrepair. There are very high levels of overcrowding and of transients putting significant pressure on families. Members of this House from the South Australian community in particular know that the recent Mullighan inquiry reported horrifying evidence of widespread child abuse on the APY lands and found that the appalling level of housing was a significant contributor to the levels of child abuse. This is a situation that the nation cannot accept and must act upon.Since we were elected, I have been working closely with the South Australian government to secure leases over the lands for improved housing. After more than a year, negotiations between the South Australian government and the APY executive had almost broken down. But in a major breakthrough following our visit, the APY executive just last week agreed to 50-year leases for both new and improved housing on the APY lands. I am very pleased to announce today that the South Australian minister has signed off on the leases and that an official will fly to the APY lands for a final sign-off on the part of the APY executive. This is a major breakthrough, because the Commonwealth can now finally move forward on our $25 million commitment and start building and improving housing in these APY communities. It has been a very long time coming.The housing will be managed as public housing with normal tenancy rights and obligations, and the leases, which are what we have been working on for so long, will provide the secure tenure to make it absolutely plain that the South Australian government is responsible for the regular maintenance of that housing. For the first time it will be absolutely plain where responsibility lies for the management of the housing stock. There will now be new work and training opportunities available for Indigenous Australians on the APY lands and construction and maintenance will now take place for both new and upgraded houses.One of the other important reforms as a result of this agreement is that it will be clear that rent will have to be collected and paid on a regular basis and, of course, tenants will have to look after their homes. Agreements like this are vital if we are to close the life expectancy gap that exists between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. This agreement, which has now been secured on the APY lands, followed an earlier agreement we reached in June for the Alice Springs town camps. We will be seeking similar arrangements, similar leases, in other remote parts of Australia so that we can see these vital improvements to housing conditions take place.I would like to take this opportunity in the chamber today to congratulate the leaders in the APY lands for taking this major step forward and also the South Australian Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation, Jay Weatherill, for his commitment to improving the lives and living conditions of Indigenous people in South Australia.</DOC>

 - The government welcomes questions on education and the government welcomes questions on infrastructure because in both of theses areas we saw such a litany of inaction for 12 years. If you come to government, as we did in December last - and we have been in government for less than nine months - and you are confronted with the state of the broadband network in terms of speed and available bandwidth, then the requirement for government to act is huge. I constantly lost count of the number of attempts the previous government had at doing anything constructive about broadband. There were 18 separate proposals; 18 separate programs - it was impossible to follow them. All I know is that every community that I went to across regional Australia would say, in one of their first presentations to this government, 'Will you please act to do something on broadband because the previous government has let us down.'Because we have embarked on such a significant national program involving potentially billions of dollars of public funds, we will go through the most rigorous, comprehensive public tender process to ensure that probity is honoured so that we can get on with the business of rolling out this network. We are committed to a digital revolution in Australia. We are committed to a digital education revolution in Australia. It is the pathway to the future and we are confident of the progress we have made.</DOC>

 - National Literacy and Numeracy Week, which starts on Monday and runs for a week, is an opportunity for all of us to celebrate reading and literature and to remind ourselves that there should always be opportunities in life to curl up with a good book. So I thought it was appropriate today, the last sitting day before we start National Literacy and Numeracy Week, to talk about some books that people might be contemplating reading.I have been looking at some of the websites of our great publishing houses. My attention was drawn to the website of Melbourne University Press, which of course is going to be publishing the memoirs of the member for Higgins. When I looked at the website I found that the motto of Melbourne University Press is 'books with spine'. Books with spine from a politician without one! We await this great entry into the literary world. Mr Speaker, you would be aware that some movies fail so badly that they go straight to DVD; well, I am betting this one goes straight to paperback! It will not be a very hard spine when that one is published.I am sure that this book with the very soft spine - or perhaps without a spine at all - will be the subject of much discussion at tomorrow night's testimonial dinner for the member for Higgins. Of course, on the question of reading there will be 'what's on the printed menu?' Prawns for entree? No spine there. Chicken for main course? A good thought. And, of course, jelly for dessert - what else? - </DOC>

 - The Reserve Bank sets interest rates, and one of the things it sets interest rates on the basis of is the state of overall inflationary pressures in the economy. One of the things that the Reserve Bank is entirely mindful of is the extent to which those inflationary pressures have endured over time. If you look carefully at the minutes of the most recent Reserve Bank meeting, it has concluded that these inflationary pressures have continued for some time. Furthermore, it has noted, as I believe has the IMF recently, that there has also been a moderating influence brought to bear on fiscal policy through the right settings which have been adopted by the government through its management of the budget. -  - For those who scoff opposite, I would draw their attention to the most recent statement to this effect by the International Monetary Fund. If you are able to bring your fiscal policy into balance with your monetary policy, and to ensure that you have got the right settings overall, you make the job of the Reserve Bank easier to bring down interest rates over time. That has been one of the core organising principles which we have sought to bring to bear in the debate on the economy.As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the key thing is that it is the Reserve Bank which sets rates. I note with interest, on that score, that the Leader of the Opposition had something to say to this effect this morning. He was disputing the proposition that the independence of the bank should be respected. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition began speaking about a particular requirement of the bank to bring in a 50 basis point decrease. A journalist said to the Leader of the Opposition: 'You have made a case for 50. If you are Prime Minister, does that give you carte blanche to tell the Reserve Bank what you expect in terms of rate movements - cuts or increases in the future?' Mr Nelson replied, 'Well, the responsibility of the Prime Minister and the government of the day is obviously to make sure that we get the economic settings right, to talk up the Australian economy, not to talk the economy down, to speak responsibly about the inflationary challenge that we face.' All fine and dandy. We go on. Journalist: 'Would you like to see the Prime Minister say what you have said?' That is calling on the bank for a 50 basis point decrease. Mr Nelson: 'No, I'm not going to comment on that at all.' Journalist: 'But you're the alternative Prime Minister as well. If Prime Minister, does that mean that you will tell the Reserve Bank what you expect in terms of rate movements?' Answer: 'No.' So what we have is the Leader of the Opposition going out on the doors this morning, saying to the Reserve Bank that there should be a defined decrease of a particular quantum in the cash rate, while we on this side of the House respect the independence of the Reserve Bank. But then he is asked the key question: 'You've said that as Leader of the Opposition. If you're elected as Prime Minister, are you going to say that as well?' He says no. - The interjection says it is a different job. I hear constantly the Leader of the Opposition stand at the dispatch box and say he speaks as the alternative Prime Minister of Australia, and therefore his pronunciations on monetary policy are those of the alternative Prime Minister - that is, that the Reserve Bank should act in a particular way. What we now have is the new Nelson doctrine: what I say in opposition has nothing whatsoever to do with what I do in government. In other words, the overall dictum of those opposite is to say anything, to do anything, to promise anything in order to get themselves a headline. How can the Leader of the Opposition stand credibly in the parliament today and speak about responsible economic management when he goes out one morning and says, as Leader of the Liberal Party and as alternative Prime Minister, that the Reserve Bank should take a particular course of action on rates and, in the same breath, say that if he were Prime Minister he would not say that or do that? That is where we have got to with the Leader of the Opposition. The credibility of the Leader of the Opposition on this entire debate on interest rates - quite apart from how we have got to this position in the first place, given that we have had 10 interest rate rises in a row under the Liberal Party - collapsed on the doors this morning when he said, 'I, Brendan Nelson, will be opportunistic and say what I like on this, but I, Brendan Nelson, as alternative Prime Minister, would not do this.' The Leader of the Opposition does not know whether he is coming or going.</DOC>

 - As we know, in Australia we are facing tough global economic times. This is because we are dealing with the impact of the global financial crisis, the impact of changes in global credit markets and also the impact of falls on global stock exchanges. This, of course, has been compounded by the oil price hike and the food price hike, and the result is that we have seen across the world both business and consumer confidence take a pounding. You see that in the numbers generated out of the various OECD economies, where five of the seven economies have generated either zero or negative growth in the most recent quarter. These global economic challenges have been compounded for Australia by the domestic economic circumstances which this government inherited. To recap for those opposite -  -  - firstly, 20 Reserve Bank warnings - they do not like this; secondly, and on top of that, we had inflation running at a 16-year high when the government was elected; thirdly, we had 10 interest rate rises in a row, delivering us the second-highest interest rates in the developed world. -  - I am glad the member for Higgins has come to life, yet again, having been out on the town with some others on Friday night in Melbourne talking to a few folk. The cumulative impact of those interest rate changes over time - that is, 10 interest rate rises in a row -  - The member for Higgins does not like this number - on a $247,000 average mortgage, means that we have a $400 a month interest rate hit as a result of the Costello interest rate regime - $100 a week. So if you calculate it on the basis of an average mortgage and the impact of 200 basis point increases in official interest rates - 10 interest rate rises in a row - that is where it leads you. That is the practical consequence for working families - a Costello $400 a month interest rate hit or the Liberals' $400 a month interest rate hit.The question that the parliament rightly asked itself is: what is the correct economic strategy in response to this? The first element is responsible economic management, and that is why we have brought down a $22 billion budget surplus. The second, of course, is to ensure that we have a program of comprehensive economic reform to deal with declining productivity growth in the Australian economy. These are the matters about which the Deputy Prime Minister and I have spoken in recent days - the productivity revolution and the education revolution which is necessary to fuel long-term skills growth. Then there is the challenge of nation building - and I will come back to that in a minute. And, of course, to assist working families, pensioners and carers on the way through this difficult period, there is our policy of a $55 billion Working Families Support Package and $7.5 billion to assist with extra payments to pensioners and carers.But the real challenge is how we take this entire economic agenda of the nation forward to deal with our real, long-term challenges: responsible economic management; acting on the productivity challenge for the education revolution; and implementing a program of nation building. This government stands proudly behind the fact that it is about to embark upon the single largest nation-building program in the Commonwealth's history. We have committed ourselves to a $76 billion Infrastructure Investment Program focused on our roads, our rail, our ports, our communications and our other critical infrastructure. The government will be investing $26 billion in roads and rail infrastructure through 2008-09 to the end of the AusLink 2 period; $20 billion in infrastructure, through the Building Australia Fund, on transport and also on other key infrastructure priorities; up to $5 billion on a national high-speed broadband network; $15 billion in education infrastructure through the Education Investment Fund on trades training centres, computers in our classrooms and investing in our universities; and $11 billion in health and hospitals infrastructure as well.Beyond this national infrastructure plan for Australia, the biggest national infrastructure plan in the history of the Commonwealth, a $76 billion plan, we also look with keen interest to what the private sector is doing in the period ahead. If we look at the most recent capex data produced by the ABS, we see that there are significant plans out there in the private sector to boost their investment in capital outlays into the future as well. This is a significant plan. When we add what is canvassed in the capex data, we see businesses planning to invest more than $100 billion in 2008-09.The way ahead through these difficult economic times is to have a clear and positive plan - a clear and positive plan of responsible economic management, a clear and positive plan on productivity growth through an economic reform agenda anchored in the education revolution and, on top of that, a $76 billion nation-building plan for the future. This separates us out from those opposite, who, I fear, in recent days, have seen it to their political advantage to begin talking the economy down rather than coming up with a positive plan for the economy's future. This government is about the economic future. Those opposite continue to revel in the past and are consoled by their inertia in the past as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, because this is a decision which is taken by the independent Reserve Bank. We on this side of the House respect the independence of the Reserve Bank. From day one, when we came to office, we did take responsibility for dealing with and tackling the inflation problem that was left to us by those opposite - 16-year high inflation in October, November and December -  -  - which produced 10 interest rate rises in a row under the Liberal Party. But we put up our hand and said we would accept responsibility for dealing with it, and dealing with it we are. We are dealing with it through responsible economic management, by building a strong surplus, a $22 billion surplus, that those opposite want to vandalise. We are also dealing with it by attending to the capacity constraints that those opposite ignored for 12 long years, thereby putting further upward pressure on inflation. On top of that, now we have the worst global conditions in over 25 years.All of these things are taken into account by the Reserve Bank, but one thing we did in our budget was that we made room to move. We made room to move for the Reserve Bank. They will take their independent decision tomorrow. But of course, if those opposite had their way, there would be no room to move for the Reserve Bank, because they want to vandalise the surplus. Do they have one single coherent answer to the problem of inflation, to do something about inflation and interest rates? Of course they don't. There is not one consistent economic policy coming from any of those opposite who pretend to know something about economic policy. I was talking here last week about the 'Three Stooges' on the other side. There was the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth and the member for Higgins. - I am dealing with inflation, I am dealing with interest rates and I am dealing with employment. The Leader of the Opposition was asked at the doors today whether, as Prime Minister, he would instruct the Reserve Bank governor to do what he had just advocated a couple of minutes earlier. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said at the doors in answer to the question, 'If Prime Minister, does that mean you will tell the Reserve Bank what you expect in terms of rate movements?' He answered, 'No.' He admitted that his policy in opposition is too irresponsible to be put in place in government. That is how irresponsible this Leader of the Opposition is. - Certainly, Mr Speaker, and because it was a question about who was responsible for interest-rate movements, absolutely. And what we had this morning from the second stooge, the member for Wentworth, at the doors, was that he walked out there and said that the government was responsible for interest rates going up, and in the next breath he said that if they came down we would not be responsible. He cannot have it both ways. On top of that, we had the third stooge -  - The member for Higgins had a blinder the other night, Mr Speaker. He suggested -  - The member for Higgins suggested the other night that if he were still in government the financial crisis on world financial markets would not have happened. I mean, fair dinkum - they are gaga! -  -  - Yes, Mr Speaker. The Rudd government is dealing with the most complex set of global economic circumstances in over 25 years. And on top of that we have inflation at 16-year highs, bequeathed to the people of Australia by those opposite. And we are doing everything in our power to put downward pressure on inflation and everything in our power to give the Reserve Bank room to move something which would not have happened if those opposite were on the front bench today. - </DOC>

 - These are very serious issues for the country which were not taken seriously by those opposite when they were in power. They were not taken seriously at all - 12 years of neglect. We are dealing with these issues, and we will not be deflected by their economic vandalism in the Senate as we deal with them, because this country is dealing with the most complex set of global economic factors in over 25 years -  - The largest developed economies are struggling to grow. The UK, Japan, Germany, France and Italy all recorded zero or negative growth in the three months to June. And this problem combined with the impact of 10 interest rate rises in a row, left to the country by those opposite, is slowing our economy. But there are grounds for optimism in all of this because we have a substantial budget surplus and, of course, as we have seen today from the latest figures from the bureau, commodity prices are also at a record high, and that is a good thing. And, as we saw from the capex figures the other day, business is continuing to invest. As the Prime Minister said earlier, we also have $40 billion put away in our investment funds to invest in the productive capacity of the future, to lift the productive capacity of the economy, and to deal with the inflationary challenges that this country faces. So what we will do is to control those things that are under the control of domestic governments. What that means is a disciplined fiscal policy. It also means investing in the productive capacity of the economy. Of course, that is more difficult when those opposite want to use the Senate to punch a hole in the budget surplus. But, as the Prime Minister said earlier, we on this side of the House are absolutely determined to invest in nation-building projects, to lift the productive capacity of the economy and our international competitiveness, because what we are battling here is 12 years of neglect from those opposite. But we have put up our hand to accept responsibility for fixing it, and we are putting in place a long-term strategy for the future. We will not make the same mistake that those opposite made. They celebrated prosperity but did nothing to achieve it into the future.</DOC>

 - If you look at the data contained in the budget papers, we projected that there would be a softening in employment in 2008-09, and therefore an increase in unemployment from 4.75 per cent. Furthermore, parallel to that, we also projected in the budget papers that there would be softening economic growth. As a consequence of that, we are dealing with softer and more challenging economic times. We have been upfront about that. We have not sought to be evasive about it; that is just the truth. Therefore, that has an effect on all working families. Because of the cost pressures I have run through before at the dispatch box, it also has an effect on, in particular, pensioners and carers, who are trying to make ends meet.What I also say to those opposite on the question of the employment conditions of working Australians is that the biggest impact over time on the take-home pay of working families is the industrial relations system under which people work. Therefore, noting that we have got softening global economic circumstances, and noting also that we have upwards revisions of unemployment - these are facts - I would ask those opposite: would workers who are, for example, in some of the businesses referred to by those opposite last week, where there have been closures and where people have lost their jobs, prefer an industrial relations system where redundancy payments were guaranteed or one where redundancy payments were signed away? I say that there is a fundamental difference between those opposite and those who stand as members of the government - the fundamental difference about which we fought the last election - which is that we believe, whatever circumstances a business finds itself in, people should have a right to proper redundancy payments.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. Today Infrastructure Australia is releasing two discussion papers, the first on public-private partnerships and the second calling for submissions from the public and the business community on nationally significant infrastructure. Submissions will close on 15 October and it is indeed important that the community have input into this debate because infrastructure is vital to people's everyday lives.Often it is not noticed until it does not work - until families are stuck in traffic jams or until people cannot get access to high-speed broadband. That is why infrastructure needs to be a national priority for nation building. That is why we built a surplus with a purpose. It is a surplus with a purpose in the short term: to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. It is a surplus with a purpose in the long term: to put aside $41 billion into nation-building funds. But you cannot actually put this money aside for long-term nation building if the surplus is diminished and if the surplus has a $6.2 billion hole drilled in it by those opposite.We must remember this: every single time that those representing the opposition in the Senate say no to a budget bill, they are saying no to proposals to unclog our ports. They are saying no to proposals to deal with urban congestion. They are saying no to proposals for better public transport. When you look at a budget, you actually have to look at priorities. For this government, our priority has been dealing with the pressures which we have been dealt - the 16-year high in inflation and the international circumstances of the credit squeeze and rising petrol prices - not only by producing a surplus but also by putting aside these funds for long-term nation building. But those opposite will in coming days have to make a decision about their priorities. For example, is it more important to maintain an industry start-up concession for condensate that came in 24 years ago or is it more important to deal with nation building, to deal with infrastructure and to deal with the capacity constraints that were identified by the Reserve Bank in 20 separate warnings? The people of Australia are interested in infrastructure and they will judge those opposite -  - by how they react in the Senate  -  - over coming days, weeks and months.</DOC>

 - It is pretty interesting when it comes to the use of economic data by those opposite. I am reflecting on the question which was asked just before about wage growth. I am just talking to Business indicators, Australia -  -  - whether you are interested in this or not. Wages and salaries grew by 2.3 per cent in the June quarter. I thought they said something that was the reverse. Let us reflect carefully on the data which has put forth by those opposite. - So, consistent with reflections made by various members of the frontbench on questions posed by those opposite, we will always examine in due course the statistical underpinnings of the propositions being put at their dispatch box. I draw attention to one such inconsistency. On the question which has just been put, if you face what we have had in recent times - a global economic meltdown which has impacted on global stock exchanges and which, in turn, has impacted on the investments of shareholders - that obviously impacts on calculations of wealth. -  - That follows as night follows day. If you look across the global economy, you see stock markets across the world with very large corrections heading south, whether it is in the United States, the United Kingdom or continental Europe. The flow-through impact that has on individuals' overall wealth calculations is therefore automatic.The key question is: what is a credible strategy for the future? The credible strategy which this government advances is: (1) responsible economic management; (2) investing in long-term productivity growth; (3) ensuring that you have a plan for nation building, because that is essential to deal with long-term constraints on growth; and (4) that you assist also with the cost of living pressures being faced by working families -  - Therefore, the critical thing is that you have an economic strategy for the future, given the constraints which we inherited from the international economy, the challenges which we inherited from the domestic economy and the roll-through impact - the member for Forrest laughed to herself at the impact - of 10 interest rate rises in a row or Costello's $400 a month interest rate hike for working families across Australia. If you want to know what impacts on overall wealth and overall prosperity for Australian families, think very carefully about the cumulative impact of the interest rate regime prosecuted by those opposite: 10 interest rate rises in a row - a $400 interest rate hike per month imposed on working families.I would suggest that those opposite get with the government's economic agenda being proposed in the Senate and act responsibly with us in building long-term national infrastructure; hence our proposal that we put forward in the parliament today. Get with us on the challenge to boost long-term productivity growth and get out of the way in the Senate of a responsible budget surplus which provides this nation with a buffer for dealing with critical economic challenges which lie ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Yesterday, Wizard Home Loans announced that it would be cutting its standard variable home loan rate by 25 basis points and, of course, this will be welcome relief for those Australians who have a mortgage with Wizard. Wizard has thrown down the gauntlet to all of its competitors. I guess we expect, as all Australians expect, all banks to pass on, within a reasonable amount of time, in full, any official RBA interest rate cut. The government expects it, the people of Australia expect it and, in particular, those people who have been receiving interest rate rise after interest rate rise expect it.Something like 740,000 Australians have taken out their first home loan in the past 7Â½ years and those 740,000 Australians have never experienced an official cut in the RBA rate, so they most certainly will be expecting the banks to pass on any relief in full. Assistant Governor Lowe of the Reserve Bank has made it very clear; he has said that banks simply have no excuse at all for not following the official cash rate down.We do understand that families are doing it tough. We understand that 10 interest rate rises under those opposite, 12 interest rate rises in total, have put families under tremendous financial pressure. We also understand that we are not out of the woods here yet. That is why it is so important that banks do the right thing and follow the Reserve Bank decision down, if that is the way it goes when the announcement is made tomorrow. If the official rate does come down, it is important that banks pass it on in full so that families get the relief they deserve.</DOC>

 - Again the government has sought to be transparent with the Australian community - which we have been - through the budget papers by indicating that, when it comes to our CPI projections, those projections would increase over time before coming back into correction in 2009-10. Let me explain to the honourable member why CPI goes up. There are supply-side factors and there are demand-side factors.On the supply side, it is like this: problems with infrastructure bottlenecks and skills shortages produce a supply-side constraint in the economy, which produces an inflationary effect. That is economics 101. But that economics 101 was the subject of 20 separate warnings to those opposite through the Reserve Bank, each of which they comprehensively ignored. The impact over time of ignoring each of those warnings, year in, year out, is that spread over many years those inflationary pressures build, and that is precisely what has occurred. It is not just on infrastructure, but it is also on skills. I read through these warnings from the Reserve Bank again this morning; they make for quite stark reading. Time after time, year after year, the Reserve Bank was warning those opposite about the need to act on the skills shortages in the economy and to act also on other capacity constraints.If the honourable member wants to understand, therefore, why the government is so wedded to its strategy of a nation-building plan and an education revolution, it is because it goes to the heart of the inflation question which the honourable member has just posed. That is, if you are going to effectively deal with infrastructure bottlenecks, you do not just wave a hand and say 'not my problem'; you do not just wave a hand over there and say 'it's a matter for the states' - or for the pixies at the bottom of the garden. No, it is something that you have to invest in and have a plan for doing.That is why the government stands behind its $76 billion national infrastructure plan, which I spoke about in answer to an earlier question. We do not believe that you can just be silent and idle on these questions; you need a plan of action and you need the funds to back it, which is what we have outlined in the most recent budget.Similarly, on the skills agenda, we have created Skills Australia in addition to Infrastructure Australia. We have created an $11 billion Education Investment Fund. We have radically increased the number of training places in the economy, in our eight to nine short months in office. The reason for doing so is that we have sought to act on these skills shortages, which form the other part of the inflation equation which the honourable member has spoken of. All of that is on the supply side.Then there is the demand side. As the honourable member for Melbourne, the Minister for Finance, has pointed out time after time at the dispatch box, the real rate at which public demand was increasing under the previous government was four to five per cent a year. This is a huge impact. In fact, if you look at where those numbers would go over time had we sustained expenditure increases of the order of magnitude which the government was running in 2007-08, it would have cost taxpayers an extra $23 billion. There was 5.2 per cent growth in outlays in the 2007-08 period, and we have brought that down to one per cent.Why is all this important? Had we been following the same reckless course of action of those opposite, we would have created a set of circumstances which would have made it much more difficult for the Reserve Bank to bring about a revision to the upwards movements in interest rates that we have seen in recent years. So my answer to the honourable member's question is: here are two sets of supply-side factors which have helped to fuel inflation over a long period of time. One is infrastructure and one is skills shortages. We, the government, are acting on those. In our nine months in office, we have sought through concrete plans to begin to turn back 12 years of inaction on the part of those opposite.On the demand side of the economy, we have also sought to act not simply to fuel the fires, which those opposite did through their five per cent real increase in outlays last year, but to provide policy space for the Reserve Bank to act and also, therefore, to bring about downwards pressure on interest rates. That has driven the government's overall economic agenda. That is how we have sought to tackle the inflation challenge. It is a challenge which will take some time to implement and to properly effect over time. But I say to the honourable member: it is far better to have a coherent strategy for dealing with a problem than to have 12 years of sweeping aside 20 successive warnings of the Reserve Bank that there was a problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and note her deep interest in all matters related to education, and particularly school education in her electorate. The more than decade of neglect of our education system by the Howard government is over, and not a moment too soon. I regret that I have to advise the House of some very disturbing statistics emerging from the National Report on Schooling in Australia 2007. These statistics show what happens when you have a national government that engages in more than a decade of neglect of education, as the Howard government did. For six of those long years the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had the education portfolio. This report shows that numeracy achievement across the years of primary school actually goes down - that is, the number of students who fail to meet adequate benchmarks increases the further that they go on in primary school. - So, the number of students obtaining numeracy benchmarks -  - I am pointing to the need to lift numeracy standards because we are seeing results like that. Then, having seen results like that, we are also advised of some of the things that would make a difference to numeracy attainment. The National Numeracy Review commissioned by the Council of Australian Governments and released in July this year concluded that the systematic teaching of numeracy in the early years of schooling, in maths lessons and in the wider curriculum, is essential to numeracy development. It went on to recommend that all jurisdictions should work towards a minimum of five hours per week of mathematics for students in all primary schools.That important piece of information is joined by new research from the United Kingdom in the form of the 2008 Independent Review of Mathematics Teaching in the Early Years Settings and Primary Schools. The United Kingdom report recommended that every primary school should have a specialist mathematics teacher. So there we have the problem defined: numeracy standards and the number of students obtaining benchmarks going down over their years in primary school. We have work which suggests that more focus on numeracy development and specialist teaching can make a difference in primary school.I am pleased to advise the House, and I am sure this will please the member for O'Connor, that the Rudd Labor government is responding to the lack of maths teachers in our schools. We made an election commitment, which we delivered in the recent budget, to halve HECS for people who got maths or science qualifications and then went teaching. On the weekend it was my pleasure to announce that we have expanded that program so that it also covers primary school teaching. If maths graduates from our universities in particular choose to go teaching, they will experience a 50 per cent HECS reduction. That can be worth $1,500 each year to them. This is part of dealing with the numeracy challenges that face this country when we are returning statistics like that.Of course, no one thing fixes this challenge entirely. It takes quality teaching. It takes quality schools. It takes a new focus on disadvantage. It takes a new focus on transparency. It takes a new investment in making sure that we have teachers in our schools who have the kinds of skills that we need to ensure that we see numeracy formation. The Rudd Labor government are engaged in a series of practical steps to make a difference for Australian students because we want to see a quality education for every Australian child. We want to see every Australian child able to read, able to write, able to count and able to do numbers. Unfortunately, the legacy of the former government's neglect is that we do not see these standards in Australian schools. We are getting on with the job of fixing it and getting the basics right.</DOC>

 - Again, if you go to the budget forecasts, we indicated quite clearly that there would be a moderation of economic growth down to 2.75 per cent in the 2008-09 period, recovering to three per cent in the 2009-10 period. That is a fact. We acknowledge it and we said so at budget time. That is quite clear. The real debate here is what has caused it and what do you now do about it? Two sets of factors have caused it: one over which we have very little control - the state of the global economy. I went through those factors at some length in my earlier answers today in question time. The other set of factors is the cumulative effect of 10 interest rate rises in a row. Those opposite throw their hands in the air as if 10 interest rate rises in a row did not happen or they had nothing whatsoever to do with it. The member for Higgins is smirking up there, second from the back. He says, 'Nothing to do with me.' He would only claim responsibility for a good thing that happened and never claim responsibility for anything bad thing that may have happened. I say to the member for Higgins and those who have inherited his economic legacy on this question of interest rates: if you have bequeathed the people of Australia, working families, a $400 a month interest rate hike, that is not just a bit of loose change. That really affects your ability to balance the family budget. Costello's $400 a month interest rate hike, the Liberals' $400 a month interest rate hike, has a real effect not just on the cost of living but on the real economy over time. It actually slows the economy down. That is what has been happening. Interest rates went up year after year in the period that they were in office but without any clear strategy for creating the circumstances to enable the Reserve Bank to start heading in the other direction.That is why I say to the member for Higgins, following his very enjoyable evening last Friday, and the member for Wentworth, with whom he has such a convivial relationship, and the Leader of the Opposition, with whom they both have such a convivial relationship that the key thing is: do you have a strategy to deal with this challenge in the long term? In January this year we said, 'Here is our five-point plan of attack on inflation. Here is our attitude to public demand in the economy. Here is our plan of attack on skills. Here is our plan of attack on the question of infrastructure.' Each step of the way those opposite have ridiculed each element of this strategy.Those opposite gave us 10 interest rate rises in a row and now say they had nothing to do with it. We, the government, having been in for eight to nine months, have said, 'Here is a strategy for dealing with these challenges for the long term.' Again I say to the Leader of the Opposition and those who would support him, and even those on the benches opposite who do not support him: get with the government's program in the Senate and allow the passage of the government's financial bills so that not only will the budget surplus remain intact but we will have the capacity to make the investments in this government's $76 billion national infrastructure plan, which is so much a part and parcel of dealing with the inflation challenge and dealing with Australia's long-term productivity growth.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Shortland for her question. I can advise that the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the June quarter current account figures today and they show a current account deficit of $12.8 billion for the June quarter, compared to a deficit in the March quarter of $19.8 billion. This has come about despite the slowing global economic growth. In these figures we have seen a 20 per cent increase in our export earnings; some $9 billion growth in that offset by only a three per cent increase in what we have paid for our imports. These figures still at 4Â½ per cent of GDP indicate a very sizeable current account deficit, but it is the lowest current account deficit since the September quarter of 2002. Encouragingly, our external accounts are starting to move in the right direction. This is also the first quarterly trade surplus since the March quarter of 2002.Whilst these signs are encouraging, we still have a long way to go; but I am confident that we are going in the right direction. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister have reminded the House that this is a government that inherited very high inflation. We also inherited an appalling trade performance from the previous government. This was a government that squandered the opportunity to sustain our export performance into the future. It was content to simply ride on the back of the resources boom. It was a government that recorded 72 consecutive monthly trade deficits. No previous government in Australia's history presided over such a woeful trade performance. This had the cumulative effect of contributing to a record current account deficit of almost $67 billion for 2007, along with record foreign debt of close to $600 billion.This is the legacy that we inherited and that we are seeking to turn around. We started that task in the May budget with the commitments, which have been referred to constantly since then, to investment in Infrastructure Australia and investment in skills formation in this country. We also saw that budget increase the commitment to the Export Market Development Grants Scheme. This week I will be receiving the Mortimer review, which will advise us on ensuring that our trade policy into the future becomes much more integrated as part of the broader economic policy. We have already commenced our commitment to the twin pillars approach of trade policy - trade liberalisation at the border and market reforms behind the border.I said last week in this House that I remain confident of the breakthrough in the Doha Round. Last week Australia negotiated and concluded with New Zealand the most comprehensive free trade agreement ever entered into by the ASEAN countries. This is Australia's largest free trade agreement ever negotiated and, given the collective contribution of the ASEAN economies, they are Australia's largest trading partner. This is good news. It is good news for underpinning these figures that point us in the right direction. We will leave no stone unturned in turning around the woeful trade performance of the previous government.</DOC>

 - Consistent with the production of economic data and forecasts in the budget, you will see that again the forecast for unemployment is to rise to 4.75 per cent in 2008-09. Consistent with what I have said both about growth and about the CPI, and similarly with the unemployment data, the government has been transparent through the budget papers in the budget which the Treasurer brought down in May.I think what we see evident on the part of those opposite is a bit of a theme. We have had about six or seven questions now in question time - and what is the theme? The theme is talking the Australian economy down. What we have had from those opposite is a series of questions aimed at creating a negative sentiment and aimed at talking the economy down, and doing so pretty selectively against the available economic data.I said last Thursday, I think, in response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition in question time, 'Why is it that those opposite in framing their questions do not bother to draw attention to, for example, the capital expenditure data which came out of the ABS last week?' That capex data projected capital expenditure investment by Australian corporations of some $100 billion for the year ahead. That seems to be missing from the narrative of those opposite. What is also missing from the opposition's narrative is the matters just referred to by the Minister for Trade.The Minister for Trade just went through what we have just had by way of the latest balance of payments and balance of trade statistics. A $559 million trade surplus in the June quarter 2008 was the first quarterly trade surplus in over six years. - Surprisingly missing from the economic narrative of those opposite, which is about talking the Australian economy down, is any reference to capital expenditure data from last week, any reference to today's balance of trade data or any reference to the fact that, in their period of office - if I recall the number correctly from the Minister for Trade - there were 72 consecutive monthly trade deficits. - No other government in the history of the Commonwealth has knocked up 72 in a row. We all know the history of the trade balance and the trade cycle and we always know that for Australia this is a challenging set of circumstances -  - For those opposite, I responded specifically to the question of unemployment data at the beginning of my answer. Coming in right on cue is the member for Menzies, the author of Work Choices, the workers' friend, he who presided over a set of industrial arrangements in this country which, based on their own survey data, meant that 89 per cent of AWAs surveyed by them resulted in one award condition less. Thirty-one per cent of those AWAs took away rest breaks, 49 per cent took away overtime loadings, 63 per cent took away incentive based payments and bonuses, 65 per cent removed penalty rates and 70 per cent took away shiftwork loadings. Despite the level of bleating from the member for Menzies, that is his contribution to working families. - It is quite clear that those opposite are not just ideologically committed to Work Choices but that, given half a chance, they would bring it back. Work Choices is etched deep into the heart and soul of those opposite, and they stand at the dispatch box and bleat about the concerns they now profess to have about the circumstances faced by working families. I say to those opposite - particularly to the ever-interjecting member for Curtin - that, when a person is facing the prospect of losing their job, one thing they would like is to have some certainty about redundancy payments. Redundancy payments are one of those things stripped away by the now very bored, very yawning member for Menzies, who regards this as trivial.The problem with those opposite is that their economic narrative not only is designed to talk the economy down; it also fails to deal equally and in a balanced fashion with the positive economic news that is out there. That concerns capital expenditure data, the data which was produced today on corporate profits and the data on the trade account, which the Minister for Trade referred to. What I would say for the period ahead is that this will be a period of great economic test and challenge, not only for our country but for other countries going forward. There are going to be bumps along the road. When you have the set of global economic circumstances that we face at present, that is unavoidable. The challenge is this: do you have a strategy of action for the future on this - and we have a clear-cut course of action - or do you have, as we do from those opposite, a simple strategy with one objective, which is to talk the economy down? In six questions from the opposition today there has not been a single reference to a policy, not a single reference to an alternative solution, not a single positive suggestion about anything. They have a simple strategy designed to talk the economy down and they hope that they get from themselves a cheap headline on the way through.</DOC>

 - This government's first priority in aviation is safety. Australia has a safety system that is second to none, with internationally respected agencies in the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Airservices Australia and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau. These three agencies have independent oversight of aviation safety in Australia.On 3 August, the CEO of CASA, Bruce Byron, ordered a systematic safety review of Qantas. CASA's review followed an incident on 25 July when a Qantas Boeing 747 flying from Hong Kong to Melbourne was forced to divert for a safe landing in Manila as a result of an explosion that tore a hole in the fuselage. This incident was followed by a number of incidents relating to maintenance of Qantas planes. To Qantas's credit, and consistent with its absolute commitment to safety, Qantas was open with CASA and fully cooperated with it during this review.This afternoon CASA announced the result of its review of Qantas's engineering and maintenance controls. CASA's review did not find any direct link between recent incidents, including that on 25 July, nor did CASA find any increase in the monthly rate of incidents. CASA found that recent incidents were unrelated and that there was no apparent common cause. CASA has recommended that Qantas review its management structure to better align responsibility and accountability for safety. CASA has recommended that Qantas take action on a range of safety and maintenance issues.I am advised that CASA will now move to carry out two additional intensive audits of Qantas. The first audit will focus on Qantas's 737, 747 and 767 fleet and involve a physical check of the planes as well as a check of maintenance documentation. The second audit will focus on Qantas's maintenance systems and internal procedures relating to airworthiness directives. This ongoing action sends a signal to the aviation industry and to the travelling public that CASA and Qantas are very serious about maintaining Australia's high safety standards. Australia can indeed be proud that we have a rigorous, world's best practice safety regime and that Qantas is rightly regarded as an airline with a reputation for safety that is second to none. My No. 1 priority as the minister for transport will always be safety. The government will never be complacent about safety.</DOC>

 - Working families, pensioners and carers are under real financial pressure, and therefore it is important to have a consistent and comprehensive strategy for dealing with the pressures that they are under. One of the pressures faced by working families is the cumulative impact of 10 interest rate rises in a row. If you do the numbers on an average mortgage of something like $246,000 in total and the impact of 10 interest rate rises in a row, you will see that the flow-through effect is that the Liberals, as a consequence of their high interest rate policy, have given those working families $400 per month in interest rate hikes. That is a simple fact. When those opposite ask why we have real pressures on the cost of living for working families, that is a big fact: $400 per month.The other impact on many working families is how to deal with pressures like the increase in childcare costs that they face. That is why the government, consistent with its pre-election commitment, increased the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. -  - Those opposite said it is ridiculous. - The member for North Sydney just interjected and said it is ridiculous that we have increased the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. They are the people who are out of touch with the basic needs of working families, including the need for us to make sure the childcare tax rebate keeps pace with the extraordinary costs which those families are bearing, with higher interest payments off the back of the rises I described before, higher childcare costs and other costs which families face. The government, in response to these challenges, has sought to do at least three or four sets of things, one of which is to deal with the extraordinary pressure on inflation and interest rates which has existed in the economy over a long period.The absolutely killing effects which those 10 interest rate rises have had on working families seeking to balance their family budgets have been huge. That is why we have taken this agenda as the absolute core priority of the government - so that we could create a set of policy circumstances to make room for the Reserve Bank to start moving in the other direction. That is point 1. Point 2 -  -  - Members opposite laugh again at the impact of 10 interest rate rises in a row. I would say that $400 a month - Costello's $400 a month interest rate hike for working families - is no laughing matter, other than for the Liberal Party. Through the budget we have also sought to honour our pre-election commitments on tax. The taxation reductions that we brought about through the budget, totalling some $44 billion, are designed to assist families under pressure. Added to that are the additional family support payments - I refer to the childcare tax rebate - and also the education tax refund, which parents are requested to begin collecting receipts for this year so that claim-back can occur from 1 July next year. These are significant initiatives, together with the $7.5 billion that we have allocated for additional payments for pensioners and carers.The Leader of the Opposition asked a question about the setting of interest rates. The Reserve Bank independently does that, consistent with the economic policy settings of the government of the day through fiscal policy. That is why we have acted responsibly in that direction. I again return the Leader of the Opposition to his extraordinary statement on the doors today. How could he go out on the doors and - presumably trying to make a big headline for himself tomorrow - call for a 50 basis point adjustment and then, in answer to the first question, 'If you were Prime Minister, would you make that call on the government?' say no? - Therefore, in terms of the response to the real cost of living challenges which are being faced by working families, pensioners and carers, the government's strategy is clear. What is not clear is the strategy of those opposite. They had one foray into policy this week, and that was to go out on the doors, through the Leader of the Opposition, the alternative Prime Minister of Australia, and say that the Reserve Bank should bring about a 50 basis point cut tomorrow. And then in the next breath, when asked whether that would be his position as Prime Minister of Australia if he were so elected, he of course said it would not be. What does that say? It says that the alternative government - as they describe themselves - have a view that the policies they put forward in opposition are far too reckless to be implemented in government. That is what they are saying. I would suggest to those opposite that if there is an alternative explanation for what the Leader of the Opposition meant on the doors this morning, everyone sitting here in this chamber is all ears. Frankly, if you go out and say, as the alternative Prime Minister, 'I am calling for a 50 basis point cut,' and then 'I am not calling for a 50 basis point cut,' the world would like to know the reason.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fowler for her question. There has been a safeguards agreement in place with Russia since 1990 for the limited use of Australian uranium, and that agreement continues in force. Last year, under the previous government, Australia entered into negotiations to complete a new bilateral civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the Russian Federation. That new agreement was signed in September 2007, during the APEC summit in Sydney, by the previous government. It was tabled in the parliament by this government in May of this year. The agreement is currently before the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Indeed, the committee had one of its four public hearings on the agreement in Canberra this morning.The government believes that the agreement meets Australia's longstanding safeguards requirements and promotes the highest international standards in this area, including involvement and oversight by the international regulator, the International Atomic Energy Agency. The government will, of course, be interested in the views of the committee and will consider the committee's report and take that into account. But, once the committee has reported on the agreement, the government will then move to consider ratification of the agreement and the government will make a decision on ratification at the appropriate time.I make clear to the House, as I have publicly stated today, and as government officials have stated privately to the Russian Ambassador to Australia, that when considering ratification the government will take into account not just the merits of the agreement but recent and ongoing events in Georgia and the state of Australia's bilateral relationship with the Russian Federation.Members will recall that last week I detailed to the House the government's view so far as events in Georgia are concerned. I relayed those views to the Russian ambassador subsequent to that advice to the House. Without repeating them, all of those points remain current. And, as I have indicated today, at my instruction officials of the government have relayed to the Russian ambassador that, when the government come to consider ratification of the civil nuclear cooperation agreement with the Russian Federation, we will take into account not just the merits of the agreement but events which have occurred in Georgia, ongoing events in Georgia, and the state of Australia's bilateral relationship with the Russian Federation.</DOC>

 - On the question of fertiliser prices, this is something that the government has been presented with by farming groups right across Australia. Fertiliser prices have gone through the roof, and it is a huge impost in terms of your ability to earn a quid out of the family farm. It is a challenge which both the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and I have been presented with in meeting after meeting. I would also say to the honourable member for Maranoa that these representations did not begin in December last year. If he were honest about it, he would know that the problem with the cost of fertiliser has been around for a long, long, long time. My understanding is - and I would look for guidance here from the minister for agriculture - that there is a committee involving Senator Heffernan and others who are looking at this matter and they will be very mindful of recommendations which come forward in terms of future action.Recently at the Pacific Islands Forum I actually raised these matters with the President of Nauru - Nauru, as you know, being a continued source of significant superphosphate in terms of international and regional fertiliser supplies - and what could be done on the supply side out of that small country vis-a-vis some of the problems that exist in global fertiliser markets. I will not for a minute pretend that the prospects coming out of that meeting had any immediate solution to the problem but I have to say that this is a dialogue that we intend to now pursue with - An opposition member - That's the important thing for you, isn't it - you are talking about it? - I would say to the honourable gentleman interjecting that the problem of fertiliser prices did not begin on 24 November last year. For those opposite who are seeking to say that for 12 years they were out there at the forefront of rearrangements of the global fertiliser market to ensure a better deal for Australian farmers, I do not think that he is being fair dinkum about it. I do not think the honourable member for Maranoa - who I have got a bit of a soft spot for - believes in his heart of hearts that it is a fair dinkum question. He knows as well as I do that the fertiliser price has been a problem for a long, long time.This government will do what it can within its powers to assist farmers who are dealing with this challenge. It is a real problem in terms of on-farm costs. It is something that the minister has been engaged in dialogue with the NFF and others on. Let me assure the House that any practical measures that can be undertaken by government to draw these pressures off working farmers who are dealing not only with the ravages of -  -  - It is true. Are those opposite assuming that farmers do not work? We assume they do work - and they work very hard. They are among the best and most effective farmers in the world, and when it comes to standing up for their interests and their rights, including making the economic policy settings of Australia more conducive to interest rates heading down than going up, we will stand up for the farmers of Australia any day.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bass for the question. I will refer to some of the work with respect to sustainability and the building of export markets, but I think I should first mention that I did have the chance during the break to catch up with the member for Maranoa in his own electorate. We gathered together because Lee Kernaghan was visiting. The member for Maranoa would remember very, very well what Lee Kernaghan had to say about the work of the government in the electorate of Maranoa. He will remember very well what the Australian of the Year had to say on those issues and the support that he gave for the review of drought policy that this government is undertaking.Make no mistake: the current position on drought policy that is being adopted by this government is identical to the drought policy that was adopted by the previous government. Not only that but the assessments are being done by a panel, the members of which are all appointees of the previous government who have had their terms extended. In the face of that, there is no doubt that, even though it has always had bipartisan support, it is true that we have not been able to get drought policy in a good enough state for the needs of rural Australia. There is no doubt about that. The Leader of the Nationals has said that in this very place. That is why the policy is being reviewed, that is why I made the comments that I made in the seat of Maranoa - the third time I have managed to visit that seat since I got this job - and that is why the government supports Lee Kernaghan's concerns that drought policy needs to be reviewed.It is also true that during the break I had a chance to look at some of the sustainability issues with respect to our fisheries and forestry, including in Tasmania. I met with some of the key fishing operators out of the electorate of Bass and, in South Australia, from Arno Bay and Elliston, with some of the key aquaculture operators there, trying to find a path through to be able to continue to increase production without causing sustainability to have a hit. Also, with respect to forestry, in addition to Tasmania, where we were able to deal with the production side of the responsible end of that, I visited both Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, where we do have real concerns about working with those governments in combating illegal logging.Over the break I was also able to deal with some of the export issues regarding the export of wheat, horticulture and, in particular, the live trade. I would like to take this opportunity, given that I have been to Riverwood Station, Kilto Station and Lamboo Station - an Indigenous-run cattle station in the north of Western Australia - and then had a look at some of the feedlots in Indonesia where that trade goes, to reaffirm the support of this government for the live trade and to reaffirm in this place, for the first time that I have had the opportunity to do so, that the live trade does occupy an important role in this nation. We expect world's best practice. The sector has been delivering that, and it continues to have the support of the government.</DOC>

 - I am unaware of the document to which the honourable gentleman refers. That is my honest answer. I think all members of this House would be united in their concern for the problems of the lower lakes. That is why I went there with Senator Wong, the Minister for Climate Change and Water, to have extensive discussions with those in the lower lakes about the particular challenges which they face. The government's response to that has been on multiple levels. The first is this: for the first time in the Commonwealth's history the buyback of water entitlements will commence. Those opposite talked about it all the time but did not spend a brass razoo on it. We have actually gone ahead with it and so far we have expended $50 million to purchase back entitlements, from memory, of some 37 gigalitres from the system. This is a small start but a necessary start. Subsequent to that, at the cabinet meeting in Adelaide, the government agreed to the release of further significant funds for the purchase of entitlements across the Murray-Darling system. That is one part of the challenge.The other part of the challenge is what you do to improve the overall efficiency of the irrigation systems which currently draw water out of the Murray-Darling system. Apart from the fact that the water has been overallocated to hell over the last 100 years, these irrigation systems are often antiques in their own right. One of the figures we have been presented with suggests that there is something like a 30 per cent leakage from these irrigation systems as they pump water from the river system onto farm properties. That is obviously a practical area where we can work. That is why, again, in the first few meetings of the Council of Australian Governments, the government have allocated literally billions of dollars in programs to the states for the improvement of irrigation systems applying to farm properties across the system.The third thing we have done is this: through the Council of Australian Governments, we have created a single Murray-Darling Basin authority. This has been talked about, again, for many months and for many years by those opposite but was never brought to fruition. At the first meetings of the Council of Australian Governments, we were able to bring about agreement on the establishment of this authority. Why is that important? For the first time in the history of the Murray-Darling Basin, we have therefore a single authority empowered to create a basin-wide plan for the proper use of the resource. In the past, that was Balkanised across the various states and territories of Australia and could no longer be sustained. These are practical steps forward. - Those opposite again interject in the most partisan of fashions. -  - I rest my case. I would have thought that the Murray-Darling should exist as a challenge beyond partisan politics. I would have thought the entire nation wanted to see politicians cease squabbling about the Murray-Darling -  - and get on with a practical plan of action to do something about the Murray-Darling, to make sure that we can actually look the next generation of Australians squarely in the eye and say, 'We did all that was physically possible to save this most threatened, challenged and pressured of river systems.' - I would suggest the Leader of the Opposition reflect very carefully on when the crisis in the Murray and the flow-through of waters actually began. Is he again suggesting - consistent with the question from the member for Maranoa last time round, who now returns to the chamber - that this problem mysteriously erupted on 24 November last year? I would say to the honourable members opposite, including the Leader of the National Party, how much did the Leader of the National Party authorise in payments to buy back water entitlements from the system? A big, fat zero. We saw 12 years of systematic inaction on a river system under gross challenge, delivered off the back of climate change and record low inflows, year after year after year. Those opposite, led by the 'Captain of the Cow Cockies', have the audacity to come into this parliament and say, 'Why haven't you fixed this problem in nine months?' I think the people of Australia would ask those opposite to get real with this. We have a plan of action when it comes to the Murray-Darling. We have achieved more in our first nine months in office than those opposite achieved in 12 years. We will prosecute this program of action. It is a practical course of action and our first point of reference is what can be practically done to save the lower lakes.</DOC>

 - We all know that vigorous competition means a better deal for consumers. People battling for our dollar as consumers means that all consumers will be better off. In relation to groceries, this was confirmed in the recent ACCC report, which found:Australian consumers would significantly benefit if Coles and Woolworths faced more competitive threats that encouraged more aggressive pricing strategies.At the last election, the Labor Party promised to clarify and enhance the powers of the ACCC to deal with incremental or creeping acquisitions - something the previous government declined to do. Today, I can update the House on the implementation of that important election commitment. Incremental acquisitions are purchases by a large firm of small outlets which might not lead to competition concerns in and of themselves but over time when taken together do lead to competition concerns. The Trade Practices Act, as it is currently devised, does not give the ACCC the proper legal framework to intervene in these instances. Today, I have released a discussion paper which outlines two options for legislation - action which those opposite failed to take over 12 years - which are the aggregation model or the model for a new power under the Trade Practices Act. This is an election commitment and this government will implement the legislation. Those opposite failed to do anything on this over 12 years.The new law will apply across the economy, not just in relation to groceries and supermarkets but across the economy, wherever the ACCC believes that creeping acquisitions are a problem. It may be the childcare industry or the supermarket industry or any other industry where creeping acquisitions are a problem. This reform is not about protecting small business in itself; it is about protecting consumers to ensure vigorous competition so that consumers can benefit from small business and big business competing against each other and so that one player does not swallow up small players in an anticompetitive way. This is part of our suite of competition policy reforms that we have embraced since the election: freeing up the foreign investment laws so that more retailers can compete for the Australian consumer's dollar; using COAG to ensure that the planning system promotes competition and does not inhibit competition; and introducing jail terms for serious cartel conduct, which the ACCC called for 15 times and the member for Higgins ignored every time and reneged on his commitment to implement. These are the biggest reforms to the Trade Practices Act in 25 years to do with predatory pricing, which I envisage will pass the House later today. These are reforms that we are moving on with alacrity because they are long overdue and because Australian consumers will be the winners from them.</DOC>

 - As the honourable member would be aware, in the government's budget forecast we projected that the unemployment rate in Australia would rise to 4.75 per cent in 2008-09. We understand that many businesses across Australia are doing it tough and that is why the government believes it is important to prosecute a strategy of responsible economic management. We intend to do that, because one of the greatest obstacles which businesses face across the country is access to affordable credit. If you look at the challenges which many businesses have had in securing not just lines of credit but also affordable credit, it has been a real challenge out there, as it has been for Australian households. That is why, if you have been operating as a business with lines of credit and you have faced real challenges with 10 interest rate rises in a row on the part of the monetary policy settings of Australia during the period when those opposite were in office, the cumulative effect of that in terms of your interest rate bill is very significant indeed. Therefore, the most responsible course of action that governments can take through fiscal policy is to make sure that you are lining up your fiscal policy direction with your monetary policy direction so that you create an environment whereby the Reserve Bank of Australia has an easier time when it comes to bringing down interest rates. That is what this government has been doing. We stand by the responsible economic management approach which we adopted through the budget - anchored in a $22 billion budget surplus - and its organising principle, in large measure, was to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates.I say to the honourable member, in relation to both businesses in his electorate and businesses operating in all electorates across the country, that one of the core responsibilities we as a government have in pursuing budget policy is to make sure that we provide maximum room for the Reserve Bank of Australia to bring interest rates down. That is what we have sought to do through the budget. This is, however, simply the first step. We have an important series of economic policy decisions which lie ahead, but the overriding discipline is to make sure that the businesses in Australia have the best possible set of arrangements when it comes to their credit facilities with their financial institutions and what they are charged by way of interest rates.The second thing I say to the honourable member is this: when any employee is faced with the challenge of unemployment or redundancy, one of the key questions they ask is, 'What are the industrial relations conditions under which I am employed?' I am not familiar with those circumstances which pertain to the businesses which the honourable member refers to, but can I say to the honourable member that one of the things which were part and parcel of the industrial relations system which he supported in the parliament when he was on this side of the chamber was Work Choices, and one of the features of Work Choices was an ability for employers to strip out redundancy arrangements without a cent of compensation. - On the question of redundancy entitlements, for any employee losing their job, one of the first questions which an employee asks in those circumstances is, 'What protection do I have?' Under Work Choices, those protections were systematically stripped away, which is why this government has said that it has been elected on a platform to abolish Work Choices and to abolish the capacity of firms to make AWAs into the future. That is what we have set out to do. We think that is an important element for all workers across Australia, particularly as they and their businesses negotiate difficult economic times. So my answer to the honourable member is: responsible economic management to ensure that we have maximum downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates, because the affordability of capital affects both households and businesses and, therefore, the ability of businesses to employ and to grow; and, secondly, to make sure we have a fair and flexible industrial relations system for those employees who find themselves in a difficult situation and to make sure that we have a set of industrial relations laws which provides those employees at least with a right to redundancy. And that is what this government stands for.</DOC>

 - If we look at the challenges facing the Australian economy at present, the global economic circumstances are difficult. We have a global financial crisis, we have significant falls on global stock markets and we also have a huge spike in global oil prices and food prices. All of these factors are affecting the state of the global economy, which is why five of the world's top seven industrial economies have already generated negative growth in the last quarter or so. In Australia, our challenges are compounded by the record of the today absent member for Higgins as Treasurer of Australia. He is possibly out to lunch. Alex is not here anymore, so perhaps there is not a luncheon partner available.The record of the member for Higgins in this respect is that, in the period when those opposite were in government, we experienced 10 interest rate rises in a row. This meant that, by the time we won office at the end of last year, Australians were paying interest rates which were the second highest in the developed world. Although those opposite do not want to hear this, the consequence of those interest rate rises resulted in the Liberals providing a $400-a-month interest rate hike for working families. Our response to that is responsible economic management. Our response to that is to ensure that we are prosecuting a national program of economic reform based on an education revolution, on building the nation's infrastructure and on assisting working families, pensioners and carers on the way through with a package of payments. Some $55 billion for working families and $7.5 billion for pensioners and carers have been provided through the budget.The honourable member asked specifically about one element of our economic strategy, and that goes to nation building. I would draw the attention of honourable members opposite to the figures which were released by the ABS last week which show that new capital spending in Australia hit a record $86.4 billion for the last financial year to June 2008. This is the highest final capex figure on record, and it shows an increase of 11.4 per cent from 2006 to 2007. I say to those opposite to also focus on this number, though it may not suit their current economic and political narrative, which is that the ABS has forecast capital expenditure -  -  - This is for those opposite who are interested in talking the economy down - such as the honourable member who is currently interjecting. The ABS has forecast capital expenditure for the current financial year to rise by $99.75 billion. That is nearly $100 billion. This is the highest forecast on record. These are good figures for the Australian economy, particularly given the challenges which the economy is facing globally.The honourable member referred to facts concerning his own electorate, and I respect the accuracy of what he has put forward today. Let me also put on the record some other facts which relate to capital projects underway across Australia. IBM has announced that it will set up a $10.8 million IT services centre at the Ballarat technology park, creating 300 new jobs in that city. In June, glass bottle maker Amcor announced a major expansion of the company's manufacturing facility in Gawler. Amcor will invest $150 million to build a third furnace at that facility to increase capacity by up to 50 per cent. The port and rail infrastructure contract at Oakajee has been awarded an estimated investment of $3 billion. Ausminerals has committed $1 billion to an investment at the Prominent Hill copper gold project in South Australia, which will create 850 construction jobs and about 450 ongoing jobs. -  - The member for North Sydney says that these are all thought bubbles. I would ask the member for Sydney to go to each of those business leaders -  - Coming from the member for North Sydney, who, at the beginning of this year, deliberately embarked upon a strategy to talk the Australian economy down, I find that a remarkable intervention on behalf of those opposite. He should reflect carefully on the statements he made earlier this year before he makes an intervention like that. Of course, for those opposite, it makes for uncomfortable tidings when their political and economic narrative, to the extent that they have one, goes to one organising principle: how do you talk the Australian economy down?We are saying that, if you look at the private sectors' capital investment record for the year just concluded, the forecast for the year ahead is for some $100 billion worth of capital investment by private firms in Australia, including the four or five examples which I have just read out. This causes you to conclude that the Australian private sector is getting on with the business of expanding its operations, notwithstanding the challenges which currently exist. The Commonwealth Bank's chief economist, Michael Blythe, said that the capex data demonstrates:Â ... that the changes to business confidence and the slowdown in the first half of the year and concerns about the global credit crunch haven't dented the positive story for Australia.Of course, that does not fit the scenario which those opposite wish to construct. That is what the private sector is doing. We on this side of the House are a party and a government of nation building. We believe that we have a responsibility to partner with the private sector in building the nation. Those opposite - and how many times did we hear this from the member for Higgins when he was Treasurer of Australia - have no place, no role whatsoever, out there building the nation's infrastructure. I remember one famous intervention when there was a debate in this place about whether urban water should be a legitimate product of national investment by the national government. What did the member for Higgins, the then Treasurer, say? He said: 'Not my problem. Blame the states.' It is always 'blame the states'.Our attitude is that the Australian people are fed up with one level of government blaming the other as to why the nation's economic infrastructure is in such a poor state. Instead, they want the government of the nation to embark upon a rational investment strategy for the future. That is why our $76 billion nation-building program for the country will provide funds of $26 billion through AusLink 2 and $20 billion through the Building Australia Fund for transport, energy and water priorities. There will be $5 billion in a national broadband network. Those opposite would, I think, find it difficult to spell 'broadband', let alone construct one. We will invest $15 billion in education infrastructure through the Education Investment Fund and $11 billion through the health and hospitals infrastructure fund, which we have also created. This is a $76 billion plan for nation building. That is part of a strategy for Australia's future. In this way, we are seeking to partner with the Australian private sector in building the nation. In this place, you can either choose to be shirkers like those opposite or you can get on with the business of building the nation. You can either lean on your shovel, as those opposite did for 12 years, or you can get on with the business of rolling up your sleeves and building the nation's infrastructure.Let me tell you that what we see through the capital expenditure data produced by the ABS is a private sector determined to get out there and build the nation's infrastructure. We on this side of the House, the government, are determined to help build the nation's infrastructure. We intend to do this road by road, port by port, cable by cable, university by university and trade skill by trade skill across the country, whereas those opposite simply have a script which says, 'That's not our problem.' We say, for the nation, we intend to partner with the private sector in constructing the nation's infrastructure. We are a government of nation building; those opposite have an excuse for inertia - inertia altogether.</DOC>

 - As I indicated in my answer to the previous question and now indicate also to the member for Wannon, the government were upfront with the Australian people in the budget forecasts when we said that unemployment in the year ahead would rise to 4.75 per cent, because we do not believe in gilding the lily. There are problems out there which are the product of what has occurred in the global economy and there are problems which have occurred here in terms of the legacy that we have inherited from those opposite.But, rather than simply bleating about it - as those opposite did for a long, long time - we have embarked upon a clear-cut economic strategy for the future. That is based on three principles: responsible economic management, a program of nation building and an agenda for an education revolution to deal with the challenges of education, skills and training. Also, we will not allow those who are finding it tough with cost-of-living pressures at present simply to fend for themselves but instead, through the budget, we will deliver a package of some $55 billion worth of support for working families and, on top of that, $7.5 billion for pensioners and carers.I say this to the honourable member: there will be great challenges ahead, including for businesses and firms, right across the country. Australia as an economy is not immune from what is happening across the rest of the world. If you look, for example, at the economies of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and elsewhere, you will find either zero or negative growth in one of the quarters which have just preceded the present one and you will find a downwards revision in economic growth across the global economy. This seems to be the subject of considerable mirth on the part of those opposite. I would say to those affected by these global economic factors that this is, in fact, serious news.The key thing, however - and I draw again the honourable member for Wannon's attention to this - is having responsible economic management which creates the conditions necessary to enable the Reserve Bank greater flexibility to bring down interest rates; that is principle No. 1. Principle No. 2 is an industrial relations system which is fair and flexible so that those employees who find themselves in real difficulty know they have some basic and underlying protections through the industrial relations system of the country.The member for Wannon voted for Work Choices - although he may have been Speaker at the time and perhaps he did not. Perhaps he is the single member of those sitting opposite who is exonerated from that responsibility; his party, however, cannot be. But the Work Choices legislation put in by those opposite was quite clear: 31 per cent of those on AWAs had their rest breaks taken away; 49 per cent had their overtime loadings taken away; and 63 per cent had incentive based payments and bonuses removed. But, as I said before, redundancy payments - which is the matter directly relevant to the debate which is being had - when people lost their jobs could be stripped away as an entitlement without any compensation under laws put in place by those opposite. They shake their heads in disbelief as though this were simply not the case.Frankly, those opposite should hang their heads in shame for creating a set of industrial relations laws for this country which made it so difficult for working people in Australia under Work Choices to get fairness, including under difficult circumstances when the firms for which they worked could no longer continue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question and I note his ongoing interest in infrastructure issues, including during a visit I had to his electorate looking at the area of South-East Queensland that is experiencing such extraordinary growth. Infrastructure is important, particularly in our growth regions; but it is important also because of the current economic context which the government faces. We are suffering from some severe economic challenges ahead, not only in terms of the global credit squeeze but also in terms of global increases in petrol prices. That is why infrastructure investment is critical. That is why the government has joined the nation-building agenda along with the private sector - as the Prime Minister has outlined, the private sector that is investing so much in infrastructure, as the capex that was released last week demonstrated.Twenty-first-century nation building requires responsible economic management and it also requires a plan to deliver world-class infrastructure and to boost productivity. That is why we have put $41 billion into long-term nation-building funds: $20 billion into the Building Australia Fund, $11 billion into education infrastructure and $10 billion into health infrastructure. The $20 billion that has been put aside into the Building Australia Fund will provide for our long-term prosperity in rail, in ports, in roads and in broadband. That is on top of the $26 billion that we have committed to road and rail infrastructure projects, many of which we have brought forward in the budget. We have brought forward projects such as the Townsville port access road in the electorate of Herbert - and I am surprised that there is not some support for that. Certainly, my colleague the member for Dawson, when I visited there recently, was very supportive of the infrastructure agenda there and of potential major infrastructure projects in regional areas, such as at Abbot Point.What we are doing is sitting down and working with the three sectors of government as well as working with the private sector on infrastructure projects, because the budget strategy was about delivering two things: firstly, putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates by producing a $22 billion surplus; but, secondly, making sure that we put aside funds into long-term investment opportunities in order to secure our prosperity for the future. We know that when we invest in infrastructure, unlike one-off payments, it is not money that just goes; it is money that comes back. It comes back in the form of increased revenue in the future. It is an investment for the long term - an investment in our productivity.We know that over the last 40 years productivity growth has accounted for more than 80 per cent of the improvement in Australia's living standards - more than 80 per cent. But what did we see from those opposite? What we saw from those opposite was an attitude towards infrastructure investment that was, 'The market will look after it by itself.' There was no national leadership, no coordination, no work on harmonisation of guidelines, no work on enhancing public-private partnerships and no work on removing the impediments to investment in infrastructure from those opposite.But of course you cannot put aside the surplus into long-term investment funds if you destroy the surplus. That is what we are seeing in the Senate from those opposite. Those opposite are prepared to rip $6.2 billion out of the surplus - $6.2 billion that will not be available for issues such as easing urban congestion in our cities, $6.2 billion that will not be available to deliver high-speed broadband, $6.2 billion that will not be available to improve public transport in our cities. These are all critical issues.What Infrastructure Australia will do is produce an infrastructure priority list for the COAG meeting in March next year. Infrastructure Australia will guide investment to where it is needed most - to help parents get out of traffic jams and home to their kids, to get our exports to market without delay, to drive the digital revolution and bring the Australian economy into the 21st century, to make public transport a viable alternative to the car, to help Australia transition to a low-carbon economy and to give families the best possible education and health care. That is the government's strategy, and it is one being opposed by those opposite, though not with an alternative - just opposition for opposition's sake. There is no plan from those opposite, no alternative from those opposite - just opposition for opposition's sake. They are opposing removing a 24-year-old start-up concession and opposing removing a rort that was introduced by them to draw a distinction between alcohol as to whether it is in straight spirits or it is mixed. They are opposed to removing that rort. One has to ask why that rort was introduced.Our infrastructure record in the past is a proud Labor one. We are proud of our tradition as the nation-building party. That is our past and that is our future. In the budget we laid out how we are preparing the economy for the future, how we are creating the conditions for a decrease in inflation and interest rates and how we are increasing the prospects of our securing prosperity well beyond the mining boom.</DOC>

 - Thank you very much to the member for O'Connor and thank you very much to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. It follows some earlier questions to me in past question times about unemployment. As the Prime Minister has explained during the course of this question time, and as I have explained in earlier question times, the budget papers show that the budget parameter, the forecast, is that unemployment will move slightly to 4Â¾ per cent during the course of this financial year. As the Prime Minister has also made clear -  - I do find it quite remarkable that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition - indeed any member of the opposition - who supported Work Choices in this parliament would feign concern when workers lose their jobs. - You are responsible for Work Choices. - I am answering the question. - I know you don't like your record being exposed, Joe, and your responsibility for Work Choices. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Can I just say to members opposite: it does strike me as remarkable that they would feign concern about workers losing their jobs, when they presided over the introduction -  - If I could finish my sentence: I know that the members opposite do not like to be reminded of their history of industrial relations extremism. The reason they do not like to be reminded of it is that they are still in the arms of industrial relations extremism and, if they ever had an opportunity to sit back over in the government benches in this parliament, we would not just see Work Choices back; we would see something worse back -  -  - because the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has made it abundantly clear that she believes in something -  - Obviously, the members opposite do not like to be reminded of Work Choices and the fact that redundancy entitlements could be ripped off without the payment of a cent of compensation. I see that the member for Menzies, from the back, is still defending Work Choices, whilst the frontbench here actually believes in something worse now. - On the question of current macroeconomic conditions -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am looking forward to the opportunity to answer it. -  - On the question of where we are with the Australian economy and how that pertains to unemployment and inflation, it is clear and has been made clear by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Obviously, the Australian economy is not immune from global economic circumstances. They are feeding in domestically. They are certainly feeding in in terms of a slowdown in the economy. Secondly, of course, the economy is bearing the burden of 10 consecutive interest rate rises under the previous government. - I was asked about unemployment and inflation, and I am answering that question. Of course, the economy is showing the consequences of the 10 interest rate increases in a row that happened under the previous government. What this government is doing is putting downwards pressure on inflation through its budget settings. What we are also doing and what I know offends each and every member opposite is that we are ensuring that people have the benefit of fair and balanced industrial relations. We know that the introduction of the transition act that stopped the making of AWAs hurt members opposite because they supported Work Choices. We will give them an opportunity to show what they stand for at the end of this year, and I predict it will -  - Yes, I have.</DOC>

 - I can inform the parliament that the Reserve Bank of Australia has just announced that it will cut interest rates by 0.25 per cent. This, the first interest rate cut in seven years, will take the official cash rate down to seven per cent and will provide some modest relief to mortgage holders right across Australia. The government knows that there is still much, much more to be done in helping Australian families dealing with cost-of-living pressures.For the average mortgage, today's interest rate cut will put nearly $600 each year back into the family budget. I am advised that for 740,000 first-time buyers this will be the first time they have ever experienced an interest rate cut. The government expect the banks to pass on this rate cut because, given the high levels of profitability for Australia's commercial banks, we believe that they have a responsibility to do so. If you pass on interest rate hikes, you have a responsibility also to pass on interest rate cuts.This interest rate decision is welcome, but it is not a day for celebration. Interest rates took a long time to rise, and they will take a long time to come back down - and the road will be a very uneven one on the way through. That is why the government is committed to continuing a policy of responsible economic management designed to make it as easy as possible for the Reserve Bank in the future to reduce interest rates further.I would add one final point. There will be more tough times ahead as we continue to battle the economic turbulence abroad and high inflation and interest rates at home. That is why the government is absolutely committed and determined to prosecute its program of responsible economic management into the future - a program of long-term economic reform based on an education revolution, based on our reforms to infrastructure and based on our program of business deregulation - because the government is determined to steer the Australian economy through the difficult times which lie ahead.</DOC>

 - I find it remarkable that the Leader of the Opposition seems not to welcome this cut in interest rates. I find that remarkable -  -  - To return to points raised by those opposite earlier today, there is this assumption that you cannot prosecute a strategy dealing with the long-term challenges of inflation at the same time as prosecuting a strategy which deals with the long-term challenges of employment. Those opposite seem to think that you can have one or the other. We believe we can prosecute a strategy for the long term which deals with the inflation challenges for the economy as well as the challenges for employment, education, skills and training. And that is very much at the heart of the government's economic strategy.I am surprised, however, given the Leader of the Opposition's intervention in this debate today on interest rates, that we have a further evolution of the Nelson doctrine from yesterday. The Nelson doctrine yesterday I thought was a pretty remarkable one. It said essentially this: that, on the question of interest rates, Brendan will say one thing in opposition but -  - he will do exactly the opposite in government. That is the articulated Nelson doctrine from yesterday. What he says in opposition he will now guarantee to do exactly the reverse of if in government. That is what he said yesterday. And the exchange yesterday, that memorable exchange on the doors, about his attitude to the Reserve Bank and providing them with instructions to cut official interest rates by 50 basis points, and his then turning round and saying, 'Of course, if I were Prime Minister, I would not say that at all' - that is remarkable. There is one question I would pose to the Leader of the Opposition, and it is this: when does this Nelson doctrine end? If the Nelson doctrine is one which says, 'What I say today on interest rates as Leader of the Opposition does not' -  - In my answer to the question earlier on about inflation and employment, I responded with what the government's strategy was in respect of both those propositions. On the question of the relationship between inflation and interest rates, that is what I am going to. We have spoken already about the government's strategy for creating an environment to bring down inflationary pressures so that the Reserve Bank has more room to bring down interest rates, and I am contrasting that with the position adopted by the Leader of the Opposition. The Nelson doctrine yesterday -  - Well, you may not have asked me to elaborate on the Nelson doctrine. I can understand why you may not have wanted to ask me to elaborate on the Nelson doctrine. But I intend to elaborate on the Nelson doctrine -  - because the Leader of the Opposition -  - says, constantly, that he is the alternative Prime Minister of Australia. And what he has said is that, on interest rates - something so fundamental to households, to businesses, to the economy - the Nelson doctrine articulated yesterday is: 'What I say as Leader of the Opposition, I will not say if I am Prime Minister of Australia.' That is what it says. So my question to the Leader of the Opposition is: where does that leave his credibility -  -  - So, on inflation and on the challenges of employment, the government strategy is clear cut. We intend to prosecute a clear-headed strategy on both of those things for the future, because those opposite have not put forward any positive policies whatsoever. But why the member for North Sydney is so agitated on this is because this doctrine announced yesterday by the opposition has them in all sorts of trouble from here on in. When do we know that what the Leader of the Opposition says is suspended for the purposes of future policy credibility and accountability? - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. So, on these critical questions of employment and inflation, we have a clear-cut strategy for the future. Their strategy is this: what they say in opposition they will not commit to do in government. That is opportunism writ large.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, because this is certainly a decision that working families deserve. They are still doing it tough. They are certainly doing it tough. But a bit of relief is certainly welcome. So for the Reserve Bank to take this decision today is certainly very welcome - although it does not seem to be supported by those on the other side.Today's cut by the Reserve Bank will put nearly $600 a year back into the hands of a family with an average mortgage. Families have waited a long time for this relief. This is the first interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank in seven years. Some 740,000 families have never known a decision by the Reserve Bank to cut rates. It has taken seven years. And, of course, we know why that is the case: because Australian families had to endure 10 interest rate rises in a row under those opposite, and that added something like $400 a month to the mortgage bill of an average person with a mortgage - $400 a month. That was certainly the legacy of the member for Higgins - one that those over there are continually in denial over.I have made it very clear indeed that I expect the banks to pass on the cut announced by the Reserve Bank today in full and in a reasonable time. I have now had handed to me some of the information about what the banks intend to do in passing on this rate cut. The NAB will pass it on effective from Friday, 5 September, Westpac will pass it on effective from 4Â September and the ANZ and the CBA will pass it on effective from 8Â September. That is certainly going to be welcomed by many people out there. It will be welcome relief, but there is still so much more to do to take pressure off inflation and interest rates. I will quote from the first paragraph of the Reserve Bank's statement today:Inflation in Australia has been high over the past year in an environment of limited spare capacity and earlier strong growth in demand.What is that talking about? It is talking about the 20 warnings that those opposite received from the Reserve Bank over a three-year period. It is talking about the need for nation building to solve capacity constraints in the economy. Of course, then there was the reckless spending by those opposite that the member for Higgins admitted to in the Howard biography. What we are going to do is put in place a responsible economic policy which deals with investment in the future through nation building and which puts in place a disciplined fiscal policy. I think you can tell that those opposite today do not really understand how tough families out there are doing it. For the Leader of the Opposition this is just some form of political opportunism. We have seen that in question time today. He wants to score a political point about this instead of welcoming this move. This is very welcome news for Australian families, very welcome news for the Australian economy, and it is good news that should be celebrated by all in this House.</DOC>

 - I was talking before about the political opportunism and the stupidity of those opposite, and it is just so evident in that question. Why is the economy slowing? It is slowing under the weight of 10 interest rate rises in a row under those opposite - something they want to forget about. They do not want to admit to 10 interest rate rises in a row and the impact that is having on the growth prospects of this economy.The member for Wentworth was on AM this morning and he pretended that there was no such thing as 10 interest rate rises in a row and that they could not have had any impact on domestic growth. Then he wanted to ignore the impact of global economic conditions. He was pretending that the global oil price spike had not happened. No, there was no impact on inflation from that. He was pretending that global financial market turbulence is not pushing up borrowing rates for households and business. He was pretending that it has not had any impact on stock markets. It has had a big impact, and this government is dealing with it responsibly through a responsible fiscal policy - stopping their reckless spending and building a surplus, which they are now attacking in the Senate; putting in place the essential investment for nation building to solve those capacity constraints that have put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. Of course, all they are worried about over there is their own individual leadership prospects. Plan A over there, the Leader of the Opposition, is just worried about what it will mean for his leadership. - It was a question about interest rates, it was a question about sustainable employment growth, it was a question about prosperity, and what stuns me in this House today is that we get such juvenile questions from the opposition. This is a very serious question. Plan A over there, the Leader of the Opposition, is just worried about what it means for his leadership. Plan B up the back, the member for Higgins -  - Plan B up the back, the member for Higgins, is worried how it will highlight his dreadful record when it comes to 10 interest rate rises in a row. Of course, we have Plan C, the member for Wentworth. He is smiling through gritted teeth. - He is smiling through gritted teeth. - Plan C is smiling through gritted teeth. Do you want to know why? - Certainly, Mr Speaker. Plan C over there said interest rates were overdramatised.</DOC>

 - The Rudd government is committed to building a modern Australia - to building for Australia's long-term future. The 2008-09 budget makes provision for a total of $76 billion for long-term infrastructure investment in road, in rail, in ports, in water infrastructure, in broadband, in universities and in hospitals. Infrastructure is the sinew, the muscle, of our economy. If it is allowed to run down, the economy cannot run as fast. And run-down is precisely what infrastructure has been over the past decade. On 20 occasions the Reserve Bank warned that infrastructure incapacities and constraints were holding back the Australian economy. As a result, when we took office inflation was at a 16-year high and Australia had suffered 10 interest rate increases in a row. I would like to reiterate the quote that the Treasurer made from the statement that has just been released by the Reserve Bank Governor today; it makes very interesting reading. I quote:Inflation in Australia has been high over the past year in an environment of limited spare capacity and earlier strong growth in demand.You could not get a clearer, simpler statement about the economic circumstances that prevailed in Australia at the time this government took office, because what that refers to is infrastructure bottlenecks and rapidly growing government spending putting upward pressure on interest rates and inflation. It is a clear statement of the circumstances that prevailed in the Australian economy at that time.The purpose of infrastructure investment is to deliver long-term prosperity - not short-term vote buying, like the previous government engaged in, but long-term prosperity. Infrastructure investment is a key determinant of growth, it is a key determinant of living standards and it is critical to attracting foreign investment into this country. It is a really important element in the competitive advantage of the Australian economy when both Australian businesses and international businesses are making decisions about where to invest.Along with many other members of the House, I was fortunate enough to grow up in country Australia in the 1960s and early 1970s. It was a period of great investment in infrastructure, particularly by state governments - both Labor and Liberal - but also, in some instances, by federal governments. I saw electricity, gas and sewerage being extended to small country towns like the town that I grew up in, and the long-term prosperity that was enjoyed by Australia in that era had a lot to do with the infrastructure investment that was contributed by governments of both political persuasions. Sadly, in recent times the view on the other side of politics about infrastructure has changed significantly, and we are yet to hear a significant statement from the Leader of the Opposition, from the member for Wentworth or, indeed, from the putative leader of the opposition, the member for Higgins, about the significance of infrastructure investment for Australia's economy - or, indeed, about what they in government would do to invest for the future. For too long Australia has been cruising on the back of the mining boom, failing to invest in infrastructure for the future.Over the past five to seven years, you have been able to see the consequences of this in the export data. You can see the consequences of this in high current account deficits and in the inflation problem that this government inherited when we took office. The Rudd government are committed to tackling these infrastructure issues. We are committed to investing for the long-term future prosperity of this nation. We are committed to ensuring that future generations of Australians can enjoy the same kind of prosperity that I and so many others of my generation enjoyed off the back of infrastructure investment in the 1960s.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I just wish he would tell the truth in the question. In October, November and December last year underlying inflation hit 3.6 per cent - the highest in 16 years. And we have been frank with the Australian people in telling them that it has gone up since then. - There he goes. He says: after a year of us running the economy, we are responsible for the inflation. I was talking before about the political opportunism from plan A there, from plan B up there and from plan C over here, and I will tell you what it is based on. It is based on the notion that there was no inflation in the Australian economy until 24 November last year. That is what it is based on. It is based on the notion that 10 interest rate rises in a row never had any impact on economic growth. It is based on the notion that there has been no impact on the Australian economy by events in world financial markets - that they are not pushing up borrowing costs for households and businesses. It is all based on a furphy. These people who sit opposite are just so intent on playing short-term political games, they have got no concept of the national interest. I will tell you this: we on this side of the House will stand up for the national interest every time. That is what we are doing by putting together a responsible budget and a responsible surplus. That is what we are doing with our responsible plans for nation building. We understand the need to invest for the future and to tackle the inflation challenge so that we can have sustainable, long-term growth.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. He is, of course, a former schoolteacher. I have had the opportunity to visit some of the educational establishments in Braddon with the member, including one of his vocational education and training establishments. I am asked by the member for Braddon about infrastructure in schooling and education generally. Of course, amongst the things we inherited from the former government - high interest rates, a high inflation environment - we also inherited the consequences of more than a decade -  -  - of neglect of infrastructure investment in education. Of course, we also inherited a skills crisis, a capacity constraint that in and of itself put upwards pressure on inflation. - Well, the former government did give us Work Choices. Yes, they did do that, absolutely -  - a strategy to make sure that people lost pay and conditions. They did give us that, so that is one thing they still stand for and one thing they unambiguously did - they introduced Work Choices to rip pay and conditions out of the wallets and purses of working Australians. They certainly stand for that. But, whilst, of course, they were engaged in industrial relations extremism, what was happening in education? What was happening in education was that the infrastructure of it was being allowed to end up neglected and in disrepair, and, in many schools around this country, students were trying to learn vocational education and training skills in workshops that would have been more appropriate to the fifties and sixties than to the 21st century.The Rudd Labor government is addressing this problem through our program of building trades training centres in schools. Already we have invested more than $90 million in 34 projects in 96 schools. Whilst the opposition calls out, 'Play the blame game,' 'Blame state governments,' 'Do something else,' we are delivering. And just listen to the feedback, not from me but from school principals who have benefited under this program. Take, for example, Principal Brendan Lawler of St Edmund's College in the electorate of the member for Blair - and I am sure the member for Blair is very familiar with this announcement. Brendan Lawler said about his trades training proposal, which was successful:I doubt if we could have had better news to begin Term 3 than the announcement made on Monday by Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, that under the Trades Training Centres in Schools Program, a grant of $2.99M was made to build a facility at St Edmund's College.And there is this feedback from Wodonga Senior Secondary College in the electorate of the member for Indi, due to receive over $8 million to build a trades training centre to serve the region. Principal Peter MacLean wrote in his school newsletter:The announcement is wonderful news for the whole Wodonga community both as an economic boost of great significance and for the long term educational opportunities it will provide.This of course was the first round. The second round is available for applications now. There is more than $300 million available in the second round -  -  - I can hear members of the opposition calling out they hate money going into schools, but we will deliver that $300 million in any event. -  - But of course I am asked about risks to the capital investment in education. Apart from the Trades Training Centres in Schools Program, in the recent budget we created the Education Investment Fund, an $11 billion fund - with $5 billion coming out of the surplus. And of course you cannot put money in a nation-building education investment fund if you destroy the surplus. So, after more than a decade of neglect from the opposition benches, the Liberal Party are now trying to prevent money being invested in education and training infrastructure by irresponsibly punching a hole in the surplus. Well, people who want to see the infrastructure of universities and vocational education and training upgraded will judge the Liberal Party by their actions. The surplus is there to put downwards pressure on inflation and interest rates; the surplus is there to be invested in nation-building projects like education. We are saying to the Liberal Party that, after a decade of neglect, the very least they could do is get out of the way while the Rudd Labor government is fixing the problem.</DOC>

 - The purpose of a surplus is to ensure that we on this side of the House, through a responsible budget, are doing our part through fiscal policy to bring about downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates. That might be a difficult concept for those opposite. It is a very clear-cut concept for those on this side of the House. -  - Secondly, when you saw the explosion in public demand which occurred on the back of five per cent real expenditure growth through the government sector by those opposite in the previous year, you began to see the array of challenges faced by the Reserve Bank in bringing interest rates down. What you had was public demand effectively roaring along at great guns and no investment in terms of supply-side constraints in the economy as well. What does that lead to? An interest rate challenge -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. The impact of climate change, with increasing temperatures over time, on drought and on our water supplies is real. It underlines why comprehensive action to tackle climate change is a priority for the Rudd Labor government. The Liberal Party, with its palpable lack of direction, consistency and conviction, shows how ill-equipped it is to deal with these issues day by day. Barely nine months into the life of the government we have given Australia a seat at the global negotiating table, with the ratification of Kyoto. We have committed to reducing Australia's greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to 60 per cent of the 2000 levels. We have set out the government's preferred design for the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We are committed to ensuring that at least 20 per cent of Australia's electricity supply comes from renewable energy by 2020 and we are committed to a substantial forward agenda on cost-effective energy efficiency improvements as a key plank of our response to reducing Australia's carbon pollution at least cost.I have to say that this comes at a time when we have had 11 of the 13 hottest years on record, evaporation rates in the Murray-Darling Basin are at a very, very high level and, regrettably, inflows are very low. That is a real agenda, they are significant commitments, they are real targets and they form part of a strategic approach to tackling climate change - an approach that is economically responsible, environmentally effective and based on science. Perhaps the best way to understand this approach after nine months is to compare it to the previous government's record over 12 years: 12 years of denying the climate change science and 12 years of ignoring the evidence. And that is not the full story. - That is not the full story, because, as we saw in the Sydney Morning Herald of 28 July, not only did the previous government spend 12 years denying the science, they then spent about 12 months pretending to care. This was what an anonymous coalition MP said about their colleagues:... 70 per cent either does not believe in climate change or is plain sceptical.That was the same MP who said:We were staring at an electoral abyss. We had to pretend we cared.The problem with pretending to care -  -  - As I was saying, the problem with pretending to care is that it is hard to be convincing to anyone. No better example of this was in evidence than last night when the Leader of the Opposition was interviewed on Lateline and was asked a very straightforward question:Do you accept what's happening to the Lower Lakes and right up the Murray is also related to climate change?This is the answer from the Leader of the Opposition:Well, no I don't.He went on to say:What's happening at the moment in the Murray-Darling Basin is a consequence of two things: mismanagement of the entire system for almost 100 years, and also the worst drought in 100 years. And it is quite wrong for people to suggest that what we're seeing at the moment is a consequence of climate change.Following that response, the Leader of the Opposition was presented with the views of Australian scientists, including from the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology. He then went on to say:Climate change in so far as the impacts that we have seen may well be contributing to some of it, but essentially what we see is a product, as I say, of drought and mismanagement.That was two positions in two minutes as the opposition leader went on to talk about mismanagement. - Can I simply say: 12 years of neglect and denial, then 12 months of pretending to care and two minutes to change position. We do not have to look very far, because they had 12 years to take action on water and there was not one single drop of water returned to the Murray-Darling Basin as a consequence of environmental flows. And now the opposition leader, in the space of two minutes, goes from 'no' to 'maybe'. This is what happens to a Liberal Party that pretends to care about climate change: a leader who cannot hold the same position on climate change from Lateline to Lateline Business.I tell you the Rudd Labor government do care about climate change. We do care about the challenge of water and we acknowledge that it is a serious difficulty for families and irrigators and other communities in the basin. We also recognise the views and evidence presented by our leading scientists and we take them seriously. We have a clear policy agenda in place to deal with these issues and we will deliver to the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for the question. The Australian government recognises the reality of climate change around the globe, what that is doing and the challenges that it is presenting within Australia. This is also something that is well understood by Australian farmers, both on the ground and at the peak body level. We have listened to the National Farmers Federation, who have said that the NFF believe climate change to be 'possibly the biggest risk facing Australian farmers in the coming century'. In the same way, we have listened to farmers when we have met them in the field. For example, in the New England region, while travelling with the member for New England, we spoke to Michael Vickery, a fine-wool producer. He talked about the work that he had done on his farm to improve soil carbon - lifting it by six per cent from when he bought the property in the mid-eighties to 1991.There are of course other views that have occurred during the last 12 years. Some were presented in spectacular fashion on Lateline last night. On Lateline last night we heard a view on the Murray-Darling Basin and the crisis there that it had absolutely nothing to do with climate change. We had a new argument presented last night which said, 'Okay, the climate is changing but the weather remains unaffected' - no impact on the weather at all - and 'You can look at any impact on the weather out there and, yes, these things are happening globally but somehow Australia remains blissfully immune.' Given a choice between listening to Australia's farmers or listening to the Leader of the Opposition, the government has chosen to listen to Australia's farmers.A lot of the work that Australia's farmers have done for many years now has a knock-on benefit in terms of dealing with the impacts of climate change. When Landcare was commenced under the previous Labor government, originally it was acknowledging the good environmental management that was performed by our farmers. Then, as salinity became an issue, Landcare work also helped with salinity. As we went into the drought, it also helped with soil moisture, and now that work, which has been done for so many years on properties around the nation, helps with the building of soil carbon. This is National Landcare Week, and 91 per cent of farmers who have had some involvement with Landcare have made changes to the way they manage their farms in ways that do help to deal with the challenges of the future.In addition to this, though, the government realises that there is a need for further adaptation and adjustment assistance for Australia's farmers. That is why we are committed to Australia's farming future, whether it be through research, through adaptation or through adjustment. We tripled the additional funding available for the Climate Change and Productivity Research Program from $15 million to $46.2 million. We also announced the Farm Ready Program - $26Â½ million to help train farmers in dealing with these challenges of the future and to make sure that the best science makes it from the lab to the farm. Of course, there is adjustment money as well, including grants of up to 5Â½ thousand dollars for business planning.Australia is not immune from these difficult global conditions. Farmers are facing a host of global challenges and a whole range of input costs, making it tougher at every level. They have had some relief today, which I hope gets welcomed by those members opposite. Today's announcement in terms of the input cost impact of debt is extraordinary for farmers. Average farm debt in Australia for 2006-07 was around $702,000 - up from 2001-02 when it was only $238,000. Today's announcement, if passed in full, will lead to a reduction in interest payments of around $1,755 a year per farm, or $146.25 every month, based on the average farm debt level. I certainly look forward to the opportunity where we look at the challenges of the future and the challenges of the present and hope at the end of question time we see the Leader of the Opposition stand up in this place and welcome the interest rates announcement.</DOC>

 - I draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to the package which the government already announced some time ago for the lower lakes. That was an extensive package which went to local irrigation works. Having visited that area with the Minister for Climate Change and Water, the particular request put to us by that local community then was to assist them with the piping necessary to get water from higher up in the Murray to their particular agricultural needs adjacent to the lakes. And that is precisely what we responded to with a very expensive program, way in excess of the $50 million which the Leader of the Opposition has just referred to.The second point, though, on the question of the Coorong Lakes is: how do we deal effectively with that as a long-term challenge given the extreme overallocation of water entitlements to the Murray-Darling? The government, again, has a strategy in place on that score, which includes, for the first time in the Commonwealth's history, the buying back of water entitlements. We have commenced that with the Minister for Climate Change and Water, having expended $50 million already for the purchase back of some 37 gigalitres of entitlements. Most recently, at the Adelaide cabinet meeting, we agreed as well to allocate a figure something in the order of half a billion dollars to accelerate the purchase of water entitlements across multiple jurisdictions. This is necessary in order to -  - The question goes to the level of support for those associated with the lower lakes, and that is what I am responding to in terms of the package which I put forward, and put forward considerably in advance of that which has been referred to by the Leader of the Opposition. I would draw his attention to the whole challenge of taking back water entitlements for the system by a system of purchasing on the open market, which is what we have been doing. What I cannot understand - and presumably that is why those opposite interject - is why, in 12 years in office, they did not purchase back a single gigalitre of water entitlements from the entire Murray-Darling system. For 12 years, they had all that time to act; they had the money to act and they failed to act. In nine months of office we have already begun the buyback program.I conclude my answer to the question of the Leader of the Opposition by again going to the third element of the challenge for the Coorong Lakes - that is, the impact of climate change. The matter has already been raised by the minister for agriculture and the minister for the environment in response to questions in the House today. The other part of dealing with this challenge in the Coorong Lakes is the impact of climate change on water inflow into the entire Murray-Darling Basin. If you are going to continue to position yourself on the side of the climate change deniers, which those opposite do consistently, and say that climate change has nothing to do with what is happening either in the lower lakes or in the Murray, you cannot even get to first base in dealing with this problem for the long term.Last night the Leader of the Opposition stood up on national television and answered the question, 'Do you accept what is happening to the lower lakes and right up the Murray is also related to climate change?' He said, 'Well, I don't.' I find that remarkable. Last night a series of questions was put to the Leader of the Opposition by the interviewer where he presented the Leader of the Opposition with a series of scientific reports. The question on Lateline was, 'How do you know it's not climate change?' The Leader of the Opposition answered, 'It's not a consequence of climate change.' He was then asked, 'How do you know that?' And there was no answer to that. In other words, he says that it is not a consequence of climate change because he says it is not a consequence of climate change. That is what it is all about. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition: you need to get with the science on this. Look at the technical report put together by the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology which says - and I ask the Leader of the Opposition if he agrees with this statement:Recent Australian drought has been accompanied by higher surface temperatures due to anthropogenic warming.That report was in 2007, when you lot were in office. Then there is the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report 2007: Impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. - Further on the impact of climate change on the lower lakes, which I would have thought the Leader of the Opposition would be interested in, I draw his attention also to the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report 2007 - again released when he was in office and many of those opposite were cabinet ministers. In the chapter on Australia and New Zealand, it says:Australia and New Zealand are already experiencing impacts from recent climate change. These are now evident in increasing stresses on water supply and agriculture ...Most recently, in January 2008, Mr David Jones, Head of Climate Analysis in the Bureau of Meteorology, said:'Last year climate change became very evident in south-eastern Australia, with South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, ACT and the Murray-Darling Basin all setting temperature records by a very large margin _Those are three sets of scientific reports. But in response to the question, 'How do you know it is not climate change?' the Leader of the Opposition says, 'It is not climate change because it is not climate change.' That is what he said. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that if he wishes to seriously engage in a debate about what you do in handling the challenges of water in the lower lakes then, firstly, you have a reasonable and rational program of assistance, which this government has put forward, and to which the government will add in the future; secondly, you deal also with a proper program to buy back water entitlements from this grossly over water-entitled river system - hence, the government's buyback program; and, thirdly, you must act in the long term on climate change. I would say that the Leader of the Opposition has had a very bad 24 hours - first with the Nelson doctrine on interest rates and now with the Nelson doctrine of climate change denial.</DOC>

 - I would like to particularly thank the member for Fremantle not only for her question today but for her very hard work and commitment to deal with these difficult issues of child abuse. I would like to also particularly mention the members for Macarthur and Fremantle, who organised an excellent briefing for all members of parliament at lunchtime today. I think it really brought home to each and every one of us just how serious this issue is. National Child Protection Week is next week and it will be run around a very powerful theme: Children See, Children Do.NAPCAN, the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, is organising many events around the country, with some support from the Australian government. This will provide an opportunity next week for all members of parliament to get out to wherever we can in our electorates to make sure that we show the sort of leadership that is needed in the critical area of child abuse.I want to share with members of the House some remarks made by an extraordinary woman at the briefing organised by the two members today. Anne-Marie is a mother of three young children. She has been participating in Uniting Care Burnside's New Parent Information Network, or NEWPIN, for the last two years. She had a very traumatic childhood, filled with far too much abuse. Back in October 2005, she was a mum with a three-year-old son and 11-month-old twins, a boy and a girl, and she said this about herself:I was tired, sad, mad, isolated, overwhelmed, deeply traumatised and very much in need of some help.She also said:And these NEWPIN people were so bloody persistent and supportive, non-judgemental and compassionate and caring, I didn't stand a chance. I'm only human.At the briefing at lunchtime today, she said that that was the greatest thing about the people at Uniting Care. They just stuck with her through all that difficult time. She continued:In those two years, I got my licence back, bought a car. I got a credit card and after attending two years of parenting courses, I realised that if I could do that then I could do TAFE too. I started TAFE, I got my health fixed and I took control of my life for the first time ever.Further, she said:The thing is when you become a parent, all of sudden it is not just about you anymore and you begin to realise, it won't be about you for a very long time.She also said - and I think this really summed it up:If you have not been taught how to love and be loved, how can you teach or show it?That is what we all have a responsibility to do: to work with people like Anne-Marie and organisations like Uniting Care Burnside in our electorates and right around Australia to make sure that children in our country can grow up happy, healthy and with a great future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. If you go to the big challenges facing Australia's future, such as infrastructure - and we have spoken a lot about those in question time today - either you can as a national government partner with state governments and, I believe, increasingly with local government in rolling out the infrastructure that the nation, including in her community around Nowra, needs or you can simply adhere to the politics of long standing, which is to blame other levels of government. We do not intend to keep up that tired, old game plan, which has been done to death by those opposite, of blaming one state government after another and blaming one level of government after another, until you have had a decent time to work through these things in a cooperative fashion. We believe that is the right way ahead. That is why we have worked with the Council of Australian Governments in the way in which we have done.Take, for example, the work by the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. I imagine the honourable member has a lot of small businesses in her electorate. One of the challenges faced by those in small business is how to deal with the avalanche of regulatory overhang in their businesses Those opposite conspicuously did nothing about that. In the period that we have been in office, we have said through the Council of Australian Governments: business - small, medium and large - is having a hard time of dealing with a whole lot of regulations. They are making it very difficult for small businesses to grow into larger businesses and for them to sell into markets across state boundaries. Therefore, one of the practical challenges is how you stop blaming other governments for that and how you start cooperating with them to get rid of some of these impediments to business and trade That is what the minister for small business is currently doing through the COAG working group on business deregulation. We think that is one practical area to work your way through these problems.Another area is in health and hospitals. I presume that in the area represented by the honourable member she would like to see greater investment by the national government in the particular health and hospital needs of her constituents rather than a formula which says: 'Ah, we've got a problem here; therefore, let's just blame the state government of New South Wales or wherever for what is going on.' Why don't we actually put our shoulder to the wheel and say: 'If the federal government, under the government which was supported by the honourable member, pulled $1 billion out of the system' - which they did when it came to health and hospitals - 'how do we as a national government put that money back in and partner with state health authorities to improve health infrastructure on the ground?'Turn to education. Turn, for example, to TAFE. Turn also to the challenges in skills. Either you can say that the digital revolution in schools is just too hard, too difficult and too long term to touch, or you as a national government can say both on computers in schools and on trades training centres that the national government should partner with state and territory governments in order to make sure that schools on the ground are doing better. For example, of the 864 schools which have now received grants for 116,000 computers - and I imagine some of those may have been delivered to the honourable member's electorate; I am not quite sure -  -  - Can I ask those opposite to put their hands up if they would like any of those grants to be handed back? Can I ask those opposite to put their hands up if a trades training centre were to be put into one of your schools in the period ahead and you would like those grants to be handed back? I use those as practical examples for those opposite. Either you can go through a cooperative strategy of dealing with the states and territories and act in a practical way on business deregulation, act in a practical way to ensure that you are delivering health and hospitals programs for communities on the ground and act in a cooperative way when it comes to schools and TAFEs, or you can play the blame game. We do not intend to perpetuate that game. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corio for his question. I was recently in Geelong, talking to employment providers, hosted by the member; I do appreciate his interest in this particular area. I am still waiting for the member for Boothby to ask me a question in this place - and I will keep waiting, I am sure.We have been doing a lot of things in this area. It is important that we get employment services correct. As of 1 July next year, we will have a new system in place, as the old contracts entered into by the previous government expire. The Job Network policies designed by those opposite have failed disadvantaged job seekers. That is underlined by the fact that, in 1999, one in 10 job seekers that were on unemployment income were very long term unemployed; it is now almost one in four job seekers that are on the very long term unemployed list. That is something we must address. As a result of that, we are not only changing the employment services but also ensuring that, over the next five years, there will be 238,000 training places for job seekers.The new employment services will have a strong focus on work experience, including Work for the Dole. There will be a very effective compliance system where a job seeker will lose income if they miss a day of activity without a reasonable excuse. That particular form of compliance will encourage engagement - that is, if there is a failure to actively involve themselves, they will lose a day and, of course, they understand, therefore, that they have to re-engage for payment to resume. That is a very important part of the system. We will keep the eight-week non-payment penalty for wilful non-compliant job seekers, but that should be a much more limited number than is currently the case.The new system is about participating, not waiting. For that reason, we will be removing the waiting lists for services - lists we have inherited from those sitting opposite. Making already disadvantaged job seekers wait compounds the problems that they have. The fact is that the new system will allow disadvantaged job seekers to be attended to immediately rather than having them wait for particular periods of time for particular assistance, which is currently the case under the existing system.I have to say that I do not think members opposite fully appreciate how hard it is for these disadvantaged job seekers to wait. For example, in Parkes, New South Wales, job seekers are waiting for up to 299 days to access the Personal Support Program. Of course, 299 days may not seem all that long to the absent member for Higgins. If you are in a taxpayer funded job waiting 294 days for a book launch, it would not seem that long at all. But the fact is that, for job seekers, it is an eternity. We will be removing those waiting lists as of 1 July next year.Over the last decade, rather than improve skills for job seekers, the member for Warringah, the member for North Sydney, the member for Dickson and others on the other side of the House spent a long time working out how to vilify and demonise job seekers; they spent their time inventing names for job seekers. I think it is a bit rich that those opposite like to use the term 'job snobs' when they exhibit a whole lot of job snobbery on their part. The fact is that we have a member for Gippsland here because his predecessor thought the actual job of looking after his Gippsland constituents was not important enough for him, so he left. The reason why we do not have the member for Lyne and the member for Mayo here is because -  - Indeed. Mr Speaker, the reason that they are not here and we have expensive by-elections is that those members -  - believe that they are too good to represent the constituents of those electorates. This government is very serious about reforming employment services and having training that will be commensurate with the skills that those job seekers need; we will make sure that we finish doing that. We expect the support of the other side - but, I have to say, after 12 years, they showed no regard for those skill needs for those job seekers.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition's question is based on a wrong premise - that is, that the tax to GDP ratio in this budget decreases tax as a proportion of GDP relative to the last budget brought down by the previous government. I would suggest that the Leader of the Opposition studies carefully his own budget papers from the past and applies the only rational measure to this, which is tax as a proportion of GDP. He will reach one conclusion, and that is that the government which he was part of was this country's highest taxing government. By contrast, what we have brought down is a budget which reduces the overall tax burden on the economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. Last night, soldiers of the Australian Special Operations Task Group in southern Afghanistan became engaged in a battle with Taliban extremists. I regret to inform the House that nine Australian troops have been wounded in this action. One soldier has suffered life-threatening wounds, five soldiers have suffered serious wounds and three soldiers have suffered light wounds. The wounded soldiers were provided with immediate first aid by their comrades at the scene before being evacuated by helicopter to coalition medical facilities. Several Taliban extremists were killed in the action. I am advised that this action is ongoing and that members of the Special Operations Task Group remain in the field undertaking their essential but dangerous work.On behalf of all Australians, let me say that our thoughts and our prayers are with the wounded soldiers, their comrades in the field of battle and their families and loved ones. This action, and the toll it has taken on these members of the Australian Defence Force, underscores the importance and the dangers of the vital mission they are undertaking in Afghanistan on behalf of us all. Let us make no mistake: they are engaged in a vital mission. The Taliban can never again be allowed to use Afghanistan as a training ground, a hiding place or a launching pad for terrorist operations around the world - terrorists that advocate harm to Australians as well; terrorists that trained there to take the lives of our countrymen in Bali in 2002; and terrorists that, if permitted a safe haven, would seek to attack us and others again.It is the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, like those who put themselves in harm's way last night, that are taking the fight to this enemy of us all. They are disrupting, destroying and displacing those that would seek to return Afghanistan and its people to the bastion of terror that we had during the period of the Taliban administration. At the same time, it is the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are building, teaching and mentoring the people of this province so that they may take charge of the land, take charge of their lives and, in time, take charge of their own security. It is the men and women of the Australian Defence Force that risk their lives every day in pursuit of this aspiration on behalf of us all. The fight in Afghanistan goes on. It involves our special forces aggressively taking the fight to the Taliban. It involves our reconstruction and mentoring troops rebuilding the infrastructure and capabilities of the civil community and the security services. And it involves us working closely with our friends and partners in Afghanistan.We are not the only ones to see our troops face danger. On 19 August, 10 soldiers from France lost their lives and 21 were wounded on one dreadful day in Kabul province, east of the capital. France, under the leadership of President Sarkozy, has been a strong supporter of the fight in Afghanistan, and France has paid a high price. I want to recognise the commitment of the French government to supporting the vital mission in Afghanistan and the commitment of our other allies in the field. The Australian government remains committed to assisting the people of Afghanistan and their democratically elected government to achieve a measure of the stability and prosperity that we take for granted in our country here. And today while we may pause to reflect on the bravery and sacrifice of our fighting men and women our adversaries should take heed of the resolve of Australia's soldiers, the resolve of the Australian government and the resolve of the Australian people in bringing to an end this unsustainable instability and conflict in Afghanistan.Honourable members - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The member has great difficulty in welcoming any good news when it comes to the economy. But today's growth figure is a solid 0.3 for the quarter and 2.7 for the year. Given the international circumstances that we face and given the impact particularly of 10 straight interest rate rises under the Liberals, the economy is certainly slowing. That is there for all to see in the national accounts today - the impact of 10 consecutive interest rate rises under the member for Higgins and the global difficulties that we experience.The member for Wentworth is living in cloud-cuckoo-land if he thinks slugging families with a $400-a-month interest rate bill does not make much difference, because that is what 10 interest rate rises in a row under those opposite have done to Australian families - the Costello interest rate bill: $400. And that has an impact on consumption. I know the member for Wentworth does not think that an interest rate rise has an impact on consumption because, when interest rates went up for the seventh time, he said their impact was overdramatised! That is what he said. He does not think $500 a year means a lot to families. But it certainly does. And $400 a month - which hit families, particularly in New South Wales, and hit them hard - has a very, very big impact on consumption. - So it is true: consumption in New South Wales did take a hit. And the reason is simply this: there are more people in New South Wales under housing stress because they borrow a lot more to get into the housing market, and it has, unfortunately, impacted there. So the member opposite really ought to be much more truthful about what is going on in the economy, who is responsible for what has occurred and what needs to be done to address this problem. Last night, the member for Wentworth was on The 7.30 Report, and this is what he said:I am not exaggerating. Look, all I'm saying is this: had we been governed by leaders who were responsible, and who had the economic interests of this country at heart, we would have had lower interest rates _Isn't that an awful thing to say about Mr Howard and the member for Higgins - particularly on the night that Mr Howard is in the House! That is a terrible thing to say about them because it is so true. And New South Wales is now living with the consequences of the neglect by the Liberals of capacity constraints, particularly in infrastructure, and the consequences of their reckless spending. But we on this side of the House accept our responsibility to put in place a disciplined fiscal policy that deals with inflation and to make the investments for the future that deal with the capacity constraints so that we can generate growth with lower inflation and lower interest rates.</DOC>

 - You could not welcome the rate cut yesterday, and you cannot welcome these figures today. These are solid figures. The government acknowledge that we are not out of the woods yet. But these figures are very solid: 0.3 per cent in the June quarter and 2.7 per cent over the year. The non-farm economy grew by 0.5 per cent. These are very solid numbers, particularly when you compare them to the other major developed economies in the world. In the June quarter, Japan recorded minus 0.6, Germany recorded minus 0.5, France and Italy recorded minus 0.3, and the UK did not grow at all. In fact, over the past year our economy has grown stronger than those of the US, the UK, Japan, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. But we are not immune from these difficulties, and that is why we have to do everything we can to address the fundamentals in our economy, do everything we possibly can to put downward pressure on inflation and downward pressure on interest rates and do something about that bill that hangs around the neck of everyone with a mortgage - the $400 Costello bill from the 10 interest rate rises in a row delivered by those opposite.The good news, particularly, in the figures today comes from business investment. Business investment rose by a strong four per cent in the June quarter and 9.9 per cent over the year, and Australia is well positioned for stronger increases in business investment in future years. Last year's capex figures show that businesses are planning to invest $100 billion in our economy this financial year. And of course we are also benefiting strongly from record commodity prices. All of these things mean that we do have grounds for optimism. But what we have to do is to go back to the foundations of our economy and deal with all of those issues that were left to us by those opposite. We have to put in place a disciplined fiscal policy. We have to build our surplus, which is why it should not be eroded by those opposite in the Senate. We have to put in place our investment for the future through our investment funds, through our $76 billion infrastructure program, to do something about the capacity constraints left to the people of Australia by those opposite. This government will not make the mistake that those opposite made. The mistake they made was to pat themselves on the back for prosperity and do nothing to sustain it.</DOC>

 - On the question of confidence both in business and at the consumer level - I will come back to the question of the Ai Group in a minute - the impact of the global financial crisis has been felt across the world. If you look at business confidence indicators and consumer confidence indicators across the world, they have all taken a pummelling.On the question of employment, as we indicated before, the government projects that the unemployment rate, according to our budget forecasts, will increase to 4.75 per cent by the middle of next year. We also note that employment growth is currently at 2.4 per cent, as of July 2008. The budget forecast is for employment growth to ease to three-quarters of a per cent over the year to June 2009. Also I would say to the honourable member that 33,000 jobs were created in the last two months; 136,000 jobs have been created since November 2007. This is a -  - I know these numbers will, again, upset the political narrative of those opposite, which is summed up in one set of words: talking the Australian economy down. That is all they seek to do. In fact, on our calculation this represents the 18th question from the opposition this week talking the economy down. I would think that a responsible opposition would actually engage in the reverse and instead engage in a debate about future policy options for the Australian economy.Our economic strategy is clear-cut for the future. I have just run through the government's employment forecast for the period ahead and the government's unemployment forecast for the period ahead.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Yesterday brought the first interest rate cut that Australian mortgage holders have had in nearly seven years. It has been a long time that they have had to wait for that. It was the first interest rate cut ever experienced by some 740,000 first home buyers. That, again, is an important fact to note. It has been a modest contribution to the cost-of-living pressures faced by working families, but for those 3.1 million Australian households with mortgages it represents a welcome development. For the average mortgage holder that means a saving of nearly $600 a year.Today, through the national accounts data, we have an indication and evidence of solid growth for the Australian economy for the June quarter. This is particularly solid growth when you consider the international context in which we are operating. The Treasurer has just referred here to the international comparators for the first six months of the year, whereby the economies of Japan, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have either experienced negative growth in those quarters or experienced zero growth. For developing countries also in the June quarter, I draw the House's attention to the fact that Hong Kong experienced negative growth of 1.4 per cent and Singapore of 1.5 per cent.I would draw to honourable members' attention - I notice the Deputy Leader of the Opposition finds negative growth around the world amusing - that the recent outlook document produced by the OECD for the global economy again contains some disturbing findings about the period which lies ahead. The OECD has noted that global growth is weak and said:Financial market turmoil, housing market downturns and high commodity prices continue to bear down on global growth _And, furthermore:Continued financial turmoil appears to reflect increasingly signs of weakness in the real economy, itself partly a product of lower credit supply and asset prices.That is the interim assessment of the economic outlook for OECD countries dated 2 September, yesterday.Therefore, against these global circumstances, as reinforced by that OECD bulletin, this quarterly growth figure for Australia represents solid growth. When you look at the fact that that translates into annual growth of 2.7 per cent, we believe that this represents a reasonable performance against the difficult challenges which now present themselves to the Australian economy internationally. The other thing I would say is that it also represents a solid performance for the economy domestically, given the cumulative impact of 10 interest rate rises in a row on the part of those opposite, all of which serves to have an impact on the cumulative economic wellbeing of the country.I said yesterday, and I say again today, however, that the state of the overall economy and the fact that we have had one interest rate cut, representing modest help for working families under financial pressure, mean that we still have much, much more to do when it comes to assisting those Australians. But, to put it into context, yesterday's official rate cut put nearly $600 a year back into the wallets of families on average mortgages right across Australia. I would ask those opposite to contemplate one thing they are about to do in the Senate - that is, their Senate treatment of the Medicare levy surcharge. -  - I would suggest to those opposite they listen very carefully to this. If they proceed with their tactic to block this in the Senate, what would be the impact for working families who have just, for the first time in seven years, had an interest rate cut which benefits them to the tune of $600 a year? Yesterday we had an interest rate cut which benefits working families on an average mortgage with $600 a year. For a family with two average income earners and a combined income of $120,000, the increase in the Medicare levy surcharge will save them $1,200 in tax. Yesterday, through the actions of the Reserve Bank in a 25 basis point reduction, we realised something like a $600 a year saving for working families with an average mortgage.The action which those opposite are now contemplating in the Senate today has exactly the reverse effect. It is in fact a raid on the household budget of working families. For a family with two average incomes earning a combined income of $120,000, the increase in the Medicare levy surcharge will save them $1,200 in tax. So on Tuesday the RBA provides relief of nearly $600 for families on an average mortgage, and on Thursday the Liberal Party of Australia will take that back in spades. I challenge those opposite, who stand here and talk about the cost pressures facing working families. We had action yesterday by the Reserve Bank, modest in terms of its overall impact, but what the opposition are about to do in the Senate on the Medicare levy surcharge represents a slug on working families and I would suggest to those opposite that they do the right thing in the Senate and stand up for working families instead of providing an average slug of $1,200, which hits their family budget. - Yes, they were.</DOC>

 - One of the more curious questions asked yesterday, which I think is embedded somewhere in the question asked just now by the Leader of the Opposition, was whether you use surpluses on consumption or whether you use them on investment. That is a very critical distinction because those opposite, in the avalanche of cash which came in the back door off the back of the resources boom, chose to do primarily one thing with it, and that was to expend it on consumption. Look at the avalanche of informed criticism of that strategy by those opposite. I take for example Saul Eslake's criticism over the last several years that, of the hundreds of billions of dollars in extra revenue received over multiple years by those opposite - and I paraphrase Saul Eslake here - he could not identify a single thing on which this previous government could hang its hat by way of long-term productive investment. The alternative is in fact to use the proceeds of the mining boom to invest in the future. I will quote here from the International Monetary Fund's report of July 2008:Saving some of the revenue from the commodity price boom in three new funds will take pressure off monetary policy in the near term...The reduction in public spending growth in the latest budget illustrates the government's commitment to help reduce inflation.We have a strategy for the future. It is saying: here you have a lot of revenue coming in off the back of the resources boom and you can either invest it or spend it on consumption, which is what those opposite did year in, year out while there was no new investment in our hospitals, no new investment in our TAFEs and our universities, no new investment for major new national and global challenges like climate change, and not a single dollar spent on reclaiming water entitlements from the Murray-Darling Basin - none of these investments in the future. I would suggest to those opposite that what they need is an economic strategy for Australia's future rather than simply continuing their past practices, which were reflected budget after budget and which were to take the revenue product of the resources boom and to expend it on consumption. This government has a strategy for the long-term future. We are proud of our investment funds for the future. We are a party and a government of nation-building and we are so without apology.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question because yesterday's official rate cut will put almost $600 a year back into the wallet of a family with an average mortgage. For a family on an average new mortgage in New South Wales, the cut will be about $560 a year. In Queensland, it will be more than $520 a year; in Victoria, more than $500; in Western Australia, $510; in South Australia, $400; and in Tasmania, $340. Families have waited a long time for this relief; in fact, they have waited seven years. They have certainly been doing it tough and that is one of the reasons why consumption has taken a hit in the national accounts today, which I was talking about before. But this is modest relief for those families who are labouring under sky-high petrol prices and of course the legacy of 10 interest rate rises in a row courtesy of those opposite, which is why it is so stunning that, in this environment, when families are under so much financial pressure, those opposite could contemplate moving in the Senate to knock off the tax cut that we are effectively giving to workers on average wages when we lift the Medicare surcharge up.As the Prime Minister was saying before, for two income earners, each on average incomes, earning a combined income of $120,000 a year, the increase in the Medicare levy surcharge will save them $1,200 in tax. That is what it will save and that is what the opposition want to take away in the Senate. That is what those opposite are going to take away from those families on average incomes via their vandalism in the Senate. They will take away twice the rate relief delivered to that family with this one act of vandalism in the Senate. They have no credibility when it comes to the financial pressures on working families and no economic program for the future.</DOC>

 - I absolutely welcome that question. This is coming from a political party that wants to vandalise the surplus in the Senate. Labor is the party that is saving and that has a disciplined fiscal policy. Those opposite are out there trying to vandalise the surplus up in the Senate. Their actions in the Senate put at risk so much. They put at risk vital investment in the future - which they would not make - via our investment funds. Investment in the future will do something about capacity constraints and put downward pressure on inflation and therefore put downward pressure on interest rates. Everything that we have seen from those opposite, most particularly the member for Wentworth, is a recipe for higher interest rates for much longer. That is what their program, if you could describe it as that, represents. We will take the responsible decisions. We will put in place the responsible fiscal settings, and that means fighting for our $22 billion surplus in that Senate and making sure that the economic vandalism of those opposite, if it succeeds, will be punished by the Australian people at the next election.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for her question. Yesterday's decision by the Reserve Bank to reduce interest rates, the first in seven years, is a welcome relief for homebuyers throughout the nation and for Australian businesses. Yet again, the Reserve Bank's decision contains a very important message, and I would like to read that message out again. That message is:Inflation in Australia has been high over the past year in an environment of limited spare capacity and earlier strong growth in demand. In these circumstances, the Board has been seeking to restrain demand in order to reduce inflation over time.Yet again, the Reserve Bank has drawn attention to the problems of capacity constraints in the Australia economy. When they were in government, the opposition missed those messages 20 times; they did not register on the opposition's radar. One would hope that they register now; one would hope that they understand the message now. The government would hope that the opposition understand that the central factor in economic capacity is infrastructure.Infrastructure investment lifts the speed at which an economy can grow sustainably, it improves productivity and it generates economic opportunity. That is why the budget makes provision over the long term for $76 billion worth of infrastructure investment. Whether it is through the AusLink program, rail, the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund or the Health and Hospitals Fund, all of these things are about long-term investment in Australia's future prosperity. Improving the infrastructure in Australia's economy, improving the capacity in the economy, will enable us to reduce the risk of interest rate increases into the longer term. That is the clear message from the Reserve Bank statement that was released yesterday. We do not want to return to circumstances where inadequate economic capacity is pushing up inflation and therefore putting upward pressure on interest rates.Yesterday's decision has provided welcome relief for many working families throughout Australia. For people with a typical mortgage, that relief is close to $600 per year. It is the first rate cut for seven years, so there are almost three quarters of a million first home buyers who have, until now, not experienced a cut in interest rates because of the long, steady interest rate increases under the former government.Yet, bizarrely, the Liberal Party in the Senate seem intent upon ripping this benefit away from many working people by blocking the government's changes to the thresholds for the Medicare levy surcharge. In fact, there will be, if the Liberal Party is successful in the Senate, many people in this country who otherwise would have been better off to the tune of about $1,800 or more as a result of the two initiatives - that is, the Reserve Bank cutting interest rates, thereby dropping their mortgage costs, and the government lifting the threshold on the Medicare surcharge. Many of those people would have been better off to the tune of about $1,800 a year. But if the opposition blocks the changes to the Medicare surcharge, they will not benefit in anything like the same way because they will continue to be hit by a slug that was originally intended to hit high income earners. Apparently the opposition now believes that people earning $50,000 a year are high-income earners and should be hit by this tax surcharge. So much for the party of low taxation; so much for the party that is seeking to relieve the tax burden on ordinary working people.We do face very challenging economic circumstances in this country as a result of a variety of international pressures. It is critical that we investment for the future; it is critical that we investment for tomorrow, not just spend today. We are now dealing with the legacy of a government that saw the future as election day, that saw spending as the way to win on election day and that saw investing as something that other people do. We are seeking to turn around that legacy and ensure that we get an appropriate balance in this country between spending and investment and that we have long-term infrastructure investment that will enable us as a society to grow sustainably. That will create economic opportunity and ensure that the Reserve Bank is helped in its long-term job of keeping interest rates as low as possible.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The government's strategy for investing in nation building is clear cut and stands in complete contrast to that of our predecessors. Our predecessors took surpluses and spent them on consumption. We save surpluses for the purposes of investment in long-term productive capacity. That is the difference. It is the strategy which was called on by the Reserve Bank in its 20 sets of warnings, when it asked, 'What are you going to do about capacity constraints in the economy?' The BCA and other peak industry bodies across Australia year in and year out asked, 'Will you invest in long-term productive potential?' I referred earlier to a quote from Saul Estlake. There was an avalanche of commentary in the 12 long years that those opposite occupied the treasury bench asking, 'Will you take the proceeds from this revenue bonanza which comes off the back of the commodity price boom and invest it in long-term productive potential?' It is pretty interesting to reflect on what the member for Dickson had to say this morning. This is what he had to say about surpluses:Well, I think you have got to, as the Reserve Bank has said, and in actual fact as the Treasurer said in his May budget, you have to preserve an amount of capital post the budget. At the moment in the next year that is projected at just over $20 billion. That's over 1.5 per cent of GDPIt is pretty interesting that the member for Dickson is now saying that we need a surplus of $20 billion, a surplus of 1.5 per cent-plus of GDP. Why are you raiding the surplus to the tune of $6 billion?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question and the good work she does for small business in her area, including the Box Hill Business Enterprise Centre. The Commonwealth, under the Rudd government, has provided funding for the centre for the first time in history. Yesterday's decision by the Reserve Bank to cut the cash rate by a quarter of a percentage point follows 12 successive interest rate rises, 10 of them under the previous coalition government. It will offer modest but welcome relief for small businesses and independent contractors. It is the first time that interest rates have fallen in seven years. In a small way it will therefore reduce the cost of credit for small businesses and contractors. In a small way it might also increase the availability of credit for small businesses and independent contractors, which is pretty important in the global credit crunch.At the time of the change of government late last year, underlying inflation was at a 16-year high and we had the second highest interest rates in the developed world. But the good news is that the Rudd government has a plan to steer Australia through these tough global economic times with responsible economic management. We have built a strong surplus and we are cutting government spending growth from five per cent to one per cent. That is giving small businesses a little bit of extra room to grow as government reduces its call on spending. We are making tough decisions in implementing a comprehensive economic reform program. We are doing that through an education revolution to revive productivity growth, we are doing it though nation building out of the national infrastructure fund and we are doing it through a COAG process of cutting red tape in 27 areas of business regulation.Despite the good news about the interest rate cut yesterday, which will put $600 a year in the pocket of the average mortgage holder in Australia, the Senate is threatening, courtesy of the coalition, to block a tax cut. The first question from the Leader of the Opposition today was about taxes and he is indicating that he likes the idea of reducing taxes. That is what we thought the Liberal Party stood for. He has an opportunity to change the position of the coalition in the Senate because the coalition is threatening tomorrow to block Labor's reduction in tax by increasing the threshold for the Medicare levy surcharge. If the coalition does stand for lower taxes - there is no evidence of that in the past - then it should pass the legislation and not block it.As some of my colleagues have pointed out, a family with two income earners both earning about $60,000 a year - about average earnings - on a combined income of $120,000 will save $1,200 a year as a result of the increased threshold for the Medicare levy surcharge. What good news that would be. That is $600 from the mortgage interest rate reduction and a $1,200 saving if the coalition would just change its mind and support our initiative to increase the threshold.The Rudd government is building a modern economy capable of meeting the challenges of the 21st century. I call on the opposition to get on board with the government's program of responsible economic management or get out of the way in the Senate. Get out of the way and allow the government to secure a strong surplus and to provide another tax cut to the Australian people tomorrow. Help us get interest rates down and lock in those interest rate reductions for the benefit of the small businesses of Australia and the independent contractors of our country.</DOC>

 - No, I cannot confirm any of the numbers used by the member who asked the question, but I can certainly confirm that, by the actions of the opposition in the Senate, you are going to hit two income earners in a household on average earnings something like $1,200 in total by denying them this tax relief, Mr Speaker, and you are going to do that precisely at the time that they have finally got a bit of relief in terms of the Reserve Bank decision to cut interest rates. They are getting the money in one pocket and you are taking it out of the other, Mr Speaker -  - When it comes to discussions with the states and these matters are discussed -  - These matters are discussed with the states via the COAG process, but we do not for a minute accept some of the estimates that are floating around about the impact on the public hospital system that are suggested by the member who asked the question.But I have got a suggestion for those opposite: the former Prime Minister Mr Howard will be in the House tonight and I know they will be lining up to suck up to the former Prime Minister -  -  - I withdraw. Perhaps tonight when they are attending this function -  A government member - Kowtowing! - bowing -  
A government member - Scraping! - scraping -  - Perhaps they would like to ask the former Prime Minister why he left the Medicare surcharge levy at such a low level for so long, because it was never designed to apply to income earners on average incomes. For 12 long years the former Prime Minister and the former Treasurer punished all those average income earners with the surcharge. Now that relief is in sight, what are they going to do? They are going to take it away. They have not got a clue what life is like for people who are living out there under price pressures - not a clue, because if they did they would not be taking this action in the Senate. We stand for providing relief to those on average incomes. We have delivered the tax cuts. There is now some interest rate relief and there was further relief on the way, and they are going to block it. They will pay a very high price for that.</DOC>

 - It is important to be able to answer this question when those opposite are trying to pretend that after 11 years they suddenly care about public hospitals, after pulling a billion dollars out of public hospitals. We have started reinvesting. We have started reinvesting in hospitals, but still the opposition will not support tax relief for hundreds of thousands of Australians. When the Medicare surcharge levy was first introduced, about 165,000 people paid this tax. The member for Higgins has not bothered to be here for the debate today in question time. It may be that he is embarrassed about some of these figures. At the time, the then Treasurer said that he thought that this was a levy that the government hoped no-one was going to have to pay. In fact, when we came to office 465,000 people were paying this tax that the previous government pretended no-one was going to have to pay. We do not make any apologies for providing relief for nearly half a million Australians.When those opposite pretend that there is some science in the figures that were set by the previous government, I thought it might be worth informing the House how these figures were brought about. The Liberals have been saying that there was some science in these figures. They want to pretend that the impact is going to be disastrous in all sorts of areas, so you would have thought from this argument that there was some logic to the $50,000 and $100,000 thresholds. I can inform the House, thanks to some fine investigative journalism by Andrew Tillett and Andrew Probyn, of the logic behind the introduction of the Medicare surcharge levy. In an interview for the West Australian recently, the former health minister Dr Michael Wooldridge explained exactly how these thresholds, which we are hoping to change and are being blocked by the Liberals opposite, were determined. Dr Wooldridge said:I think the numbers in the end were negotiated with Senator Harradine - it was over a bottle of Jameson's whiskey late at night ...That is what I call evidence based policy - obviously no reason to change.But there was more. Dr Wooldridge went on to reveal that the Liberals had not given a moment's thought about the consequences of this levy and those thresholds in 10 years time. Dr Wooldridge said:We were happy to successfully get through 12 months, let alone worry about a problem in 10 years time or more.Fancy that - a Liberal thinking about short-term politics! We are planning and investing for the future, and those opposite are looking at short-term politics. We do not make any apologies for wanting to provide tax relief for half a million Australians, and it is about time that the Liberals got out of the way and let us do it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. As I said before, these matters are all negotiated and discussed at COAG. The government does not for one minute accept the propositions that are put forward by the member opposite. But for the record we have already put an additional $1 billion into state public hospitals, not a bad record compared to your withdrawal of funds - the withdrawal of funds by those opposite over a long period of time.Health is a priority and public hospitals are a priority for those of us on this side of the House. Of course they have never been a priority for those on that side of the House because they are simply stuck in the past and stuck with all of the old approaches, including their commitment to this unfair and unjust Medicare levy threshold surcharge. It is unfair and unjust, and it just shows how out of touch those opposite are if they are going to block this measure in the Senate which would deliver relief to people on average incomes who are doing it tough and need it. Five hundred dollars or $1,000 might not be much to the member for Wentworth, might not be much for the member for North Sydney, but we understand the importance of it, and if there is one thing that the national accounts demonstrate today it is that the people of Australia understand the importance of it. The fact that those opposite did not understand the importance of it is shown by the 10 interest rate rises in a row that hit those working families that you are punishing twice by trying to keep the surcharge.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chifley for his question and I know he is deeply interested in literacy and numeracy in his local schools. As I had the opportunity to advise the House last week, this week is National Literacy and Numeracy Week. It was with great pleasure last week that the Prime Minister and I announced an additional more than $40 million investment in literacy and numeracy pilot programs around the country so we can make sure that we understand what the best of evidence is for the teaching to children of literacy and numeracy.This $40 million worth of pilots in 29 schools is a down payment on a $577 million program for all schools to assist with literacy and numeracy development. -  - I hear the opposition calling out about past government programs, but this is an investment of more than half a billion dollars in literacy and numeracy. Of course, Literacy and Numeracy Week is not just for children in schools. It is for all Australians, and Australian adults can win prizes by answering the question: what are you reading today? I am very happy to answer the question: what am I reading today? Because today I had the great pleasure of going to Chapman Primary School here in the ACT to read to the grade 4 students a children's book called Little Beauty, which is the tale of a gorilla and cat that, despite their differences, learn to live together and to strike up a friendship that endures during troubled times. It is a lesson in life, and I am more than happy to make copies of it available to members of the Liberal Party if they think that they would learn something from it.But of course it is a little bit disappointing that we have not had answers from those opposite about what they are reading today. I am particularly distressed that the member for Higgins, who has such interest in literacy and numeracy, is not here to answer the question: what is he reading today? - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am sure the loyalty of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the member for Higgins will be noted. But it would be nice if the member for Higgins were here to answer the question: is he reading today 'The complete idiot's guide to getting the job you want'? That is one possibility. - I was asked about the reading undertaken by Australian adults and I am answering that question. I would like an answer as to whether -  - If I were to guess what the member for O'Connor was reading, it would just stop with the words 'The complete idiot's guide.' - I withdraw, Mr Speaker. The member for O'Connor is always welcome to come round to my house. I know he is a man who needs friendship and support; I am happy to offer it. The one thing that we know is not being read by the member for Higgins is the program for tonight's tribute dinner, but I am sure it will inevitably include a compulsory reading from Work Choices, the opposition's favourite book.</DOC>

 - The first responsibility of government is to make sure we have a decent public hospital system. And can I say to those opposite: if ever I saw a demolition derby being conducted on the public hospital system of Australia, it is the 12-year history of the Howard government - 12 years of denuding a public hospital system of appropriate funding to manage for its growth. There was at least $1 billion sucked out of the contribution by the Commonwealth to the states for the management of the nation's public hospital system. What this government has done in the nine months since being elected is reinvest $1 billion, $500 million of which has already been delivered, into extra funding for our hospitals, and we are proud of that fact.The second thing that we have done is commit $600 million to a fund to help slash elective surgery waiting lists, to which we have already provided an upfront allocation of $150 million. That is designed to bring about 14,000 extra procedures, which have already been delivered.In terms of senior Australians, we have a plan to introduce the Commonwealth Dental Health system - a scheme which it took the Howard government less than 12 months to abolish when they were in government. So let us get real about this. In the 12-year history of the Howard government, they pulled $1 billion out of public hospitals and, in the nine-month history of this government, we put $1 billion back in. When first elected, it took the Howard government less than 12 months to abolish the Commonwealth Dental Health scheme and, in nine months, we have reintroduced the Commonwealth Dental Health scheme. - I would say to the honourable gentleman who has just intervened that seniors and pensioners use the public hospital system and therefore what they want is a public hospital system which they can get proper access to. When we were recently in the electorate of the honourable member for Kingston, when we had our community cabinet down there, some senior Australians who are finding it very difficult to get elective surgery came to visit me. Our response to that, rather than to perpetuate 12 years of blame game, is to come up to the mark and ask: what can we do to partner with state governments on that? We have provided, for persons such as those in Kingston, a $600 million fund to help slash elective surgery waiting lists - $150 million already to deliver 14,000 extra procedures. That is practical action, concrete action to help Australians, including senior Australians, to deal with their healthcare charges.As to the other part of the question which the honourable member raised, can I go to the future of the Medicare levy surcharge. In 1997 the $50,000 threshold captured the top eight per cent of single-income earners - and there they left it. By 2010 this $50,000 threshold will capture the top 45 per cent of single-income earners. This is basically a huge grab for money on their part. That is what it is about and therefore what we are saying is that we need to look after those middle-income earners of Australia. - I would suggest that, if the Leader of the Opposition is trying to pump up his leadership stakes with this sort of performance on this sort of issue in question time, perhaps he should reserve that for this evening when all those opposite will gather at a function to honour Mr Howard. I know the member for Wentworth will be there with bells on. The member for Wentworth will be doing the tables all evening, I imagine. Someone with a tally sheet will be walking behind him. The only regrettable thing is that the member for Higgins will not be there. - The honourable member for North Sydney obviously does not like an answer which goes to what we are doing for public hospitals and the public healthcare system in Australia. That is of direct relevance to seniors, as is the ability of seniors to access appropriate dental care. That is why we have re-established the Commonwealth Dental Health Program.On the question of this Medicare levy surcharge, as I said, if we left it at the $50,000 threshold, rather than capturing the top eight per cent of income earners, as it did in 1997, by 2010 it would capture the top 45 per cent of income earners. Those opposite are arguing presumably that these represent top income earners in Australia. That is how radically out of touch they have become. Our new threshold of $100,000 for singles and $150,000 for couples will return the figure to around eight per cent by 2010. That was the threshold that you used back in 1997. You left it in place for 12 years. It delivers a financial penalty to many, many Australians and, as a consequence, we are acting. So I would say again to -  - I beg your pardon?An opposition member - He said he was a bureaucrat. - I think there was an adjective used there on the way through - I may have misheard it. I think there was a really interesting adjective used there - but that's life. - Up you come, Joe. Come on, Joe. - The critical issue here is that, if you are dealing with the health needs of senior Australians, your first responsibility is to make sure you get a properly funded public hospital system. Your second responsibility is to ensure that you re-establish the Commonwealth Dental Health Program - something which those opposite abolished a decade ago. We have done that. We have done it in nine months. We are proud of our record on this and we are proud of the fact that we intend to deliver this advantage to middle-income earners through the action we propose in the Senate. Again I challenge those opposite. On the day after we have had one modest interest rate cut, which affects so many working families across Australia, they are contemplating opposing a measure in the Senate which will, for income earners of the type I described before, lead to a further $1,200 a year hike. I would say to those opposite that, if they are concerned about families under financial pressure, they should act in the Senate and act appropriately in defence of the interests of those working families under financial pressure.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. I know he has a strong interest in these issues. The government is relying on the best local and international expertise to inform its action on water management in the face of climate change. We have considered reports from the International Panel on Climate Change, CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology - the experts from Australian and overseas institutions who consider and report on these matters. We have seen the lowest inflows in history into the Murray River in the two years leading up to November 2007, when the Liberal Party were in government, which was 43 per cent lower than previous historic lows. The more recent CSIRO sustainable yield project has found that actual inflows over the last 10 years, in five out of the eight southern Murray-Darling Basin catchment areas, are close to or worse than the worst case projections for climate change for 2030. The message has been consistent for many years. In 2002 the Australian Greenhouse Office noted:The regions already affected by reductions in rainfall and streamflow, mainly due to natural climate variability, would be placed under even more stress by further decline in rainfall as a consequence of global warming.So there is a very, very sound body of evidence that has accumulated over many years, and it indicates that climate change is having, and will continue to have, an impact on rainfall in the Murray-Darling Basin and in southern Australia.Despite these clear advices, on this question we now have the Leader of the Opposition claiming that recent above average national rainfall is proof positive that climate change impacts in the Murray-Darling Basin are not real. The Leader of the Opposition confirmed this view on ABC radio Adelaide today when he referred to the annual Australian climate statement of 2007:Climate change and the changes in temperature in recent years and the people who argue about it arguably have made and do make a contribution to it ... but it is not the cause of what we have got at the moment.That is what he said. He went on to say:In fact I notice the Australian climate statement from the meteorologists points out that average annual mean rainfall has been slightly more than average recently - 25 millimetres.The very same statement that the Leader of the Opposition quoted from also notes that south-east Australia has now missed out on the equivalent of an average year's rainfall over the past 11 years. In other words, there has been less rainfall in the south. But it seems that the opposition's position now is: it is raining in the tropical north; therefore, climate change has had no effect on the Murray-Darling Basin in the south. This is a policy detour that takes us through the efforts of Sir Joh. With slightly more rain in the north, and record low rain in the south, we have got the Leader of the Opposition channelling Sir Joh and gerrymandering rainfall down to the southern basin.Mr Speaker, I ask you: when will the Leader of the Opposition stop appropriating unrelated rainfall figures to assert that the Murray-Darling is unaffected by climate change? On Lateline on Monday night the Leader of the Opposition had two positions in two minutes. Today he was given the opportunity to clarify his remarks, and the only answer he had to this very serious problem was to gerrymander Australia's rainfall. I ask the opposition leader where he is getting his advice from on climate change. He will not take the advice of the CSIRO. He will not take the advice of the Bureau of Meteorology. He does not believe the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. I suspect he is taking his advice from climate change sceptics in his own party. It is time that the opposition leader stop denying dangerous climate change. - Yes. - Yes.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member's question I would say two things. Which government committed funding and has actually used that funding to buy back water entitlements for the Murray-Darling? The Australian Labor government. Which government in its 12 years in office refused to spend a single dollar to buy back a single gigalitre of water entitlement? The Australian Liberal government. There is a classic contrast here between action in nine months and inaction over 12 years.But I go back to my second point. You cannot deal effectively with the challenge of the Murray-Darling if underpinning your entire approach is the deeply ingrained climate change scepticism of the Leader of the Opposition. When I read the transcript - because I did not watch it - of the Leader of the Opposition's performance on Lateline the night before last, where in response to questioning he disputed absolutely and uncategorically any relationship between the problems of water in the Murray-Darling system and climate change, the conclusion that we had to reach is that those opposite, even having been through the experience of the last election, just do not get it on climate change.I said to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday that there are at least three sets of scientific reports - from the Bureau of Meteorology, from the IPCC and from the CSIRO - that go through the linkage between climate change and water inflow into the Murray-Darling system. Presumably, the Leader of the Opposition personally knows better than any of those individual institutions. Well, we on this side of the House have a different view: you accept the science and you work within the science. That is the first thing. The second thing is: when it comes to an overallocated system, which is the Murray-Darling system, rather than just dreaming about it, what you do is you act and actually spend money to buy back entitlements, which is what we have done more of in nine months than those opposite did in 12 years. Thirdly, what you do is also bring about practical assistance measures to assist those in the lower lakes area. In nine months, practical action from this government; in 12 years, a litany of inaction by those opposite. The contrast is clear.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. Today is a special day in our history: it is the first official proclamation day with respect to the Battle for Australia. It is a time when the parliament and the people can unite to consider the question of what our country went through so many years ago in the dark days of 1942 and 1943. I know that the Prime Minister went to the Australian War Memorial today, and I believe the opposition leader did so as well, to commemorate this occasion, and the shadow minister went to the service in Sydney. The reason that I am late for question time - although I am sure that no-one really cares - is the fact that I was at the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne at what was a very special ceremony that was attended by several thousand children and representatives right across the board. It was an occasion befitting the importance of this occasion in terms of our history.The circumstances of what we faced as a nation at that time were in fact very dire. The then Prime Minister, John Curtin, said after the fall of Singapore: 'The fall of Singapore opens the battle for Australia,' and, within days, Darwin was bombed for the first time - which I know is an event that is very important to the member for Solomon and the people of Darwin. Northern Australia was subsequently bombed some 70 times. The people of Australia - seven million people at that stage - were overwhelmingly united in a war effort that encompassed both the military and the civilian aspects of our society. If you were not in uniform, you were working to support those who were in uniform. Nearly one million Australians were actually in uniform at that time all over the world and, in particular, defending our nation on its northern extremes.There has been quite a bit of debate about the nature of the Battle for Australia. Does it really constitute a battle? Does it really meet the definition? It has been an issue that some historians have tried to wax lyrical about in recent times. I would like to address a couple of issues on this occasion. One argument is that it was not a battle because it was a series of battles. History tells us that that is not the way that we define these things in historical terms. The Battle of the Atlantic was in fact a range of engagements. The Battle of Britain went over a considerable period of time. Battles and their historical locations in history and their significance are not normally determined just by geography or time.Beyond that, an argument that has been put and argued strongly by some is that there were no invasion plans and therefore there was no invasion or any invasion that was likely. History tells us that the success that occurs on the military field determines what opportunities are presented and developed. The fact is that, because Australian and Allied forces fought hard and defended this country and its environs well at places like the Coral Sea, the Kokoda Track, Milne Bay and elsewhere in the islands, the plans of the Japanese were not achieved. The circumstances to which they might have turned their minds to achieve did not happen.We can be very proud of what our forebears did so many years ago. We should recognise their courage and sacrifice at a time when the nation really needed it. We could also say - and this is my view - that this is something that encapsulates what occurred in World War II. It does not detract from the many Australians who fought the Germans in Bomber Command or in North Africa, Greece or Crete. It is, if you like, representative of the major commitment that we had as a nation at a time when we needed to have it. I urge everyone to get behind Battle for Australia Day in the future. I say to all of you that the commemorations that I was at today, and what I have seen of other commemorations that occurred today, are a credit to all those involved.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to receive this question, because the bank-switching package that we are putting in place is the first time there has ever been a bank-switching package. Those opposite could not find it within their hearts to put in place a bank-switching package for 12 long years. We are working with the banks and the Reserve Bank to put in place a bank-switching package which will be fully operational by November.For the first time, banks will be compelled to participate. This is a huge advance because, in the past, people have been trapped. They have not been able to easily move their transaction accounts, and the capacity to move their transaction accounts is a very important power to have if we want to have a competitive banking sector. When you want to move, the capacity to access your credits and your debits from your bank is very important because so much of the household budget is tied up -  - This is a very important measure and yet another example of how those opposite do not understand how important competition is and how much saving a few dollars can really matter to families. But, in the case of mortgages, it can be a lot more than a few dollars. Customers have to have the capacity to shift their account. They have not had the capacity to easily do it up until now. Banks will be compelled for the first time to provide all of those details and facilitate the opportunity for a customer to move their account.The member asked about exit fees. Did those opposite ever do anything about exit fees? No. Did they ever once mention the phrase 'exit fees'? No. What we have done is we have had the whole question looked at by ASIC. We have for the first time got a handle on what is actually happening with exit fees. As a consequence, we are now getting a new product on the market which does not have exit fees. That is something that never happened under those opposite. Banks will now be compelled to provide for their customers all of the details so that people can easily move their transaction accounts.Furthermore, if banks do not participate according to the code that they have signed up to, they will be liable for compensation - the first time that has ever happened - through the Financial Ombudsman Service. We will bring the full power of competition to bear so that customers can more easily move their accounts - something that never happened when those opposite were on the treasury benches.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question and note his very strong interest in aged care. Given that Australians now have the world's second longest life expectancy after the Japanese, I am sure that most members of this chamber would agree that our longevity is to be celebrated. Indeed, it is one of the major challenges facing Australia in the 21st century. That is why the Australian government is investing more than $40 billion in aged and community care over the next four years. A record $28.6 billion of that is going directly to our nation's nursing homes. In short, no Australian government has invested more in aged and community care than the Rudd Labor government.This government is committed to working in partnership with older Australians, aged-care providers, unions and consumer groups to improve quality in residential aged care. Members will be aware that the new aged-care funding system came into effect on 20 March, and indeed it had bipartisan support. At that time we said we would examine the new system after we had an appropriate sample size. Access Economics have now analysed 33,000 claims. Their initial analysis found that on average the subsidy rates were higher than they would have been under the previous model. In fact, the returns, on average, were almost three per cent higher. We will honour our commitment to monitor and review the funding model after 18 months.Those on the other side of the chamber are always talking down the aged-care sector - always. But the fact is that we have a healthy and confident aged-care sector with a very strong future. Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on building approvals in aged care present a very optimistic picture. Building approvals in the aged-care sector are reaching record levels, with substantial investment. For the June 2008 quarter there was investment of $302 million in projects compared with $250 million for the same period last year. That is a 20.8 per cent increase in aged-care building approvals. This construction activity is underpinned by the strong growth in the aged-care sector last year. The just released independent Bentleys MRI/James Underwood &amp; Associates National Residential Aged Care Survey found that earnings had increased in all three areas of residential services - high care, low care and merged services. It found that returns were positive, regardless of their resident mix or type of service.The overwhelming majority of aged-care providers in Australia are providing top-quality care for our nation's elderly. In every state and territory I have seen world-class facilities and they are backed by hardworking, dedicated staff. The government are committed to tackling the challenges of the 21st century, including our ageing population.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition not only for the question but for the concern he has expressed over our soldiers and the bipartisan support we constantly receive from the opposition on matters operational, particularly in Afghanistan. Yesterday the Prime Minister confirmed that on Tuesday night, our time, nine Australian special forces soldiers were wounded while on operations in Afghanistan. The question from the Leader of the Opposition gives me an opportunity to provide the House with an update on their condition and their progress.I am pleased to be able to say that our most critically wounded soldier made it through the night and has been sufficiently stabilised for transport to Germany, where he will receive the sort of expert care suitable for his needs. However, he is not out of danger, and I ask all members and indeed all Australians to keep him in their thoughts and in their prayers. I can also report that overnight the number of soldiers on the serious list fell from five to three, so that is more slightly good news. Those three soldiers remain in a serious condition, however. They have been stabilised and remain under care in coalition medical facilities in Afghanistan. The remaining five soldiers are in the hands of those who provide excellent care on base in Tarin Kowt.The incident which led to these casualties is a reminder of the dangers faced by the men and women of the ADF on a daily basis. They put their lives on the line for others, for all of us. Their work is critical to global security and indeed to Australia's own security, and of course they fight for a better deal for the Afghan people at the request of the democratically elected government of Afghanistan. The work of our troops there is diverse. They are taking the fight to those who want to take Afghanistan back to the dark days of the Taliban regime and those who want to continue to use the country as a breeding ground for terrorists who seek to perpetrate their acts of terror right around the globe, including in our own backyard. Our Reconstruction Task Force continues to build social and economic infrastructure - hospitals, schools, roads and bridges.The events of Tuesday night remind us that Afghanistan remains a dangerous place and that the challenges to the global community there remain enormous. But we must continue to meet those challenges, and we will. I know that is what the six soldiers we have lost in Afghanistan would want us to do, and I am confident that all those who have served in Afghanistan, including those many who have been wounded there, would want us to do that. They know how important our work there is.I conclude by thanking all of them for their service and their sacrifices and by reassuring them and their families that the Australian people are a very grateful people for the work they do. I also thank in particular the families, including those loved ones who are nervously awaiting the next update on the condition of those injured on Tuesday night. Their sacrifices are also enormous, and too often the emotional pain they feel can be excruciating. Again, I ask all members and indeed the broader Australian community to keep those who are currently under care both in their thoughts and, of course, in their prayers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Overnight it was confirmed that the economy of the 15 euro zone nations shrank by 0.2 per cent in the June quarter of 2008. It was the first quarter-on-quarter decline since the data series for the euro zone commenced being collated back in 1995. As the House would know, this comes off the back of negative or zero quarter growth among five of the world's largest economies: Japan, a 0.6 decline; Germany, 0.5; France, 0.3; Italy, 0.3; and the UK, zero.By contrast, what we had from the national accounts figures yesterday for Australia was solid growth of 0.3 per cent during the June quarter, 2.7 per cent year on year. As Chris Richardson, of Access Economics, said today, I think, or perhaps it was yesterday:I think it will be a better balance for the economy; business spending up a storm is good news,Â _That shows business is confident about the future and putting their money where their mouth is, and that is better for future growth.I note what CommSec equities economist Savanth Sebastian has said:Australia has delivered another fantastic economic report card given the economic conditions on the global front.What I would say, rather than use those terms, is that Australia is not out of the woods yet. We have a lot of work to do. It is important to be upfront with the Australian people about how difficult the challenges are, particularly off the back of continuing global economic difficulties and off the back of the domestic economic circumstances which the government inherited at the end of last year.Those circumstances, of course, were difficult. As the House has heard many times this week, if the economy has been buffeted by 10 interest rate rises in a row, it does have a cumulative effect on economic confidence and activity. That is just a fact. And if you translate that through, the impact of those 10 interest rate rises in a row for working families was a $400-a-month interest rate hike. That is what it represented - real money in the pocket. That is the cumulative impact of 10 interest rate rises in a row under the Liberals, delivering us, by the time the government changed at the end of last year, the second-highest interest rates in the developed world.The question asked why responsible economic management was necessary, given the challenges which lie ahead. The global factors are those which we have addressed in the parliament during this week, and we are not out of the woods yet in terms of the roll-on impact of the global financial crisis. The local factors are those just described, but the impact which that continues to have on confidence in the economy, the confidence of business and the confidence of consumers is real. The key challenge, however, is to deliver a responsible program of action. And what we have done on that score is that we have embarked upon a strategy which, first and foremost, delivers responsible economic management of a $22 billion budget surplus, which is now under assault, by those opposite, in the Senate - $22 billion on which they are seeking to conduct a $6 billion to $7 billion raid in the Senate. That is the first plank of responsible economic management.The second is to have a clear-cut national program of economic reform, and that is what the government has embarked upon in terms of the challenges of education, skills and training, to address the skills crisis and skills shortage delivered to this economy by those opposite, having ignored 20 consecutive Reserve Bank warnings. As a consequence of that, the government has embarked upon an education revolution. The Minister for Education, the Deputy Prime Minister, and I have been speaking to that and, most recently, announced the quality education reform agenda, which will be part and parcel of that, to boost the quality of our school education, to boost the quality of our teachers, and to produce an increase in the quality of our education, skills and training outcomes.The third element of our response, of course, is a program of nation building - a $76 billion plan for nation building, which those opposite, again, seem to wish to undermine. And finally, part of our program of responsible economic management - to ensure that those opposite are fully mindful of it - is to ensure that, through the budget, through tax cuts and through what we have done by way of additional payments to pensioners and carers, we are assisting working families, pensioners and carers on the way through.What I would say to those opposite as we come to the end of the sitting fortnight is to reflect carefully on the impact of their actions in the Senate on this overall economic strategy, because this $6 billion raid on the surplus in the Senate being waged by those opposite is the very definition of economic irresponsibility. We had volume 1Â½ last night and this morning - depending on who was counting the votes in the Senate last night and who showed up for the vote, and who might have showed up this morning. It is interesting that the Liberals were too busy at their fun-fest over here in the Great Hall of the people to actually make sure that people were going to roll up and vote in the Senate, so committed were they to their course of action.But, on the luxury car tax, I think it is remarkable that, in the first defining vote of the new Senate on a major tax measure before the parliament and the nation, the Liberal Party stands up and says: 'We the Liberal Party - this party with its eye fixed firmly on the past - are going to say that our first legislative action is to ensure that you can get a cheaper luxury car.' That is what they have done: they have voted for a cheaper luxury car for Australia - saying everything, I believe, about the priorities of those opposite, and how they bleat. - Well, Joe: $555 million, which you have chosen to provide to the Porsche drivers of Australia, as opposed to $555 million for the public transport needs of Australia; $555 million for Porsches and $555 million less for public transport; $555 million for Rolls-Royces and $555 million less for urban rail - those are the priorities which those opposite have embraced.Whether it is the luxury car tax or the Medicare levy surcharge - and let us go to this other element of the in-touch Liberal Party of the 21st century. Here we are in this week, where, for the first time in seven years, we have had an interest rate cut for working families, for those who have suffered those 10 interest rate rises in a row, and those working families, depending on the size of their mortgage, being benefited to the tune of $600 a year, on the basis of that 25 basis point cut. In the same week that working families get a $600 interest rate cut, the Liberal Party of Australia says that they are going to vote for a $1,200-a-year hike in terms of their taxes, through the measures that they are taking on the Medicare levy surcharge. So the Reserve Bank brings down, for the first time in seven years, an interest rate cut to save working families $600 a year, and the Liberal Party says, 'We are going to reward you by giving them a $1,200 tax hike this year.' - The question I was asked was about responsible economic management, and I could not think of a more irresponsible course of action than theirs in the Senate - and that is why they are so sensitive about it, because they have voted to save Porsche drivers $555 million and not spend that $555 million on public transport. That is why they are so sensitive about it. - The Liberal Party have become so leaderless and have so lost their way - as the member for Wentworth, who looks at me with surprised and open eyes, knows full well -  - Plan C, as the Treasurer interjects. The leaderless Liberal Party have so lost their way that they think the right thing to do for Australia is to provide luxury car buyers with a tax cut and take that $555 million away from public transport. On the Medicare levy surcharge, they think the right thing to do -  -  - I notice that certain Liberals were so bored last night that they did not bother showing up to vote, but that is a different matter altogether.So we have, where the Liberals now stand on the question of the Medicare levy surcharge, a $1,200 tax hit on working families. We know where they now stand on the question of luxury car tax - that is, half a billion dollars for the Porsche drivers but not for those using public transport. We know where they now stand on RTDs - backing the big distillery companies. We know where they now stand on Fuelwatch - backing the big oil companies. We know where they now stand on GROCERYchoice - backing the big supermarket chains - and on the Medicare levy surcharge - backing the big private health insurance companies. It is about time that the Liberal Party stood up for working families instead.We have a clear plan of action, a responsible course of action for the future. I would say to those opposite: why don't you allow working families to get a decent outcome from the votes in the Senate - most particularly on what is happening with the Medicare levy surcharge - and a decent outcome for those who are crying out for action by the national government on urban transport? The leaderless Liberal Party of today has lost its way when it comes to providing any leadership for working families.</DOC>

 - I certainly do welcome this question, because we have another day and another position from the member for Wentworth. This is what he had to say in a press statement issued yesterday. The lead par reads:Today's National Accounts shows the resilience of the Australian economy _But he wants to come in here all the time and talk it down. And, of course, in the Senate today we have seen the Liberal Party try to blow a further hole in the surplus, showing very clearly where they stand. They stand for people who are buying luxury cars. They stand for lower taxes on luxury cars. They do not stand for working families who need lower interest rates. - There is an issue to do with confidence -  - Ten interest rate rises in a row -  - Consumer confidence around the world has hit record lows because of what has occurred in international financial markets. But those opposite want to pretend that, if they were still in government, the international financial credit crunch would not have happened. Indeed, that is what the member for Higgins said only a week ago. He wants people to believe that he could have controlled international credit markets, when he cannot even get a job in one. We have seen the colours of those on the other side of the chamber in the Senate, with their attack on the surplus. We have seen the philosophy of the Leader of the Opposition. It has been laid out in the Senate. They stand for big oil, fast cars and Bacardi Breezers. It is now clear the Liberal Party is being led by Robbie Williams.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, because we do need a very strong surplus in these times of international economic turmoil. International uncertainty demands that we have a strong surplus as a buffer against that global turmoil and also to ensure that the Reserve Bank has room to move when it comes to interest rates and also to put in place critical investments for the future. Of course, the plans that those opposite have to blow a hole in the surplus of $6.2 billion are now well advanced with their actions in the Senate today.We saw how confused they are on the economy yesterday when they could not even organise a raid on the surplus. They could not do that competently yesterday, but today they have rejected the increase in the luxury car tax. In so doing, they have indicated, as the Prime Minister said before, where their priorities lie. Their priorities lie in lower taxes for people who buy luxury cars. That is where their priorities lie. That is where the member for Wentworth's priorities lie. Their prioritiesÂ  do not lie in lower interest rates for working families. They lie with big oil and they lie with people buying luxury cars. They do not lie with those people who are suffering under the Medicare surcharge levy. They certainly do not lie with working families. They are doing their best to ensure that the rate cut that working families receive this week may not necessarily be put in place again. The Liberal Party's determination to blow a hole in the surplus simply means that interest rates will be higher for longer. That is the consequence of their action in the Senate. Those people opposite stand for higher interest rates and slower growth and their actions in the Senate have demonstrated that.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. I note before she was interjecting, 'I know nothing.' Never a truer word was spoken in this parliament. - I will explain to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition -  - I will. Let me explain it to you because you need to understand something about the workplace relations system. Let me explain to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition what has happened with the workplace relations system. People saw an avalanche or a tidal wave of extreme industrial relations legislation coming under the former government. Knowing that that extreme legislation was going to be put in place, people rushed to lock in their collective agreements before it took effect. As a result, many collective agreements were locked in at the same time and those collective agreements are now coming up for rebargaining. That bulge of numbers is the logical consequence of people seeking to beat the industrial relations extremism of the former government. - Thank you very much. Let me further explain this matter to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The figures clearly show that there are more collective agreements coming up for renegotiation as a result of this lock-in before Work Choices. Listen to the figures. The number of expiring collective agreements in the first half of 2007 was 1,676. The number of expiring collective agreements in the first half of this year is 4,948. Obviously that is a huge lift in the number of collective agreements expiring in this six months and coming up for rebargaining. -  - To further explain these figures, during 2008, we anticipate that a total of 8,239 collective agreements covering more than 770,000 employees will expire and come up for rebargaining. - In total, this is 43 per cent of the 18,985 federal agreements current as at 31 December 2007. - To further explain to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition something she clearly does not understand, when collective agreements expire there is a period of bargaining. Even under the extremism of Work Choices, during a period of bargaining -  - When agreements expire, even under Work Choices people can engage in protected industrial action as part of the bargaining system. Therefore, the more collective agreements expiring in a time period, the more likely it is that there are people taking protected industrial action.The member for Dickson then left the chamber. - I again make this simple point because, obviously with the level of disruption from the member for Dickson, I do not believe it was heard: the more collective agreements that are coming up for rebargaining in a period, the more protected industrial action that may be occurring in that period, because the only time in which protected industrial action can be taken is when people are rebargaining for a new agreement. Obviously, you are seeing the evidence of that in the number of collective agreements coming up for rebargaining in the figures. I say to the opposition that under Work Choices you could have protected industrial action. - As I was saying, under Work Choices you could take protected industrial action during a bargaining period. I do not know what is being suggested by the opposition here, but I take it that they have in contemplation a workplace relations system even more extreme than Work Choices. Presumably, under that system anybody who took protected action during a bargaining period would somehow be, what, shot? Is that what you want? - Presumably, we can conclude that, yet again, the opposition stands for something more extreme than Work Choices. These figures show a clustering effect of the number of collective agreements coming up for rebargaining. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition spent five minutes analysing the issue, she would understand that. Of course, she is incapable of it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question and for his acknowledgement that nation-building infrastructure is critical for his electorate, and, indeed, that is why it is at the heart of the Rudd government's economic reforms. If you actually listened to those opposite and their attitudes towards infrastructure and towards the budget surplus and if you analysed what they did in the Senate, you would think that they had no regard at all for infrastructure. We have heard allegations that these funds are not real, that they are not important and that it does not matter whether we make that long-term infrastructure investment. But, whilst they say that through their spokespeople in the parliament and whilst they act on that in the Senate by undermining the budget surplus, what they do as local members is very different. I have a folder here with 103 submissions from many of the members of the opposition frontbench. Thirty-five coalition MPs have made submissions to me about infrastructure spending - more than half of their frontbench. That indeed is what you would expect local members to do about infrastructure. Many members on this side of the House are also making submissions about infrastructure spending. -  - I am asked to give some examples. You will be pleased that I am not going to go through all 103, but -  - I have a letter from the member for Groom. The member for Groom asks for $700 million as the first step in a multibillion dollar project. I wonder what this project is. Well, the member for Groom has been keen on this project for some time because he promised it in his first speech. - The member for Groom mentioned this in 1998 - and you can all look on the website because first speeches are easy to find - and he promised that it would be finished by 2005. That was in his first speech, but he did nothing while he was a senior cabinet minister. He waited for the Rudd government to come to office and then he wrote me a letter. Congratulations! And I table the letter. But there is more. The member for Flinders wrote to me supporting the creation of a community infrastructure fund and put forward seven pages of projects worth $266.92 million. But there is more -  - You just be patient. -  - The more trouble that they are in, the louder they yell. - I got a letter from the member for Paterson asking for $20 million -  - He has now upped it to a billion. The member for Paterson asked for $20 million 'to fund coalition election commitments'. That is a beauty! - Those requests are from long-term members who could have acted on this in government. But you do not have to be around for a long time to ask for money from our long-term infrastructure fund. The member for Gippsland, who has sat in this House for seven days, wants $140 million - $20 million a day. That is his sitting fee! That is the National Party for you. That is an extraordinary effort. But we know - An opposition member - What is your point, Albo? - You will get the point; it is coming, Sunshine! The fact is that for 12 long years - and indeed since the election, so for almost 13 years - we have heard those opposite say, 'Public transport is solely a state responsibility; it has nothing to do with us.' There was no engagement with urban policy and no engagement with cities. We heard it for 12 years - no engagement with public transport. And yet the member for Cowan has written asking for funding for a mass transit solution for Perth's northern suburbs. He asks for funding for buses, for light rail and for rail. Not just that - remember how day after day they said the BAF did not matter and Infrastructure Australia did not matter? Well, they are not just asking; they are pleading. I will read from the member for Cowan's letter. It states, 'As federal transport minister I implore you to support this proposal through funding from the Infrastructure Australia Fund.' Imploring! - What we see from the coalition is that in one chamber - the Senate - they are voting against our surplus, voting to reduce the amount of funds that can be used on the Building Australia Fund, and in this House member after member is asking - pleading - for expenditure from the Building Australia Fund. In one chamber they knock it down and in the other they plead for funding. Well, they cannot have it both ways. The total funding requests in this folder are a conservative $6.9 billion. That is what they are asking for. But in the other chamber they are ripping out $6.2 billion.What they need to do is to put the principles that they espouse in this correspondence and the principles that they talk about in their electorates about the importance of infrastructure funding into practice and vote for our measures, vote for the surplus, and support the government's long-term infrastructure agenda.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. The truth is that working families, pensioners and carers are experiencing great challenges when it comes to cost-of-living pressures. That is the absolute truth. What in practical terms do you do about it? I say this to the member for Hume: what you do not do about it is bring about a set of economic conditions which make it easier for the Reserve Bank to continue to put up interest rates. If you look at the cumulative impact of 10 interest rate rises in a row, what you have is the Liberal's $400 a month interest rate hike that was imposed on working families. That is what those 10 interest rate rises in a row led to.Our response is responsible economic management, which makes it easier for the Reserve Bank to act to bring interest rates down. That is what we have done in the nine months that we have been in office, as demonstrated through the budget that we put through this parliament in May and that was announced by the Treasurer, and which is now, in substantial measure, being threatened in the Senate by the party of those opposite. That is a clear-cut course of action.The second thing that you can do to assist working families under financial pressure is to honour your pre-election commitments on tax cuts, which is what we have done with a $44 billion package to reduce taxes for low- and middle-income earners. The third thing you can do, in practical terms, is to assist families dealing with the cost of child care, which is why we took a commitment to the Australian people to increase the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent - and that was honoured as of 1 July this year. These are practical measures which assist working families balance the budget, given that they are under enormous cost-of-living pressures.I tell you what does not help the challenges faced by working families: the action of the Senate - which I presume the member for Hume is supporting through his party in the Senate - to vote against the government's measures on the Medicare levy surcharge. If you look at the maths of that and how it flows through to families, for a family on a combined family income of, say, $120,000 a year, the measure we are putting forward would save that family $1,200 year - and that means something in the order of $20-plus a week. I would suggest to the honourable member for Hume that that is a practical measure, again, where he could help working families under financial pressure.These are the practical actions which a government committed to dealing with these challenges have advocated. I would strongly say to the honourable member: get with the government's program in the Senate - get in particular with the matter which is yet to be voted on, the Medicare levy surcharge, because that is a real potential hit on working families who continue to do it tough in Australia.</DOC>

 - Of course the government are committed to an education revolution and we are doing that because we want every child in this country to have a world-class education. I know the members of the opposition are in a sour mood today, because last night they had their big shindig - listening to Memories, The Carnival is Over and Yesterday while having glasses of red wine - and this morning they have woken up a little sore in the head and with a sour taste in their mouths, but if they could just try and concentrate for one moment. While they are living in the past, we are committed to making sure that the children of this country get a first-class education in the future. We are committed to overcoming the neglect of more than a decade of the former government - six years of it under the personal administration of the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. For a reason best known to themselves, they are all pretending to be characters from Fawlty Towers today. They picked the wrong show; it should have been Seinfeld - a show about nothing! They all would have fitted into that because they did nothing in government.Let me tell you, Mr Speaker: the Howard government released 24 reports on teaching and 76 on school education and it did nothing of substance to make a difference to the quality of education in Australian schools. The Rudd Labor government are getting on with the job of investing in Australian education - our $1.2 billion digital education revolution, our $2.5 billion investment in trades training centres in schools, our $577 million investment in literacy and numeracy, our $534 million investment in early childhood education and our $500 million we have already delivered to Australian universities to help them renew their ageing capital stock because they were bearing the burden of a decade of neglect, six years of it under the personal watch of the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.But we want to do more and, in doing more, we have created the Education Investment Fund, an $11 billion fund to renew the capital stock of our universities and our vocational education and training sector. I am asked about the risks to this new fund. The risk to this new fund is the smash-and-grab raid that the Liberal Party has engaged in on the surplus. In pursuit of luxury cars, they are putting at risk our ability to invest in our educational institutions, particularly vocational and higher education institutions. - I hear the member for O'Connor yelling out, and I can inform the member for O'Connor that this fund, in operation, would be able to benefit the University of Western Australia, which has a campus in Albany in his electorate. It would be able to benefit the Curtin University of Technology campus in Geraldton. Presumably, he does not want to see these campuses benefit and that is why he is supporting the smash-and-grab raid on the surplus. - I hear the shadow minister for education also calling out. He has a campus of Swinburne University and TAFE at Lilydale in his electorate. The smash-and-grab raid his political party is engaging in on the surplus -  - That was the interjection you made before. The Education Investment Fund, you might not have noticed, is an $11 billion investment in education. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am pleased to see that, in opposition, the member for Warringah has finally found a copy of the standing orders - something he neglected for all those years in government. He never had one before, so something has improved in his life during the last few months. We want to see investments in universities -  -  - Thank you very much. Now they are calling each other irrelevant. That is amazing. We want to invest in universities and vocational education and training around this country. The risk to that is the Liberal Party's smash-and-grab raid on the surplus. I say to the Liberal Party: if they are going to continue on this smash-and-grab raid, they should have the decency to ring every vice chancellor and every TAFE director to explain to them why they do not believe their campuses are worth investing in. That is what they are putting at risk by their conduct.</DOC>

 - Again the Leader of the Opposition puts a question to the parliament based on an entirely false premise - that taxes have increased under this government as a proportion of gross domestic product. The only effective measure of the tax impact on the economy is tax as a proportion of GDP, and tax as a proportion of GDP has gone down this year relative to last year, relative to the year before that, relative to the year before that and relative to the year before that as well. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition study his statistics and work it out.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. Today we have seen the first instalment of the Liberal Party's smash-and-grab raid on the government's surplus in the Senate after bungling it yesterday. That first instalment is highly symbolic, because the Liberal Party are seeking to relieve the tax burden on the purchases of Porsches, Lamborghinis, Ferraris and other such vital modes of transport for ordinary working people. At the same time as they are seeking to relieve the tax burden for purchases of such vehicles, they are also seeking to keep the tax burden for middle-income working families arising from the Medicare levy surcharge - something in the vicinity of $1,000 plus, which the government is seeking to remove and they are seeking to retain. In effect, their message to these working families in that middle- to upper middle-income bracket is: 'Don't worry; it's okay. We will allow you to get a tax break on your next Ferrari or your next Lamborghini.' While they will still have to suffer the Medicare levy surcharge, if they are out buying a Lamborghini, a Ferrari or a Rolls-Royce they will be okay.It is interesting that the member for Hume today had the gall to ask a question about battlers selling cars on the side of the road. It appears to me to be rather odd that the policy response from the Liberal Party on the cost-of-living challenges facing working people - the first big policy position they put forward in this parliament - is to cut the taxes on luxury cars like Ferraris and Lamborghinis. - It is good to see, finally, that the opposition have a policy with respect to the cost of living. It is: 'Let them drive Ferraris!' Given the shambolic performance of the Liberal Party yesterday and the fact that their positions on what they are going to do in the Senate, and indeed on their leadership, have moved around over the past few months, we can be forgiven for not being entirely sure about how this is all going to unfold. I would urge the opposition again to rethink their position. We could actually get a change of heart. But we know that one thing will not change with the Liberal Party, and that is that their core priority is to stand up for the interests of high-income, wealthy Australians.We do not know who their leader is going to be. We have seen over the past few months the member for Higgins appear on the horizon as a would-be saviour for the Liberal Party. You can see them huddled in corridors around parliament discussing this - the Messiah is potentially on the horizon for the Liberal Party. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am concerned about the future behaviour of the Liberal Party in the Senate and the prospect of a leadership change. We have seen over the past month or two, courtesy of the member for Higgins, the longest striptease in Australian history. It is a very peculiar striptease. - I have come into possession of the member for Higgins's budget report to his electorate. - I just want to draw attention to one particular point in this newsletter -  - I will table it too, if you like. The first item of attack on the government is to criticise the government for failing to deliver the coalition's tax cuts to high-income people on the highest tax rate, above $180,000 a year. - Not yet. - Yet again, this indicates the true priorities of the Liberal Party. It does not matter whether they change jockeys; the horses will still be the same -  - I table the document.</DOC>

 - I might begin my answer with a continuation of what I thought was a first-class presentation from the finance minister. I will tell you what we were not prepared to commit to in any element of tax reform and that was providing a tax break for those highest income earners in Australia. The minister for finance was absolutely right: how those opposite could have gone to the election last year promising, from memory, $3 billion to $4 billion in tax cuts for those Australians earning north of $180,000 a year strikes me as passing strange.The honourable member asked this other question about what other tax measures we have introduced to provide tax relief to working families. I tell you what else we are introducing: it is called the education tax refund. For the first time in this country's history, we are providing -  - The question was about tax and what the government has done on tax. We have been absolutely clear cut about honouring our commitments for tax cuts - some $44 billion of them - for low- and middle-income earners.Secondly, we have been absolutely clear cut that, when it comes to the use of additional public revenues, we do not believe - as those opposite believe - that Porsche drivers need further income tax relief. Those opposite are about to give them a tax break in terms of the luxury car tax. But do those north of 180 grand need an extra $3 billion to $4 billion? I would have thought not. Therefore, what we did with that money - and I say this to the member for Wentworth - is we said to working families, 'If you are spending money on your kids' education in primary school and high school, you should keep those receipts and then, at the end of the financial year, we will provide you with a tax refund at different levels for both primary school and secondary school students.' It is $750 a year for primary school students and $1,500 a year for secondary school students.That is a measure which, from memory, cost something in the vicinity of $3 billion to $4 billion. We believe that is a very significant measure. For example, if those at home wish to add to the digital revolution occurring in the classrooms of Australia, as a consequence of the policies of the government, by assisting with their kids buying a home computer and getting internet connections at home, that becomes a tax deductible expense for the future. As a consequence of that, we are making it easier for working families to provide for their kids' education.On the question of child care, there is the increase in the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. I do not recall those opposite actually saying anything about boosting the childcare tax rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent prior to the last election.So on the education tax refund, Member for Wentworth, you are wrong. On the question of the childcare tax rebate, you are wrong. On the question of your predisposition to provide $4 billion worth of funding for those north of 180 grand -  - On those three measures that I have just referred to, the position of the government on tax is absolutely clear. But I go back to the fundamental premise of the question being advanced by both the member for Wentworth, the plan C for the leadership of the Liberal Party, and the current Leader of the Liberal Party. - Is the member for Wentworth seriously suggesting that he is not out there counting numbers at the moment? - Are you seriously suggesting that you are not out there counting numbers at the moment? - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. My comments have everything to do with the answer to the question because they go to the future of the government's tax bills in the Senate. If there is a change in the leadership of the Liberal Party, we will wait with interest to see what new posture will be adopted to the passage of those bills - whether it is plan A, plan B, plan Z or plan whatever in terms of the alternative leadership of the Liberal Party. I would say to the member for Wentworth that, given that he is so experienced in counting the numbers, they should probably think about appointing him as Senate whip, because they seem to have a problem with counting numbers in the Senate at the moment, too. If you are harnessing votes generally, Malcolm, I would suggest that your Senate whip needs a bit of help on that score, because it did not go so well last night. - It is the member for North Sydney volume barometer again: when in big trouble, bellow most loudly. - I say to the honourable members who have asked this question about tax: the previous Liberal Party government was the highest taxing government in Australia's history. Why do we say that? We say that because tax as a proportion of GDP reached 24.9 per cent in both 2004-05 and 2005-06. When we took over office it was running at 24.7 per cent. For the benefit of those opposite, get these numbers straight: 24.7 per cent in 2007-08, 24.6 per cent in 2006-06, 24.9 per cent from 2004 through to 2006, 24.5 per cent from 2003 to 2004, 24.6 from 2002 to 2003. The first budget brought down by this Australian Labor government reduces tax as a percentage of GDP to 23.8 per cent. That is the mathematics. You might find it very disconcerting, but that is the mathematics. And if you look to the forward estimates, it remains lower right out to 2010-11.I would conclude my answer by suggesting that those opposite reflect on this: if we were to sustain in this budget - the one that the Treasurer brought down in March - the same tax to GDP ratio as we inherited from you with the last budget, do you know how much more we would be collecting by way of tax in the period ahead? We would be collecting $30 billion in more tax. If we sustained the Liberal's tax as a percentage of GDP at 24.7 per cent, as opposed to the 23.8 per cent we had hit, that would be a further $30 billion tax hike on Australian working families.I would say to those opposite, given their deep addiction to taxation, to do one thing for working families: tell your senators in the Senate to get behind the government's program on the Medicare levy surcharge, as $1,200 extra a year means something to working families at the moment. If the Reserve Bank can give us an interest rate cut which produces for working families a reduction of $600 in their interest rate bill each year, the Liberal Party should at least not add to that by providing an additional $1,200 tax hike a year, which their current action in the Senate is contemplating.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. He takes a particular interest in our government's health policies, having recently secured $7 million for 12 new dialysis chairs in his electorate. But he asks particularly about the Medicare levy surcharge. Members might recall yesterday that I enlightened the House as to the reasons behind the setting of the surcharge, introduced by then health minister Michael Wooldridge, who told us that this threshold was devised over a bottle of Jameson's whiskey late one night. I thought it might be a good idea to let the House know about a few other comments that Dr Wooldridge has made about this surcharge.When the surcharge was first introduced, he said:High income earners will be asked to pay a Medicare levy surcharge if they do not have private health insurance. These are people who can afford to purchase health insurance.Now we have the current-day Liberal Party with the firm opinion that someone who earns over $51,000 is a high-income earner. Never mind that somebody earning that rate is now earning less than the average wage; in the Liberal Party's eyes, if you earn more than $51,000 a year, you are a high-income earner. You are rich if you are over Michael Wooldridge's Jameson's whiskey threshold - hardly something to be proud of. But I am informed that this morning in the House, a Liberal senator for Queensland - in fact, I think the same -  - Thank you. It is good to know that the education spokesperson can help us out on occasion. I thank the member for that. In the Senate this morning, a Liberal senator from Queensland - and I believe it was the same senator who feels so passionately about the luxury car tax that she forgot to turn up - suggested that the Liberal Party's position on the Medicare levy surcharge was all about choice. There is nothing wrong with choice; the Labor Party think choice is a good idea. However, the choice that the Liberal Party are offering working families is this choice: they can choose to pay for private health insurance or they can choose to pay a tax. That is the choice that they are offering.I do understand that working families start to get nervous when the Liberal Party talk about choice. We know that the last time they talked about choice it was Work Choices. We know where that led; it was absolutely nothing to do with choices. Under the Labor Party's policy, we are offering a real choice to these people. We know that family budgets are under pressure, and our measure would actually allow families to choose whether they want to spend their money on their home loan, whether they want to spend their money on groceries, whether they want to spend it on private health insurance or whether they want to spend it on child care. We believe in giving them a real choice by giving them the money in their pockets so that they can choose how to spend it. It is about time, if the Liberal Party were really about choice, that they supported our measure in the Senate.</DOC>

 - I would ask those opposite -  - to reflect long and hard about their first action in the Senate, which is on the luxury car tax. - The first priority legislatively for those opposite is to send a message to working families, pensioners and carers that they, the Liberal Party, stand for cheaper Porsches. That is their message: cheaper Porsches, cheaper Ferraris and cheaper Rolls-Royces. - In terms of the cost-of-living pressures on working families, you have groceries, you have petrol and you have interest rates - and the impact which that has on home mortgages and rents - as well as the other challenges which working families face in balancing their budgets. The measure that was put forward by the Leader of the Opposition in his budget reply, which I notice was opposed by the member for Wentworth, and I think the member for Higgins and the member for Flinders - have you sorted that one out yet, by the way, as to whether it is official opposition policy? - Again, it is a relevant question in terms of the future leadership of the Liberal Party. If they change to the member for Wentworth, will this policy they currently have be sustained? It is an entirely legitimate question. - It is an entirely legitimate question because the member for Wentworth had been backgrounding at the time how much he opposed the policy - I think the member for Higgins as well, supported by the member for Flinders. I think, on the calculations put forward by those opposite at the time, they said that this would assist working families by about $2 a week. I think that was the figure used by the Leader of the Opposition. I would say this to those opposite: the measure you are about to vote against in the Senate on the Medicare levy surcharge equals about $20 a week. That is about $1,200 a year based on the income profile I referred to earlier in the question. - Those opposite stand here and say on this measure that they are concerned about the price impacts on working families. We are offering, in effect, a tax cut for a very large number of those working families; you stand for a tax hike. The inconsistency in these positions is extraordinary.</DOC>

 - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition interjects, 'A holding pattern'. What were the last 12 years? The last 12 years were, I would say, not just standing still but actually taking the entire debate backwards. They had 12 years to act on a climate change crisis which is impacting on the Murray-Darling Basin, and what did they do? How many gigalitres of water entitlements did they buy back after 12 years in office? Zero. Absolutely zero. - There is a direct proportional relationship between the loudness of their interjections and the absence of action during their period in office. The situation in the Murray-Darling Basin is serious. There has been some modest reprieve with some recent rains but, with the arrival of warmer weather, evaporation will start again to take its toll, and water levels are again expected to start falling.If we look at the facts which we are presented with, we have just had the fifth driest winter on record, and that is out of 117 years of records. Normally storages would be starting to fill now but, while there have been some inflows, these are now below the historical average. Active storage in the Murray system is around 20 per cent capacity, and for the basin as a whole it is around 23 per cent capacity. These are the facts that we are presented with. This is a deep challenge to the entire Murray-Darling Basin system; in fact, the system is in real crisis.I look also to comments made yesterday by the CEO of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission, Wendy Craik. She said that the current water shortage 'has the fingerprints of climate change all over it' and she said:There are features of the current phenomenon that we find ourselves in - water shortage, drought, whatever you want to call it - that are linked to climate change.We also have statements by the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology in their technical report on climate change in 2007 - when those opposite were in office - which say:Recent Australian droughts have been accompanied by higher surface temperatures due to anthropogenic - human induced - warming.If you look at the 2008 report of CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, An assessment of the impact of climate change on the nature and frequency of exceptional climatic events, it states in its conclusion:About 50 per cent of the rainfall decrease in southwestern Australia since the late 1960s is likely to be due to increases in greenhouse gases. The autumn rainfall decline in southeastern Australia since the late 1950s may be partly due to increases in greenhouse gases.That is what the scientists have to say. The Chairman of the NFF, David Crombie, said, 'The NFF believes that climate change may be the greatest threat confronting Australian farmers and their productive capacity now and into the future.'This is the challenge we face with the Murray-Darling Basin system now. We have clear statements from the scientific community, from those representing farm organisations and from those representing the basin authority itself about the direct linkages between climate change and what is occurring in the Murray-Darling Basin. The government's course of action is clear-cut. - The Leader of the Opposition says that the government has done nothing. The Leader of the Opposition therefore says that the fact that we have, for the first time in the history of the Murray-Darling Basin, spent $50 million on purchasing back 38 gigalitres of water entitlements - when those opposite had 12 years to buy back one gigalitre - is doing nothing. We have done that in nine months. In 12 years they bought back zero. Secondly, we have allocated, at the Adelaide cabinet meeting, a further half-billion dollars to accelerate the purchase back of water entitlements; thirdly, we have allocated $5.8 billion to improving irrigation infrastructure; fourthly, a new and independent Murray-Darling Basin authority has been established as a consequence of the intergovernmental agreement which this government brought into being - not our predecessors - which will implement a new basin plan from 2011. On top of that, we have for the first time an independently audited account of the total storage within the entire system. These are practical courses of action against a real crisis facing the Murray-Darling Basin system.I am also asked about alternative responses to the challenges we face. The core problem we face is that those opposite still do not accept that there is any linkage at all between climate change and the impact on the Murray-Darling Basin system. How can we get to first base in reaching a conclusion on what should be done about the Murray-Darling Basin when the alternative government of Australia and, as the Leader of the Opposition often describes himself, the alternative Prime Minister of Australia say that there is no relationship at all between climate change and the current state of the Murray-Darling Basin? That is what he has said. You cannot dispute it. He was asked the other night, 'Do you accept what's happening to the Lower Lakes and right up the Murray is also related to climate change? And he answered, 'No, I don't.' It is quite clear-cut.They were at dinner last night with the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard. Those opposite and those on this side of the chamber may remember the answer that was given at the beginning of last year on climate change when I asked, I think, the Prime Minister at the time whether he accepted the reality of climate change and its relationship to human-induced emissions. He said that the jury was still out. Eighteen months on, that is still the state of the Liberal Party. They are climate change deniers - not in their heart of hearts but in the words put forth this week by the alternative Prime Minister of Australia. Can I just say to those opposite: in terms of the leaderless rabble that the Liberal Party have become, the time has come for the conspirators to come out of the shadows and bring this to a conclusion. It has gone on for too long - whether it is plan A or plan B. It is about time this was brought to a conclusion. We have here a clear statement from the climate change denier who is currently the Leader of the Opposition and the alternative Prime Minister. Our Murray-Darling Basin system is in crisis. It requires, therefore, national political action - not opportunistic, short-term political pointscoring. It is time that the climate change deniers in the Liberal Party got with the government's program and backed a national solution to a river system in crisis.</DOC>

 - We are not doing that; that is the point. What we are doing is increasing taxation on Porsches - very expensive luxury cars. That is what we are doing, and you have no -  -  - The opposition want lower taxes for people who purchase luxury vehicles; it is that simple - lower taxes for people who purchase luxury vehicles. All of this today is about covering up their embarrassment, because what they are now doing is trying to blow a $6 billion hole in the surplus, which means that what they are saying to the Australian people is they do not stand for working families who want lower interest rates. It is very clear who they are siding with in this debate. They are siding with big oil, they are siding with people who are purchasing luxury vehicles and they are siding against people on average incomes who are slugged with a very high levy when it comes to the Medicare surcharge. That is what they are doing. They are acutely embarrassed about it, and all of their tactics in question time today have been about camouflaging that fact.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can indicate to the House that in Singapore last week Australia and New Zealand concluded a free trade agreement with ASEAN. This agreement is the most comprehensive free trade agreement that ASEAN has ever entered into. It is Australia's largest free trade agreement; ASEAN as a whole is our largest trading partner, with some $71 billion in two-way trade between us and them. This is a larger trading partner than China, a larger trading partner than the US, a larger trading partner than Japan.As for the agreement itself, it will liberalise commerce on up to 97 per cent of Australia's current trade with key ASEAN partner markets by 2015, a significant advance on the Bogor 2020 time line. It covers all three major sectors - agriculture, manufacturing and services. In the case of agriculture it will cap tariffs and phase them out over time. In respect of manufacturing it will cover over 30 per cent of our manufacturing exports and eventually eliminate tariffs on manufactured goods such as machinery and parts, electrical equipment and instruments and gaming machines. Australian pharmaceutical products as well will be tariff free in a few years. As far as the services sector is concerned, there will be greater security and certainty for the banks and insurance companies. The agreement will improve entry for teaching staff, allow education providers to supply more courses and give telecommunications providers access to essential network services.This is a very significant free trade agreement. It will provide not only new export opportunities but, significantly, capacity to create new jobs in this country. As well, whilst I was in Singapore, where Austrade has headquarters, I also had discussions with the Austrade regional manager for the ASEAN region and I have instructed Austrade to work with industry to develop a strategic plan for all the sectors of industry not only to have a better knowledge of what this agreement holds but to develop a strategic plan to properly take account of it.This is a significant advance. Australia was left a woeful record in trade by the previous government. We inherited a trade performance of 72 consecutive months of trade deficits. Never before in the history of this country has a government presided over such a performance. And in the 11 years that the previous government was in office it was only able to have net exports contribute to economic growth in two of those years. Not only did it leave us high inflation which drove up interest rates; it left us a woeful trade performance. Labor has a plan and has started to implement it to turn around that woeful trade performance. This ASEAN free trade agreement is part of that plan.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question on the tourism industry. I say that because the tourism industry is exceptionally important to the Australian community, especially in the context of jobs in regional and rural Australia. One of the issues the tourism industry is raising is their serious concern about the impact of inflation on their local businesses and the need for the Australian government to get the economic fundamentals right. In that context they are vitally concerned and they seriously welcomed the reduction in interest rates this week, which has made it a little bit easier for them to conduct their businesses in a very tough global environment.I say that because the tourism industry in Australia is finding it a little bit tough at the moment because of the serious economic concerns throughout the global economic community. On top of those serious economic concerns, they have also had to handle the impact of a very strong dollar, which has undermined our historical inflow of tourists from such significant markets as Japan. This industry has also had to handle the impact of a serious oil crisis, which has made it more difficult for tourists to come to Australia and to travel in Australia. So I simply say that the Australian government -  - I can assure the House that we will continue to work closely with the tourism industry. We will also continue to work to overcome the neglect that this industry has had to put up with - the failure of the previous government - on such fundamental issues as a shortage of labour and a failure to train Australians to perform very valuable work in the tourism industry, which is so important to Australia's economic performance. I might also say that they have raised with me their serious concerns about the failures of the previous government with respect to key infrastructure issues, such as improvements in railways and the performance of airports - in association with the requirements of the Australian community - to actually save to invest in improving those key economic activities for the future in terms of investing in skills and infrastructure development.I am pleased to say that I have a good working relationship with the tourism industry. They continue to bring their concerns to me, because they are also about making sure that, unlike the previous government's international tourism advertising campaign called 'Where the bloody hell are you?' - The member for Curtin then left the chamber. - We will also work with industry to get Tourism Australia's performance right. I recently read with concern a report by the Australian National Audit Office about the lack of attention paid by the previous government to corporate governance issues concerning the operation of Tourism Australia. I understand the need to actually make sure that I get the tourism industry right. The Leader of the Opposition is concerned about tourism because the member for Wentworth is just about to send him on a long, long holiday.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question today. The member for Kingston held a very successful forum on homelessness in her electorate with a lot of local organisations represented. Her report to me was a very insightful and compassionate report. So I thank her for her question today. Today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released a report Counting the homeless. It counted the people who were homeless on census night in 2006. One of the frustrations of working in the area of homelessness is that figures are really only taken twice every decade and then we wait two years to see what those figures are. Nevertheless, the Counting the homeless report, which looks at census night 2006, shows us some very important and disturbing information. The number of people who were sleeping rough each night increased 16 per cent between 2001 and 2006, from 14,000 people to 16,000 people. On census night 2006, there were 2,192 more children homeless compared with census night 2001. That reflects, unfortunately, a 22 per cent increase in the number of homeless children under the age of 12 in that five-year period. It also reflects a much broader shift in the type of people who are becoming homeless. We are seeing a lot more families and couples becoming homeless - a lot more families with children.I am pleased to report that there is some good news in the data as well. There has been a fall in the number of homeless young people between the ages of 12 and 24. That group of homeless people fell from around 23,000 in 2001 to just under 18,000 in 2006. That shows that targeted interventions in a particular population group can be successful in reducing homelessness.This data also confirms that homelessness services have been doing an amazingly great job with the resources that they have. Over 20,000 people were staying in shelters and refuges on census night 2006. That is 5,600 more people than were in the same type of accommodation in 2001. That was done without, at the time, any real increase in funding from the Commonwealth.Of course, the Rudd Labor government has already taken action in the area of homelessness. In the May budget we contributed $2.8 million to RecLink, the organisation behind the Choir of Hard Knocks, and 30 other similar programs. We put $150 million of new money into building homes for homeless Australians. These funds have been allocated to states and territories, and states and territories are building, buying and planning those homes right now. A Place to Call Home will meet its target of delivering 600 new homes for homeless Australians, an important though modest contribution.Last month I launched the National Homelessness Information Clearinghouse. With government funding of $500,000 over three years, it is a crucial tool for informing and connecting the homelessness sector. Our homelessness white paper will be out in a few weeks time. Over 1,200 Australians attended consultations and over 600 written submissions were received. Today I also released a short summary of those submissions.Homelessness is being tackled by the COAG Housing Working Group because obviously Commonwealth, state, territory and local governments need to work together. Of course, the problem of homelessness goes beyond government intervention. It requires all the support and help of the not-for-profit, non-government, benevolent and charity sector, which has been so successful for so many years. But it goes beyond that also. Our response needs to engage the business community and the whole of the Australian community. We know that with targeted action we can turn around the figures that we have seen today.</DOC>

 - Can I say to the honourable member, who I think comes from the state of Western Australia, that the first responsibility we have as a government is to make sure that we are prosecuting a policy of responsible economic management. Secondly, I would say to the honourable member that if he looks at the national accounts figures released yesterday he will see a solid growth performance for the Australian economy but a particularly solid growth performance in the Western Australian state economy.The honourable member, I presume, refers to the impact of another tax measure which is being considered by those in the Senate. I presume that is the reference of his question; what in particular he was talking about is somewhat unclear. Can I say to all those opposite: if you are going to prosecute a policy of responsible economic management, it means ensuring that you deliver a responsible surplus outcome. Currently, we have a $6 billion assault on it. I would say to those opposite: you ought to pursue these policies in order to make it possible for the people of Western Australia to enjoy, like other Australians, a decision by the Reserve Bank to bring down interest rates, rather than to see them continue to go up. That, I would say to all those in Western Australia, is a good way ahead.The other thing I would say on the question of fuel prices for those in Western Australia is this: those in Western Australia have benefited from a Liberal government decision since 2001 under Premier Richard Court -  - On the matter that the honourable member just raised, I also draw his attention to what his own leader had to say on 20 August. He said, 'I'm advised in part that the change in excise referred to is not likely to have any impact on domestic gas prices.' - So says the Australian Financial Review. Is anyone up there in the press gallery saying they got it wrong? Let us find out. -  - Well, the Leader of the Liberal Party should be careful about what he says. Obviously, he has come under attack from his Western Australian Liberal colleagues for that statement and he is trying to wriggle out from under it. It is there in black and white. I have not heard -  - As we know, the tax measure being considered in the Senate at the moment is a tax on condensate. Again, I draw the attention of those opposite, including the honourable member, to their leader's own statement on 20 August. He said:I am advised in part it - the change in excise - is not likely to have any impact on domestic gas prices.I know it is a politically uncomfortable message for the honourable member, particularly on this day, that his own leader does not adhere to the political script that he desires. I know that is politically uncomfortable -  - The more the Leader of the Liberal Party protests this day, the more we know the Leader of the Liberal Party is in terminal trouble. We had the Nelson doctrine on interest rates earlier this week: what he says on interest rates as Leader of the Opposition is not what he will do on interest rates as Prime Minister. We have had the Nelson doctrine on climate change, which is that he does not accept there is any connection between climate change and inflow of water. -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Again we have the Nelson doctrine when it comes to the impact on gas prices in WA. One thing is said in this place -  - and another thing elsewhere. I would suggest that those opposite develop a clear political and policy script for the nation's future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I believe this is a matter on which all members of the House have a common view - that is, how do we deal with the problem of the inadequate supply of donated organs for those who need them and for those who now are adding to the waiting lists for transplants around Australia? Currently we have 1,800 people around Australia on waiting lists and that number is made up of those who make the waiting list. There is a further number of patients -  - The member for Paterson should really reflect on whether something as sensitive and as serious as organ donation is something to make cheap political points about. -  - Do you support the interjection by the member for Paterson? -  - Do those opposite support it? -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Where I began on this was to say that I believe all members of the House are united in their interest in ensuring that we have a decent organ donation and transplant system for the future. I assume that is the case on the part of all members in this place. - The honourable member for Paterson interjects, 'What are you doing about it?' Can I say this: as a consequence of the 2020 Summit, when the question of organ donation came up and was prosecuted with legitimate vigour by those who are associated with the system as it works at present, the government decided in July to embrace a $136.4 million national plan to boost organ donation and to save lives. - The honourable member for Paterson interjects, 'That's not enough.' - Mr Speaker, I would suggest that those opposite try to enter into the spirit of what we are doing here, which is to try to make a real improvement for a whole lot of people who need organ donations. This $136.4 million plan includes the following elements: firstly, $67 million to fund dedicated organ donation specialist doctors and other staff in public and private hospitals who currently do not exist; secondly, $46 million to establish for the first time a new independent national authority to coordinate national organ donation initiatives across the country, which anyone associated with this would know are currently poorly coordinated; thirdly, $17 million in new funding for hospitals to meet additional staffing, bed and infrastructure costs associated with organ donation; fourthly, $13.4 million to continue a national public awareness campaign; and, fifthly, $1.9 million for counselling for potential donor families.These are very practical measures. We have engaged in a lot of discussion within the government about how to do this and how to do it better. The reason we have done that is the figures that I began my answer in question time on today. I think all of us have people in our own electorates, people that we know, who are directly personally affected by something we as a nation need to do better. That is what we are trying to do. It is not just the 1,800 who are now on transplant waiting lists; it is those who cannot even get on to those lists for a series of other reasons.We had some good news today at a personal level when we had a visit from little Cordelia Whatman. She is, I think, 15 or 16 months old, a little bub. This case is prior to this scheme coming in. There is no direct connection here, but I simply use this little one as an example of what good things we can do as a country if we talk up, both sides of politics, the importance of getting donations right. This little one successfully, thank God, got a liver transplant at Westmead children's hospital two months ago. I saw her today and she is looking in really good nick. But that is just one case, and there are 1,800 others out there who need help and need it now.Therefore, I would say to all members of the House: in our own way, in our own communities, let us get behind what I think is a really good national program. It is not going to solve everything. But one of the things that is really important is for us all to talk up the need to not just commit ourselves to organ donation but, when that terrible tragedy occurs in a family, for people to go through with it to the end, because that is where the downfall is occurring.The stats on people signing off for organ donation are huge for Australia. Australians want to do this. Some 90-plus per cent, I think, of Australians sign up saying that they are willing to donate. But last year we had a total of 198 people who donated organs. There is a real problem at the actual interface - that is, where it happens in the hospital. That is what we have to crack. That is why the advice to us from the medical experts is that they need specialist medical and nursing staff within hospitals to try and make this work - people who are not associated with the normal functions of the hospital; people who have this as their dedicated mission. As of Saturday, I understand, the positions of the chief executive officer and medical director of the new organ donation authority will be advertised. We are at this stage on track to have the new authority up and operating by 1 January 2009.It will be good if we can get those numbers down. That is the ambition I think of all of us here, and I think we can all play a modest part in our own communities in trying to make this work as well.Mr Speaker, on that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - In the budget that we brought down in May, the government provided three additional things. The first was a one-off cash bonus of $500 a year, and I contrast that to the previous government, which did that for the previous three financial years on a one-off basis but in the preceding eight years of their term in office did not do that. That is the first point. The second is that the government also increased the utilities allowance from $107 a year to $500 a year and made that permanent into the future. That was not done by the previous government in previous budgets. The third thing was to increase the telephone allowance, as we foreshadowed prior to the election. The consequence of this is that the overall increases to payments for pensioners in that budget were something in the order of $900 per year once you put those various additional payments together. That is a figure approaching $20 per week. Furthermore, as the government has already indicated, consistent with the recommendations put forward by the Senate inquiry into cost-of-living pressures on pensioners, which was supported by both government and opposition members, that there should be therefore a full review into the long-term structure of pension payments into this country. That is what is currently underway.</DOC>

 - The government, in building an Australia for the future, is determined to ensure that whatever can be done to preserve the dream of Australians to one day own their own home does not just remain a dream but can still be a reality. The problem that we faced coming into office was that any measure of housing affordability in this country represented some stark figures indeed. The average house cost represented some four times the average annual wage back in 1996 but, as of the end of last year, represented some 7Â½ times the average annual wage. That is a huge change over time. The average size of a first home buyer mortgage has more than doubled, from $107,000 at that time to $248,000 as at the end of last year. These figures are then reflected in how much first home buyers are spending on mortgage repayments as part of their total income. Back in 1996 they spent 15.2 per cent of their total income on mortgage repayments. As of the end of last year it was getting up towards 30 per cent. These are clear-cut measures of a real decline in housing affordability, and everyone understands this core fact. If, back in the 1996 period, a new house was going to cost you some four times your average annual wage and if, by the end of the period in office occupied by the Liberals, that had risen to 7Â½ times, that is a huge change. That is what is reflected right across the Australian community. The practical challenge that we face is what is to be done about it. What we did about 12 months ago was convene a housing affordability summit in opposition. -  - We said we would embrace three major new policies. I have news for those opposite who interject: each one of those policies has been implemented in government. There have been $2.2 billion worth of housing affordability investments by this government, against zero investment in these areas by the previous government. Under this government there is a Minister for Housing. Under the previous government there was no housing minister. Under this government there is an investment in First Home Savers Accounts. Under the previous government there was no such investment at all. Under this government there is investment in a new National Rental Affordability Scheme. On the part of those opposite there was no such investment.Today we took this one step further by releasing the guidelines for the new Housing Affordability Fund. The Housing Affordability Fund is more than half a billion dollars strong and it is designed to do one thing: to provide a partnership with local government and others across Australia to bring down the on-costs for a new house in a new housing development across the country. If you have a participating local authority, we would seek to do two things. If they wish to partner with the government in the new Housing Affordability Fund, then the way in which we propose to do it is as follows. Firstly, if that partnership occurs, the amount which we invest with that local authority will represent a parallel drawdown in the infrastructure costs which are passed on by the local authority to a new homebuyer. That is one thing, but the second is that the other real increases in costs which are faced by new homebuyers out in new housing developments are also what are called holding costs or holding charges - in other words, charges which arise from delays in the development approval process. This is the second part of the proposal contained in this new fund. If we enter into an agreement with a local authority somewhere, the other part of the deal is to draw down the delay in the development approval process and again to draw down further the additional costs passed on to the homebuyer. Put those two things together and our calculation is that new homebuyers could be up to $20,000 per house better off. That is a practical step forward on the part of this government. It is a half-billion dollar program. It does not solve all the problems in housing affordability, but it is a program which has been warmly welcomed by the industry, including the Housing Industry Association.The other thing I would say is this: if you also look at this in the context of the other measures we have put forward on housing - $623 million for a National Rental Affordability Scheme to encourage the building of up to 50,000 new affordable rental units of accommodation as well as the $1.2 billion investment in the First Home Saver Accounts, on which the Treasurer is currently engaged in final negotiations with the banks - what you have are three programs on housing affordability, more than $2 billion worth of activity, out there in the marketplace for the use of Australia's homebuyers, or those who wish to invest in affordable rental housing and those who wish to save for their home. These are practical actions by a government getting on with the job of putting real programs out there to help first home buyers and other homebuyers deal with the challenge of declining house affordability.We have said many times in debate in this House in recent months that cost of living pressures for working families, for pensioners and for carers have been going through the roof in recent years. Housing affordability -  - Recent years. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition - so keen as he is to interject - that increased cost of living pressure only occurred in this country as of 24 November 2007! If you are going to have any credibility in the cost of living debate in this country, you have to recognise that these pressures have been building for a long, long time. The housing affordability figures that I referred to before go right to where they stood as of November last year. Let me just repeat this for the Leader of the Opposition. In March 2006, housing affordability stood at four times the value of the average annual wage. When those on the other side left office at the end of 2007, it was seven and a half times the value of the average annual wage. That is a huge decline in real housing affordability for working families. We have a practical plan of action to do something about a real need for working families.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. I would assume that the point that the honourable member is making in her question is that there is an inflation problem in Australia today that is affecting pensioners, carers and working families across the country. One of the things I would ask the honourable member to reflect on in asking that question is what is it that drives inflation a lot? What drives inflation a lot is where you have government expenditure out of control. What we had with the previous government, as of when this government took over, was annual expenditure growth running at some 5.3 per cent.If you have government expenditure out of control, it adds to the fuels of inflation, which in turn affects the cost of living and which in turn has the effect of putting upwards pressure on interest rates - which affects all working families, including small businesses. That is why the government have a clear-cut strategy for dealing with the inflation challenge, anchored in the budget surplus that we brought down in May. The government's objective is to make as much room as possible for the Reserve Bank to put downward pressure on interest rates. We appreciate the fact that we have had one small decrease in interest rates - the first decrease in interest rates in seven years and after 10 interest rate rises in a row on the part of those opposite. - I note carefully where the shadow minister's position on the pension lies. When asked on 16 May this year:Let me just be clear -  - It is a question put to you and I think the honourable member knows exactly what this refers to.Let me just be clear there, the opposition - that is, the Liberal Party - is _ endorsing an increase in the base rate of the pension.The response from the shadow minister was:Yes. Absolutely.However, about an hour later - and they do not like this, and the member for Wentworth will even less so because it may interrupt other events that he has planned in the next fortnight or two - the member for Wentworth stood up and he said, 'Well, we have not got a policy to raise the base rate of the pension.' So the shadow minister says on radio that they are going to increase the base rate of the pension and an hour later the Shadow Treasurer says, 'We have got no policy to raise the base rate of the pension.' - The point that I would make in response to the other part of the honourable member's question is this: the shadow Treasurer said in a statement only a few months ago that they had no policy to increase the pension. They had 12 years to increase the base rate of the pension but failed to do so. What we find instead -  - So concerned were the Liberal Party about the state of the pension that for 12 years they had an opportunity to do something about the base rate of the pension and did nothing. Furthermore, in August last year, when, as reported in the Australian newspaper, the then Minister for Families and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Brough, took a submission to the cabinet to increase the pension, what did the Leader of the Opposition do? What did the member for Wentworth do? He was a member of the cabinet. What did the member for Higgins - now absent and presumably preparing for tomorrow's performance at the National Press Club - do? What did the member for Curtin do? -  - One year ago, they had this matter before the cabinet. After 12 years in office - and therefore, I presume, a continued determination to act on the age pension - what did the member for Higgins, the member for Wentworth, the member for Bradfield and the member for Curtin have to say about it when the matter was before the cabinet one year ago? We can only assume from the actions which came from that cabinet that the answer is: nothing. What has changed in the last month or so is that a certain member of the opposition is particularly concerned about the moves against him on the question of the leadership. Let us go to the substance of the proposal by those opposite. What about the 2.2 million other Australians who depend on the pension? You put forward a proposal which goes to a group of 900,000 worthy Australians. What do you say, however, to the group of 2.2 million other Australians who are carers, widows or in receipt of the disability support pension? We have a program of reform on this. We will deal with it in the proper way, not opportunistically like those opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. She has a long and abiding interest in housing affordability issues, particularly in the area of homelessness. She has been a very strong advocate in her own community on issues around homelessness. Today the Prime Minister and I launched the second stage of our Housing Affordability Fund. This $512 million fund tackles two major impediments to housing affordability: the holding costs associated with planning delays and the impact of infrastructure charges on new housing development. The Housing Affordability Fund will give local councils the chance to improve housing affordability in their communities. It is all about local solutions for local communities.I note that the Australian Local Government Association has welcomed the government's announcement already. Its president, Councillor Paul Bell, said:We are pleased that funding can be made available to help councils facilitate affordable housing projects. We are particularly grateful that the Australian government are prepared to fund community infrastructure related Housing Affordability Fund projects.It is very important to emphasise that the Housing Affordability Fund is not a one-way street. Councils will be expected to implement more efficient planning processes and work in collaboration with builders and developers to cut the red tape that adds so much to the cost of building. For example, the first initiative of the Housing Affordability Fund is the $30 million electronic development assessment project, which invests in changing our 18th century, paper based planning system and dragging it into the 21st century and making it an electronic system. That project is already well underway.The government's most important criterion when assessing projects will be value for money. It is about how much new home buyers will save at the end of the day on their new homes. We are expecting a wide range of projects. Some of them will involve planning right across a local government area, which will deliver modest savings on every new home in a local government area going into the future. Other projects will fund specific pieces of local infrastructure that will deliver larger savings for a more limited number of homes.Just as no two communities are the same, we do not expect any two projects to be exactly the same. Some areas might apply for funding for libraries, childcare centres, roads, sewerage systems or stormwater collection and recycling - costs that would otherwise be passed on as levies to new home buyers. Other areas might apply for help to fast-track rezoning to deliver more affordable land or perhaps to do site remediation which will bring land to market more quickly. Other councils might apply for extra funding for master planning which will bring on higher density developments closer to shops and railway stations.Following the launch today, the Housing Affordability Fund has received strong endorsement from the housing industry. For example, Caryn Kakas, the Executive Director of the Residential Development Council, said today:The HAF is strongly focused on achieving systemic cost reductions, and the guidelines encourage best practice in local government in respect of residential development assessments and planning processes.She further went on to say:HAF funding has the potential to improve development processes and should have long-lasting, long-term benefits which can achieve cost reductions not only across one development but across entire LGAs, regions or whole states if taken on in a cooperative manner.Wilhelm Harnisch, the Chief Executive Officer of the Master Builders Association, also said today:The HAF is a welcome return of the Commonwealth into this vital part of the Australian social fabric and the economy. There has been a decade of policy neglect in addressing the supply-side barriers, and the HAF is supported by industry as a first and vital step in redressing this area of policy neglect.The government recognises there is a need for action on housing affordability. As the Prime Minister said, the government's housing initiatives go well beyond the Housing Affordability Fund and include $2.2 billion worth of new initiatives in this area. Next month our first home saver accounts will be open for business, with banks and credit unions providing those accounts particularly for young Australians. We have also got the $623 million National Rental Affordability Scheme, a scheme that will provide industry with the incentives to build 50,000 new affordable rental properties. I am very pleased that industry and the not-for-profit sector have been enthusiastic in taking up the challenge through the National Rental Affordability Scheme and have applied for more than 12,000 of the National Rental Affordability Scheme incentives in this first funding round. We have applications with start dates spread over the first three years and will have two further funding application rounds in October and early next year. This is a vote of confidence in the government's housing affordability projects and shows that the government is getting on with the job of addressing the housing affordability issues that are so important to Australian families, pensioners and carers.</DOC>

 - Affordable housing is the cornerstone of a fair and well-functioning society. It is a very high priority for the Rudd government. Affordable housing is also important when it comes to labour force mobility so that people can move more easily.Housing affordability has declined markedly in this country in recent years. For example, mortgage repayments for the typical first home buyer now consume 28.5 per cent of their gross income compared to 15.2 per cent in the March quarter in 1996. And on top of that we had 10 interest rate rises under the member for Higgins, which certainly put a very substantial dent in housing affordability. Those 10 interest rate rises added something like $400 to the mortgage of an average home owner. Housing affordability just got a lot worse under a decade of neglect, which is why it is such a priority for the Rudd government. It is why we have announced the Housing Affordability Fund, which was announced today by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Housing. We do, for the first time in a long time, have a Minister for Housing, which is an indication of what a priority this side of the House puts on housing. This is all about helping local government reduce the cost of developing new infrastructure. And, of course, we have the Housing Affordability Fund along with that. We have our first home saver accounts and the National Rental Affordability Scheme. We on this side of the House have done more in nine months than those opposite even contemplated in 12 long years.</DOC>

 - Firstly, the group of pensioners we are concerned about covers the 2.2 million pensioners, carers, widows and others who are not part of the recent leadership related proposal put forward by the member for Bradfield. That is the first point. The second is this: we have acted as a government consistent with the following recommendation. Let me read it to you. It says:_ recommended the Government review the suitability of the base pension levels through economic analyses of amounts required to achieve at least a modest standard of living for retired Australians. - The interjection from the member for North Sydney was, Â 'Another committee'. This recommendation was the unanimous final report of an inquiry by the Senate backed by you, Joe - backed by him, backed by everyone on his side, including the member for Warringah. Pardon us for actually doing what we all agreed to do as a consequence of this particular Senate inquiry.Furthermore, I draw the attention of those opposite as to who initiated the Senate inquiry last year: the Labor Party from opposition. We initiated it from opposition, the then Prime Minister, Mr Howard, agreed with that inquiry proceeding. Its recommendation was to go to the heart of the base pension level for the future. That recommendation was supported by the Liberals and by the Nationals in the Senate. Labor have acted upon that and now opposition members say they do not agree with their own party. That is what they are saying. - Leader of the Opposition, are you saying that the Liberals and the Nationals in the Senate did the wrong thing? - The measure which is being reviewed at the moment, comes out of the Senate inquiry which was backed as a course of action by those opposite, except when they ran into a problem with their own internal leadership politics last week and decided to change tack. That is what all that was about.Secondly, in terms of the budget and providing assistance to pensioners now, again, I draw the attention of the honourable member for Warringah to what actually happened in the budget whereby we came up with not just a $500 annual bonus but on top of that an increase, from $107 a year to $500 a year, in the utilities allowance for pensioners, something which those opposite had never done in their 12 years in office. On top of that, we also increased the telephone allowance for pensioners. We put those three measures together. The member for Warringah's question goes to providing assistance to pensioners now. What I am saying in response to that is that the measures contained in the budget add up to an additional payment for pensioners of something approaching $20 per week. That is what was put forward in the budget. That is nearly double that which was put forward by those opposite. That, therefore, provided us with a basis to continue with this particular course of action, which the Liberal Party and the National Party agreed to until they ran into leadership politics problems last week.I conclude on this: again, for the benefit of those opposite, the reason that we on this side of the House are looking carefully at the total impact which this has on the budget and on all categories of pensioners is that every $10 a week increase in the pension results, across the system, in a further $2 billion per year to the budget bottom line right into the future. Therefore, it is important to get this reform right - a reform we have been working on in our first nine months in office that those opposite spent the previous 12 years not working on at all.But on the 2.2 million carers, 2.2 million widows, 2.2 million veterans, 2.2 million sufferers of one disability or another, who are omitted from the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition last week, I draw his attention to public statements, including one by People with Disability Australia, dated 11 September, entitled 'Disability pension rise needed now' -  -  - He said that they supported it. The disability pension rise needed now goes to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition did not provide any provision at all for the disability pension in his statement last week. I suggest the Leader of the Opposition actually reads the statement. Furthermore, there is a statement by Queensland Advocacy Inc. which deals with another group which were not the beneficiaries of the proposal put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. Then there are statements by Family Advocacy, the National Council on Intellectual Disability and the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia and there is a statement from Carers Australia entitled 'What about the hardest working families of all?' On top of that, we have a statement from the Brotherhood of St Laurence entitled 'Increases to income support need to be fair for all'.I table each of those statements from those various community organisations. The reason I do so is to go back to the core point: because the member for Bradfield is challenged on his leadership, he has changed the position put forward by the member for Wentworth only a few months ago on the age pension. He changed it last week in a real hurry and, as a consequence, missed out 2.2 million carers, recipients of the disability support pension, widows and others. Labor intend to undertake this program of reform thoroughly. We have commenced that program of reform and we intend to prosecute it fully, those opposite having had 12 years to deal with this problem. Their inattention to it for 12 years demonstrates how much they really cared about this, which was not at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question and thank him for welcoming me to his electorate once again last week when I joined with the Prime Minister, the Queensland Minister for Main Roads and Local Government, Warren Pitt, and local figures, including the deputy mayor of Townsville, to turn the first sod on the Townsville port access road. When we talk about this government's nation-building agenda, the Townsville port access road is a good example of how this will help individuals where they live and how it will help boost the nation's productivity. Work is starting two years early on this project as a result of Labor's budget, which brought forward $20 million of spending. The first stage, the 2.5-kilometre Stuart Bypass, will mean that the road can go away from existing residences, therefore leading to a substantial increase in the quality of life of people in the south Townsville area. The second stage, a 7Â½-kilometre eastern access corridor, will be completed by late 2011 or early 2012. In total, this 10 kilometres of road, costing $190 million in total - with a fifty-fifty split between the Commonwealth and the state government - has the potential to add some $10 billion to economic activity in Northern Queensland. It will enable the Australian economy to benefit from the booming north-west minerals province to get those goods out of the port of Townsville.It was one of the first commitments made by the Prime Minister when he became the leader of the Labor Party and visited Townsville in December 2006. It seems to be supported by everyone in Townsville. Indeed, last week the Deputy Mayor of Townsville, Councillor David Crisafulli, attended the sod turning and congratulated the government on its nation-building agenda. Someone who would be known to some of those opposite as a former staffer of Senator Ian Macdonald, a minister in the Howard government, had to wait for this government to be elected before we engaged in nation building as part of our $76 billion nation-building infrastructure agenda.But it is not supported by everybody, because on 19 December 2006, in response to the then Leader of the Opposition's support for the Townsville port access road, the Minister for Finance and Administration, Nick Minchin, put out a press release entitled 'Rudd splurges on national spending binge' and he opposed not just the Townsville port access road but the Ipswich Motorway as well. That was their position in government. We on this side of the House are going to get on with our nation-building agenda in spite of the opposition and obstruction of the friends of those opposite who sit in the Senate.</DOC>

 - The Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister and I - and I believe others in response to that question - have been straight up and down about this. We have been clear-cut in our language in saying that there is a massive problem in terms of the ability of age pensioners to live on the current age pension. That is what we believe. We have said that. That is why we have a program of action to deal with it. -  - Can I just say to those opposite that they should bring some attention to bear on a further piece of data on this, which came out today. The Leader of the Opposition said before that the cost-of-living pressures for pensioners had really gone through the roof but only in the last few months. Can I suggest that he has a look at the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia, HILDA, Survey, which came out today, which studies the period 2001 to 2005. Can I say to those opposite that this is a period when they were in office and this is a period for which we have clear-cut data on what was happening when it came to elderly couples. This survey says -  - The survey, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics Survey of 2001-05, which is a period in which those opposite were in a position to do something about this, says that older Australians missed out on the increase in the standard of living in Australia over that period. In fact, it said that their standard of living increased by just 0.7 per cent across that time.The second point I would make is that across that 2001-05 period revenues to the government from personal income taxes grew from $77 billion a year to $112 billion a year. - The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics Survey shows that there was a real problem in 2001-05 in terms of the standard of living of older Australians, including pensioners. In that same period the revenues going to the Howard government went through the roof. If you look at what happened with company tax in that period, you will see receipts went up from $31 billion to $49 billion. Despite the fact that the data showed clearly that we had an emerging problem of cost-of-living pressures for pensioners in that period and despite the fact that the public revenue of Australia in their period in office was awash with cash, the opposition did nothing about it. Here is the point for all members of this House to consider: they were the pressures in 2001-05 - we have the data - and that is how much money the opposition had to deal with it, but on 11 August last year when, according to the Australian, Mal Brough took to cabinet a proposal for a $30 per week increase -  - The problem for those opposite is that the past does not exist. It is as if the problem with cost-of-living pressures suddenly emerged on 24 November last year. My question to the member for Bradfield is: what did you do in cabinet 12 months ago when this was put before you and you had money to deal with it? What did you do as -  -  - The question is: when could this have been dealt with properly? Those opposite sat there in cabinet - the member for Bradfield; the member for Curtin, she who interjects most robustly, given her deep, longstanding compassion for the poor in this country; the member for Wentworth, given his deep, longstanding compassion for the poor -  - In August last year the member for Curtin said nothing in cabinet, the member for Bradfield said nothing, the member for Higgins said nothing and the member for Wentworth said nothing. They were all there and prepared to act, but they did nothing. This government is getting on with the business of implementing reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. We on this side of the House do understand that responsible budgeting and investment for the future is critical, and it is needed to tackle inflation. That is why we have delivered a strong surplus. And, of course, that is why we have reined in growth in government spending to one per cent, in contrast to the past four years where spending under those opposite grew by four times that amount. Those opposite went on a spendathon over a four-year period. The whole time they were engaged in that spendathon they were mean and silent about pensioners in their priorities. Pensioners were not in their priorities at any other time during their 12 years in government. - So why do we have this gimmick and why do we have this stunt from those opposite? Plan A over here, the Leader of the Opposition, did not have this position at budget time. His spokeswoman did at budget time, but she was overruled by plan C, the member for Wentworth - it is great to see you back. You have the Andrew Peacock suntan - terrific! - Of course, plan B is not here today. Plan B, of course, was the architect of the spendathon. It has fallen to this government to control reckless spending. It has fallen to us because the consequence of that reckless spending was upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates.The IMF told a few home truths about this last week. In effect, the IMF said that that spendathon, that spending spree put upward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on interest rates. That was backed up by Treasury minute after Treasury minute after Treasury minute. Indeed, in their last budget, they had a $40-billion spendathon. Could they find any room in that budget to do something about the base rate of the age pension? No, they could not. So why has the Leader of the Opposition got this proposition here today? I will tell you why: because he is now being hunted by plan C, the member for Wentworth. It would not be here if it was not for the looming leadership challenge that is coming from the member for Wentworth. There is nothing in their proposal which is genuine. They are leaving out 2.2 million pensioners. We on this side of the House will do the responsible thing: we will put in place a set of arrangements which are economically responsible and fair because we have a 100-year history of looking after low-income earners. -  - Yes, we do.

 - In the budget the government delivered an increase in payments for the forthcoming year of an order of magnitude of nearly $20 a week. We have indicated also that, through the process of the Harmer inquiry, we will undertake long-term pension reform. The core problem we face is: how do you deal justly with the two to three million Australians who find themselves in these difficult economic circumstances? What the Leader of the Opposition has done opportunistically, challenged as he is on the leadership front, is reach into the tin and say, 'How can I get myself a headline while Malcolm is away in Milan?' or wherever he was. He did this without any reference to the 2.2 million pensioners who were left out, without any reference to the widows, without any reference to the carers and without any reference to those who are disabled. He simply went for one category of pensioner in order to get himself a headline. But where the real rub in this lies is here: if the Leader of the Opposition were fair dinkum, he would have demanded action when they had the power, when it was before their cabinet only last year. This Leader of the Opposition is not fair dinkum about this. He is just not fair dinkum. The member for Wentworth is not fair dinkum about it because he slapped down the member for McPherson when she raised it only three months ago. None of those opposite are fair dinkum about this. As the Treasurer just said, the Australian Labor government is proud of its history in looking after those Australians most in need of support from government. We have done it for 100 years. If you look at the debates on the introduction of the age pension 100 years ago, it was the conservatives who said it will be the ruination of the economy. We have constantly stood by those Australians who need help. We will do that now and we will do it into the future.Those opposite, led so particularly by the member for Bradfield, are simply playing short-term politics with this, rather than long-term reform. If any of you had a skerrick of sincerity about this, you would have acted when Mal Brough brought this to the cabinet. None of you did. None of you raised your voice - not one of you - when you had all the money available to do it. In nine months we have turned this around in terms of the process we have now got under way. We intend to act responsibly on this.I look at the examples on the part of those opposite as they now confect moral outrage. Having had 12 years to act on this, they now say to us, after nine months, 'Why do you fail to address what we were not interested in dealing with in our 12 years in office?' Do you know something? The Australian people actually see through what you are up to. It says everything, I think, about the member for Bradfield and why the member for Bradfield is not to be much longer with us. It is the Leader of the Opposition who stands up and memorises everything and believes in nothing. That is the Leader of the Opposition - he memorises everything and believes in nothing. We see it on the age pension; we see it on so much which is before this parliament. I think it is time those opposite actually were fair dinkum with the Australian people and answered this question: if this was of deep concern to the Liberals, why, after 12 years, did you not even lift a finger?</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Today both the Treasurer and I have been in discussions with the Secretary to the Treasury and the Governor of the Reserve Bank on developments in the United States financial markets overnight and in fact on developments in global financial markets. As the honourable member will be aware, with the developments yesterday in the United States, Lehman Brothers, formerly the fourth-largest US investment bank, has now filed for bankruptcy. This is the largest single filing for bankruptcy in US history. Secondly, with the Bank of America agreeing to purchase Merrill Lynch, we have had the purchase also of the world's largest brokerage firm in an all-stock deal worth some US$50 billion. In response to these events, US stocks fell significantly overnight, with the Dow Jones industrial average recording its largest drop since the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001.The honourable member asks about concrete measures. The global financial crisis has been unfolding since August last year, and what the government has done since taking office in November last year, attendant on the advice provided to us by the Treasury and others, has been to take a series of decisions to strengthen our financial system. First, in terms of the particular recommendations of the Financial Stability Forum, which is a body involving a number of other leading economies on which Australia has been represented now for some time, we are in the business of encouraging the full implementation of its recommendations across the global financial community. At the core of this lie the recommendations concerning transparency, because transparency concerns, which have been evidenced in the various financial instruments used by US investment banks in particular, have in part gone to the heart of the problem. The second concrete action we have taken is this: we have supported liquidity in the Australian economy by expanding the government bond market to ensure our broader financial markets operate more effectively, a decision announced by the Treasurer some months ago. A further measure has been this: to strengthen the protections available for eligible deposited insurance policy holders, we have of course advanced our proposition on the Financial Claims Scheme.These are concrete measures we have taken in response to the advice provided to us by Treasury and others in the first six months of this year. Upon taking office we were acutely conscious that this global financial crisis was not over, it had a long way to run and, as events in the United States have demonstrated in the last 24 hours, regrettably it has a long way to run yet. Nonetheless, I say this to the honourable member: the government is determined to prosecute a policy of responsible economic management to assist in seeing Australia through these difficult global economic challenges, and that is what we intend to do.</DOC>

 - I certainly welcome the member for Ballarat back as well. As the Prime Minister was saying before, we are facing one of the most difficult times in international financial markets, and the difficulties of course have their origin in the US subprime market. As the Prime Minister noted, overnight Lehman Brothers, formerly the fourth-largest investment bank in the US, filed for bankruptcy, a very significant event. And of course we have seen the takeover of Merrill Lynch by the Bank of America.These are serious matters and the government, over the last 24 to 48 hours, has been constantly briefed on these developments, first of all, by and through the council of economic regulators. As the Prime Minister said before, we have been in regular contact with the RBA and of course with APRA. In recent weeks I have also been in regular contact with my international counterparts. This is quite important, because we are not immune from these events but we are better placed than many countries in the world to weather the storm.It is the case that our banks in this country are well capitalised and that is something we can be thankful for. We do not face the same problems being experienced in the United States. Nevertheless, events on international markets are having an impact on confidence around the world. The member who asked the previous question asked what the government was doing. We want to ensure our financial system is as strong and as well regulated as it can possibly be. Of course, the member opposite, the new Leader of the Opposition, will well recall legislation put through this parliament some time ago to put in place a financial claims scheme and also measures to increase liquidity in the bond market. I thank him for his cooperation in that endeavour.What we can do is build a very strong surplus as a buffer against international and global financial turmoil. What we can also do is to build our investment funds so we have the capacity to invest in the future, to expand the productive capacity of our economy. So it is not a time to be complacent. It is a time for economic leadership. It is not a time for reckless spending on dodgy projects which are owned by fundraising mates. It is certainly not a time to call inflation a fairytale and then to turn round and say that the government did not cut the budget hard enough. It is certainly not a time to vandalise the surplus.The Leader of the Opposition, in a press conference that went for 20 minutes today, spent $20 billion - he wants to raid the surplus to the tune of $6 billion - and then he recommitted to a whole set of spending requirements which have been outlined by the previous Leader of the Opposition - $20 billion in 20 minutes. That is not responsible economic management, it is not responsible economic leadership and it is not what this country requires at a time of global uncertainty.</DOC>

 - These are the matters that I, the Treasurer, the Secretary to the Treasury, together with the Governor of the Reserve Bank, in different conversations, were discussing earlier today. Let me go to Australia's commercial banks. Our advice is that the exposure by the Australian commercial banks to Lehman Brothers is modest. In relation to other entities within the Australian economy, referring to different levels of government, I am unaware at this stage of any particular exposure. But should other matters come to hand, given that these are recently occurring developments, then of course we will keep the House apprised.I would say, however, to all members of this House that, as the government has said consistently throughout this global financial crisis, it is very important to be upfront with the Australian people about the extent of the challenges coming at us from the global economy. We have been saying that day in, day out at the dispatch box since the beginning of the year. At the same time, it is very important to be mindful of the underlying strengths of the Australian economy. The underlying strengths are the balance sheets of the Australian commercial banks, the strength of our regulatory system and the fact that the exposures to most of the difficulties which have occurred in the United States in relation to Australian private financial institutions to date, based on the information we received, have been modest.It is important therefore to keep the crisis in context, to acknowledge its reality, to acknowledge that Australia is part of the global financial system and therefore is not immune. At the same time, with one voice, all responsible politicians and leaders in this place should reassert and assert continually the underlying strength of the economy, critical as that is for the continued confidence of our institutions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. The government is committed to responsible economic management, to maintaining a very strong surplus and to very substantial infrastructure funds for investment in Australia's long-term economic prosperity for the future. We have inherited an inflation rate at a 16-year high and 10 interest rate increases in a row, putting serious pressure on working people in this country and of course, most significantly, increased government spending at a rate above five per cent per annum in real terms. That is why the government had to take strong action to ensure that we have fiscal settings putting downward pressure on inflation and interest rates and to ensure that Australia's government is investing for the long term - investing in infrastructure, investing in growing our economic capacity and putting long-term downward pressure on inflation and interest rates.Ever since the budget was handed down it has been under threat in the Senate. The strong fiscal settings that the government put in place in the budget have been under threat as the Liberal Party have taken a very strong stand in favour of cheaper Ferraris and Porsches, in favour of cheaper alcohol for teenage drinkers and in favour of higher taxes on middle-income Australians - a strong stand from the Liberal Party, reflecting where they really stand on the big issues facing the nation.That is not all. Along with blocking these initiatives, the Liberal Party, under the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bradfield, willy-nilly made big spending promises over the past six to nine months without ever once hinting where the money to pay for those promises might come from. I will mention just a few: pensions, fuel excise and infrastructure in schools. If you actually add up the dollars, you will see that the total cost to the 2008 budget surplus of their actions in the Senate - and only three of their unfunded promises - would be in excess of $4 billion and the total cost in the 2009 budget would be well over $5 billion.As we all know, we have just had a change of opposition leader. The first question that the new Leader of the Opposition needs to answer is whether he is going to maintain the commitments made by his predecessor. Is he going to maintain the irresponsible spending commitments and the wrecking attacks on the budget in the Senate? The member for Bradfield has gone off into exile. He has joined the member for Higgins in indefinite exile in the political twilight zone up beyond the bleachers. The member for Higgins thinks it is still his surplus. He has not noticed there has been a change of government. If it is his surplus, why doesn't he defend it against attacks from the vandals in his own party? - Wilson, when you discover a sense of humour, I will start making jokes. - We have seen recently a fair degree of posturing from the opposition on the issue of the pension rate. It was rightly pointed out yesterday by a number of members of the government that only about 12 months ago the people undertaking this posturing actually had an opportunity to do something about this. Amazingly enough, they did not.I want to add another point to illustrate how hollow and hypocritical these people are. Not only were they not doing anything; let us have a look at some of the things they were doing. For example, in the last 16 months of the Howard government - when the member for Bradfield was a cabinet minister, the Leader of the Opposition was a cabinet minister and the member for Higgins was Treasurer - they spent $457 million on government advertising. That would have helped a few pensioners! They spent $350 million - about three times the ordinary amount spent on industrial relations - on the infamous Work Choices. And they managed to top $4Â½ billion in government grants - 10 times the amount they spent on government grants only five years before that. So, as well as looking at the things they did not do for pensioners less than a year ago, we should be looking at what they actually did spend the money on and why government spending was increasing at the rate of five per cent per annum, all in order to save their political hides.Regardless of the turmoil in the opposition and regardless of who the leader is, they do not change their spots. They stand for irresponsible economic management, they stand for wasteful, short-term spending of government money and they stand for the interests of well-off Australians at the expense of working people and pensioners.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. On the government's approach to pensions, as I indicated to the House yesterday, in the budget we brought in three measures. The first was a one-off bonus of $500, which the previous government had done for the previous three years but not for the previous eight years that they were in office. That is the first point. The second was that we increased the utilities allowance for pensioners from $107 per year to $500 per year and made that permanent. That was never done by the previous government and there was no commitment for them to do so into the future. The third thing we did was to increase the telephone allowance from some $80-plus per year to some $130-plus per year. The honourable member asks the question: when will the government deliver assistance to pensioners? Through the budget, we delivered those measures and, consistent with the recommendation that his own party supported in the Senate, we will, through the Harmer inquiry, reach a conclusion on long-term reform for all categories of pensioners.This morning - and I use this as an illustration in response to the honourable member's question - I was in Western Sydney. With reference to the question of pensioners, the proposal on pensions put forward by the Liberal Party would have excluded some 12,000 pensioners in the electorate of the honourable member for Werriwa. That would have been 5,277 age pensioner couples, nearly 5,000 disabled pensioners and 1,500 carers. This goes to why we in the government, looking at long-term pension reform, are going through every single category of pension rather than leaving any one category out.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calwell for her question. I know her deep concern for educational equity in her electorate. In the past few days, while they have been wandering around talking to each other about themselves, members of the Liberal Party have missed some very important educational data that was released by the OECD. The OECD released the report Education at a glance. This is a periodic report from the OECD about the status of a nation's education system.The OECD Education at a glance report is a snapshot of expenditure on this nation's education system, its strengths and its weaknesses in 2005 - that is, it is very clearly a report card on the Howard government's years as they relate to education. When we look at that report card, there is plenty to be disturbed about. What it tells us is that public spending on education was at 4.3 per cent of GDP, well below the OECD average of five per cent. We ranked 19th when compared with our competitor countries in the OECD. We were behind Canada, behind the US, behind the UK and behind many other European countries. Deeply disturbingly, despite all the worldwide research that shows investment in the early years is the most productive investment one can make in education - research which is so familiar to the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Child Care, the member for Bennelong -  - when we look at this OECD report on spending in the early years, we see that we came near the bottom of the class. We were 24th out of 26 countries. This is an unbelievable indictment of the record of the Howard government. These are the nations with which we must compete. These are the nations with which our economic prosperity is tied up. If we cannot compete then, over the long term, obviously this nation will go backwards. The Howard years put at risk the education system of this country. In the modern world of education policy, standing still is going backwards. Under the Howard government we did much worse than stand still: we had 12 years of neglect and underinvestment in education.This government was elected to bring in an education revolution, and we are doing that. We are doing that across the board - from early childhood education, to schools, to vocational education and training and university. Amongst a comprehensive suite of policies, this government is investing $11 billion in our Education Investment Fund so we have a long-term source of funding to renew the capital of our higher education system: both our university and our vocational education and training systems. But you cannot have $11 billion in the Education Investment Fund if someone engages in a smash-and-grab raid on the surplus. The newly elected Leader of the Opposition, in spending $20 billion in 20 minutes at a press conference today, has indicated to the Australian people that he is going to lead the Liberal Party on that smash-and-grab raid. What that smash-and-grab raid means is we cannot make investments in educational infrastructure for the long term in this country. The Liberal Party neglected education when they were sitting on the treasury bench. Now they are trying to damage education from opposition. This is economic vandalism, which ultimately means education vandalism in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The decision by the Commonwealth to approve the Sugarloaf pipeline was taken on the basis that there would be no significant impacts on matters of national environmental significance and that there would be no allocations from water which was identified as being allocated for the environment, including the Living Murray system and Water for Rivers. Those conditions were made quite clear by me -  -  
Government member - She doesn't understand. - The member does not understand. Those conditions were made quite clear by me when I made that approval. I make the point, through you, Mr Speaker, that it beggars belief that opposition members would get up and talk about their concerns for water and the environment. I am referring to the opposition's extraordinary track record of neglect, when in government, in its exercising of national leadership over the issue of the water health of the Murray-Darling Basin. It is a fact. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Coming from an opposition member who wanted to put green shadecloth over the Great Barrier Reef, I think questions of credibility need to be -  -  -  - As the member should know, we have laid down a set of significant conditions to ensure that matters of national environmental significance are considered and that no derogation from water identified as going to environmental flows will happen as a result of this project. That is our responsibility, and we have exercised it diligently. I just add, through you, Mr Speaker, that this government is showing specific and particular commitments and recognising the seriousness of the issue in the Murray-Darling Basin. Only a number of days ago, we made a significant commitment to Toorale Station, which would provide waters coming back in to the river system from their allocations, and also to lands under the National Reserve System. The fact of the matter is that the opposition had some 12 years to take serious action in relation to water health in the Murray-Darling Basin; in the nine months that the Rudd Labor government have been here, we have been starting to deliver on bringing water health back into the system.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. He has a longstanding interest, representing, I think, one of the oldest electorates in the country. He is acutely aware that there are many thousands of pensioners across the country who cannot get access to dental care and who will not be able to get access to dental care if the Liberal Party continues to oppose dental measures in the Senate.The Labor government wants to deliver a Commonwealth Dental Health Program which would put $290 million into public dental services. We on this side of the House are well aware - and I would have thought some on the other side would be aware - that those public dental services are provided to the most vulnerable in our community. They are for people who otherwise would not be able to afford dental care. I remind those in the opposition that there are 6.6 million concession card holders. Of those, 4.3 million are pensioners and their dependants. If, however, the new Leader of the Opposition continues to direct his senators in the other place to vote against our changes in dental care, we will not be able to provide the Commonwealth dental scheme. We made it clear before the election that our more targeted program would replace the previous government's program. We will not be able to provide this program if the Senate continues to oppose those measures. That was the choice that was necessary for us to be able to maintain our surplus, and that is the choice now facing the Senate. I would particularly like to make that choice clear for the new Leader of the Opposition.Under Labor's program, Western Australians would receive 35 times more funding than they would have received under the Liberal scheme. Under Labor's program, South Australians will receive 10 times more funding than they did under the previous government's scheme. Queenslanders will receive 11 times more funding. Victorians will receive 3Â½ times more funding. And, wait for it, the Northern Territory will receive 174 times more than under the previous program. Under the Liberal scheme, a multimillionaire with a chronic disease could get help, but a pensioner with a toothache could not. The Liberals wanted to avoid making a choice. They want our scheme and their scheme. That is just not possible.I want to again highlight this for the new Leader of the Opposition. Last week on Meet the Press on another issue, when the Manager of Opposition Business was pretending that the Liberal Party supported tax relief - just not the Labor government's tax relief, it seems - Steve Lewis said to the Manager of Opposition Business: 'You can't have it both ways.' And do you know what the Manager of Opposition Business said? 'Actually, we can.' That is the problem with the Liberals - they want everything both ways. They want our scheme and they want their scheme. They do not want to make difficult choices. We have to make difficult choices. It is clear that the Liberal Party under previous leadership would not make those choices. This is an opportunity for the new leader to show that he is able to make a choice. The rest of his team cannot. Are you going to, Malcolm? - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gippsland for his question. The member for Gippsland points to one of the significant problems that we have with the current methods for exceptional circumstances drought policy, and that is that we are obliged to -  -  - Well, it was your policy too, so do not get too excited. We are obliged to have a system where you have lines on a map. The National Rural Advisory Council, NRAC, makes a decision based on an entire area. For the entire area that they were making the assessment for - a good part of which falls into the seat of the member for Gippsland - they made an assessment that the period of recovery had begun. There is no doubt that when you draw those generalisations across entire regions you will find some areas where people are not in recovery at all. This happened with respect to the Bourke-Brewarrina area and the local member got involved there. We made sure that the New South Wales government put in a fresh request for revised boundaries and NRAC conducted an immediate assessment. Under those revised boundaries, a fresh EC declaration was made within the space of about 48 hours. We had a similar situation in two different areas in Queensland. I would encourage the member for Gippsland to follow the same process that -  -  - I know it might be appealing for a member of the National Party to ask me to abandon all process, but I would encourage the member to do what some of his colleagues have done - one even met with me today on this issue - and that is to ask, 'What is the process we should follow to make sure that the recommendations come in from the state government on the revised boundaries?' We will make sure that the National Rural Advisory Committee, every member of which was actually an appointee of the previous government, deals with the issue immediately and that we have proper process to make sure farmers are not left in the lurch when they are continuing to face tough times. But what I will not show any sympathy for is someone who, unlike his colleagues, refuses to engage in the process and decides he would rather get the headline and jump up and down here. Every day he delays in engaging with the process he leaves the farmers in his electorate out in the cold.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As I indicated to the House earlier today, I was with the honourable member today at the Minto Family Centre in his electorate, along with the member for Bennelong, the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare. As the member indicated in his question, the government is committed to an education revolution - that is, we want to make sure that we are building the best educated, best trained and best skilled workforce in the world. That is the ambition which Australia needs to have for itself in the global economy of the 21st century.We know for a fact that, to make that work, you have to make it work at the earliest stage of a kid's education. That is why this government has paid particular attention to early childhood education. Early childhood education and our commitment to making those opportunities available to every four-year-old in the country is out there for all to see. We intend to implement it, and we are in the process of implementing it. When you go particularly to those even younger than that, some of the data that we have got from the preliminary paper for the 2007 National Report on Schooling in Australia shows that by year 3 children from families where neither parent has worked for 12 months or more do considerably worse against reading, writing and numeracy benchmarks.I draw these figures to the attention of honourable members because they are really important in terms of real challenges being faced by families out there. Only 88.5 per cent of kids from jobless families are meeting reading benchmarks compared with nearly 94 per cent for all students, only 87 per cent of kids from jobless families are meeting writing benchmarks compared with 93 per cent for students in other categories and 87 per cent from jobless families are meeting numeracy benchmarks compared with nearly 94 per cent for other students.The government is committed to building an Australia for the future, one where we are not left behind by the rest of the world and also one where we do not leave individual Australians behind. That means ensuring that these kids get the best possible start in life. The question is: what do you do about it? What we have done about it is our Home Interaction Program, whereby we are establishing 50 centres nationwide. They will operate by providing a grant to a local community organisation. That community organisation will then engage tutors who will then provide home based services to kids in these particular disadvantaged circumstances. The idea is that if the young kid is not getting enough reading or writing opportunities or is not being taught basic things like counting at the home front - for a whole range of reasons - we have got the flexibility to get those tutors into the house to do that sort of work after school and to help the kids with their homework.What we have done today in the honourable member's electorate is precisely that. At Claymore in his area there will be one of these centres. It will be up and running soon. Today, the parliamentary secretary has announced that 13 of these centres will now be operating nationwide. We will be rolling out 50 nationwide. This will literally help thousands of families with kids who are the life and soul, and the human faces, of those cold statistics I read out before. Having talked to some of the mums and some of the kids in Minto this morning, this is a really good thing to see happen. This morning, we saw the Burnside charity, which operates I think as an extension of the Uniting Church, operating in conjunction with the state government of New South Wales, making sure that they have got some home based programs of their own to help in all sorts of other areas where these kids are often in distress. This provides an additional level of service. What we know for a fact is that, if we do not get kids in the habit of reading in the earliest years of their lives, it gets harder and harder to get them back on the road to recovery. - I would suggest that the honourable member for O'Connor just regard this one as serious. I know he regards this as just a general circus for his own performance. - I would just suggest to the honourable member opposite that those mums and dads who happen to be watching the broadcast today, or listening to it, are as interested in early childhood education as they are in the electorate of the honourable member for Curtin. I would suggest to her that, rather than interject in the negative way in which she has just done, she should take an interest in the early childhood education opportunities of kids in WA and kids right across the country. I would have thought, as a former minister for education, she would be out there cheering from the rooftops for a practical, positive initiative like this. The government is on with the business of implementing an education revolution. It is part and parcel of preparing Australia for the 21st century and, for young kids who are facing disadvantage, of making sure that none of them are left behind.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chifley for his question. Today at the Press Club we heard an extraordinary attempt to rewrite political and economic history. When it comes to political and economic history, I would rather rely upon the advice of the International Monetary Fund and upon the advice of the Treasury. What they say is something quite different to anything that appears in the member for Higgins's book. They do record the reckless spending of the member for Higgins, the legacy of which was high inflation and high interest rates. In fact, there were some extraordinary revelations last week in the Australian Financial Review about what the IMF had to say about the member for Higgins. Paul Cleary summed them up in the Australian Financial Review this way:The result of this outbreak of bad policy in the last years of the Howard government is likely to be a long period of inflation and weak economic growth, and it may take some considerable time, and pain, to get the balance back in the right order.That was the conclusion of all the work provided by the IMF about the member for Higgins. But of course there is no chapter in his book about inflation hitting 16-year highs and there is no chapter in his book about 10 interest rate rises on his watch. The problem here - and this just goes to the heart of the negligence of those opposite - is that it was not as if the member for Higgins had not been warned. He was warned; we now know that from executive minutes from the Treasury. He was warned way back in April 2005. This is what they had to say:With the factors affecting monetary policy being finely balanced, any economic impacts flowing from the May budget are likely to be an important consideration for the RBA board in coming months.That was the warning to the then Treasurer about what the likely impact would be of the reckless spending from those on the other side of the House. But it gets worse. This is what the Treasury advised the member for Higgins in November 2006 -  - In November 2006 this is the advice that was tendered to the member for Higgins. Treasury said:_ there is a real risk that significant spending will add to inflationary pressures.At that time the Howard government were only proposing an additional spend of $13 billion. They went on to spend an additional $40 billion. They completely ignored all of the advice. They put their foot on the accelerator precisely at the time that there should have been some restraint. That is what these minutes show, but of course this does not appear anywhere in the memoirs of the member for Higgins. The consequence of this was another four interest rate rises and inflation at 16-year highs.As we were saying yesterday, when this spendathon was going on, where were the priorities of the Liberal Party? Were they with pensioners?Government members - No! - Were they with low-income earners?Government members - No! - Where were they? They were with high-income earners; that is where they were. When Mal Brough took a proposal to the cabinet room to do something about the base rate of the pension, did they agree? No, they most certainly did not agree.Now the member for Wentworth, who has no past, sits over there and pretends that he had nothing to do with it. But, of course, he was sitting around the cabinet table at that stage. Plan C over here was around the cabinet table with plan B, who is still up the back. Plan B is still operational - 45 votes to 41. Eighty-six votes for Work Choices and high interest rates - that is what happened in the Liberal party room today. Now they want to make it worse - they want to raid the surplus again. They think you can block a surplus and spend it at the same time. They think that there is a magic pudding. What they are trying to do in the Senate is knock off $6 billion from the surplus, and in his press conference today the new Leader of the Opposition locked himself into spending another $20 billion. This is the same behaviour that gave us high inflation and high interest rates. It is about time that we had some responsibility from those on the other side of the House. The member for Wentworth is smiling. He is up there orchestrating and supporting in the Senate vandalism of the budget on important measures like alcopops. Of course, the member for Wentworth has no great affiliation with those sorts of everyday goods - he thinks alcopops is the noise that is made when he uncorks the Moet! - Yes. - Yes.</DOC>

 - What I can confirm is that the government does indeed take the issue of intermodal freight services very seriously indeed. Moorebank has been identified as a critical area. Discussions, of course, need to take place with not just my department but the Department of Defence and also the state government. We know that we need to get serious about the freight issue and the freight challenges for Sydney. For 12 years this was left untouched, just like other infrastructure issues that were ignored by the former government. We have established Infrastructure Australia to bring together the different tiers of government - federal, state and local - and the private sector to make sure that we can move forward on these challenges, including making sure that we have intermodal facilities so that we can increase the amount of freight that is moved by rail. At the moment, we have had a significant increase in rail freight in terms of east-west; we have had nothing in terms of north-south. It was completely ignored by the former government. This government is determined to get the processes right to work not just with the different tiers of government but with the private sector and with local communities - because local communities know that infrastructure is critical, and part of that is getting freight right.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question and for his ongoing interest in infrastructure, particularly the Ipswich Motorway, where substantial progress has been made under the Rudd government. This government has been working -  - I advise the member opposite - he lives in Brisbane - to go and have a look at the literally hundreds of workers today doing work on the Ipswich Motorway. You should go and have a look at Labor's nation-building agenda in practice on the Ipswich Motorway - something that was ignored by those opposite for 12 years. Such progress is, of course, part of Labor's tradition as a nation-building party. That is why from day one we moved quickly to establish Infrastructure Australia to bring together all the different levels of government and the private sector.If Infrastructure Australia provides the way, the Building Australia Fund provides the means - a means to fund investment in roads, in rail, in ports and in broadband. These funds are under threat from a reckless, irresponsible opposition that wants to blow, at a minimum, a $6.2 billion hole in the surplus - an opposition that discarded its leader today but discarded economic responsibility sometime ago. It completely gave up on economic responsibility. I would have thought that the new Leader of the Opposition would understand the importance of our nation-building agenda, because in the past he has had a history of being attracted towards the Labor agenda. It is common knowledge in the Labor Party that the new Leader of the Opposition went to Kirribilli to meet with then Prime Minister Keating about getting the casual vacancy in the Senate for the Labor Party in 1994. -  - Thank you. This was about Graham Richardson's casual vacancy in the Senate, and Malcolm Turnbull, the Leader of the Opposition, had a discussion with then Prime Minister Keating at Kirribilli. - Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition clearly understood at that time that infrastructure was important. Only Labor could be trusted with the job of building the nation. We have seen a former Labor Party member replaced by someone who wanted to be a Labor senator.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The government welcomes the agreement unveiled late yesterday Zimbabwe time by Mr Tsvangirai and Mr Mugabe to effect a power-sharing agreement in Zimbabwe. I take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Tsvangirai on becoming Prime Minister of his country in very, very difficult circumstances and against great odds. I am sure that sentiment is shared by the House.The government regard the peace arrangement as modest progress. Our preference, which again I am sure is also shared by the House, would have been for Mr Mugabe to walk off the stage, for him to go. The power-sharing agreement sees Mr Mugabe remain as President, Mr Tsvangirai as Prime Minister and a majority of cabinet ministers appointed from the Movement for Democratic Change party: some from Mr Tsvangirai's faction, some from Mr Mutambara's faction. The proof of the agreement will be in the implementation on the ground: whether we see real progress towards implementing the electoral and democratic will of the Zimbabwe people; whether we see respect for human rights; whether we see respect for the rule of law; and, importantly, whether we see the humanitarian, social and economic reconstruction of Zimbabwe.For some time, the Australian government has had sanctions very firmly imposed against Zimbabwe. These have had bipartisan ongoing support, both regarding travel arrangements for senior members of the regime and financial transactions. These sanctions will remain in place but will be kept under review pending the implementation of the agreement and progress made in Zimbabwe. Whilst having sanctions in place, the Australian government has continued to apply humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe. This has particularly applied to food and food assistance. In the last 12 months, we have seen nearly $10 million applied to humanitarian food assistance in Zimbabwe. Again, depending upon progress, we will look at whether it is possible for Australia to increase its humanitarian assistance to Zimbabwe and whether capacity-building development assistance is also appropriate.From a very low base, this is modest progress. The proof will be in the actual implementation. We certainly wish that Mr Tsvangirai has a full and complete opportunity to advance the interests of his people, and the Australian government looks forward to dealing closely with Prime Minister Tsvangirai.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. He would be well aware, particularly as we are having a fight across the parliament about blowing a huge multibillion-dollar hole in our surplus, that honouring Labor's commitments at the election is our first priority. It was not a commitment made by the Labor Party, but I think that this is an important question because there are many, many pressures in rural hospitals; there are many pressures on rural GPs. We are certainly determined to get more funding into our health system, particularly through our public health services. We have put an extra $1 billion into public hospitals already, and several hundred million dollars of that has gone to South Australia for them to distribute to their country hospitals. They have recently withdrawn their strategy, something that we have supported to make sure that rural communities in South Australia can get the health care that they need. We will continue to keep working with the state governments to make sure we can deliver a better outcome, but we will be giving priority to commitments made by us. -  - We would like the Senate to allow us to fulfil our commitments. Then, of course, we will be happy to have discussions about any future commitments that members on the other side of the House might want us to make in health.</DOC>

 - Can I thank the member for Canberra for her question. She has an enduring and genuine interest in people with disabilities in her electorate but also beyond that, and I do thank her and appreciate the question she has asked. It is an important issue.The government has reversed what I see as an unfair and harsh policy of the previous government where, in order to actively look for a job, a person on the disability support pension had to first go through an assessment that would risk their benefit, even before they had found a job. I am delighted to update the House today that, as of Monday, 8 September, last week, disability support pensioners are able to be assessed for which service is most appropriate but of course they are able to do so without the eligibility assessment occurring.For years those opposite were told that this was a great disincentive for recipients of DSP to seek work and to find their way off income support, but they did nothing. This matter was put to the previous government time and time again, and they failed to respond and to provide opportunities for people with disabilities. This policy ineptitude was underlined by the HILDA survey in 2006, which estimated that there were 400,000 Australians with a disability that were looking for a job or wanted an increase in hours. We needed to do something about that. This decision will open up opportunities for people on the disability support pension.The result of the assessment under the previous Liberal government, however, would have seen people risk losing up to $55 a week - before they even attended their first job interview. I know for many of those opposite, including today's Leader of the Opposition, $55 may not seem a lot of money, but for those people in receipt of the disability support pension it is an enormous amount of money and it is a profound disincentive for those people to seek work and find a way to reduce their reliance on welfare. We make this decision knowing it provides opportunities for those people on the pension to look for work without the threat of losing income - that is why we have changed it.This decision by the government has been well received by disability support recipients but also by disability employment providers, employers and others. ACE, the peak body representing the disability employment sector, has responded to this decision and said it:_ overturns ill-informed policy decisions of the past which unfortunately caused much harm to _ people with disability around the country and dashed their hopes of ever securing work and making their contribution to society.The government has also received support from business leaders, including the AiG. The AiG and other employer bodies understand that there are capacity constraints and productivity constraints in the economy created by a chronic skill shortage - which is of course a legacy left by the opposition to this nation - a skill crisis that the Rudd government is responding to by increasing training places and providing opportunities for people to be equipped with the skills to fill existing vacancies.What we have done through this decision has given opportunities to people with disability to seek work without losing income, because we respect those people who are on that income. We want all Australians to be provided with opportunities - whether in the area of employment, education or training - to have a fulfilling life. For that reason we have overturned a policy that for many years treated thousands of Australians without dignity or respect.</DOC>

I think every single member of this House understands how important it is for any government to support families and particularly to support those families who are struggling - struggling because one member of the family is out of work, struggling because a child is ill or struggling for any other reason. We certainly do want to make sure that the stronger families program is working effectively and we will make sure we do that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for the question. In the reform of wheat export marketing, the government delivered on a key election commitment and on a key economic reform. For the first time in more than 60 years, wheat growers around Australia now have a choice about who exports their wheat. Information sessions commenced on 1 August around the country. More than 51 sessions have been held during August and September and attendance at each of them has been impressive. Wheat Exports Australia have commenced the process of accrediting companies that satisfy the legislation and are therefore given accreditation to export wheat in bulk. So far, 13 companies have been accredited, including AWB, the former single-desk holder. That means those wheat growers who want to continue to sell to AWB will be allowed to do so and those wheat buyers from overseas who want to continue to deal with AWB will be able to do so but those who wish to engage in choice beyond that now have an option, for the first time.I note in an article I saw a couple of weeks ago in the Land that a small business by the name of OzEpulse is among the companies given permission for the first time to be an exporter of wheat. For some years they have believed they could provide growers with a significantly higher price than growers were receiving. In 1999, for the first time under a previous company name but the same directors, they put in their application. Back then, of course, when a small business put in an application, guess who got to decide whether or not they could be a competitor with AWB. It was AWB. Not surprisingly, in 1999 and each subsequent year their applications were rejected. In 2007 they were faced with a new scheme when the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, a member of the National Party under the previous government, held the veto. What happened when they applied to export wheat in bulk then? The veto was still exercised. I am pleased to say that this company is among the 13 companies which have been given accreditation to export wheat in bulk. The Managing Director of OzEpulse is quoted in the article in the Land:'We had applications sitting on the minister's desk for six or seven months,' he said.'We found out AWB was apparently making submissions directly to the minister that we were not privy to.'Almost every application we made was blocked, even though the price was well in excess of what AWB was offering.'For a small business wanting a fair go, they were neglected for a decade. For farmers wanting a better price for their wheat, they were neglected for a decade. A much needed economic reform is finally operating and delivering for the future of small business and farmers.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for this very serious question. I can inform the House that earlier this morning our time the US Federal Reserve announced that it would provide AIG, the American International Group, with an $85 billion emergency loan. In exchange, the US government will take a 79.9 per cent stake in AIG. The Australian government certainly welcomes the actions by the Federal Reserve, which, of course, have the full support of the US treasury. This announcement will provide much-needed support to AIG internationally and, of course, to the broader US market.We do need to be very careful when we are commenting on the impact of these events on the Australian subsidiaries of AIG. We have to be very careful indeed. The relevant regulator, APRA, has strong prudential engagement with AIG - indeed, as it has all across the sector. The Australian businesses which are regulated by APRA are required to hold assets in Australia that exceed their liabilities in Australia. They are required to do that. But, nevertheless, because there could be flow-on effects, APRA is continuing to talk to the local subsidiaries. We do need to distinguish between the impacts on the international operations and on their Australian subsidiaries. The Australian subsidiaries are working within the framework that APRA has put out there.The regulators are doing everything they possibly can to ensure that the events internationally have minimal impact on policyholders, whether they be general insurance or the life insurance component. That is what APRA is doing as we speak. Of course, we will continue to see further volatility on global markets. There will be companies in this country which are investors in the international operations of that company, so we might expect some impacts on companies similar to the impacts we have seen, for example, from those that were investing in Lehman Brothers.What I can say - and I think this is very important and we should continue to shout it from the rafters - is that our banking system in particular is well regulated and it is well capitalised, as is our insurance industry. We have seen what happened in the past when that was not the case. That is why it is so important that we do put in a broader response to this international volatility that has been going on since last August. That is one of the reasons why the government committed to a financial claims scheme so promptly. That is why the government have been absolutely determined to implement all of the recommendations of the Financial stability review. We have been doing that. Part of that is encouraging firms with exposure to disclose those as quickly as possible and part of that has been to get a commitment to a financial claims scheme in this country should the worst happen to one of our deposit-taking institutions.As many people in this House might well recall, there have been recommendations to a recommendation to the previous government about establishing such a scheme. In fact, the original recommendation for a financial claims scheme came from the HIH royal commission. The member for North Sydney would, of course, remember that. We have acted on that recommendation - something the previous government did not do and did not follow through on. I am pleased to say there has been bipartisan support for the Financial Claims Scheme that we have put forward. It is currently out there for industry consultation. It has been through the cabinet, and it will be going to parliament in the not-too-distant future.Since August last year, and since we have been in power, we have been acutely aware of the danger to the Australian economy flowing from these events in international capital markets, and we have used every possible lever within our control to prepare our country to make sure that we can survive the situation in the best possible shape. It remains the case that, if you were in any country in the world in these circumstances, the country you would want to be in is Australia.</DOC>

 - The Treasurer has just referred to developments in the last 24 hours in relation to AIG. The government and the financial regulatory authorities in Australia continue to monitor developments closely. Of course, these developments in relation to AIG follow on from recent actions in other respects in the United States by the Federal Reserve. They injected another $70 billion in liquidity into the financial markets overnight, following $70 billion the previous day. They also announced last weekend that they would accept a wider range of collateral for cash loans as a means to calm financial markets. Of course, this follows action in recent weeks to take control over the mortgage institutions Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, pledging up to $200 billion to support them. However, it is important to note also that the Federal Reserve said in their statement of 16 September that 'strains in financial markets have increased significantly' and that they 'will monitor economic and financial developments carefully'.What these developments point to is the fact that we are living in exceptionally difficult global economic times, and we in Australia are not immune from these developments. That is why it is important for all members to be focused on the fact that we the government have a plan to see Australia through these difficult economic times. Firstly, this is anchored in our approach to strong economic management, grounded in a $22 billion budget surplus as a buffer for the future. Secondly, there is our $76 billion nation-building plan for infrastructure in ports, roads, rail and broadband. Thirdly, there is our long-term economic reform agenda to lift long-term productivity growth through an education revolution and through our program of business deregulation as well as our policy of long-term tax reform.On the question relating to immediate developments in the financial sector, the government has also been acting in concert with its own monetary authorities and through international cooperation with the global economy and financial markets to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available. In the last few days there has been action by the European Central Bank to inject some EURO30 billion of liquidity, as well as parallel actions by other central banks around the world. Some months ago in Australia we injected further activity into the government bond market through an action taken with the support of the opposition to the tune of some $25 billion. As just referred to by the Treasurer, we have been in the business of implementing a financial claims scheme to ensure that eligible deposit and insurance policy holders have appropriate protection.These are important national measures which the government has taken in relation to our own financial markets, and we have been acting in concert with others in international financial markets through the Financial Stability Forum and also through the IMF and the G20. It is important to note what the Governor of the Reserve Bank said on this matter just a week or so ago. The governor, Glenn Stevens, said on 8 September:_ what we see in the Australian financial scene is an order of magnitude less troubling than what we see abroad _ Australian financial institutions continue to present a contrasting picture to their peers in the US, Europe and the UK _ Some have had to make provisions for unwise exposures that had been accumulated earlier. But even in these cases, capital, asset quality and profitability remain very sound.Therefore, it is important that we keep the current challenges being presented to us from the global economy and global financial markets in appropriate perspective.As the Treasurer also indicated before, we in this country are better prepared than most to deal with the buffeting which is being presented to other national economies by recent developments in global financial markets. If you look at the continued positive growth generated in the Australian economy in the most recent quarter, you see that it is 0.3 per cent against what is a decisively negative set of numbers across most of the other major global economies. If you were also to go to our inflation rate: while still unacceptably high, it is nonetheless lower than that of the United States. For the first time in seven years we have interest rates that have been reduced by 25 basis points. On the question of employment and unemployment - and this has been the subject of some questioning in this House in recent weeks - the current rate of 4.1 per cent stands at almost the lowest of the other major economies, the US being 5.7 per cent; the UK, 5.3 per cent; Canada, 6.1 per cent; France, 7.3 per cent; Germany, 7.3 per cent; and Italy, 6.5 per cent. We have also had recent positive data in terms of the capital expenditure intentions of Australian private firms.But where I conclude is on the question of what underpins our confidence in the government's policy directions for the future, and that is the strength of the government's budget surplus. On the question of the surplus, we have worked hard through the budget process to ensure that we could deliver a 1.8 per cent of GDP surplus outcome for the year ahead. What I would draw the attention of honourable members to, however, is the fact that that budget surplus position again stands in stark contrast to what we see on the part of many other economies - the United States running at minus 2.4 per cent; the United Kingdom, minus 3.8 per cent; Japan, minus 2.8 per cent; France, minus 2.9 per cent; Germany, plus one per cent; and Italy, minus 2.8 per cent. Therefore our budget circumstances, relative to those which pertain in other major economies, are sound and strong indeed.In order to preserve this buffer for the future, against what is a set of quite challenging international and global economic circumstances, it is important that we do everything we can to preserve that budget surplus. My direct appeal to the new Leader of the Opposition is to unblock the budget in the Senate. My direct appeal to the Leader of the Opposition, as he says he is now in the business of providing economic leadership, is to demonstrate that leadership in the Senate and unblock the $6 billion worth of measures that are currently blocked in the Senate, in order to preserve the budget surplus - a budget surplus which is a necessary buffer in these uncertain economic times for Australia.</DOC>

 - The one glaring omission on the part of those opposite in the measure which they propose is the two-million-plus pensioners they exclude from their proposal. I say to those opposite, in their newfound concern and compassion: what about all those people who are also in couple pensioner arrangements, all those pensioners who are widows, all those who are carers, and all those who are in receipt of the disability support pension? The point I would make to those opposite is: if we are engaged in the business of long-term reform of pensions and the retirement income system, then it must be across the board, not selectively picking out one element in order to demonstrate that there is a headline. That is the first point.The second point is this: the honourable member who is now the Leader of the Opposition barely a year ago sat in the cabinet when the then member for Longman brought forward a proposal to increase the base rate of the pension by $30 - and it is reported in the national daily. My question back to the Leader of the Opposition, in his newfound interest in compassion, is: why did he not act then? Why did he not put his hand up, why did the member for Curtin not put her hand up and why did the member for Higgins not put his hand up to act on the matter when they had the opportunity to do so?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It is a matter of some regret that there have been further troubling developments on the question of Iran's nuclear program. I am deeply concerned by a report released by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, on 15 September - 16 September Australian time - that confirms that Iran is persisting with its uranium enrichment and reprocessing related activities in violation of four legally binding United Nations Security Council resolutions.Regrettably, this shows that Iran has yet again failed to provide the IAEA with the access it needs to give credible assurances about the nature of Iran's nuclear program. The IAEA has comprehensive and detailed information which suggests that Iran has conducted studies into nuclear weapons and that Iranian military entities have been involved in nuclear procurement. Iran continues to dismiss this information as 'forged and fabricated' and continues to hinder the IAEA's investigation into these issues.These actions are not those of a state seeking to address the international community's concern about the nature of its nuclear program. Iran needs to comply immediately with its obligations and suspend its uranium enrichment and reprocessing related activities. It must grant the IAEA the access it needs to remove the international community's justifiable doubts about Iran's peaceful intentions.Australia supports the efforts of the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany - the so-called 'P5 plus 1' group - to engage constructively with Iran and the generous incentives package that the P5 plus 1 group has offered Iran should it suspend its enrichment activities. It is in Iran's interests to accept the incentives package, which represents the best way to resolve the nuclear issue to the benefit of all in the international community. Iran has a clear choice: to cooperate with the international community or to face further isolation from the international community.Australia has made a firm commitment against the spread of nuclear weapons. Australia strongly supports, and has implemented fully, United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iran which target Iran's proliferation sensitive nuclear activities. Australia has also implemented sanctions into domestic law, including financial and travel restrictions as well as a prohibition on the supply of specific goods, services and financing which could assist Iran's nuclear and missile programs.Australia welcomes the European Union agreement in late June to impose new travel and financial sanctions aimed at pressuring Iran to halt uranium enrichment. In light of Iran's continuing failure to comply with its international obligations, the Australian government is considering what further measures it can take within the international community to bring further pressure to bear on Iran. I conclude by reiterating that Iran's noncompliance with legally binding United Nations Security Council resolutions is of grave concern to the international community and remains of continuing and grave concern to the Australian government.</DOC>

That was the formal response by the Liberal Party in response to the Australian budget of this year -  - I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, and he knows exactly what I am talking about, that, if he was really serious about pension reform in the 12 years that the Liberal Party was in office - and let us narrow it right down to the shorter period that he was in cabinet - why was the matter of pensioner reform raised only last year, 12 months ago?

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question, and I note her deep interest in the circumstances of working Australians and their rights at work. Can I confirm to the House that, before the end of this session, the House will consider the substantive bill from the government on the remainder of its workplace relations changes. Can I confirm for members in the House that this bill will deliver on the government's election promises, the things that it took to the Australian people and which the Australian people endorsed at the last election when they rejected the extremism of Work Choices and endorsed the government's Forward with Fairness plans.The legislation will deal with 10 national employment standards that every Australian worker can rely on - 10 national employment standards that can never be ripped away in the way that basic entitlements were ripped off working Australians under Work Choices. The award modernisation process for the remainder of the safety net for workers who earn $100,000 a year or less has already been produced by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. These parts of the safety net, the National Employment Standards and modern simple awards will protect working Australians at work and will be a fairer and simpler system.The legislation will deal with a fair bargaining system, enabling Australian working people to bargain in their workplaces with their employers, enabling them to unleash new productivity gains, which, of course, we have not seen under the divisive Work Choices policies of the Liberal government. The legislation will deal with a one-stop shop - Fair Work Australia - where employers and employees around the nation will be able to get advice, enforcement of industrial awards and agreements, and disputes such as unfair dismissals resolved. The legislation will deal with a new simple unfair dismissal system that gets the balance right, that enables small businesses in particular to get on with the business of managing their business but protects hardworking Australians from being unfairly dismissed. The legislation will include clear, tough rules for dealing with industrial action, because we want cooperation in Australian workplaces.This legislation will be a companion to the legislation already passed by the parliament earlier this year, which ended the making of Australian workplace agreements. Can I remind the House, in case anybody has forgotten, about the damage that those agreements did to hardworking Australians. We know from data collected in May 2006 that, of those hardworking Australians who were confronted with Australian workplace agreements under the industrial extremism still endorsed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, 63 per cent lost penalty rates, 52 per cent had their shift work loadings cut and 51 per cent lost overtime. We know that the opposition, and particularly the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, like to sneer at people who shop for specials. Well, presumably, they were delighted when they saw hardworking Australians have these basic pay and conditions ripped off them.It seems remarkable to me that the Leader of the Opposition can come into the parliament today with concern about the circumstances of Australians when, as a cabinet minister in the Howard government, hardworking Australians would have been not just standing at his door but pounding on his door to tell him about the rip-offs under Work Choices. What did the Leader of the Opposition do about that? Absolutely nothing, except endorse industrial relations extremism.The Leader of the Opposition said: 'Work Choices was the single most important reform to workplace relations in any of our lifetimes.' The Leader of the Opposition might change in terms of who has the job, but one thing never changes about the Liberal Party: they are and always will be the party of Work Choices.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and for interest in fairness at work. As I have just advised the House, we are now in the closing stages of a consultative process which has engaged business - both big and small - and trade unions in consulting on the details of implementation of the government's Forward with Fairness plans, as taken to the Australian people at the last election. - Of course, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is calling out because she does not believe in telling Australians the truth when you go to elections on workplace relations policies. But this is the government that did tell Australians the truth. We took our Forward with Fairness plan to the last election. We have been consulting on its implementation and details. We are about to go through an intensive process through the committee on industrial legislation, where industrial experts will look at the legislation in draft over a 10-day period in order to give their advice on its improvement on the details of its implementation, and then the legislation will be in this parliament.I am asked about obstacles to the implementation of this legislation. I regret to advise the House that there is a clear obstacle, and that is the present policy of the Liberal Party in responding to the government's legislation. We have been advised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the Liberal Party's test as to whether the legislation will be supported by the Liberal Party or opposed by the Liberal Party is whether or not it reintroduces Australian workplace agreements. That is the Liberal Party's test for the government's legislation which implements the policy we were elected on: whether that legislation has grafted onto it the heart of the Work Choices policy that the Australian people rejected at the last election. So presumably, unless the Liberal Party sees the heart of Work Choices - the policy rejected by the Australian people - grafted into the government's legislation, it will deny the Australian people what they want, which is an end to the remainder of Work Choices. Presumably, the Liberal Party is going to thwart the Australian people's desire for the policy that they voted for and instead continue the hated Work Choices legislation.A big decision is coming for the new Leader of the Opposition, and he has got only two choices. He can back in his deputy leader, stand by Work Choices and spit in the face of the Australian people, or he can dump the position of his deputy leader and acknowledge that the Australian people voted for Forward with Fairness and Forward with Fairness is what the Australian people should have. It is a big test for the Leader of the Opposition. He says he is concerned about Australians. He wants us to believe him to be a compassionate man. He supported rip-offs of Australian working families when they were in government. What we are waiting to see is whether he is going to support those rip-offs in opposition. I am not heartened, having looked at what the Leader of the Opposition has had to say in other circumstances about workplace relations. He said the following:You have to free the market to do its work and let the cost of setting the clearing price - be it for labour, shares, home units or loaves of bread - be as low as possible -  
A government member - Aha! - Exactly. He continued:and by that I mean with as few transaction costs as possible.Transaction costs like a minimum wage, transaction costs like an awards system, transaction costs like industrial laws that are fair, transaction costs like a fair bargaining system and transaction costs like unfair dismissals. He wants Australian working people to be treated as if they are loaves of bread. - Isn't it interesting? The man who defended every rip-off in this parliament is up to defend Work Choices. For every rip-off of every family, everybody who ever lost a cent - you were there at this dispatch box defending it. But the choice remains for the Leader of the Opposition: he dump his deputy, vote for what the Australian people voted for, or come clean on his plans to take Work Choices further and to make sure Australian working people are treated as if they are chattels; because that is clearly what he has said in the past.</DOC>

 - As I said in response to the question from the member for Sturt, the government's view on terrorism is hard line, and that means through the prosecution agencies; it means in supporting the independence of our judiciary. Obviously members of the bench are going to take exception from time to time with statements from members of the government or members of the public or, for that matter, members of the opposition. I stand entirely by this government's position, which is that we will take a hard line on terrorism in the future, without fear or favour.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for her question and for her ongoing interest in infrastructure, particularly in the growing part of South-East Queensland. This government has made infrastructure a key part of our economic reform program. We have established Infrastructure Australia and put $20 billion into the Building Australia Fund. Our recognition of the importance of infrastructure investment has been widely applauded by industry - people who, for years, were crying out for national coordination of infrastructure; people who were arguing for a pipeline of projects to be available on infrastructure in ports, in roads, in rail, in broadband and in energy. All of these areas have suffered from an infrastructure deficit.Just this morning I addressed a gathering of the Tourism &amp; Transport Forum, members of which I welcome to question time today. The TTF this morning produced a compact. It is a document that calls for greater public investment in infrastructure. It is a document that talks about the need to deal with urban congestion in our cities. It is a document that calls for the need to unclog our ports. It is a document that is consistent with the principles being established by this government's nation-building agenda.The Tourism &amp; Transport Forum, many members of which are sitting up there in the gallery, are not affiliated with the Fabian Society! This is not some left-wing gathering. This is a gathering of Australia's business leaders - the likes of Clayton Utz, IBM, Leightons, David Jones, ABN AMRO, Bilfinger Berger, Multiplex, Macquarie, Qantas, the NRMA, the Commonwealth Bank; I see many of them, the captains of industry, up there in the gallery - all supporting an infrastructure agenda and all arguing for the Building Australia Fund.But what do we have from those across on the other side of the chamber? What we had when this question was asked was an interjection from the Leader of the National Party, of all things, who interjected that it is just a slush fund - complete opposition; ignoring it for 12 years and then opposing the nation-building agenda of the government.Just yesterday the member for Calare said once again that public transport in Australia's capital cities was solely the job of state governments; once again repeating the argument that it had nothing to do with the Commonwealth; once again repeating what they played out in action over 12 long years of neglect - that it had nothing to do with the Commonwealth government. But, of course, as the people present this morning at the seminar know, if the opposition succeeds in blowing a $6.2 billion hole in the budget, then what that means is less money in the long-term investment funds that were established as a part of the Rudd Labor government's budget in May.So out of touch are the opposition - not only with working Australians but with people who, from time to time, would be seen as some of their traditional supporters - that they are ignoring their calls also. But as a reborn friend of the battler, the Leader of the Opposition, from Struggle Street in Point Piper, should ensure not only that he defends working Australians but that he gets in touch with the business community of this country. -  -  - </DOC>

It is a piece of theatre from central casting as confected as the member for Wentworth's recent discovery of compassion for pensioners - which did not exist as of four months ago. -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. The benefit of your intervention just now is to underline the absolute hypocrisy of those opposite. Here we are, debating a matter which they believe - or argue - is of such sensitivity that it should not be the subject of political comment, and what do they do? They make it the subject of political comment. I find it remarkable. The harder the question goes to whether the government is serious about terrorism -  -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. He certainly has a good following in Leichhardt - I am not sure about in the chamber. The government is committed to delivering long-term, sustainable growth for the future Australian economy, and all of the major domestic policy initiatives of the government are connected to this ultimate objective, whether in infrastructure, the Education Revolution, the national broadband network, the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme or, most particularly, delivering a strong budget surplus that puts downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. That is particularly important in the event that we have further problems in international financial markets like what we have seen over the past few days. That simply underlines the importance of having strong fiscal settings and a very strong budget surplus in this country.I note that the new Leader of the Opposition has described the international financial circumstances as 'the gravest economic crisis globally in any of our lifetimes'. It certainly is a very serious financial crisis internationally, but some might debate whether the wider implications for the global economy are equivalent to things like the 1970s oil shock or the recessions of the early 1980s or early 1990s. Time will perhaps tell. I note the Leader of the Opposition is a bit sensitive on this point.There is no question that there are very serious challenges facing the global economy. Australia is not immune from the implications of these challenges, but we are well positioned - indeed, better positioned than almost any other developed nation in the world - to ride out these challenges. We still have reasonably strong economic growth, low unemployment, good regulators, strongly capitalised banks, a strong budget surplus and, of course, money continuing to flow from the mining boom and particularly strong business investment, as the most recent data indicates. We are well placed to deal with these problems, and it is very important that we take a balanced view of the nature of these challenges and do not talk down the Australian economy. I note that the Leader of the Opposition's sole criticism of the Treasurer -  -  - I note that the sole criticism, the sole point of any coherence made by the Leader of the Opposition, previously the shadow Treasurer, was the claim that the Treasurer was talking down the Australian economy. When we look at his current rhetoric, it would perhaps be pertinent if he took some of his own advice and gave a slightly more balanced perspective on the challenges that are facing the Australian economy, because there are real-world people out there who are making spending choices and investment decisions based on, amongst other things, where the Australian economy is seen to be heading by Australia's political leaders. So it would be important if the Leader of the Opposition were to take a balanced perspective on these things, because it is extremely important that the true position, the balanced perspective on these things, is conveyed to the Australian people.We do have serious challenges, but we also have good settings to deal with those challenges. I note that the Leader of the Opposition has been seeking to cast a bit of cover on who he really is in recent times. He indicated that, because he lived in a flat for a time as a kid or something, he is the great representative of Struggle Street and the battlers. - I am afraid this is entirely relevant. Unfortunately for the Leader of the Opposition, the Australian people are less interested in whether you come from privilege than whether you represent privilege. That is the truth of the opposition leader's position. In spite of pretending to be the man from the battlers -  - In spite of portraying himself as the new-found friend of the battlers, the Leader of the Opposition was very recently an integral part of a government that gave the Australian people Work Choices - an industrial relations regime that tore away their penalty rates, their overtime and all the protections that lower paid battlers rely on in the workplace to give them some bargaining power.He is also part of an opposition - as shadow Treasurer and now as the Leader of the Opposition - that is engaged in an exercise in the Senate to blow a very large hole in the budget surplus in order to fight for lower taxes for Ferrari buyers, Porsche buyers and Rolls-Royce buyers. He is also engaged in an action in the Senate to rip apart the budget surplus to defend the interests of big alcohol companies so that teenage girls can buy cheaper alcopops. He is also engaged in a vandalism exercise in the Senate to maintain a tax lurk that was put in place for big oil companies 30 years ago as a kick-start to new projects.So the man who says that we are in the biggest economic crisis globally in our lifetime is at the same time engaged in an exercise in the Senate to rip apart the budget surplus, which is one of the key buffers for the Australian government and the Australian people in dealing with the consequences of the international crisis. Why? Because he is defending the interests of privileged, well-off Australians. The issues that he is pursuing and that the opposition is pursuing ultimately come back to who they really are, and that is the representatives of the better-off in our society. - The Leader of the Opposition has given nine major media interviews in the past 24 hours since becoming Leader of the Opposition. He has not once mentioned health. He has not once mentioned education. He has talked an awful lot about himself, but there has been no new significant policy initiative to deal either with the economic problems coming from the international crisis or indeed with the wider interests of working people in this country. The Rudd government is committed to looking after the interests of working people and to investing for the long-term future of the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - Obviously the matter raised by the honourable member is one that has been dealt with by the courts and, as the Attorney-General himself indicated on Monday, his comments were not directed at matters which were still before the courts. As Attorney-General, it is his role to assure the community that all agencies are working hard to protect Australians. -  - I would say to the barracking new Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, this: on the question of terrorism, this government makes no apology for taking a hard line. It makes no apology for making clear-cut statements to the Australian community that we will not brook -  -  - On the matters which went to the substance of the questions concerning the Attorney-General, I have responded to those, including the one that went to this government's credentials in the fight against terrorism. I can simply say to those opposite that that has been a large part of what has been put before us. We take a hard line. We make no apology for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Shortland for her question and I note what a very strong interest she has when it comes to aged-care places and community care places. Australians have the second longest life expectancy in the world, which is great news, and currently there are some 2.8 million Australians, about 13 per cent of our population, aged 65 years and over. This number is expected to triple over the next 40 years, and an Australian born today can expect to reach 81.4 years of age, which is great news.To meet these challenges over the next four years, the Australian government is investing more than $40 billion when it comes to aged care, $28.6 billion of that on nursing homes alone. We acted because for the last 12 years the previous government neglected aged care. They were always talking down the aged-care sector. Well, we are committed to fixing that. In fact, no Australian government has committed more funding to aged care than the Rudd Labor government. - One of the major challenges of an ageing population is to find ways to help nursing home providers to set up beds in areas of high need. That is why we established the zero real interest loans and associated places round: to meet that specific need. Members of this chamber will be very pleased to hear that stage 1 has been a huge success. As a result of this plan, there will be 1,348 new nursing home beds and more than 100 community care packages in areas of high need. This is stage 1 of our election commitment. -  - I hear someone asking, 'Where are they?' I will outline that. This includes 375 new places in Western Australia, valued at $46.6 million; 154 new places in Tasmania, valued at $16.07 million; 293 new places in New South Wales, valued at $30 million; 246 new beds in Victoria, valued at $19.7 million; 259 new places in Queensland, valued at $24.7 million; and 128 new beds in South Australia, valued at $12.8 million. This is about providing nursing home beds through low-cost finance in areas where they were previously very unlikely to be established. We will now build on this very successful plan in developing stage 2 of zero real interest loans, and we will examine further ways to create more nursing home beds in areas of high need. As I said before, for 12 years under the previous government aged care was neglected. This government is committed to meeting the challenges of the 21st century, including our ageing population.</DOC>

 - I appreciate the member's question. What I said at the outset in my press conference on Monday was:The jury is still deliberating on charges against two individuals and the court orders remain in place in respect to those matters, so, as such, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on detail relating to those matters.I went on:However, I welcome the convictions that have been handed down today.They were in respect of six individuals. For the record, might I say in respect of the Leader of the Opposition's comments about reckless comments that, as I understand it, the defence counsel, in a submission that went to nearly two pages of transcript, challenged two of my comments. The first was where I said:Successful prosecutions are of course important, vitally important, in sending a clear message to those who may be influenced by violent extremism.That was one quote the defence counsel took objection to. The second statement the defence counsel took objection to was:The seriousness of the offences involved in this case highlights why we must do all we can to ensure the public's security.They were the two comments that the defence counsel took exception to, in some two pages of transcript.In terms of the member's question, can I say - and it should be put on the record - that we certainly appreciate the work of the court. There was tremendous pressure on the court, the judge, the staff and the jury. We recognise the tremendous work. The trial went from February this year, with over 50 witnesses and 6,000 pages of evidence - a tremendous workload undertaken by the court. But in my comments on Monday - and I will table the transcript shortly - I specifically stated that my comments were not directed at matters still before the court.While the defence counsel has a professional obligation to defend the interests of his client, my role as Attorney-General is to ensure public safety. In the face of six convictions being handed down, I saw it as my role to assure the community that all agencies are working hard to protect the safety of all Australians.The other point I made in my statement on Monday was that it is important to recognise the role played by members of the Muslim community in assisting with the investigation. In other words, while, yes, certainly individuals have been convicted of very serious offences in these proceedings, this does not reflect upon the Australian Muslim community generally. I thought it important to make those points in the context of the widespread media reporting that was inevitably going to occur. - I will not be long in concluding, but it was important to reassure the community that it was also important to specifically acknowledge the assistance provided by Muslim Australians, a fact specifically acknowledged by -  - What has it got to do with the issue? In the context where there was to be widespread media coverage of very significant, very alarming events, it was very, very important that we took steps to ensure that the integrity of our vibrant and multicultural society was protected, and it was important in both respects to reassure the community. Going back to comments made by the Prime Minister, our role is not to defend the accused; our role is to defend public safety. And, again, I would like to recognise the tremendous work of the Australian Federal Police, the Victorian police, ASIO and the Commonwealth Department of Public Prosecutions. Individually and collectively these agencies have done an outstanding job. Once again, let me for the record indicate the government's respect and appreciation for the work of the court in managing this long and complex matter.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to do that for the member for Bass because we know on this side of that House that this measure will provide tax relief to nearly half a million Australians, and unfortunately the opposition does not see fit to, at this stage, support that tax relief. We have a new Leader of the Opposition and he announced yesterday:I know what it is like to be very short of money _ I know Australians are doing it tough and some Australians, even in the years of greatest prosperity, will always do it tough.Now he has the opportunity to put some substance behind that commitment and he could, if he chose to, direct his senators to vote for tax relief that would assist nearly half a million Australians who indeed are doing it tough. The new Leader of the Opposition has a chance to nail his colours to the mast. If he understands that some people are short of money and doing it tough, this is an opportunity for him to provide tax relief immediately to nearly half a million Australians. And, particularly for the benefit of the new Leader of the Opposition, I want to read out an email - one of many that have been sent to those of us on this side of the House and, I am sure, to some on the other side of the House - from one couple who said:I am writing to you to thank you for increasing the threshold on the Medicare levy surcharge. As you are aware, this threshold has been set for many years, not taking into account the rising cost of living. For the first time in 12 years we have a government that is looking after working-class families and does not seem intent on punishing us for not being able to afford a higher standard of living. I had to wait for two years to get surgery and still cannot afford to go to the dentist. We are not choosing to not have private health insurance; we simply cannot afford it.I say to the new Leader of the Opposition, after nine interviews yesterday that were all about this man sitting over here, there are half a million Australians who would actually like to know whether he is prepared to provide tax relief to those families. For average income families, many families, it is $1,000 or $1,200 that could go into their pockets straightaway, and the opposition is blocking this move in the Senate. It is a chance for the new Leader of the Opposition, instead of talking about himself, to tell those people what he will do to provide tax relief to them.</DOC>

 - For a start, in answering the Leader of the Opposition's question, Mr Benbrika's convictions had been confirmed at the time of my statement. If I can refer to the submissions from the Crown - these were made before his Honour:In our submission it is clear from the context of what was said by the Attorney-General that he was there speaking in respect to those counts in which a verdict of guilt had been returned, that is, concluded. In any event nothing in the passages where he expressed the views he has in our submission could reasonably be taken as being in any fashion an observation upon those counts which were yet to be decided. It is clear enough, we would submit, from the introduction of what he has to say, that he recognises the jury is still deliberating - Which I did. - and in respect of those 'it is inappropriate for me to comment on the detail relating to those matters.'That is the quote from me. The Crown went on:It is expressed from what he is saying that he is speaking in respect of counts that the jury have delivered.And that was most certainly the case. His Honour dismissed the application by the defence - who I might say had made a number of applications during the course of these proceedings for the discharge of the jury - and made, in all bar two pages of transcript, a submission here.I was asked about the purpose of my comments. I can simply repeat my answer: my comments were not directed to the matter before the courts. I specifically stated that. It was my role as Attorney-General to reassure the community that our security agencies were doing all that they reasonably could to protect their safety. I also saw it as very important that while, yes, individuals had been convicted of very serious offences, the blame for conduct of those individuals should not be sheeted home to the broader Muslim community.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I know that he is a person who is absolutely committed to improving our trade performance.In the context of the financial uncertainty that surrounds us, it is timely that the government provide Australian business and the broader community with certainty and confidence on the way forward. That is why improving our trade performance has become even more important. There are two contexts for this. The first is that world trade grows much faster than world output - in fact, by a multiple of three - so improving our trade performance increases our options. The second context is what we inherited from the previous government. Not only did they bequeath us high inflation but they also bequeathed us a woeful trade performance - 72 consecutive monthly trade deficits, record high trade deficits, record high current account deficits and record high foreign debt. In fact, during their 11 years of office, net exports only had a positive contribution to GDP in two of those years. Contrast that to when Labor were in office. We achieved that positive contribution to GDP from net exports on 10 occasions. That is why we do need to turn our trade performance around. Net exports must once again make a positive contribution to economic growth.In the time that we have been in office we have embarked upon a two-pronged approach to trade: trade liberalisation and structural reforms to make us more competitive. On the trade liberalisation front, we recalibrated our trade negotiation priorities to make Doha and a conclusion to that round central to our approach. In fact, this is a government that played itself back into relevance in the Doha Round. The fact is that we are 80 per cent of the way to a successful conclusion to the Doha Round. If successful, it will see tariffs on goods come down, agricultural tariffs come down by up to 70 per cent, domestic agricultural subsidies in the US cut to $14Â½ billion, tariff quotas increased and agricultural export subsidies eliminated. It is significant because it provides greater certainty to the business community and it is also an important platform for further liberalisation.On the question of free trade agreements, let me make this observation: the previous government said that that was its priority. In 11 years of office those opposite succeeded in achieving outcomes in only three FTAs. In the nine months that we have been in office not only have we concluded two FTAs but we have unfrozen the stalled talks that they got into with China and brought forward the free trade agreement with India feasibility study. Given the importance of both India and China and the strong domestic demand that they still generate, these are important developments. As for the ASEAN free trade agreement that we concluded, let me make this point: this is the fastest growing region of the world. It collectively has $71 billion in two-way trade and it is bigger than the US, bigger than China and bigger than Japan. It is a Labor government that brought conclusion to those negotiations. That is a demonstration of our commitment to turning around the trade performance.Our response to Mortimer will address those structural reforms, and I will have more to say about that at a later stage. But the Rudd government, after some very terrible years on the trade performance front from the other side, is providing greater certainty for Australian businesses, greater certainty for our exporters and greater confidence to our community. The government has a lot to repair from the mismanagement and sclerotic shape that those opposite left our trade performance in.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to get the question on the day that the National Party have been reduced to single figures in the chamber. - I also note that, among the different references that the member for Gippsland has just made, he did not refer to the conversations with my office today at the meeting that he had with my office today and the advice that he was given today in terms of the specific engagement with the process. I would also add that I met with the Chair of the National Rural Advisory Council the Sunday before last, and on that occasion we went through the issues with Gippsland. He made clear at that point that there would be a new assessment, that the original survey that was done was a desktop assessment and that they -  - would be going through and looking at a reassessment of the Gippsland area. The important thing on the process and on the engagement is to understand the pathway through. As I reminded the member for Gippsland, yesterday when I made that comment was when I was explaining the process, and he stood up in this place and said, 'Oh, but what about the farmers in Gippsland?' It is the process that delivers for them - it is by engaging in that. That is why he can look to his left, he can look to his right and he will find he is surrounded by members of parliament on that side of the chamber who have engaged in an entirely different way in making sure that they get the recommendations dealt with by the National Rural Advisory Council so that those recommendations come back to me to make sure that exceptional circumstances reassessments are done, and done in a timely fashion.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chifley for his question. Of course, Australians around the country know about the impact of skills shortages. Whether you are running a major project in the north-west of this country or trying to get a plumber or another tradesperson to attend to a small job at your home, the consequences of skills shortages are in your face.This is a skills crisis that has built up over 12 long years and which the government is urgently addressing. We have made available 42,000 training places under the Productivity Places Program of the government, and these training places provide job seekers with qualifications from certificate II level to diploma level. So oversubscribed has this program been, so popular has it been, with people taking the places and commencing training - and, indeed, some have completed training and they are now in jobs - that I have recently announced an additional investment of $45.5 million for an additional 15,000 training places to be available to job seekers.We are acting to address Australia's skills crisis, and the skills crisis shows throughout Australian society. Indeed, it is somewhat bemusing to me that we have seen a bit of a skills crisis on display today in the House of Representatives. We have seen the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition morph into senior counsel and junior counsel. He is back in his spy catcher days; she is back in her days of defending CSR against claims by people who got mesothelioma in Wittenoom. And they think that that is leadership for the country - senior counsel and junior counsel! Well, it might make a difference if you were at the bar trying to earn money as a Queen's Counsel, but what Australians actually want is leadership. So I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition they might want to think about those political skills -  - Can I just say on the question of skills shortages - and having been a lawyer in the past - that, if I were picking a side on CSR and Wittenoom, I am glad I picked the side of the injured workers. I am proud of that. I am proud I did not defend the company against those claims. I am actually proud of that. On the question of these skills we have seen on display today, can I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that his job is not the Spycatcher trials but to outline some policy for the Australian people. He might want to start with skills shortages. He might want to move to health. He might try telling us what he is going to do when the Forward with Fairness legislation comes into the parliament. Will he be defending Work Choices, or voting the way the Australian people want him to vote? We are looking forward to a bit of exercise of political skills on those things.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Liberal Party indicated only a few months ago he had no policy to increase the pension. That is the first point. - The interjection from the Leader of the Liberal Party is, 'We didn't have one then but we've got one now.' -  - The further interjection from the Leader of the Liberal Party is, 'We don't make policy on the run.' I would have thought that when you deliver the budget reply, which was then delivered on behalf of the opposition, that is the formal response to the government's position. In that government budget we outlined our proposal to increase the allocations to pensioners through the utilities allowance and the telephone allowance, which actually represented something like a doubling, almost, of the additional payments to pensioners made in the previous Liberal budget. That is the first point. - The second part of the answer is that, consistent with the position again adopted by the Liberal Party in support of the Senate inquiry on pensions and retirement incomes, that review is underway. That is the review which you also called for, and the government will deliver a comprehensive package of reform based on it.The third part is this: the proposal put forward by the Liberal Party excludes 2.2 million pensioners - carers, widows, and others. We, therefore, do not believe in that sort of policy on the run. We believe in comprehensive reform. That is what is necessary for all pensioners and carers out there - not the single, opportunistic call on domestic party politics which has been made by those opposite.</DOC>

 - The Australian economy faces tough global economic times. The developments in US financial markets during the course of this week have underlined that fact. There was more uncertainty in financial markets in the United States overnight. Stocks fell in the US, with the S&amp;P 500 down nearly five per cent. Financial stocks were particularly weak, with the S&amp;P financial index losing nearly nine per cent. Approximately US$4.4 trillion of market value has been erased from global stocks this week.This is a very significant global financial crisis that we are in the midst of. Honourable members will be, in part, familiar with the US regulators' response, including the action by the Federal Reserve to lend up to US$85 billion to the American International Group, AIG, the significant global insurer which was the subject of some discussion in the House yesterday. The Fed said:The Board determined that, in current circumstances, a disorderly failure of AIG could add to already significant levels of financial market fragility and lead to substantially higher borrowing costs, reduce household wealth, and materially weaker economic performance.The US Treasury also issued a statement overnight announcing that it will sell more debt to enable the Federal Reserve to expand its balance sheet to accommodate any subsequent bailouts. The program will start immediately with a US$40 billion auction of 35-day bills. The proceeds will provide cash for use by the Fed as it seeks to boost liquidity in credit markets.Furthermore, in another development in the last 24 hours - and the government welcomes this particular development - the US Securities and Exchange Commission has taken action to strengthen investment projections against naked short selling. The SEC actions apply to the securities of all public companies, including all companies in the financial sector. The SEC chairman, Christopher Cox, has said:These several actions today make it crystal clear that the SEC has zero tolerance for abusive naked short selling.The IMF managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has said in relation to future developments in global financial markets, 'We continue to anticipate a gradual global growth recovery in 2009.' I note, in particular, that the IMF's managing director has been very, very balanced with his remarks about the state of US and global financial institutions over the course of the last 12 months.Australia is not immune from these developments in the global economy, but we are better placed than most to weather the current economic and financial storm. I have been in contact with our regulators, including APRA, the RBA and the Treasury. We are, in fact, closely monitoring the situation on a daily basis. APRA today advised me of their assessment of developments around AIG, HBOS and other relevant financial institutions. Their advice is as follows:Australian deposit taking and insurance companies supervised by APRA are well-capitalised, profitable, and well-regulated, and are weathering the turmoil well. Australian depositors and insurance policy holders can be confident in the soundness of Australian financial institutions.That was from John Laker, the chairman of APRA.The government has already taken action to advance the financial claims scheme, which was recommended by the Financial Stability Forum in April this year and had also been the subject of domestic recommendation here in Australia five years ago. The government has also been actively implementing other Financial Stability Forum recommendations concerning strengthening the prudential oversight of capital, liquidity and risk management; enhancing transparency and valuation; implementing changes in the roles and uses of credit ratings; strengthening the authority's responsiveness to risks; and establishing robust arrangements for dealing with stress in the financial system. It is not just Australian national action which is required in these areas but also appropriate international action.The Australian government and the Australian economic regulators have been in daily contact with their American counterparts in recent days, given this most recent spate of developments in financial markets. Earlier this year, in March, I met with Secretary of the Treasury, Hank Paulson; the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Kimmitt; the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke; the Chairman of the Securities Exchange Commission, Christopher Cox; and the Managing Director of the IMF, Dominique Strauss-Kahn. Also on that occasion, when in the United Kingdom, I met with the Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King. When I am in the United States next week my intention is also to continue contact with the US regulators at this difficult time. I will be meeting with the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I will also be meeting with the President of the World Bank and other representatives of the critical regulating agencies of the US financial system.These levels of contacts are necessary in the current environment for the simple reason that we face a series of global developments in global financial institutions which are, of themselves, significant in terms of confidence across the global economy. For our regulators and for the government to be aware of likely future actions on the part of the US regulators is of paramount importance to the continued health of Australia's financial institutions as well. If I could conclude with this remark, it is important at times like this -  -  - This seems to be the subject of some hilarity on the part of various members on the front bench. We do not regard these developments as faintly unserious; they are of a deeply serious quality. It is important on occasions such as this that, in fact, we have a responsible economic and political commentary from the heads of political parties in this country.I noticed earlier today some loose commentary on the part of the alternative Prime Minister of Australia concerning the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and remarks which he had made. I say to the Leader of the Liberal Party that, whether he approves or disapproves of the language of a particular speech given by the Reserve Bank governor, the most important thing is that, at times like this, at times of great global financial crisis, no-one - repeat: no-one - including the Leader of the Opposition, cast any doubt over the authority of the public statements by the Reserve Bank governor about the health of this nation's financial institutions.</DOC>

 - The honourable member, the Leader of the Opposition, has drawn my attention to his remarks earlier today, and I indeed will respond to his remarks earlier today where, in commenting on the Reserve Bank governor's statement about Australia's strength and resilience, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'It's just a question of language.' - The honourable member's question referred to his remarks this morning. The question he was asked this morning was as follows:Do you take comfort from the words of the Reserve Bank Governor yesterday that '_ conditions in Australian banks are light years away from what's happening in other banking systems around the world?'Mr Turnbull said:Yes, I do take comfort from that. I don't know that I'd use the word 'light years', I think.He was asked:Is he wrong?'Mr Turnbull said:_ I'd express it slightly differently.My point is that, at a time of significant, global financial crisis, the challenge here is not to provide rolling literary commentary on the content of the Reserve Bank governor's speech but is this: either you support the authority of the governor's statements on the robustness of Australia's financial institutions or you seek to separate yourself from them. You chose the latter, trying to make a political point, and you are rightly condemned for so doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question because honourable members would be aware that it has been a very difficult week in global financial markets. Of course, stock markets have fallen substantially in the last few days. We have seen the fourth largest investment bank in the US go bankrupt and the third largest bought out by the Bank of America. And, of course, we have seen that lifeline given by the Federal Reserve to AIG. Overnight we have seen the UK's fifth and sixth largest banks in merger talks. So this is a serious time in global financial markets - a very serious time - and that is why the Prime Minister and I have been in regular contact with our regulators. And, of course, we have been in regular contact with our counterparts internationally as well. As the Prime Minister said before, we have been advised by APRA that Australian deposit-taking institutions and insurance companies, supervised by APRA, are well capitalised, profitable and well regulated, and they are weathering this storm pretty well. It is the case that our banks are well capitalised; it is the case that our banks are well regulated.Let us consider this one fact. Australia's largest four banks are among only 12 of the world's top 100 banks with a AA credit rating or more. That is what we mean when we say that our banking institutions are well regulated and well capitalised. What it does mean is that the situation in this country, when it comes to our banking sector, is light years away from what is happening in the United States. What the Leader of the Opposition did today, when he was commenting on the speech of the Reserve Bank governor, was to fundamentally question the Reserve Bank governor's assessment of our banking system. That is what he did. It is not a very smart thing to do; in fact, it is an unwise thing to do in the circumstances in which we find ourselves. He will begin to learn that this motormouth approach to politics does not serve him well in these circumstances. This was the Treasury spokesman who, before the budget, said inflation was a fairytale. This was the Treasury spokesman who, before the budget, said there was no need for spending cuts and no need for a significant surplus. This was the Treasury spokesman who, after the budget, said that we had not cut hard enough. This was the Treasury spokesman who said we should have had a bigger surplus - and this is now the Leader of the Opposition who was raiding that surplus. He is consistently inconsistent, because he is out there all the time promoting himself. He is not out there promoting the national interest.All members could see it here before, when he asked the question of the Prime Minister. You could see his sense of self-satisfaction just waft out; he was quoting himself. The problem is that when you are the Leader of the Opposition you have to be responsible. I say this to the member for Wentworth: the Leader of the Opposition has to be responsible in the language they use. And they have an obligation to be even more responsible at a time of global financial turbulence. That is why those opposite should not be raiding the surplus to the tune of $20 billion. It is a surplus we need, at a time of global uncertainty, to act as a buffer against that global uncertainty. What we do not need is those irresponsible statements from the Leader of the Opposition undermining confidence in our banking sector.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for the question. It is a serious question and a serious issue. I do not think it is appropriate in the House for us to be doing anything that would be unnecessarily scaring the markets. We on this side of the House take very seriously that the regulation not just of the health insurance industry but of a range of other insurance and banking industries needs to be taken care of in this difficult time.I am not going to try to answer this on the run, because I think that it is far more important to make sure that we dignify what is a serious question, in difficult financial circumstances, with a careful response. I will consult with both the Treasurer and our minister responsible for prudential regulation in the other place to see if there are any issues that are of current concern to the health industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know that in his community the role of local government is particularly important, as the role of local government is across our nation. Today the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, and the President of the Australian Local Government Association, Paul Bell, and I announced that here, in late November, we would convene the first meeting of the Australian Council of Local Governments. That will be an important gathering, because we hope it is going to bring together representatives from each of this nation's 565 local councils.The reason we are doing this is that local government is one of the critical arms of the fabric of this country's administration. We talk about reforming the federation; that is important. That is the relationship between Canberra and the states. But the missing third arm of this administrative arrangement in Australia is local government. That is why we need to make sure that we have a proper consultative arrangement with local government into the future. We need to make sure that the infrastructure responsibilities of local government can be delivered at the local level. There was a report in recent times by the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers which found that there was a $1.13 billion annual underspend on infrastructure renewal at the local government level and a $14.5 billion backlog in infrastructure renewal work. We regard local governments as partners with the Australian national government's nation-building program for Australia, because state governments are critical in this respect; and local governments also have a critical role to play. That is why we wish to bring the heads of local government to Canberra to engage them on our future strategy.Local government across Australia performs a critical function. The numbers speak for themselves: 657,000 kilometres of road across Australia; $150 billion-plus worth of invested infrastructure across Australia, under the control of local government; activities worth some $22 billion a year, employing some 168,000 people. Local government has to become much more of a central part of the national affairs of this country. The government, through the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and through others, intend to take that challenge seriously. Therefore, prior to the election we committed ourselves to the establishment of an Australian Council of Local Governments. We now, with the statement today, honour that commitment. Come the end of November we will convene in the Great Hall of this parliament representatives from each of those 565 local authorities. Two specific matters, and possibly a third, will be on the agenda. One is: how do we the national government now partner with local authorities in their local infrastructure needs in the future? This is a critical area for the future. It is a critical area needing reform; it is a critical area needing extra financial assistance to underpin that reform. That is agenda item No. 1.Agenda item No. 2 is the particular needs - the planning needs, the development needs, the urban design needs - of our major cities. As I travelled across the country, as I am sure my colleague the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has, and saw the state of public transport across Australia and the other critical urban design needs of our major cities, I acknowledged that it is a crying shame what needs to be done, what needs to be invested and that is why, in part, we have our nation-building fund as well.The third item is this: prior to the last election we undertook to provide constitutional recognition for local government. In doing so, we intend to get the direct views of local government about what form that should take. Rather than Canberra handing down to the states a form of language to be put to a referendum we would much rather engage with local government on the most appropriate language to be considered for inclusion, by way of amendment, in our Constitution.This is a significant new area of national reform for the government: firstly, to ensure that we have a regular, annual national Australian Council of Local Governments meeting here in Canberra with the full cabinet of the Commonwealth; secondly, to use that as a means to reform the way in which the national government delivers infrastructure funding and assistance to local government; and, thirdly, to look particularly at the language -  - that we will then subsequently put to the people by way of constitutional change. This is an important area of national reform for the nation. Nation building is the business of this government, including what we do out of Canberra, what we do with the states, whether they be Labor or Liberal, and what we also do with local government, whether they be Independent, Labor or Liberal. Nation building transcends party politics.</DOC>

 - The opposition is on a very slippery slope here. There are thousands of Australian businesses and families out there which depend on the confidence in the financial institutions and other institutions in this country to ensure that their economic circumstances are in reasonable shape. - Don't worry, I'll get to the question. - I did mention this in passing in an answer to a question yesterday, but it is something that the opposition needs to think very carefully about - that is, we face very difficult circumstances in this economy as a result of the financial situation in the United States. That has a significant potential impact on a range of things in Australia, but we are very well placed -  - I will get to the specific point if you will just hold off for a moment. We are very well placed in this country to ride out these very difficult circumstances. But one of the critical factors in this is confidence in our institutions and in our major organisations, and the opposition is getting onto a very slippery slope by deliberately seeking to undermine confidence in the -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. As the shareholder minister for Medibank Private I have had recent direct contact with Medibank Private in the ordinary course of events with respect to their corporate plan and financial circumstances. At the time that occurred, which was very recent - I cannot give you a specific date - their finances were in entirely robust shape. I cannot give a specific answer to the question that the shadow minister asked about the six-month period. I am happy to go back to Medibank Private and examine the situation again. But I can assure you that at the most recent time, which was within the last couple of weeks, Medibank Private were in perfectly respectable shape financially. I would also suggest to you that you and your colleagues think very carefully about where you are heading with this line of questioning.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question and for his interest in these issues, the latest instance of which was his hosting of my visit to Gladstone just last week. Today the Prime Minister announced that the government will forge a new partnership with local government, that level of government that is often closest to our communities. That partnership will begin with the inaugural meeting of the Australian Council of Local Governments here in November. We are bringing local government into the heart of the national government, right here in Parliament House. And we are fulfilling a Labor election commitment - another Labor election commitment being fulfilled by this government - because in recent times there has been a disengagement between the Commonwealth and local government.Today we set a new direction. Today we give communities a real voice in the nation's future - a future that is based upon respect for and recognition of the important role that local government plays as the third tier of government, not just in providing local roads and bridges but, most importantly, in terms of service delivery, libraries, child care, environmental and health services, which is why the government is committed to taking steps to recognise local government in the nation's Constitution. That is why we will establish next year the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program.The government recognises that infrastructure is critical to our economic prosperity, and that is why we have a whole-of-government approach. We have established Infrastructure Australia and the Building Australia Fund for nationally significant infrastructure. But we also recognise that local community infrastructure is also important for quality of life, regardless of where Australians live, whether it be in regional communities or in our cities, whether it be in the area of the Brisbane City Council, which has a million people in a growing community, or whether it be in the Shire of East Pilbara, which takes in some 378,000 square kilometres in some of the most remote parts of Australia. That is one of the reasons why already, this year, in the budget, we have delivered record assistance to local government - some $1.9 billion in financial assistance grants. That is why we have extended the Roads to Recovery program for another five years and increased funding by one-quarter of $1 billion over that period of time.Today's announcement has been worked through with the Australian Local Government Association, in meetings that I have had as local government minister, with the various state and territory local government associations, with individual councils - and all of them have said to us, 'Why is it that in the past we have not had that direct relationship?' Well, we are going to give them that direct relationship, beginning with a meeting to be attended by all of the government ministers here in Parliament House, one which will enable us to move forward in this new partnership, today forging that missing link in our federation in terms of the reform that is necessary.</DOC>

 - If the honourable member had actually looked at what I said in my press conference today, he would have noted that, depending on the availability of certain mayors, that date could be shifted. That is what I said. -  - And that is exactly what we have -  -  - Can I suggest -  -  -  - When 29 November was advanced it was said at the same time that, depending on the availability of certain mayors, the actual date could be shifted by a few days. Furthermore, I said in my response to the question today that the event would be held in late November. We will ensure that that continues. But you know something? The key thing here is the reform of the relationship between Canberra and local government. The key thing here is the reform in the relationship between the national government and those who deliver infrastructure services at the local level. The key thing here is as follows: whether you are going to reform the delivery of funding to local government to deliver local infrastructure services. -  - And so, in the riotous celebration on the part of those opposite - led by the member for Higgins, who has come back to life, I notice, all of a sudden - about whether we are going to have the first meeting of the Australian Council of Local Governments on 28 November or a few days either side of it - big point! - the key thing is whether in fact we have any such engagement with local government at all. And I would say to those opposite: if they were faintly engaged in serious national reform, if they were faintly engaged in the need for local government to have constitutional recognition or faintly engaged in the local funding needs of local government, what they would do is endorse what the government is doing rather than seek to make cheap political points.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, because at a time of global economic uncertainty it is important that we have a strong budget surplus. This is not understood by the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition said at his first press conference that he was going to provide new economic leadership. What does that amount to? It amounts to the same old Liberal Party economic leadership - vandalising the surplus in the Senate, economic irresponsibility. I am pleased to tell the House that so far we have seen some responsibility from the minor parties in the Senate. We have seen a lot more economic responsibility from those minor parties - from the Greens, from the Independent, Senator Xenophon, and from Family First - than we have seen from the Liberal Party because they do understand the importance of a budget surplus. They understand the importance of having a strong surplus at a time of global uncertainty and they also understand the importance of that in terms of giving the Reserve Bank room to move when it comes to interest rates.What do we get from the other side? The Leader of the Opposition had his first press conference. It went for 20 minutes, and he spent $20 billion. This is the same spendathon that the member for Higgins introduced the country to in the previous few years. There is absolutely no difference between the member for Wentworth, the previous Leader of the Opposition or the member for Higgins. They are all old-style, big-spend liberals who want interest rates higher for longer. We on this side of the House stand for responsible economic management. Those on that side are utterly irresponsible.</DOC>

We are proud of the fact that in that green paper we put forward a compensation scheme for both households and businesses, particularly those that are strongly affected. For the member not to acknowledge that at all in his question just shows how desperate he is now that there has been a change of leadership in the Liberal Party, and they now do not have any responsible approach to climate change either. We are going to approach this issue in a measured way and in a responsible way, and we are going to do it in a timely way. For 12 long years we had inaction from all of those on that side of the House. The member for Higgins could not even bother to mention the words 'climate change' in any of his budget speeches. What we are getting now is simply more irresponsibility from the new Leader of the Opposition. Desperate to cobble together the numbers, he is now going to walk away from climate change and he is now going to walk away from emissions trading. They are utterly irresponsible and they should be condemned.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. The Rudd government is committed to delivering long-term, sustainable growth in the Australian economy. That is the central focus of our economic policy. While we are dealing with the implications of the international financial crisis centred in the United States, it is very important that we not take our eyes off the longer term - investing for the future of all Australians - and, indeed, the reform task that is associated with that objective. We must not overlook the important structural challenges that we face: a high current account deficit; exports that have been underperforming over a number of years; relatively low savings; inefficient regulation, particularly as between states; and, of course, inadequate infrastructure and skill formation. These are the big issues that the Rudd government is seeking to tackle. The budget, the budget settings and the surplus are the rock on which these policies are based.It is extremely challenging to be dealing with these issues in the international financial circumstances that we face, but the government remains firmly committed to pursuing the long-term reform agenda to build prosperity for the future. The budget surplus puts downward pressure on inflation and interest rates, it delivers money for long-term infrastructure investment through the three infrastructure funds and, of course, it is a buffer against the potential effects of the international financial crisis on the Australian economy.The Liberal Party, the opposition, have been intent upon blowing very substantial holes in the budget surplus through their actions in the Senate. We have seen them attempting to valiantly defend the interests of Porsche, Rolls-Royce and Ferrari buyers; fortunately, with some modifications, it now appears likely that the luxury car tax measure will get through the Senate. But they are still there fighting valiantly for cheaper alcohol for teenage girls for the benefit of big distilling companies, they are still there fighting for tax breaks to continue for big oil companies and, of course, they are still endeavouring to block tax relief for middle-income earners from the impact of the Medicare levy surcharge, which was originally put in place by the former government to apply to higher income earners, not middle-income earners.I note there has been something else by the Liberal Party going on in the Senate today - something that may have implications for the budget surplus - and that is that the Senate Select Committee on State Government Financial Management has handed down a report, recommendation 7 of which is that state governments have the power to impose income tax. This recommendation, I understand, was opposed by the Labor members of this committee. Were state governments, in addition to the federal government, to have powers to impose income taxes, that would have significant implications for the structure of the federal government's finances in ways that are perhaps unpredictable. It might be interesting to know exactly what the Liberal Party has in mind in proposing this particular policy, and no doubt we will hear more of this from the Leader of the Opposition in due course. I will be interested to know his view.Finally, can I reiterate that the government is committed to delivering a very strong budget surplus and to maintaining sound fiscal management. The previous Liberal government left us with inflation at a 16-year high, 10 interest rate increases in a row, government spending growing at five per cent per annum in real terms in the middle of mining boom and, of course, enormous waste and profligacy in government programs and government spending generally.The government is working to sustain the fiscal settings to ensure that we have sustainable long-term growth for the future, that we can improve our export performance, that we can improve our skills basis and that we have better infrastructure for Australian businesses to use. It is about time that the Liberal Party stopped its sabotage in the Senate and got on with the business of thinking about what it actually stands for.</DOC>

 - I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. What, of course, underlies the question is that the Liberal Party remains committed to Work Choices, whereas the government is introducing exactly what it -  - promised the Australian people, which is Forward with Fairness. Forward with Fairness is a way of finding the appropriate balance between prosperity on the one hand and fairness on the other hand. - The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party's question is premised on the false choice that the Liberal Party tried to present to the Australian community in 2007 and which the Australian people rejected. It is premised on the false choice that when you are making workplace relations arrangements you need to choose between prosperity and fairness, between jobs and fairness at work. There is no such false choice alive in our economy. And the Australian people saw right through the Liberal Party's cant about this at the last election. Modern, simple workplace relations is good for workers and it is good for business. Of course, if you are doing things that are good for business, you are doing things that are good for employment.Let me tell you what was bad for business. What was bad for business was the system set up by the former government where agreements went to the back of a 100,000-long queue so businesses did not know what was happening for three months, four months, five months, six months or seven months. Screaming abuse in defence of Work Choices is not going to make that right. Having small businesses wait five, six, seven or eight months under Work Choices to be told what had happened to their agreement -  - after it had gone into a black hole is just one example that shows that proper workplace relations -  - simple, modern, flexible, fair workplace relations - are good for business, good for jobs and good for working people. The Australian people understand that and the government understands that; the only people in the country who do not understand that are the Work Choices supporters over there.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question. I know he has a particularly strong focus on the interests of his local community, as a former mayor. In fact, I have visited various projects which the honourable member has had running in his former municipality on local water conservation.Climate change is a challenge for us all. It is a challenge for the future. It is a challenge which requires the nation to act nationally and internationally. That is why this government's approach to climate change rests on three core pillars. Firstly, how do you reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Secondly, how do you shape a global solution which means being part of the Kyoto process, not pretending that it does not exist? Thirdly, how do you also adapt to climate change, which is of such a critical concern to so many out there in rural and regional Australia as well?Our response to this - on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions - is what are the practical ways forward? The Treasurer has spoken to one in the parliament already today: a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This is a very significant reform both for the environment and for the economy. It will be tough. It will be hard. It will require difficult decisions, but this government is determined to take those difficult decisions. The second way forward is: how do we go about boosting energy efficiency in our country? The government is developing an energy efficiency strategy to that effect. The third way forward is: how do we also boost the renewable energy role within the overall national electricity grid? Once again, the government is developing a strategy on that as well.In the period ahead, however, we have got this huge challenge with coal-fired power stations. What are we going to do about emissions now from coal-fired power stations and into the period ahead? We have more than a passing interest in this - not just in terms of our domestic reliance on coal-fired electricity generation but, beyond that, in the critical role of coal exports for this country. We are the largest coal-exporting country in the world. We, therefore, have a particular responsibility given our national energy requirements, as well as our national export requirements, to deal with this challenge of ensuring that coal-fired stations in the future are as clean as possible.That brings us to the question of clean coal technology and carbon sequestration. How do we deal with this effectively? Earlier today I spoke on legislation which has been introduced by the Minister for Resources and Energy concerning the regulatory regime for offshore sequestration sites for Australia. This is a world first. This is something which those opposite fiddled around with, but they never actually got their act together to bring the legislation through. -  - They did not. They had a lot of time to act on this but failed. Legislation has been put forward by us. It has been introduced into the parliament, and I commend the actions of the minister for energy in what he has done on this in making sure we have got something which works for industry but, critically, works for the national economy as well. CCS technologies are critical for the future. -  - I would say this to those opposite, as they howl in interjection: we have an opportunity for Australia to be the world leader in CCS technologies. The question is whether the government is going to get behind industry on this or push industry to one side. This government intends to get right behind industry and work with them, because we believe it is absolutely critical for CCS to work. The G8 recently in Hokkaido came up with a proposal to have 20 demonstration projects, up to 250 megawatts each, in operation by 2020, capable of demonstrating that this technology works. The practical question for all of us is: how is that going to happen? -  - Those opposite find this enormously amusing. As Australia is the world's largest coal exporter - I really find it interesting that those opposite find this so amusing - we are interested in protecting Australia's long-term coal industry. We are interested in protecting Australia's long-term coal exports. We are aimed at doing this both for our own economic interests and to make sure that we are doing the right thing by the global environment. - That is why CCS technologies are so critical. Our government's ambition is to become the world leader in this technology and its application. We will have more to say about this in the days ahead. I suggest to those opposite that, rather than carping and being critical about it, they should get on with the process of supporting the government's actions.The other part of the honourable member's question goes to the impact of climate change on water. Here again we are confronted with a dilemma in terms of the posture of those opposite. We know that the Murray-Darling is suffering from enormous stress. That stress, contrary to what the previous Leader of the Opposition said, is partly the product of climate change. It is also the product of historical overallocation of water entitlements. Our challenge is: what are we going to do about it? Therefore, what we have done since coming into government - and I say 'done' since coming into government; we have not dreamt about it like those opposite did for so long - is begin to buy back water entitlements. - The interjection from the Leader of the Liberal Party is that they brought in the Water Act. Twelve years it took you to bring in the Water Act. How many gigalitres of water did you buy back? - Thank you, Mr Speaker. And how did that rainmaking grant proceed - which was so enthusiastically embraced by the then Minister for the Environment and Water Resources? The Leader of the Liberal Party, when he was minister for water, had ample opportunity to buy back water entitlements. How many gigalitres did he buy back? Government members - None! - How many gigalitres did the Liberal government ever buy back? Government members - None! - They had 12 years to buy it back and how much did they buy back? 
Government members - None! - None. What we have done in nine months is begin the process of buying 35 gigalitres through the initial $50 million purchase which has been exercised by the Minister for Climate Change and Water and, secondly - and this is where the rubber hits the road for those opposite - Toorale station. Together with New South Wales, we have taken a decision to buy back the water entitlements associated with the purchase of that station - 20 billion litres of water to the Darling, peaking up to 80 billion litres in flood times. What do we have from the shadow minister for water security on behalf of the National Party? His statement is that this is an 'anti-rural Australia act'. So the view of the coalition - because he is the shadow minister for the coalition - is that they are opposed to our buying back 20 billion litres worth of water entitlements to the Darling and up to 80 billion litres in flood time.I would say to the shadow minister and to the Leader of the Opposition: how does that square with people like the member for Sturt and the South Australian members here in this parliament who day in, day out call upon the government to buy back water entitlements in order to provide environmental flows down the Murray and to ensure that we can act in time to save the lakes at the mouth of the Murray? My challenge to the Leader of the Opposition is this: do you back the shadow minister for water or do you back the member for Sturt? Where does the Liberal Party stand on buying back water entitlements? In nine short months, we have acted on this. We have purchased 37 gigalitres. We have now purchased a station which possesses a potential to buy back another 20 and up to 80. Where does the - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He certainly holds these views passionately. We have had the chance to discuss similar items outside the House in some detail. It is important to note that the ACCC's report recommended significant changes to the horticultural code, which have been widely welcomed by farmers and which are being worked through by my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It is also important to note that the ACCC's report into grocery prices found that the margins of Australian retailers by and large match the comparable margins of nations with similar concentration levels.It is also the case that the ACCC did recommend, and the government agrees, that there should be substantially more competition in the Australian retail grocery market, which not only benefits consumers but would also give farmers and wholesalers more opportunity to choose to whom they sell their products. The government certainly agrees with the honourable member that the former government needs to be condemned for lack of action in relation to competition in the grocery market. We certainly hold the view that there needs to be more competition in the grocery market. That is why we have freed up the foreign investment laws. That is why we have made planning a priority in relation to the COAG process, ensuring that the planning process in Australia is used to promote competition, not inhibit competition. That is why we are moving on creeping acquisitions, to limit the ability of large and powerful players in the market to increase their market power even further. That is the program of reform by the government in relation to competition in the grocery market, which will not only benefit retailers and consumers but will also benefit farmers and wholesalers. - Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Of course, she chairs the House of Representatives committee that is conducting an inquiry into pay equity. As a result she would be well aware that the workers who suffered the worst under Work Choices, as the statistics undoubtedly show, were women workers - rip-offs of women workers, working Australians, that were endorsed by the Liberal Party, by the Leader of the Opposition and by every member of the Howard government, and that are still endorsed by those people.Apart from their endorsements of the rip-offs of working Australians, of course, they endorsed a shambolic system that was bound up in red tape. The member for Hasluck has asked me to provide an update to the House on the question of the processing of employment agreements. I am pleased to do so, because Work Choices was bad for Australian workers, enabling them to be ripped off, and bad for business, which had to intersect with a red-tape nightmare. As a result of changes that the Howard government made to Work Choices last year, the Workplace Authority started with a backlog of 54,000 agreements - 54,000 agreements sitting in a ginormous pile, unable to be processed because of the shambles and red tape of the Howard government under Work Choices. Small businesses and big businesses - businesses that employ people - were waiting desperately for an answer but, because of the shambles of the Howard government and its Work Choices laws, they could not get one. That queue blew out to more than 100,000. It fell to this government to clean up the mess that the Liberal Party created for business with this huge backlog. - I know that the member for North Sydney believes in Work Choices. He defends Work Choices every day. He did it every day in government at this dispatch box, and he is doing it now. He is doing his defence of Work Choices. Maybe the member for North Sydney, in defending Work Choices, might like to defend the shambles that happened under his administration, which needed to be resolved by this government.I am pleased to report to the House that we are resolving the Liberal shambles. Of the 337,000 agreements lodged under the previous government's so-called fairness test some 281,000 have now been finalised and 15,500 are back with employers for them to provide further information or amendment to meet the requirements of the act. So the Liberal Party that said to the Australian people, 'You should be able to be ripped off at work' also said to Australian employers, 'Here is a mountain of red tape to tie you up in.' We are fixing both.I am asked about responses to my announcement yesterday about further details of Labor's Forward with Fairness plans to ensure that Australian working people get treated with fairness while businesses are able to get on with the job with a simple workplace relations system. I am pleased to advise the House that there has been a positive reaction to this announcement. For example, the National Farmers Federation gave an endorsement to the government's Fair Dismissal Code, which is showing a new way to balance fairness at work for working Australians with the needs of small business. The National Farmers Federation said of the Fair Dismissal Code -  - I know that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition cannot stand it when people are not engaging in Work Choices and industrial relations extremism, but she might like to show some simple respect to the National Farmers Federation. I am trying to read their words. - Obviously she does not want to listen to the National Farmers Federation. The National Party might want to think about that. But the National Farmers Federation said that the government's code is 'striking a sensible, practical balance for employers and employees'. And the endorsements did not stop there. The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia's CEO, Mr Tony Steven, said about the fair dismissal code that it is providing 'a simple checklist to follow' and he congratulated the government on this achievement. The Australian Industry Group welcomed the 'positive progress' that the government has made in developing the new workplace relations laws. Here we have a Liberal Party that professes a concern about jobs - maybe it wants to listen to the organisations that represent people who create jobs and reflect on what they have said.What we know from yesterday's reaction to the government's announcement on Forward with Fairness is that the government is getting rid of Work Choices and going on with Forward with Fairness. There are positive reactions from the business community to Forward with Fairness. The only people who support Work Choices in this nation are the industrial relations extremists sitting over there as members of the Liberal Party. We are asking them, despite their extremism, despite their love of Work Choices, to actually let the government get on with the job and deliver what the Australian people voted for. Business has had a positive reaction to that. It is time that the Liberal Party actually listened to the people who create jobs instead of just screaming abuse out.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know his deep concern for the state of the Murray-Darling. His questions are always properly framed and they go to the whole question about what we can practically do about the challenge which is faced there, given the history of overallocation and the scientific consensus about the impact of climate change in making that system more stressed than it has been in previous times.The scientific consensus most recently reflected, from memory, in a CSIRO report, which also involved the Bureau of Meteorology, was that climate change was a factor in bringing about the current stress of the Murray-Darling system. Therefore, in our response to it, the key challenge is dealing with the long-term measures: how do you act on climate change nationally and globally and how do you take off water pressures now? That goes to what the government is doing on the overallocation of water entitlements, which are the points contained in the answer I gave earlier to the member for Makin. Thirdly, what do you do to increase the efficiency of the irrigation system? I will come back to the question which the honourable member has asked about a cost-benefit analysis. These are the three practical measures which are necessary in the here and now to deal with the stress which is currently being experienced by the system. That is why in the meeting most recently with the Council of Australian Governments we allocated billions of dollars to the states and their respective irrigation systems, to do one thing - increase the efficiency of the irrigation systems, which, we are advised, if properly invested in, could result in 30 per cent greater efficiency as against the current water loss from often antiquated systems. That is the first point. The second is: what do you also do to draw down the overall take of water from the river system? That goes back to what I said before to the honourable member for Makin's question about the investments we have made in buying back water entitlements. They are the two practical measures which are currently underway.On the cost-benefit analysis which the honourable member has asked about, I will seek to come back to him in terms of what we can do practically on that question, because, unlike those opposite, who simply howl in response to any question on the Murray-Darling, I take the member for New England's questions seriously because they are seriously intended. I believe he deserves a response on that question of the cost-benefit analysis.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. Alcohol abuse is an issue of concern across the whole community, but it has been of particular concern in Cairns following some particularly violent incidents. I wanted to take this opportunity to talk about some of the very worrying statistics about alcohol abuse in our community, to highlight some of the action that governments and community organisations are starting to take across the country and to invite the Liberal Party to consider whether they might want to be part of tackling this serious problem rather than standing on the sidelines.I want to share a couple of the worrying statistics about in our community. On alcohol consumption in any given week, approximately one in ten 12- to 17-year-olds is binge drinking or drinking at risky levels. This is not young adults; this is 12- to 17-year-olds. High levels of alcohol consumption are leading to alarming levels of hospitalisation. The number of young women, young adults, aged 18 to 24 being admitted to hospitals because of alcohol has doubled in the last eight years. And we know that binge drinking leads to violence. Last year, more than three-quarters of a million Australians were physically abused by persons under the influence of alcohol.That is why I wanted to take the opportunity to draw to the attention of the House campaigns being run by two local papers. One by the Cairns Post is called 'Just Think' and is why the member for Leichhardt was particularly interested in raising this issue. The campaign called 'Just think' actually commenced in Geelong. On this front page from the Geelong Advertiser there is a photo of the result of some violence - violence which has been highlighted in their community. I know that the members for Corio and Corangamite have been actively involved in this campaign. I want to congratulate those newspapers for being prepared to take a lead within their community to raise this issue, particularly for the sake of young people. It is not a message that says, 'You can't go out and have a good time'; it is a message that says, 'Just think about what you are doing and make sure you take care in the circumstances when you are drinking.' I think they are running a really good campaign. I understand from conversations with the member for Corio that a Facebook campaign that has been set up by the Geelong Advertiser has something like 40,000 members - an enormous sign that the community is worried about this issue, that young people themselves understand that there are risks. We need to do all we can to raise awareness that these sorts of issues can cause harm in the community.While talking about this issue, I want to also raise a report that was released yesterday. Members of the House might have read some coverage of this. It is a report by David Collins and Helen Lapsley. This report was actually commissioned by the Howard government. It is entitled The avoidable costs of alcohol abuse in Australia and the potential benefits of effective policies to reduce the social costs of alcohol. This report, commissioned by the Howard government, states:_ that increasing the tax rate on alcoholic drinks which are specifically targeted at the youth market (for example, alcopops) is likely to be effective.It further states:There would appear to be strong justification for the April 2008 increase in the Australian tax on pre-mixed drinks (alcopops) by 70 per cent.In other words, we have independent experts, in a report commissioned by the Howard government, backing the action that the Rudd government is taking. I want to lay down a challenge to the new Leader of the Opposition: stop playing politics on this, join with the rest of the community and start working with us on finding serious solutions to these very serious problems.</DOC>

 - A good start to bipartisanship would be to unblock the budget in the Senate. Six billion dollars is not, as has been suggested by some, a bit of loose change; it is important in producing a solid budget surplus, a buffer for Australia in difficult global financial circumstances. So bipartisanship should begin in the Senate, and I would strongly suggest to the leader of the Liberal Party that he instruct his Senate colleagues to unblock these budget measures. The reason for so doing is this: in uncertain global financial times the most irresponsible thing that can be done is to add to uncertainty. If a government in its budget delivers a budget surplus of $22 billion, the worst thing you can do to global markets is to say that an irresponsible political party in the Senate is threatening to block that surplus, given that Australia stands uniquely positioned to have that buffer for the future. I would suggest that bipartisanship begins about 200 metres away, in the Senate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on the real economy worldwide, not just on global financial markets. The Australian government has a strong set of policy measures in place to see Australia through these difficult financial times. They begin with the budget surplus, to which I just referred to in my answer to the previous question, but they are also anchored in the strength of this government and this country's national financial regulatory institutions and in the extent of the collaboration between Australian financial regulatory institutions and those which exist abroad.Over the weekend the United States authorities proposed a significant initiative to address the financial crisis. Their plan would give the authority to the United States Treasury department to buy up to US$700 billion - that is US$700 billion - in mortgage related assets from financial institutions. The US Treasury secretary, Hank Paulson, said on Sunday:This is not something that we wanted to do. This was something that was _ necessary.This is a significant action on the part of the United States, and it is a welcome effort to put a floor under the problem by the US authorities. The program intends to fundamentally address the root cause of the financial system stresses in the United States by removing distressed assets from the financial system. Markets thus far, based on early reports of this impending US action, have responded positively in the United States and elsewhere.Members will also recall that on Wednesday last week the US Securities and Exchange Commission tightened restrictions on short selling. Australia followed this move on Friday by working through our regulator, ASIC, to place a temporary ban on naked short selling. On Friday night the USSEC took further action to temporarily ban all short sales of nearly 800 financial stocks. The announcement followed a similar move by financial regulators in the United Kingdom. As a consequence, and in response, ASIC announced yesterday they would impose a 30-day ban on short selling of all stocks. The government endorsed the coordinated response, which accords with similar action by the US and UK financial regulatory authorities.While appropriately regulated and disclosed short selling has a role to play in the effective operation of markets, it is appropriate to curtail its use at a time of heightened market volatility - and that is precisely what we have at present around the world. We are acting to help prevent market manipulators from artificially driving down stock prices. We cannot afford for that to happen in a time of unprecedented global financial instability as we have seen most recently on markets. In addition, the Commonwealth government will introduce legislation to improve the long-term disclosure requirements around short selling.As I indicated earlier to the House, Australia, while not being immune from the problems in the United States, nonetheless is better placed than most economies to weather the current storm. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has advised the government that Australian deposit-taking and insurance companies supervised by APRA are well capitalised, profitable, well regulated, and they are weathering the turmoil well.The government has also been active on a range of other regulatory fronts and also through the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank has enhanced liquidity in the market to compensate for an increased demand for liquidity. The RBA has been expanding its money market operations during periods of particular stress, including in the overnight money markets. For example, over the past week, aggregate exchange settlement balances have lifted from $1.5 billion to close to $7 billion in the overnight money markets. This follows additional liquidity injections by the Reserve Bank into markets both in March and June of this year.In a further measure, the RBA also widened access to its repurchase agreement facilities by enabling financial institutions to use a much wider class of assets as collateral for such agreements. Again, this is designed to enhance liquidity. The RBA has been undertaking moves in this respect during the course of the financial crisis over the course of 2008. Furthermore, as a government we have, in partnership with the economic regulators, taken further steps to support liquidity in the government bond market to ensure our broader financial markets operate more effectively. We provided legislative authority for an increase in future Commonwealth government securities of some $25 billion, with an authorisation of $5 billion worth of further issuance in 2008-09.In a further measure of direct relevance to households, the Financial Stability Forum, in which Australia has been active, recommended in April of this year that authorities review and, where necessary, strengthen deposit insurance arrangements. For us that has meant taking action on the financial claims scheme - a financial claims scheme which would provide better protection for consumers in any uncertainties which would lie ahead.Internationally, Australia remains active with the Financial Stability Forum because we must act not just nationally but in absolute concert with regulators in the United States and elsewhere. That is why, through our financial authorities - APRA, ASIC, the RBA and Treasury - we have been working in all five areas of global collaboration with the FSF on strengthening prudential oversight of capital, enhancing transparency in valuation, changing the roles and uses of credit ratings, strengthening the authorities' responsiveness to risks and implementing robust arrangements for dealing with stress in the financial system.These are practical measures which the government, together with the financial regulatory authorities in Australia, have been taking in response to this crisis. It is important to continue to stress the absolute strength of Australia's regulators, the fact that our regulators are among the best in the world and that the government, in concert with the regulators, have been acting throughout the course of this crisis and throughout the course of 2008 in response to what is a global problem now confronting all economies.</DOC>

 - The position put forward by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, as I understand it, was that now in other markets, particularly in the United States, the government is taking a role and proposing to buy back some of these securities. That relates specifically to the measures announced in the United States to which I referred in my answer before - an action taken by the United States Treasury to use $700 billion worth of US money to purchase bad debt from those who currently hold those mortgages on the part of US financial institutions.Why have the US regulator and the US Treasury done that? Because, if you go to the actual state of the problem in the United States, it is that subprime mortgages began filtering their way through the real economy and across the breadth of financial institutions from August last year. Subprime mortgages, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would be aware, represent some 15 per cent of mortgages in the United States mortgage market. Subprime mortgages represent something like one per cent of mortgages in the Australian market. There is, therefore, a clear distinction between our set of circumstances and those of the United States. And there is a further distinction, which I draw the honourable member's attention to as well: in the United States currently the arrears rate in terms of repayment on mortgages is something like six times that which currently exists within Australia. Again, our circumstances are significantly different. And I draw honourable members' attention to the remarks made by others last week which sought to cast doubt on the statements by the Governor of the Reserve Bank about the state of Australia's financial system relative to that which pertains in the United States and elsewhere.Therefore, the point I would make to the honourable member putting her question is that this represents the distinction between our markets and those which exist in the United States. That is why the measures that we have adopted, we believe, are responsible: they follow complete and close collaboration with the advice provided to the government by the financial regulators over the course of this year - not just the injection of liquidity into the economy by the Reserve Bank but also actions in relation to other aspects of assistance to financial players within the Australian financial market.I would say this to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and to the Leader of the Opposition on this most sensitive question: it is far better to proceed cautiously, rationally and intelligently through this debate in Australia than it is to simply shoot from the lip with anything which happens to come to the mind of the Leader of the Opposition in a press interview. These are serious and substantial matters. The government have been acting in close and absolute concert with the advice provided by our financial regulators. For the alternative Prime Minister of the country, as he would describe himself, to stand up and say that the US$700 billion rescue package should be adopted here reflects, I think, an absence of understanding of what is occurring in the Australian financial market. I would say to him also that, in these difficult and volatile times, words amount to bullets. Therefore I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition - and to the Liberal Party - that, rather than engaging in loose debate on these most serious matters, he becomes a constructive participant in them. The most constructive thing the Leader of the Opposition can do at the moment, apart from minding what he says publicly on these matters, is to head to the Senate and unblock the budget and deliver to the government an appropriate surplus for providing a buffer for the future - a buffer which Australia needs given the uncertainties we confront through global financial markets.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. The government certainly welcomes the decision of the independent regulator, ASIC, to ban short selling, because, as the Prime Minister was saying before, we are in a time of great difficulty in global financial markets. We probably have not seen a time of difficulty like this for a very long period of time. We certainly do welcome the announcements by the US government over the weekend and we certainly note the recovery in financial markets this morning. But nobody should imagine that we are out of the woods as yet. We will continue to see global financial market volatility over the period ahead. That is why this decision from ASIC is so important.It does remain the case that our banks are well capitalised and well regulated, and most certainly they do not face the same problems as the banks in the United States face, because they do not have the exposure to the subprime problem in this country that there is in the United States. So we are not complacent about our economic situation, and that is one of the reasons why the government has moved quickly to strengthen our financial system. We are implementing the Financial Stability Forum recommendations and encouraging their implementation internationally. Encouraging their implementation internationally is very important because what we need here is concerted global action that in the end can produce some surveillance of the international investment banks - which do go to the core of this instability in the United States and around the globe.That is but one reason why engaging with international leadership, engaging with international policymakers, as the Prime Minister will do, is so important - because the world requires a global solution. No country is an island in these circumstances. That is why we are not immune from the fallout. What is required here is an international agreement, as well as strong domestic action - and the government has been taking strong domestic action by increasing bond issuance, such as that which was referred to before. But one thing this government will not do is take the advice of the Leader of the Opposition to invest in subprime debt. That is effectively the gaffe that the Leader of the Opposition made on Laurie Oakes's program yesterday; and he is very sensitive about it - very, very sensitive about it. It was a gaffe of epic proportions.So we have been moving to strengthen the system, to introduce a financial claims scheme. We have also been very supportive of the decision taken by ASIC to put a ban on short selling. That is also very important to protect the integrity of our financial system. But we do need concerted international action. That is where the solution lies, globally and domestically. I just wish the opposition would put aside its petty politics and get behind constructive initiatives, globally and nationally, on this very important issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. I congratulate her on her appointment. I look forward to a constructive dialogue and debate about these matters which are so important to the economic health of the country. The parliament is the appropriate place for that. Let us just deal with short selling. Was there any legislation on short selling in 12 years from that side of the House? No.An opposition member - There was no need for it. - There was no need for it? Okay. That is good. I will just take them through this issue. We did say earlier in the year that we would move to legislate for the disclosure of covered short selling. The government has prepared a bill in that area. But, as everybody in the world knows, financial markets melted down last week. In response to that, governments around the globe moved to change their position on short selling. They moved to change their position on short selling because of the carnage that was going on in stock markets in an environment that was so destabilising it had lost touch with the economic fundamentals of many companies. So there was a very strong case at the end of last week for substantial action on short selling.ASIC, the independent regulator, determined late on Friday that they would take some further action. What happened after the market closed in Australia over the weekend was that further decisions were taken by other governments internationally. A further decision was taken in the United States by the SEC. A further decision was taken in Canada, and in at least three other countries decisions were taken. So over the weekend I conferred with all of our regulators. In fact, on Friday afternoon there was a meeting of the Council of Financial Regulators. On Friday afternoon and through the weekend I conferred with our regulators on this position and I conferred with people right across the financial services sector, because the ban on short selling in various forms by all of those other countries would have exposed our market first thing on Monday morning to a wall of funding that could have really had a detrimental impact on many, many reputable Australian companies.We on this side of the House make no apology for the decision of our independent regulator to ban short selling - a decision they announced late yesterday afternoon. It was a very important decision in the history of this country. There is a case for short selling, but there is not a case for short selling in the market environment in which we now find ourselves domestically and around the globe. We are a small market and it was simply not possible for us to remain open to short selling when every other market in the world had closed. What occurred was that the regulator met again and took an independent decision on Sunday afternoon, announced it and it has been applied from this morning. This is yet another example of our regulators being up to the mark and acting to protect our national interest. I would have thought those on that side of the House really would have understood how important this decision is and how it deserves bipartisan support.</DOC>

 - As the Prime Minister and Treasurer have said, Australia is better placed than most countries to withstand the current financial turmoil. There are a number of reasons for this - our well-respected prudential regulation system and the growth in our terms of trade being important parts. It is also very important that we keep our strong budget surplus. Countries without a strong budget surplus are more limited in their response to the current turmoil.I am also asked about threats to the current budget surplus. The newly-minted Leader of the Opposition and the Liberals in the Senate remain the biggest threats to that surplus. The Leader of the Opposition, in his first breath in his new role, proved that he was just as economically irresponsible as his predecessor. He indicated that he will continue to block the government's budget measures in the Senate and therefore reduce the surplus that is so important to our economic stability. He does this even though he acknowledges that the figures involved are significant. Yesterday, talking to Laurie Oakes, the Leader of the Opposition said:_ it's a huge amount of money _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _$6 billion is a gigantic amount of money in anyone's terms _That is what the Leader of the Opposition said on Sunday. But on Friday he said, 'It's a very small amount of money.' It was in the interview yesterday that he also said that his raid on the budget surplus was only a small amount because it was less than one per cent of the total budget. He was disagreeing with himself in the same interview. It is just like the old days, when the member for Bradfield occupied that chair. In the finest tradition of recent leaders of the opposition, he could not even agree with himself in the same interview. He threatens the budget surplus even though he recognised on Sunday that the amount of money involved is substantial - but on Friday it was small.Not only does the Leader of the Opposition continue to threaten our savings measures in the Senate; he also continues the policy of unfunded spending - billions of dollars of unfunded spending. We know that he believes a big chunk of that unfunded spending - the reduction in the petrol excise - is bad policy. We know that he thinks it is bad public policy and yet he continues it. He is hardly what you would call a conviction politician. We knew that he disagreed with the member for Bradfield; now we know he disagrees with himself.The Leader of the Opposition has thrown out all economic credibility. This is what he said to Laurie Oakes, trying to defend his policy:_ whether the petrol excise is 38 cents or 33 cents or 28 cents, it's simply a question of measuring up the budgetary consequences. You lower the excise, you just reduce government revenues.Wouldn't Goldman Sachs be proud of the member for Wentworth! He has worked out that if you cut tax you reduce government revenue. But what he did not say is that when you cut government revenue you either cut the budget surplus or cut services. Who would have thought Malcolm Turnbull's Liberal Party would make the Australian Greens look economically responsible! - The Leader of the Opposition has made economic irresponsibility the hallmark of his first week as Leader of the Opposition. The new occupant of that office is 'Brendan Nelson lite'.</DOC>

 - Last week the Leader of the Opposition was happy to have a flick at the Governor of the Reserve Bank; this week he is having a flick at the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. At a time of global instability in financial markets, this is not a responsible course of action. I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that a responsible course of action at a time like this is to back our institutions rather than to engage in the politically opportunistic course of action of simply having a flick at them on the way through because there might be a cheap headline in it for him. The circumstances surrounding the response to short selling are as described in the Treasurer's answer to the parliament just before. That is why the government acted in the way it did. I noticed very carefully what the Leader of the Opposition had to say by way of intervention before when the Treasurer was referring to the need for legislation on short selling. His interjection was there was no need for any legislation on short selling while they were in office. -  - I simply draw his attention to the fact that dealing responsibly with the problem of short selling, given the volatility of markets at present, is important. That is what the government has done through the long-term legislation it has already foreshadowed. That is why ASIC took the action it did over the course of Friday and the weekend. Had it not done so in the manner in which it did, it would have left Australian financial markets grossly exposed today. That would be irresponsible. The government was not prepared to countenance that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Port Adelaide for his question. Indeed, infrastructure investment is central to the government's economic priorities. That is why we put $41 billion from the surplus into long-term infrastructure investment funds. Infrastructure investment helps put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates. It addresses capacity constraints and it lifts productivity. Recent global economic events are of concern, of course, to all Australians. It is important that we monitor the situation closely and do what we can to ensure that Australia and our financial institutions are well placed to withstand global changes and global conditions. The Prime Minister's visit to the United States this week is part of this strategy.It is quite extraordinary that the Leader of the Opposition has maintained his criticism of this visit. It shows just how opportunistic he really is. It is also a fact that the opposition leader is defined by his inconsistency. In April he thought it was important for him to visit the United States. He had this to say:The security, the mortgages, the homes, the jobs of Australians depend in large measure on the international developments coming out of the United States of this credit crisis, so it was important for me as Shadow Treasurer to come here _So, according to the opposition leader, it is important for him to visit and to have consultations with global economic institutions while he is shadow Treasurer, but the Prime Minister, who has got his hands on the levers of the Australian economy, is subject to criticism for having these very discussions. That opportunism is characteristic of the Leader of the Opposition. That is why, on the $6 billion black hole, it is either a big amount or a small amount. He is not sure about that, but he is sure it is a good amount for them to blow a hole through the budget. That is why he described the $41 billion infrastructure investment funds in his budget reply speech as 'the greatest con of all'. - That was the opposition leader's statement. Today, as one of his expanded -  - The member for Sturt is one of the opposition leader's 32 members on the shadow ministry. They have 32 shadow ministers shadowing 30 ministers; two of them are shadowing each other - that is the only way that you can come up with that conclusion, but then again a few promises had to be made. I am asked about the attitude towards international consultations. The opposition leader certainly has not always been opposed to international travel. Just 10 days ago he was overseas, not meeting with global economic leaders but sitting in St Mark's Square in Venice -  - Far be it for an Albanese to criticise someone going to Italy. But then, do not be such a hypocrite that you come in here and criticise the Prime Minister for going to the United States to have discussions about global economic conditions. - I was addressing the part of the question that went to international economic consultations and I was talking about that. But, of course, they are very sensitive over there. We know that, when it comes to consistency, the Leader of the Opposition just has not got it. What the merchant of Venice has got to understand is that, when your client is the Australian people, there is no substitute for substance. From merchant banker to merchant of Venice - that is what we have sitting in the opposition leader's chair.</DOC>

 - On the question of short selling, contrary to the dismissiveness of those opposite who do not seem to regard legislation as all that important, let alone other forms of immediate action, the circumstances are as the Treasurer outlined before. Firstly, actions were undertaken by the United States and UK regulatory authorities on short selling last week. Secondly, they were expanded in their scope at the very end of last week, requiring, therefore, further action on behalf of the Australian regulators. Failure to act on this, and failure to act on it responsibly, would have exposed Australian financial stocks and stocks in general to massive manipulation on the part of international speculative investors. We in the government were not prepared to countenance that course of action. I am surprised that those opposite seem to be so prepared.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I know that she has been deeply concerned about fairness and balance in Australian workplaces, particularly the circumstances of working Australian women. As these statistics show, Work Choices has been a disaster for working women. It is beyond doubt - from information from the Australian Bureau of Statistics - that under Work Choices women did worse. The ABS data shows very clearly in its wages and earnings data series that women working full time on Australian workplace agreements took home on average $84 a week less than women working on collective agreements. And the data for women working part time and casually was even worse; the rip-offs per hour for women working casually - and many working women do because they want to combine work and family life - was even worse. A woman who was on an AWA who was working as a casual for an average amount of time could expect to earn $94 per week less than her counterpart who was on a collective agreement. The Rudd Labor government has already ended these rip-offs by ending the making of Australian workplace agreements and ensuring that all working women and working men have the benefit of a fair safety net.Last week I announced further details of the government's Forward with Fairness changes, and they include a set of additional protections for working women. Of course, the foundation stone of Labor's fair and balanced industrial relations system is a safety net that cannot be stripped away. As well as the dollar rip-offs that working women faced, even after the last government's so-called fairness test, a working woman could have stripped away from her the protections on changes of shift and changes of roster inherent in her industrial award. For example, instead of being given a few days notice that she was going to be moved to night shift - notice so that she could make new arrangements for the care of her children - a woman could have that protection stripped away and be given half an hour or an hour's notice of a change of shift, which could have left her children without care. The government, in making sure that the safety net is there for everyone and that it cannot be stripped away, has fixed that and will make sure working women do not have that fear for the future.The government's National Employment Standards also include a new era of flexibility for working women - making sure that women can sequence unpaid maternity leave with the unpaid paternity leave of their partner, giving working families the option, if they choose, to have a parent at home for the first 12 months of a child's life. Our National Employment Standards include a new era of flexibility, enabling working women to have the right to request an extended period of unpaid maternity leave and a right to request a return to work on a part-time or flexible basis if that would enable them to put together work and family life in a more cooperative way.I am asked about obstacles to the implementation of the government's plan. Of course, shadow ministers in this place seem to come and they seem to go, but the more things change -  - Some actually just go, it is true. And very curiously some backbenchers seem to move across further and further out of sight. - In all the coming and going and moving back and forth - and the member for O'Connor moving curiously along - what we know is that the more things change, the more things stay the same. -  - I am commenting on an obstacle to the implementation of the government's plan. I understand that the member for Sturt may consider this obstacle to be irrelevant, but the name of this obstacle is the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is standing in the way of the government's plans because the announced position of the Liberal Party at the moment is that unless we bring back the Australian workplace agreements that ripped off working Australians, including working women, then the Liberal Party will not pass the government's bills. It will prevent the government delivering Forward with Fairness.As the chairs are reshuffled over there, and we get a new spokesperson on workplace relations, the signs are not good, because in October 2006 the new shadow spokesperson on workplace relations said this:Work Choices is a continuation of the Howard government's proud record on women and work.Could anybody be more out of touch? Could anybody be more delusional about what Work Choices meant for working women? This is the attitude of the Liberal Party. Shadow ministers may come or go, but the one thing that the Liberal Party stands for, will always stand for and clearly stands for under the new shadow minister is Work Choices pure and simple - with all of its rip-offs.</DOC>

 - The Australian Council of Financial Regulators, which met with the Treasurer last Friday, continues to monitor on a regular basis the liquidity requirements and the credit requirements of the Australian economy. If the honourable member had listened to the answer I gave at the beginning of question time, he would know that I went through the various interventions undertaken by the Reserve Bank in injecting liquidity into the economy, most particularly into the overnight money markets over the course of March, June and, most recently, September. This is part of the normal operations of the financial regulators. Furthermore, when it comes to all future contingency arrangements, the regulators continue to examine all that may be necessary into the future. I would suggest that a responsible course of action on the part of those opposite would be to underpin the confidence of this House in the regulators, rather than, drip-by-drip, to seek to undermine public confidence in those regulators.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Flynn for his question. His electorate and the electorates of many around this House are acutely conscious of the importance of coal-fired power generation now and into the future as well as the importance of coal exports into the future. If we look at the statistics, that concern is registered loud and clear. Eighty per cent of Australia's electricity comes from coal-fired power stations. Coal is the backbone of regional Australia in many regions - from Mackay to Muswellbrook to Moe. Coal also fires 40 per cent of the world's power generation and will continue to do so for a long time to come. It is also Australia's biggest export.The practical challenge we face is how we deal with those economic realities on the one hand and the fact that 40 per cent of energy related CO2 emissions in 2005 came from coal-fired electricity generation. This brings us to carbon capture and storage. Carbon capture and storage is an important technology option for the future. It is an important practical option for the future. It is important in the overall response to climate change within Australia and internationally. - The International Energy Agency says that improved energy efficiency and CCS - carbon capture and storage - represent the two most viable options currently available to bring down greenhouse gas emissions into the medium term. That is why the government embraces both of those courses of action.You can see the beginnings of demonstration projects in the Otway Basin in Victoria. You can also see it at the Callide A power station in Queensland and the oxy-fuel combustion technology which is proposed to be trialled there by way of retrofitting, and you can also see post-combustion capture technology in two other power stations in Australia - one in black coal in New South Wales and the other to be based in brown coal in Victoria. On Saturday I took the opportunity to visit Santos's operations in Moomba and for them to brief me on their proposals for a three-stage carbon capture facility - the Moomba carbon storage project. This is an exciting project. I commend the company for their active support for CCS technologies. Together with those other project possibilities around the country, we begin to see the emergence of a way forward in bringing down greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power stations and, more generally, from carbon based fuels in Australia.On Friday, the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, and I launched a global carbon capture and storage institute, which Australia will support. What is the proposal? It goes into two parts. Right around the world at present you see a whole range of research going on but ineffective coordination of that research and, with the four principal technologies alive with carbon capture and storage, you see very thin at-scale industrial application of these technologies. The problem we face is that time is running out. We need to make sure that these industrial scale projects get going.The best definition of an industrial style project is something 250 megawatts or more. So many of the projects which are currently underway around the world which go by the rubric of demonstration projects are very small indeed. We need to have them at scale not only so we can demonstrate that the technology works at scale but also so we can calculate the cost differential between a 250-megawatt station without CCS technology applied as opposed to one with CCS technology applied and then work out where that difference is to be met in the future by way of investment activity by government, corporates and others. This of course is directly relevant to the future architecture of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme as well.Why we have put forward this global carbon capture and storage institute is to assist in bringing together all this research and technology investigatory activity around the world into a single entity to the best extent possible. This is a global public good and the world needs to have a go-to place to access that technology for at-scale projects. But there is one further reason, and this is also the big gap at the moment. -  - Those opposite find this enormously amusing. I do not find climate change at all amusing. I find it a real challenge for the future, and finding practical ways of responding to climate change is the way ahead. The second reason for a global carbon capture and storage institute is that, when it comes to identifying projects at scale, you need a clearing house around the world to point would-be investors in the direction of those projects that are most ready to go. At present that is simply not happening. We have put together this initiative in close consultation not only with the Australian coal and resource industry but also with various governments around the world, and there has been an initial expression of support from not just the British government but also other governments.I say to those who simply catcall from opposite and say that there are problems with this: for 12 years there was a lot of time to act on this, and I have to say that across the country and across the world I do not see a whole lot of action resulting from the various speeches made by others when they occupied the treasury benches and had an opportunity to act.Here is the challenge: the G8 meeting in Hokkaido said that by 2020 we have to have 20 at-scale CCS electricity projects around the world in order to demonstrate to the world that this technology works and at what price it will work. That is the challenge that has been established. The problem is worldwide that there is no capacity that exists at either the technology level or at the financial clearing house level to bring any such projects to fruition. That is why we have decided to provide leadership. That is why when I am in New York I will be canvassing this extensively with world leaders. That is why it will form a large part of the presentation that we make to global governments: because, for this to work, it is not just that it is an Australian initiative that counts; we need global buy-in. For this to work, we need those 20 projects not just to be designed, not just to be talked about, not just to be floated, but also to be delivered in concrete reality on the ground. That is what this institute is about. I would suggest to the sceptics opposite: get behind it and be bipartisan instead of than just talking about bipartisanship as some cute, political ploy.</DOC>

 - If the honourable member were to look at the government's budget forecasts he would see that, in terms of the rate of economic growth for the period ahead, we have obviously projected a softening of growth consistent with the softening of growth across the global economy. Secondly, what follows from that is that public revenue also softens. One follows from the other. I would have thought that the honourable member would understand that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for this question. As a representative of a key regional seat with a significant number of people employed in the coal industry, she - unlike many on the other side - understands the importance of the Prime Minister's announcement of last Friday. The Global Carbon Capture and Storage Initiative correctly gives us an opportunity internationally to cooperate with the business community and also like-minded countries to finally make significant progress on something of fundamental importance not only to Australia's economic and environmental future but also to the global community.Australia is an energy superpower. It is therefore our responsibility to show leadership in trying to put together something about abatement while also securing our economic future. I understand on the other side of the House there are some people who doubt the importance of this technology. I want to remind the House that 80 per cent of Australia's electricity comes from coal fired power stations. I want to also remind the House, in terms of our economic prosperity, that it is estimated that coal exports from Australia in this financial year will earn us as a nation $43 billion. For Australia, in terms of security of energy, reducing carbon emissions is therefore exceptionally important, not only from the point of view of the coal industry - I remind the House that the export of LNG is also exceptionally important, and getting storage correct is of fundamental importance, for such key projects as Gorgon. This presents Australia with an opportunity to secure our own economic future and also an obligation for Australia to exercise leadership on this front, because we are at the forefront. We have not only a requirement to solve our own environmental problems but also an opportunity to potentially engage in technological solutions of importance to the whole global community.I am pleased to say that at last Friday's discussions there was key support not only from business, representatives of state and territory governments, and the generators but also from key sectors of the environmental movement and the labour movement, represented by the CFMEU and the AWU. - They understand the importance of Australia making progress, of doing something about guaranteeing that our National Low Emissions Coal Council is able to accelerate the demonstration and deployment of these technological activities and of having in place a carbon storage task force which enables the development of storage, mapping and infrastructure plans in the immediate future. They also welcome the government's achievement in the House of Representatives last week of potentially world-first legislation covering carbon dioxide storage in Australia's offshore areas.I simply say in conclusion that Australia and the broader community understand the challenges that confront us in the demand to reduce carbon emissions in the global community. I look forward to working with my state and territory counterparts, representatives of business, NGOs who are prepared to front up to hard decisions and the labour movement to make this a reality. This is about investing in our future and our economic prosperity while also assisting the world in guaranteeing high levels of economic growth while reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</DOC>

 - As of three months ago, the Leader of the Opposition said he had no policy to increase the pension at all. I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that consistency is a good thing in politics; I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that, in the 12 years they had in office to act on the age pension in any fundamental way, they failed to do so. Secondly, in the course of the last budget we virtually doubled the additional increase to pensioners as a consequence of our increase to the utilities allowance, and we have of course in process the review, which those opposite supported, coming out of the Senate inquiry. I would suggest that, when he sat in the cabinet together with many of those on the current front bench - and perhaps those currently on the back bench as well, including the member for Higgins - if their passion had been so deep to act on the age pension 12 months ago, they could have done so. They failed to do so, and the opportunism in their current politics on this is there, clear-cut, for all to see.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Earlier today the Australian government detailed a plan to improve aged care for remote Indigenous communities. It includes, for the first time, a set of standards applied to these unique aged-care services in remote communities. In addition, we are providing a $46.2 million program for staff, locum relief and emergency capital works on facilities. Nationally, there are 30 Indigenous specialist aged care services providing about 700 places. It is time that the Australian government started to improve the care for frail and aged Indigenous Australians. When it comes to life expectancy, there is a 17-year gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, and the Rudd government is committed to closing the gap within a generation by taking practical steps to improve the health status and social and economic wellbeing of Indigenous Australians. This plan is about providing proper care for older Indigenous people while still being respectful to their cultural needs. We will consult with and take the advice of Indigenous communities and the Indigenous aged care sector.I would also like to make a few comments about the tragic death of Dulcie Brumby, which occurred on 14 June 2007 at Docker River, which is 670 kilometres by road south-west of Alice Springs. This was an appalling tragedy. Dulcie Brumby was 70 years old and in an Indigenous aged care service. That night she was unsupervised and fell into an open pit fire. She subsequently died at Alice Springs Hospital. Her death has been the subject of a report by Northern Territory Deputy Coroner Dr Celia Kemp.On behalf of the Australian government, I extend our condolences to the family of Dulcie Brumby. This afternoon, I asked the independent Aged Care Commissioner, Ms Rhonda Parker, to personally conduct an assessment of the Department of Health and Ageing's handling of the Docker River aged-care death. It is imperative that we act to improve aged-care services for older Indigenous Australians, and that is what the government has outlined today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. This is the most recent policy, I take it? This is today's policy; it is not last week's policy? I note the previous opposition leader is not in the chamber, but he was quite clearly on the record -  -  - I apologise. He is moving around. Maybe it is a comeback. The Leader of the Opposition at the time the original stunt was announced made it clear that veterans were not included. - It was because this side of the House raised the issue that they had excluded thousands and thousands of veterans, amongst a whole range of other people. That is why there has been some change. But when was the change? - It was snuck into the Senate as a late change - an amendment to a notice of motion. Even then, when you go to the question of what was included in the wording, there is an argument that some veterans have been excluded. -  - Have a look at the partner service pension. Have a look at your wording there. You have missed out a few there as well, not to mention veterans with disabilities in some cases. - Let us not forget that, once again, after a decade of inaction, they have finally discovered some policy. The member for Paterson then left the chamber. 
 - Finally, after a decade, we find that they have some policy. We all know that the opposition only discovered veterans affairs in the last year before the election. Let us have a look at what has occurred since the election. Here are just a few examples. This government, when in opposition, committed to an inquiry into the deseal-reseal issue. -  - Your government refused to back it until you became the opposition, and then the shadow minister endorsed it. She said, 'We support this inquiry.' Of course, when you were in government it was 'no'. - I will bring my answer to a conclusion, Mr Speaker. The point with respect to this is that, once again, it is a simple question. But the real answer is what you did not do. The fact is that you never took action when you could have and you have now ended up in a situation of trying to reduce the concerns of pensioners in this society to a stunt.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question and for his real concern for Australia's pensioners, unlike the politics that we are seeing from those opposite. When those opposite actually had the power to do something about pensions, what did this Leader of the Opposition do in cabinet? He voted no. What did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition do when she was in cabinet? She voted no. That is what they did when they were in government. What this government is doing is actually delivering to pensioners.Let me inform the House that this fortnight pensioners are going to receive $128 - the third quarterly instalment of the increased utilities allowance. This fortnight, age pensioners, widow pensioners, carers and disability support pensioners will all receive $128. It was the decision of this government to increase the utilities allowance. Under the previous government, the utilities allowance was only $107. Under this government, the utilities allowance is $500. This fortnight, the government is delivering $128 - the next quarterly instalment of this very important utilities allowance. This, of course, enables pensioners to pay the bills that are always increasing. It was up to this government to extend the utilities allowance to those on the carer payment and the disability support pension. In their last year in government, those opposite refused to give an increase in the pension to anybody and also refused to extend the utilities allowance to people on carer payment and the disability support pension. This government has delivered to those people.We know that this is becoming a bit of a pattern with those opposite, playing politics as they are over in the Senate right now. They have also decided to exclude carers and those on the disability support pension in this latest political game that they are playing in the Senate, even though it is the case that single age pensioners, people who are single and dependent on the carer payment and people who are single and dependent on the disability support pension - and I am glad the Leader of the Opposition is listening - are all being paid exactly the same pension rate. They are all dependent on the same pension rate. But of course, in the effort to play politics by those opposite, they have completely ignored those carers who are doing it tough and those people on the disability support pension who are doing it tough. Each and every one of them is living on $281 a week.I just want to make sure that the Leader of the Opposition understands this by reading from a letter that a woman from Gippsland, Jean Tops, has written to all senators. She says: 'We are alarmed at the suggestions being made by the Liberal Party that only single age pensioners should be thrown a lifeline of $30 a week. We are alarmed,' she says, 'that they are considering putting this proposal to the Senate for approval next week when there are millions of single pension persons who will miss out if such a proposal were to be adopted.' She goes on to say: 'Is it so difficult to understand that single primary carers on pension payments are in the same boat as single age pensioners? Is it so difficult to understand that single disability support pensioners are in the same boat as single age pensioners?' All of these people are being completely ignored by those opposite.Of course, those opposite do not understand this. It was just a quick political fix, a bit of a game that they tried to play in the Senate, a game on the part of the Liberal and National parties. Because they have tried to do this so quickly, rushing it into the Senate to try and save the skin of the previous Leader of the Opposition - well, that didn't work - in yet another complication, they forgot to index this little measure that they have put into the Senate today. In their rush to score political points, there was no indexation for this measure.There is another complication - which of course they are not the faintest bit concerned about - that many people who have written to our pension inquiry are certainly concerned about. Many of them are pleading with us to not just increase the base rate of the pension, because if that happens they will see a lot of the increase in the pension go in increased rents. One of the submissions has actually come from the member for Flinders. He has passed on a submission from one of his constituents, who says, 'If the pension alone is increased to cover all the cost-of-living expenses, landlords will be able to raise rents accordingly.' Many, many people who are in the public housing system know exactly that. They know that - as does the member for Warringah, of course. Where is the member for Warringah? He seems to have disappeared. We knew he was bored with his job, but we did not know he was so bored as to not turn up today.Reforming the pension system is a very complicated task. It is not something that should just be handled as some sort of political plaything by one opposition leader after another. This government intends to get this right. In the meantime, this fortnight, we are delivering an increase of $128 in the utilities allowance to make sure that pensioners have got increased money in their pockets to help pay their bills.</DOC>

 - It follows from the global financial crisis that stock markets around the world have gone down. If you look at what has happened on the US stock exchange, the S&amp;P, over the last 12 months, there has been virtually a 20 per cent reduction that has been reflected in various stock markets around the world. Obviously the impact of that flows through to those whose superannuation investments are in equities markets. That is one of the reasons why the government are determined, firstly, to prosecute a policy of responsible economic management and, secondly, to ensure that we, through our coordinated action with the Australian financial regulators - APRA, the Reserve Bank and ASIC - are responding appropriately to the financial crisis. Thirdly, we are doing so in concert with the international regulators. That is the best way - the best way by far - that we can look to the return of stability to global financial markets. On the question of the advices to which the honourable member refers, I am unaware of any such advice being requested. What is occurring on this matter in terms of other ministers and across the bureaucracy is of course a matter for them.</DOC>

 - Given that 13 of those letters arrived on the day the question was asked, you probably should interject with something different next time. -  - The National Farmers Federation have described climate change as possibly the biggest risk facing Australian farmers in the coming century. I would like to report to the House on some ABS figures which have been released recently, which show that about half of Australia's agricultural businesses have changed their management practices in response to climate change. These figures do vary across the country and across agricultural industries, with stronger results in the south of the country, obviously, than in the north. In the Goulburn-Broken Natural Resource Management region in Victoria, 78 per cent of agricultural businesses have changed their farming practices to deal with climate change. In the north Tasmania NRM region, the figure is 80 per cent. In the Northern Agricultural Region in Western Australia, the result is quite high, at 83 per cent. The Rudd government has also tripled the Climate Change Research Program from $15 million to $46.2 million. Those expressions of interest closed a couple of weeks ago and I am pleased to report to the House that we have received more than 200 expressions of interest from Australia's leading bodies doing research into carbon pollution, better soil management and adaptation to a changing climate.Farmers have been recognising the need to adapt their practices to deal with climate change and have been aware of the connection between emissions, human behaviour and climate change itself. In fact, this is the very dispatch box where the then Prime Minister, 18 months ago, said:_ I do believe there is a connection between climate change and emissions. I do not really think the jury is out on that.That is why I was surprised to read a comment from a primary producer - or a former primary producer - that was published in the Canowindra News, where the article begins:Member for Calare, John Cobb, says he is prepared to out himself as a climate change sceptic to bring a 'voice of reason' to the debate about Australia's response to global warming.Mr Cobb, who has previously served as the nation's assistant environment minister, yesterday questioned the impact human activity has had on rising temperatures, sea levels and the ongoing drought.While Australia's farmers and primary producers have been moving in one direction, in the last couple of days the opposition has decided to move in the opposite direction, by taking a climate change sceptic and saying, 'Yes - that is the person who ought to be in charge of the agriculture portfolio for the opposition.' The Leader of the Opposition has chosen to drag the climate change debate backward from where Mr Howard left it. In government, we know, the Leader of the Opposition was frustrated at the handling of the climate change debate. If you look at today's announcement, you discover that the reason he was frustrated was that the previous Prime Minister was taking climate change too seriously for his liking.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. On the question of pensions, which have been the subject of so much discussion in this House, let me make the following things perfectly clear. The government acted in the budget to make some moves to lift some of the pressure on people who receive the age pension and other forms of pensions and benefits. In particular, the opposition leader might like to note that we increased the utilities allowance to $500 - $128 of that amount will be paid to pensioners this week. We provided a cash bonus of $500.Of course, I acknowledge and the government acknowledges that it is tough for pensioners. We understand that. We speak to pensioners. We understand how much pressure is on them. What the government has determined to do, above the budget measures which have already made a difference for pensioners, with $128 being received by them as part of the utilities allowance this week, is have the question the subject of a thorough investigation so we can look at the pension base rate -  - I note the member for North Sydney plays the fool as usual. On the question of pressure on pensioners, we have said that this will be the subject of examination because, of course, the age pension is the bedrock of our pensions and benefits system. Its rate relates to a number of other measures, and consequently we want to work through all the issues.Can I conclude with these remarks. There is always a stench about hypocrisy and it is in this room right now, because the Leader of the Opposition, who asked this question, was a member of a government and at the cabinet table that did nothing for 12 years on the basic rate of the pension. Indeed, he sat at a cabinet table where the then responsible minister suggested increasing the base rate of the pension. He must have said 'no' because certainly the government said 'no'. Then, earlier this year, when the shadow minister for ageing had the temerity to suggest that there should be an increase in the pension -  - The Leader of the Opposition earlier this year in his capacity as shadow Treasurer slapped down any suggestion that there be an increase in the base rate of the pension. The hypocrisy of the opposition on this is manifest. Whilst they continue with their hypocrisy, with their cobbled together measures - measures that leave out more than two million Australians who receive a form of pension - the government will get on with the business of delivering practical measures, like the $128 this week, like the $500 utilities allowance, like the $500 bonus, and we will address the question methodically and comprehensively in a thorough-going review, and we will not be listening to those who had 12 years to act. Let us line them up: the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Manager of Opposition Business, the new spokesman on the ETS - and the list goes on. None of them did anything in government to make a difference on this question, and that is how they will be judged.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. Of course the challenges this nation faces are great. We face, with the rest of the world, the challenge of tackling climate change. We face the issue of raising our rate of productivity growth. We know that this nation is languishing when it comes to productivity growth - and today's productivity growth is tomorrow's prosperity. We need to be investing in education. We need to be ensuring we have more productive workplaces. Not only is today's productivity growth tomorrow's prosperity, but of course the challenges for tomorrow's prosperity are major with the ageing of the population and with the forecasted changes in the dependency ratio that that implies.When the election was held in November 2007, the government went to the people with a practical program of action about these great challenges. In climate change, it included re-engaging with the rest of the world by ratifying Kyoto and introducing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme as well as measures to enhance the development of new technology - renewable technology and solar technology. We went to the Australian people to seek a mandate for our productivity-enhancing measures. Those measures include our education revolution - investing in education from the education of our youngest children through schools, through addressing the skills crisis and through our universities. Our productivity-lifting measures include our fair and balanced workplaces.Since the government was elected, circumstances on global financial markets have caused anxiety right around the world. We know that those circumstances are reshaping the international economic landscape. We know that in the last very short period of time we have seen major measures that have caused huge problems in global financial markets. We have seen some of the world's largest -  - I fear that my intervention yesterday has moved the member for O'Connor back into the main chamber, and for that I apologise to the House. That was most certainly not my intention.Events are being reshaped by the global credit crisis. We have seen some of the world's leading financial institutions face either the end of their business or a landscape of dramatic change. We have seen the US government invest $700 billion in mortgage related assets for these companies in a buy-up plan. We have seen financial regulators around the world move to address the problem of short selling, which would increase volatility in financial markets in this very difficult period. And we have seen central banks around the world move to address the liquidity crisis and to inject more liquidity into financial markets.In these uncertain times around the globe, the last thing we can afford in this country is uncertainty around the delivery of the government's budget. The budget was designed for the times. It was designed with a surplus to give us the buffer we need in difficult circumstances. The fact that it was so designed and provides such a buffer is endorsed by the IMF in its recent report, which stated that prudent fiscal policies and flexible exchange rates provide Australia with 'important buffers against any substantial weakening in the external environment'. In these uncertain global economic times we need budget certainty, and that is why the actions of the Liberal Party in the Senate are so damaging. They would be damaging in ordinary times. They would be economic vandalism in ordinary times. But in these times of uncertainty they are the height of irresponsibility.We understand that the Senate plays a role as a house of review, where they look at and scrutinise legislation. That is the proper role of the Senate and we understand that. But what is happening in the Senate, courtesy of the Liberal Party, is not that proper role of review; it is obstruction pure and simple, designed to take $6.2 billion out of the budget surplus and to create uncertainty in these uncertain times.I say to the newly elected Leader of the Opposition that he has an opportunity to create a break with the past. Instead of endorsing the irresponsibility adopted by the Liberal Party immediately after the May budget, he has an opportunity to actually engage in a responsible economic strategy and to make sure the budget can be delivered. We continue to call upon him to do so. He can prove that he is not an economic vandal by responding to those calls. - Yes. - Yes.</DOC>

 - What I stand by very clearly is the fact that what you have proposed misses out on a large section of veteran pensioners. You miss out on those on disability service pensions. You miss out on those on partner service pensions. You also miss out on those who are on partner service pensions who are now single because of the death of their partner. You miss out on significant numbers of veterans right across the board in this area. It is inconsistent, it does not deal with the real issues and therefore it is not dealing with the real problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It is critical that the government achieves the right balance in framing economic policy. In framing the budget, we struck the right balance between getting rid of the reckless spending of those opposite and delivering a substantial $55 billion Working Families Support Package. We delivered tax cuts. We delivered an increase in the childcare tax rebate and we delivered an education tax refund. We also delivered an additional $500 bonus for age pensioners. That is very important - something that was not funded or provided by those opposite. We also boosted the utilities allowance by $400. We also put in place the Henry review, which will report no later than next February. We delivered a strong surplus because it is important at a time of international economic uncertainty to have a strong surplus.Framing economic policy does demand responsibility with the nation's finances as much as it requires compassion, and it requires empathy with those that are under financial pressure. Of course you can only have that compassion and empathy if you understand the everyday lives of the Australian people. Those opposite, the Liberals, have demonstrated no understanding of the financial pressures facing Australian families.In the Treasury portfolio there are lots of facts and figures, and I would be the first to say that you cannot possibly know every single one, but there are some facts and figures which are very, very important. This morning the member for Curtin was full steam on radio; last evening the member for Curtin was full steam on radio. What we found was that she had no idea of one of the central facts that go to the heart of the financial pressures on Australian families and to the heart of the economic debate in this country. She did not know the official RBA cash rate. She got it wrong. No wonder those opposite found it so difficult to actually welcome the rate cut a couple of weeks ago. She did not understand that essential figure. It really says something about the Liberal Party when the Treasury spokesman does not know the official RBA cash rate. That is really something and it demonstrates how out of touch those opposite are with the financial pressures on Australian families.It does not stop there. We have this ploy on pensions in the House today - a ploy from those opposite which leaves out two million pensioners. How could they do that? They say they understand -  - It is not just that they left out two million pensioners; it just demonstrates they do not understand the financial pressures around the kitchen table. How could they possibly leave out disability support pensioners or carers? Shame on you - if you understand this problem, you have demonstrated that you cannot actually fix it. Those opposite do not understand the need for a long-term sustainable solution to this particular problem because they do not understand the everyday lives of Australian families. They are that far out of touch.If you ever needed any evidence of how out of touch the Leader of the Opposition is from the everyday lives of Australian families, we heard it on Radio National this morning when the Leader of the Opposition was being interviewed by Fran Kelly. Fran Kelly asked him this question:Malcolm Turnbull, the country needs to know which footy team you barrack for.MALCOLM TURNBULL: Well, I, I, I have to confess I vote for, I vote for, I, um, support, um, Australian Rules, the Roosters. - There are no roosters in the AFL Grand Final - there have been plenty of swans and there have been plenty of hawks, but there are no roosters. I would not be surprised if he was out there next congratulating Ricky Ponting on winning the Brownlow Medal. - The question was about being in touch with the needs of Australian families. It is a very serious question. If you have no appreciation of the daily lives of Australian families, how can you frame economic policy to look after those families? If you do not understand what the official RBA cash rate is, how can you understand the financial pressures on Australian families? If you leave two million pensioners out of a proposal before the parliament, how can you claim to understand the financial pressures on pensioners? I am really saying here that, when the Leader of the Opposition goes out there pretending to be in touch with the people, what he demonstrated this morning is that he is a phoney when it comes to all of that - he is pretending to be something he is not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. This is a very important issue and one which the government takes seriously. What we are not doing is playing the sort of low-rent politics that we have seen from the other side. What the Treasurer actually announced in the budget was a significant increase in the utilities allowance. Under the previous government the utilities allowance was only $107. The Treasurer increased the utilities allowance in his first budget to $500, and he decided that it would be paid quarterly. So, in this fortnight, pensioners are going to receive their third quarterly instalment of the utilities allowance - $128 will go into their bank accounts in this fortnight. The second thing the Treasurer decided to do in relation to the utilities allowance was to extend it to carers and people on the disability support pension. This was never done in 12 years by those opposite but has been done by this Treasurer in his first budget. The third thing the Treasurer did in his first budget was extend the bonus. A bonus of $500 was paid to age pensioners in this federal budget. All of this actually cost the federal budget $7.2 billion. That is what we are doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. This is an important issue for us on this side of the House. In the Senate very soon we are going to see a vote on the Tax Laws Amendment (Medicare Levy Surcharge Thresholds) Bill 2008. As many people would be aware, this is a bill designed to deliver relief to working families, particularly those who are struggling with their household budgets. The purpose of this budget measure was to provide relief to working families and to adjust a threshold which had not been changed or 10 years. The tax, as the member for Higgins would know, was originally meant to apply to high-income earners but now slugs many hundreds of thousands of working families earning less than the average wage. We remain determined to deliver relief to working families. It is true that there has been some opposition to this measure. We have listened to what has been said and we have consulted extensively. I would like to share with the House some comments made in the other place. Here is what Liberal Senator Colbeck said about this measure:If they are talking about indexation _ then indexation of this measure would have put the threshold at about $75,000 or $76,000.Then Western Australian Liberal Senator Mathias Cormann, the Leader of the Opposition's new shadow parliamentary secretary for health administration and, I might note, the former head of a private health insurance fund, said -  - It is interesting that he knows what he is talking about, because I think the member will be very interested when he hears the rest of this answer. It may be that the Leader of the Opposition might like to take the advice of the rest of the frontbench. But let me read the quote first - we will get to that:_ would it be more appropriate, instead of doubling it and probably overshooting the mark, to look at what the figure would be if it had been indexed? I am talking about approximately $75,000 per annum.The Private Hospitals Association said it would be more equitable to use thresholds of $76,000 and $152,000 to be indexed thereafter. Access Economics, in a report for the AMA, said the thresholds of $70,000 and $140,000 would have restored the system to previous real levels if that was the goal. Even Terry Barnes, former senior adviser to the former Minister for Health and Ageing, Tony Abbott, suggested that the new thresholds might be more appropriate at, for example, $80,000 or $160,000. Senator Xenophon has suggested that the threshold should be lower than we originally proposed, while the Greens have asked for indexation. Having consulted and having listened, we are prepared to take a sensible approach to this matter and to the wishes of the Senate, because we are determined to provide much-needed tax relief for working families.In the other place this afternoon we will propose new thresholds of $75,000 for singles, while retaining our original proposal for couples at $150,000. If I take the interjections earlier to be any indication, I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to stand up and affirm that the Liberals will now support these new thresholds. This measure will deliver immediate tax relief to 330,000 Australians - a significant number of working families who need this break. True, it is not as many as we would have liked to have delivered relief to, but the position of the Liberals and of the Senate means that, if this proposal were accepted, 330,000 families would nevertheless be beneficiaries of this measure. It is a pragmatic response following a Senate inquiry and much consultation. For two average income earners, each earning about $60,000, this will deliver an immediate saving of $1,200 to those families in the first year. Just as importantly, we propose that this threshold be indexed each year to reflect wages growth. This will ensure that it will remain relevant into the future rather than ever threatening to become the tax trap that was delivered courtesy of the previous government.There has been a lot of talk, as I have said, in the last few days about the Leader of the Opposition wanting a bipartisan approach to economic responsibility. This is his first test, or his first opportunity. If the opposition truly want to pursue a bipartisan approach to economic responsibility, then this is their chance. The Leader of the Opposition should stand up now or after question time and indicate that he will support this new proposal, which has widespread support, particularly within his own party. He says he is a real leader and he wants a bipartisan approach. This is his chance to stand up and say so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. This side of the House believe that there is a need for very substantial action when it comes to the base rate of the pension. We have said that repeatedly. But it has to be done in a measured way, it has to be done in a proper way, it has to be done in a financially responsible way and it has to be done in a way which does not leave behind two million Australian pensioners. That is what those opposite are proposing - to leave behind two million Australian pensioners.We have not had, on any occasion in the last nine months, one funded alternative proposal from those in the opposition; not one. What we have had is act of economic irresponsibility after act of economic irresponsibility. We on this side of the House will do the right thing by Australian pensioners and the right thing by the nation in the long term. And the right thing by the nation is the right thing by Australian pensioners. To get a sustainable, funded costing into the base rate of the pension is, indeed, very complex. It has to be done properly. It has to be done in such a way that we do not leave two million Australian pensioners behind. And it has to be done in a financially responsible way. That is why, in the budget, we put forward the $500 bonus for age pensioners. I wish we could have done more. We also increased the utilities allowance by $400 for all pensioners.Some of us have been around the House a while and some of us have a long memory about the new-found interest in pensioners by those opposite. I can well recall for year after year ministers in the previous government coming into this House and denigrating disability support pensioners. I can remember it very well. Disability support pensioners, along with the carers, are deserving of justice in this review, just as everyone else is deserving of justice in this review. And justice will be delivered by those on this side of the House. We have had a 100-year history in defending the rights of people on low and fixed incomes. We will do the right thing. You can do the short-term thing. We will do the right thing in the long term, and we will do the right thing by the nation and the pensioners of Australia.</DOC>

 - The government is committed to long-term sustainable growth in the Australian economy. The primary mechanism for delivering that growth is responsible economic management. That means, in the current economic circumstances, a very substantial budget surplus; reining in government spending, which was running at over five per cent real growth when we took office, and getting it down to one per cent; reducing tax as a proportion of GDP over the forward estimates; and setting aside very substantial sums from the surplus to invest in the three major infrastructure funds, which will invest in big, long-term nation-building infrastructure such as the national broadband network. The budget strategy is absolutely central to responsible economic management.Unfortunately, the opposition has been acting in a grossly irresponsible way in its approach to dealing with the budget legislation in the Senate - blocking measures in the Senate at every opportunity and threatening to blow a huge hole worth billions of dollars in the budget surplus. When the Leader of the Opposition was shadow Treasurer he tried to distance himself from the irresponsible populist approach taken by the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bradfield. He tried to portray himself as the responsible, calm person and the responsible economic manager. Unfortunately, in his first week in office, if anything, I would have to say that the new Leader of the Opposition has been even worse than the member for Bradfield was on the responsible economic management front. He has continued the blocking tactics in the Senate and he has recommitted to the member for Bradfield's huge unfunded spending promises. And since the current Leader of the Opposition took over, we see a pattern of deliberate undermining of confidence in the Australian economy by doing things such as raising questions in this place, with not a skerrick of evidence, about the health of the finances of Medibank Private and other private health insurance organisations; by doing things like suggesting that the government should invest in toxic subprime mortgages such as the United States has been forced to do - even though the Australian economy does not have anything like the same problem; and by doing things like contradicting the Reserve Bank governor's assessment of the differences between the circumstances in Australia and in the United States.It is notable that the stand-alone investment banking model appears to be dying, and perhaps it is about time the 'merchant of Venice', the investment banker representing the opposition, actually reviewed his model for approaching economic management, because he has been grossly irresponsible over the first week - even more irresponsible than the member for Bradfield. I doubt whether the new shadow Treasurer is going to be able to offer any great assistance in the role that the former shadow Treasurer played because she does not even know what the Reserve Bank official interest rate is. When asked on radio she said: 'I am just trying to think. I will have to go and check that one out.' To be fair, she did get closer than Barnaby Joyce. She did better than the National Party. You know you are in trouble if you are even less accurate than the National Party on economic matters. But I doubt whether we are going to get much assistance from the new shadow Treasurer.I am feeling nostalgic for the member for Bradfield already! I know that that is a terrible thing to admit, but I am feeling nostalgic. He may have been an irresponsible populist but he knew a good statistic when he saw one. In fact, he knew several thousand personally and intimately. I'll tell you what: he would know what the Reserve Bank cash rate is. He would definitely know. In fact, I am prepared to bet that he would know what the cash rate is in Uzbekistan as well - and probably the bond rate and the growth rate and various other things. He did not have much else other than this supply of endless statistics, but he did know one thing well.A word of advice to the opposition: irresponsible economic populism does not pay. Tearing down the budget surplus, making huge unfunded promises and undermining confidence in the Australian economy and in investment decisions in Australia may score you a few cheap points now but you will get a very different response from the Australian people when they think long and hard about whether you are qualified to manage the Australian economy in turbulent times over the next couple of years.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Even as he asked the question, the Leader of the Opposition looked uncomfortable because he knows how hypocritical his and the Liberal Party's performance is on this question. He understands that Australians would look at the record of the Howard government and ask themselves why the arguments put by the Leader of the Opposition did not persuade the Howard government to act in 1996, 1997 or 1998, and so on and so forth up to last year, when he sat round a cabinet table and the then responsible minister, Mal Brough, said to him in cabinet that we should put the rate of the base pension up - and the Howard cabinet said 'No'. There is no walking away from that fact. There is no pretending that that fact does not exist. At least when they sat over here, the Leader of the Opposition and the former members of the Howard ministry were honest enough to say to the Australian people, 'No. 1, we love Work Choices and, No. 2, we are going to do nothing about the pension'. That is what you said to the Australian people over 12 long years.Well, this government has acted with practical measures in the recent budget, practical measures that will mean pensioners will have more money - $128 received this week - in the form of the utilities payment that we increased to $500. Pensioners had the $500 cash bonus out of the budget. We understand that these measures will make some difference but that there will still be pressure on pensioners, which is why we are engaged in looking at the question of the pension, comprehensively, through a review.Can I contrast that with the approach of the Leader of the Opposition, who has cobbled together a measure that he was amending on the run over the weekend - 'Oops, I forgot veterans' was his approach, and there was a quick cobbling together, an amendment of the motion. And, as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has indicated in the House, yesterday and today, even with those changes there are veterans left behind. As the minister responsible, Minister Macklin, has indicated in the House today, there are two million pensioners left behind.The Leader of the Opposition knows that this is an exercise in politics. It is not delivering a solution. The government is working on a solution to take pressure off Australian pensioners. We have delivered the budget measures. The one thing the Leader of the Opposition does not explain, whether he is here in Canberra or overseas in Venice, is why he did nothing about the base rate of the pension when he was in a position to make a difference, around the cabinet table. Why did he do nothing about it? Until he provides an explanation of that point, everything else that he says will be viewed in its shadow. Until he answers the question: 'Why did he do nothing?' then the things that are being said in question time today will be weighed for what they are worth by members of the Australian community. -  -  -  - </DOC>

 - I was asked to update the House on recent developments in financial markets and their implications for Australia. We have continued to see volatility on global financial markets overnight, with Wall Street falling 3Â½ per cent. US authorities are continuing to work on a solution to the bad debts in the US that are at the heart of the problem, which is of course the US subprime problem. The action by US authorities will build on recent coordinated action by central banks and regulators worldwide, including our own, to increase liquidity and to crack down on short selling. These global difficulties will continue to impact on confidence in share markets around the world and they are most certainly slowing the global economy.Honourable members would be aware that the largest developed economies are all struggling to grow. The UK, Japan, Germany, France and Italy all recorded zero or negative growth in the three months to June this year. So we should not be surprised that these global problems, together with something like 10 interest rate rises in a row under the Liberals, are slowing our economy.Of course, we have been upfront about all of these things from the very beginning. In our May budget we recognised that the combination of slower global growth, tighter credit conditions and high interest rates would slow growth and that this slower growth would have flow-on effects on the labour market. The turbulence in global financial markets is also impacting on our share market and superannuation returns. We understand that this is creating considerable anxiety in our community, particularly for retirees reliant on super as their primary income.So we are not immune from these global difficulties, but we are certainly better placed than most countries to weather the storm. This is one of the reasons why we do need a significant budget surplus - to act as a buffer against the global uncertainty. The new shadow Treasurer has a chance to turn over a new leaf, understand the importance of the surplus in these circumstances and get her party to change their tune in the Senate so that we can protect the surplus and have it there as a buffer against these uncertain conditions. But I somehow get the impression from the behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition and others that this is not going to happen. It has been a pretty bad 24 hours for the shadow Treasurer. It is a tough job, being a shadow Treasurer - particularly now she is on the front bench with a leader who is pretending to have economic credibility.We have had a lot of criticism from those opposite about economic management. Yesterday, I listened quite intently to the member for Curtin's response to my ministerial statement. One part of that statement stood out. This is what she said in her response to my ministerial statement yesterday:The proposal would give the Treasury Secretary significant leeway and flexibility in buying, selling and holding residential or commercial mortgages as well as any securities, obligations or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages. Among the things the US government is asking for is the authority to hire asset managers to oversee the buying of assets.That is quite an insightful piece of analysis. The thing was that it sounded familiar to me. It did ring a bit of a bell. And now I know why: because it was from an article in the Wall Street Journal of 20 September. Very insightful! If I could just quote from the Wall Street Journal article of 20 September:The proposal would give the Treasury secretary significant leeway in buying, selling and holding residential or commercial mortgages, as well as 'any securities, obligations or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages.'And, earlier in the same piece:Among the things the government is asking for is the authority to hire asset managers to oversee the buying of assets.Now, I have taken advice from many quarters, but I have never stolen something directly from the Wall Street Journal and I have never passed it off as my own wisdom! I think following this that the member for Curtin will be forever known as the shadow minister for plagiarism - the Helen Demidenko of Australian politics! Two gaffes in 24 hours - that is quite a start from people who are lecturing others about competence and standing in the community. This comes from people who are strutting around, not caring about interest rates and showing all sorts of pretences instead of understanding what is going on in the economy and the community. I think the Leader of the Opposition might now be regretting his decision to exclude the member for Goldstein from the position of shadow Treasurer. He certainly could not do any worse.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Words are certainly bullets. Inflation hit a 16-year high in the months of October, November and December last year. And of course the current Leader of the Opposition described that as a 'fairy story'. The fact that inflation hit a 16-year high under the Liberals is very embarrassing to all of those Liberals who sit opposite. Essentially, it points to their central failure in economic policy. I make no apology for being frank about the situation in the Australian economy, about the legacy left to this economy by the Liberal Party - inflation at a 16-year high, which pushed up interest rates 10 times in a row. When they pushed up interest rates 10 times in a row, on about the seventh occasion, when there was a 25 basis point rise, the current Leader of the Opposition said that it had been 'overdramatised'. Yes, words are bullets. The bullets that side have been firing into their economic record are substantial.The record that they left this country has exposed the economy at a time when the international situation has turned. So, precisely at a time of great global uncertainty, their legacy of inflation at a 16-year high and 10 interest rate rises in a row have led to less room for the Reserve Bank to move. Fortunately, this government put in place responsible economic policy during the budget and the consequence of that budget was to provide the Reserve Bank with room to move. We cut back on reckless spending, and we put in place essential spending to enhance the productive capacity of our economy so we can do something in the long-term about inflation and do something to get interest rates down in a sustainable way. That is our record. We are proud of it. That is their record and they should be ashamed of it.</DOC>

 - If you go over the lake and drive up Anzac Parade, you will pass the Vietnam Forces National Memorial. It is a very impressive and imposing memorial indeed, with three large concrete walls. Around the memorial are three seats. These three seats contain the names of six Australian servicemen, who at the time the memorial was established had not come back from Vietnam. Fortunately, owing to the work of Mr Jim Bourke and Operation Aussies Home, and with the support of the previous government and the then minister responsible, the member for Dunkley, finances were made available to allow work to be done and provide a capacity to return three of those soldiers back home: Lance Corporal Richard Parker, Private Peter Gillson and Lance Corporal John Gillespie. Their remains have been returned to this country and they were buried with the honour they properly deserve.On 27 September 1969, Private David Fisher was hanging by a rope from a helicopter during a hot extraction at Nui May Tao, 32 kilometres north, north-east of Nui Dat. He fell from the rope. Aircraft personnel undertook an immediate search. There was another search by light helicopter, then an SAS squadron did a search. Later a rifle company searched for three more days and then another rifle company searched for three more days, but they could find nothing. The search was complicated by the fact that the aircrew were unable to identify exactly where he fell.But owing again to the diligence of these people and Mr Bourke, we were able to, after a time, undertake an extensive search. In consultation with the Vietnamese government and Vietnamese veterans, we were able to identify a place where we thought we might find the remains of Private Fisher. On 8 August this year, an Australian investigation team discovered remains that they believed might belong to this man. On 21 August, another investigation team was sent in. That investigation lasted until 28 August. They were able to find further remains and Private Fisher's identification tags. After extensive forensic work, the Australian authorities and Vietnamese authorities were able to confirm that these were indeed the remains of Private Fisher. We will be repatriating Private Fisher home to this country on 10 October.On 3 November 1970, Flying Officer Michael Herbert and Pilot Officer Robert Carver disappeared without a trace in a Canberra bomber, A84-231, during a bombing mission approximately 65 kilometres south-west of Da Nang in Vietnam. Despite four days of extensive air search, their remains have never been recovered.So, from the original six listed on that memorial, by 10 October we will have the remains of four Army personnel returned home with the honour they deserve. We are still hopeful that, over time, we may find the remains of these two missing airmen.On behalf of the government and, I am sure, on behalf of the House, I wish to thank the Vietnamese authorities for the support we receive while we undertake these searches.Honourable members - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - I indicate to the Leader of the Opposition that in the May budget the government did act to assist Australian pensioners. In the May budget the government did act to increase the utilities allowance and provide a $500 cash bonus for age pensioners. As the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Macklin, made clear in the parliament yesterday, pensioners are receiving, as this parliament sits in this period, indexation for a single pensioner of $15.30 per week and $128 from the new utilities allowance. The government provided these additional payments because we recognised that it is very tough for Australia's pensioners. These were new arrangements not provided by the previous government: the increased utilities allowance and the $500 cash bonus provided in this government's budget in May.As the Leader of the Opposition is aware, there is a comprehensive review being undertaken of the age pension. The opposition indicated when this matter was before a Senate committee that it understood the need for a review in this area. I indicate to the Leader of the Opposition, as was dealt with in this House yesterday, that the proposition that the Leader of the Opposition put before this parliament would not have addressed the needs of two million pensioners, including carers, couples and people with disabilities. It would have even failed to include 13,000 single carers and disability pensioners who are over age pension age. There was no indexation of the $30 and there was no understanding of the way in which a variation like this relates to other changes in payments to pensioners.The government is getting on with the job of delivering practical measures to help Australian pensioners now. The government is engaged in a comprehensive review of the circumstances of Australian pensioners and our pension system. The government has made that perfectly clear. The government will respond when that review is completed.</DOC>

 - As members of this parliament are well aware, and as many Australians are thinking and talking about, we confront the most difficult global economic circumstances in a quarter of a century. We have seen major falls in the United States stock market. Global stock markets have fallen by more than 20 per cent since the recent round of instability began and markets continue to be volatile. Overnight the US Treasury Secretary testified before the Senate Banking Committee. He urged support for the US government's plan for major financial institutions and he stated that, to avoid a continuing series of financial institution failures and frozen credit markets that threaten American families' financial wellbeing, the viability of businesses, both small and large, and the very health of our economy, the measures taken in the US were necessary.The US Federal Reserve chairman also noted overnight that difficult conditions are likely to persist. He said:Despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and other agencies, global financial markets remain under extraordinary stress.These are difficult circumstances, but it is important to understand that this nation is better placed than most countries to deal with this turmoil. We have a strong, well-regulated banking sector. Australian businesses are continuing to undertake record levels of investment. We have taken further steps to strengthen Australia's financial markets and we have built a strong surplus, which we need more than ever as a buffer to help withstand these challenges.The Treasurer and I today commented on the release of the most recent International Monetary Fund report on this country's circumstances. It noted that this country does have a prudent fiscal policy and it noted, with approval, the budget surplus settings of the government. It also noted the well-regulated nature of our financial markets and it welcomed the government's major reform agenda working through the Council of Australian Governments to achieve profound reforms that will make a difference for this nation's future. Intergovernmental agreements can be complex, but for Australians this is about better schools, better hospitals, a national approach to climate change, a national approach to homelessness, working together to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage for Indigenous Australians and working together for a seamless national economy. These are the major issues of our time, and we are working to bring this profound round of reform to this country.The government is also working through the Senate to deliver its budget. And, of course, in delivering that budget - in delivering that all-important surplus - we continue to face obstruction and economic vandalism from the Liberal Party. It seems even with a new leader the Liberal Party is intent on derailing the government's fiscal policy direction. To take one example of this - though, of course, we have heard of many - the position of the Liberal Party on the Medicare levy surcharge shows just how out of touch it is with the needs of this nation to deliver a budget surplus and just how out of touch it is with Australians. This is a measure that would provide 330,000 Australians with up to $1,500 in tax relief per year - a tax cut for those working Australians - and the Liberal Party is standing in the way of it. - And the Leader of the Opposition has just confirmed that he is standing in the way of a tax cut for 330,000 Australians. Can I say to the Leader of the Liberal Party, now known in this House as the Merchant of Venice: that is a pound of flesh, and he should consider the circumstances of those Australians. Rather than continue to reaffirm that he will stand in the way of that tax cut, he should do something for working Australians and enable them to get that $1,500.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Firstly, can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the document which I take him to be referring to - a document that has been in the media - is not a document that can be characterised in the way that he has characterised it. This is a document which summarised stakeholder views. Yes, there were a variety of views, and we know that there are pensioner organisations pushing for an increase in the base rate of the pension. None of that is new. This is a document that canvassed stakeholder views and a document that concluded that this was a complex matter and required a comprehensive and thorough-going review.On the question of hypocrisy, which I have been invited to comment upon, can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that it is for him to explain to the Australian people why he ruled out an increase in the base rate of the pension as Liberal Party policy in May this year only now to engage in the questioning that he is engaging in in this parliament - a fundamental shift in the Leader of the Opposition's position from May this year until he assumed the opposition leader's chair. We know of course that, when he was shadow Treasurer, he ruled out the very policy he now says that he stands for.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question. We did receive the IMF report early this morning. It is a report card on the resilience of the Australian economy - a good report card on the government's plans for it. Like the government, the IMF is saying that we can expect some slowing as a result of the fallout from the global financial crisis. But the report also adds weight to the government's view that, whilst we are not immune from global difficulties, we are certainly well placed to withstand the fallout. If I could just quote from the IMF report, this is what the IMF executive directors have said about Australia's strength through responsible economic management:Looking ahead, Directors considered that the sound macroeconomic framework should permit Australia to weather the global downturn and to contain inflationary pressures.The IMF report also went on to give the government's reform effort a very, very big tick. The report strongly commends the government's budget -  -  - No, it does not. Unfortunately for those opposite, it does no such thing. Until they put up their hands over there for inflation at 16-year highs, they cannot claim any of the credit. They can claim no credit whatsoever. This is what the IMF had to say on the economic settings of the May budget:Saving some of the revenue from the commodity price boom in three new funds will take pressure off monetary policy in the near term and enable increased _ investment over the medium term.That is what they had to say about our investment funds. The IMF go to great lengths to point out that capacity constraints in the Australian economy have been responsible for inflationary pressures and, because they were left unattended for so long by those opposite, the result was inflationary pressures in the economy. That is why the IMF have given the government a very big tick for attending to those inflationary pressures and for expanding the productivity capacity of the Australian economy. They went on to say this about the agenda:_ if implemented fully, the broad reform agenda should enhance the flexibility of the economy and lift productivity and labour force participation.They also went on to talk about the quality of Australia's banking and regulatory systems, and I quote again:The banking sector is sound with stable profits, high capitalization, and few nonperforming loans.On this side of the House we do welcome the IMF's assessment, and we cannot understand why it is not welcomed by those opposite. Those opposite have been walking around talking about bipartisanship. You would have thought that they would be supporting a responsible surplus if they wanted to be bipartisan. They would not be up in the Senate vandalising the surplus; they would be getting behind the government and they would be getting behind our surplus and they would be voting for it in the Senate. So, on one hand, the phoneys over there want to argue that they are responsible and that they want to be bipartisan and, on the other hand, they vandalise a surplus which is absolutely essential for Australia at a time of global uncertainty.We certainly do welcome this report, its support for our long-term agenda, its support for our reform agenda in education, infrastructure, business deregulation, climate change and tax. This government is doing everything it possibly can to keep striking a responsible balance between relief for families, support for pensioners and the long-term investment future of this country. There is only one thing that stands in the way of that: the vandalism of the Liberal and National parties up there in the Senate. It is about time we had some responsible behaviour from those opposite. Until they behave responsibly, all of their protestations about standing for responsible management are as phoney as their support for pensioners.</DOC>

 - There is a certain aspect of this question which the opposition has once again got wrong. The figure of 70,000 single-service pensioners the shadow minister has referred to actually takes into account a number of different groups. In fact, if we go to veterans who are single service pensioners, only around 35,000 are included in the definitions that the opposition sought to put forward in their motion. Some 28,000 of that figure of 70,000 are in fact on partner service pensions. They are overwhelmingly the widows of veterans who had qualifying service and who have of course passed away. They do not qualify as war widows. The definition put forward in the proposal by the opposition specifically excluded them, because it referred to veterans only.This government, in its policy when in opposition, led the way for the then government to address issues with respect to the maintenance of the incomes of our most disabled veterans. This government, both in opposition and in government, has led the way to address some of those longstanding issues. There is more to do, and the government has made it very clear that there is. But the fact of the matter is this: the opposition put forward the figure of 70,000 single service pensioners but, when you go to the detail of what they proposed, they are only covering half of that number. Once again, they have left out thousands and thousands in a rush to put forward a policy option which does not deal with the inherent problems that they say they are dealing with. Once again, they have missed the point.</DOC>

 - All members of the House would be aware of the turbulence that has convulsed world financial markets throughout the course of this year. One of the world's oldest investment banks has filed for bankruptcy, the US government has tipped billions of dollars into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the world's largest insurer has been nationalised by the United States government and, across the United States and Europe, markets continue to suffer unprecedented turmoil.A key challenge for the government and for our independent regulators is to remain vigilant in the face of these overseas events. Our prudential regulation is amongst the best in the world, as was recognised by the IMF overnight. So we are well armed, but we are not bulletproof in this turbulence around the world. But even in adversity there can be opportunity. In these troubling financial times there will be opportunities for Australia. In these turbulent times investors will be looking for a safe place in which to invest their funds, and Australia fits the bill. That is why the government continues to take concrete steps to transform Australia into an international financial services hub. It is a government priority to make Australia a leading financial centre in Asia.Tomorrow I will be introducing legislation into the House to reform the way the tax act deals with managed funds - an important step in promoting Australia as a financial services centre. Of course, these changes all flow from our reduction in the withholding tax on budget night - a very important reform that has been widely welcomed. I would have thought it would be something that would be welcomed on both sides of the House, but unfortunately that is not the case.I am asked to report on challenges to the financial sector, and one of the challenges is the shadow Treasurer's complete lack of understanding of economics. The Treasurer has informed the House of some fundamental errors by the shadow Treasurer, and it is with a heavy heart that I have to report yet another error by the shadow Treasurer. In her now infamous speech on Monday, she said this at the dispatch box:It is symptomatic of a government that is unsure of where to go or how far to go. This is a government that says it wants to promote Australia as a financial services hub and then reduces withholding tax for foreigners.I even checked the Hansard this morning and it is still there. Sometimes mistakes can tragically disappear from the Hansard but this one is still there. She came in in full flight, the Wall Street Journal in one hand and a pair of scissors in the other, and off she went to launch an attack on our withholding tax policy. This is an initiative which has been widely welcomed across the financial services sector. Stephen Dunne, the managing director of AMP Capital Investors, said:Reducing the withholding tax for foreign - investors - _ will strengthen Australia's competitiveness as an _ investment centre. - The Investment -  - and Financial Services Association said:It sends a very positive signal to the financial services sector and will enhance our industry in the Asia Pacific region. - It said:It will _ encourage more young people to enter the industry. - Cutting the withholding tax rate is an integral part of our strategy to promote Australia as a financial services hub. The shadow Treasurer completely lacks understanding. Perhaps the shadow Treasurer may attempt to blame the Leader of the Opposition, like she has this morning on the other little mistake in the same speech, the other little mistake which saw her cut and paste from the Wall Street Journal into the Hansard of this parliament. The policy of the shadow Treasurer appears to be: if you tax them they will come. That is the investment policy of those opposite: if you tax them they will come. Yet again we dip our hand into Bishop's bag of blunders and out comes another gem. It is just as well that the shadow Treasurer is not a baseball player, because she would have found out on day 1 that it is three strikes and you're out.</DOC>

I was not aware that you had moved countries and taken up residence in the United States. Now we have -  -  -  - Well, I do know that you need a distraction because there has been a lot of action happening today. I would just like to quote from the Australian online today:_ the offending paragraphs of background were provided for her speech from the leader's office.Is that true? Who provided it? It says provided 'from the leader's office'.

 - I thank the member for his question. Obviously I informed the House yesterday of a changed proposal that is being put to the Senate when there is a debate on the Medicare levy surcharge. We have of course been encouraging senators to support this proposal. But I noticed that the new shadow minister for health, the member for Dickson, came out of the blocks very fast yesterday to say that this was outrageous and a proposal that he would not support.I would like to draw the House's attention to comments made by the new shadow minister for health in August 2006, when, as the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Dutton revealed the numbers of taxpayers who were being hit by the Medicare levy surcharge and revealed that they had doubled since the introduction of the measure in 1997. This was not a passing comment; this was a detailed answer to a question on notice. The member for Dickson, the new health spokesperson for the opposition, conceded that in 1997, when this measure was first introduced, 167,000 people were paying this tax and by 2001 198,000 people were paying this tax and by 2002 it was 235,000 people - and it was very good of the member for Dickson at the time to take the House through these numbers - next it was 282,000 and, by 2004, it was up to 362,000. As we know from other tax office figures, by 2005-06 there were 465,000 Australians paying a tax because the previous Howard government was too lazy to change the tax thresholds. So we know there is an opportunity for the member for Dickson, the new health spokesperson, and the new Leader of the Opposition to note 'Rudd's $1,200 health savings' as headlined by the Daily Telegraph, which I am holding.The opposition has a choice: do they want to support $1,200 in tax relief for many average working families or are they going to keep opposing this measure? When the new Leader of the Opposition made his first speech after having become the Leader of the Opposition, he told his first press conference:I know what it is like to be very short of money. _ I know Australians are doing it tough and some Australians, even in the years of greatest prosperity, will always do it tough.The Leader of the Opposition has an opportunity now to provide relief to those very many families who are doing it tough. He can direct his senators in the other place to vote for this measure, and 330,000 people will immediately benefit from it. It is time for the opposition to stand up and say whether they are for tax relief or not. Is the Liberal Party any longer a party that supports tax relief or not? There will be an opportunity to vote for this in the Senate today, tomorrow or in the coming days, and the Leader of the Opposition and the new shadow minister for health and ageing can provide that relief to 330,000 people. They should do it now.</DOC>

 - I am particularly pleased to answer this question, and I congratulate the member on his new position. I have to draw the line at being asked a question of great concern for our public hospital system. If I recall correctly - maybe people on this side of the House will be able to help me here: which government was it that pulled a billion dollars out of our public hospital system? It was the opposition. And which government - The member for O'Connor then left the chamber. - As I was asking: which government is it that in the first nine months of coming to office has put an extra billion dollars into our public hospital system, $600 million into elective surgery and millions of dollars into nursing - all issues ignored by the previous government? What I am sure the new shadow minister is aware of is that private health insurers do make requests to government to increase their premiums each year. That premium round is due at the end of the year. They start putting in their submissions to PHIAC and others, the actuarial studies are done and, by February or so, we will be asked to approve those premium increases. I have made it absolutely clear that I will take a very dim view of any insurers who think that adjusting -  - I am trying to answer the question. I am not particularly being provided with the opportunity by those opposite. We know that, when it comes to private health insurance and investment in our public hospitals, those opposite always want to go for the cheap line. They never want to look at the actual statistics. They never want to look at the actual detail. They do not care about the working families who would get tax relief through this measure. They do not want to have an explanation of the premium round increases. - If the shadow minister -  - I wonder whether, if I speak slowly enough, he will get thrown out. It seems like he is going to approach being the shadow minister as someone who just wants to interrupt and never wants to actually hear the answer to the question. As the shadow minister knows, the premium round will be dealt with in the new year. We have made very clear that we will take a dim view of private health insurance funds who think that a tax whack for working families is an excuse to try to jack up their premiums. We will take a very dim view of that and we have put them on notice of that. But, if we want to look back at the premium rises that occurred under the previous government year after year after year so those who were in private health insurance paid more and more and more, courtesy of premiums always ticked and flicked by the previous government, he can go back and look at those figures.Of course it would not be appropriate for me to predict what applications private health insurers will make to the government. It is a matter for them. It is a matter for us then to assess. It would not be appropriate for us to try to make some estimate today, as the shadow minister well knows.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I know that the member understands the fundamental importance to his electorate and to the nation of lifting our export performance. The Mortimer report and the IMF report both have a pretty simple message: first, that trade is essential for jobs and economic growth. Both reports then go on to say that we have to lift our export performance. Mortimer says that if we do not lift our exports foreign lenders will not keep servicing our ballooning foreign debt, and the IMF report says that unless we lift our exports our current account deficit just cannot be sustained.I am also asked what Mortimer has to say about our recent trade performance. He gives it a damning scorecard in terms of the previous government's performance. It failed on export growth. Since 2001, the export volume growth rate has fallen to a quarter of that in the 1990s. It failed on productivity growth, achieving zero productivity growth in 2007, after productivity grew rapidly in the 1990s. And it also failed on infrastructure investment, which, according to Mortimer, substantially limited export volumes and competitiveness. That is the reason that the previous government recorded 72 consecutive months of trade deficits. No government in the history of this nation has done as poorly as that. So far as Mortimer is concerned, two-thirds of our cumulative trade deficit, $92 billion worth, was incurred in the last five years of the previous government - and it managed that performance despite the resources boom.I am also asked if there are any recent statements on our trade performance. Well, there are. They were made the other day by the new shadow Treasurer, and she is the one in this place who wants to be judged on her economic credentials. She actually thinks the Howard government's legacy on trade was a great one. - That is certainly not what the records show. But on Monday - I think her first intervention since her appointment to the job - she had this to say:The diversification of our exports has reduced the volatility of the terms of trade.In that single sentence she is wrong on three key economic fronts. First, as Mortimer points out, the terms of trade effect is caused by strong world demand, not by the diversification of our exports. Second, we did not get a diversification of exports under your term of office in government; in fact, we narrowed our export base. The services sector rate of growth in exports fell from 8Â½ per cent to two per cent, and -  - Because you did not have the right policy. And the manufacturing export growth went backwards. Third, as to the reduced volatility in the terms of trade she is simply wrong. There has been strong upward movement in the terms of trade over the past five years. The shadow Treasurer has been accused of plagiarism in this place. I do not make that complaint in terms of that statement because, quite frankly, no-one else would be silly enough to make the mistake of getting three economic facts so wrong in one sentence.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for her question. It is true that the banks have been very profitable in Australia, particularly in the first quarter of this year, and that is why I was so absolutely insistent earlier this year that if there were to be a cut in the official RBA cash rate then that cut should be passed on. - I will answer. I am going to go all the way through it. This is a very important question. It is one that the government is very, very concerned about and has been very active on. But you have got to understand the background. It is quite complex, and those opposite may have some difficulty understanding it. It is true that the big banks have been very profitable, and that is why the government was absolutely insistent that if there were a cut in the cash rate then that should be passed on - and it was passed on, and that is a very good thing. But the government is concerned about the degree of competition in the mortgage market, and that is one of the reasons we have been so insistent on putting in place a bank-switching package, something those opposite could not manage to do in over 12 years.It is also the case that the securitisation market has dried up because of events in global markets. That is true as well and that is producing a situation where the market is less competitive. Of course, that outlook changes by the day and by the week, given events in global financial markets. That is why I have made it very clear on a number of occasions publicly that should further action be required to put further competitive forces into that market then the government would take the appropriate steps at the appropriate time. We acted earlier in the year when it was very clear there was not enough liquidity in the market. There were not enough government bonds and we put more out there. We brought legislation into this parliament to issue further government bonds -  - Well, the current Leader of the Opposition thought it was a good idea at the time - something you could not manage to do. The current Leader of the Opposition understood the need to put more liquidity in the market, and we did issue more bonds. We also, in that legislation, gave authority to the government for the AOFM to be more active in the area, should that be required. We stand ready to take further action in the mortgage market to make it more competitive so that Australian families out there get a fair deal. That is the government's position.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. Those opposite, who lay claim to economic credibility, should take a long, hard look at this report, the latest International Monetary Fund report on Australia's economic performance. The International Monetary Fund strongly endorses the government's economic strategy and importantly has commended the government on its long-term reform agenda. The IMF report says the directors considered that:_ if implemented fully, the broad reform agenda should enhance the flexibility of the economy and lift productivity and labor force participation.The report goes on to say:Successful implementation of further reforms would enhance the economy's flexibility, lift productivity - hear, hear! - and foster labor force participation. Reform is essential to take full advantage of the mining boom that is centered on Queensland and Western Australia, that will require capital and labor to move from other states.The Rudd government is helping to create the conditions for sustained, low-inflationary economic growth. The government is pursuing an ambitious long-term reform agenda aimed at restarting productivity growth. This follows a decade of squandered opportunity when productivity growth after the boom times of the 1990s slipped away until, last year, as mentioned by the Minister for Trade, it not just had fallen to a low level, not just had slowed but had stopped. It had ground to a complete halt. It was zero.The government is investing in an education revolution to restart productivity growth. We are working, through the Council of Australian Governments, to reduce regulation in 27 different areas of reform. We are doing this to advance Australia towards a seamless national economy as called for by the Business Council of Australia. As the IMF says, this government's reform agenda will help lift productivity growth, because today's productivity growth is tomorrow's prosperity. I note that the newly elected Leader of the Opposition said, on 19 September, just the other day:There is a need for bipartisanship and a constructive approach to the economy.I invite the opposition leader to support the Rudd government's program of long-term economic reform as endorsed today by the International Monetary Fund.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I gather that the opposition feel compelled to continue to justify their vandalism of the government's surplus up in the Senate. It is the case that the government's proposal does not affect dramatically the bulk of purchases of cars in the rural sector. - So a ute is a luxury car, is it? Mr Speaker, those opposite introduced the luxury car tax. Let us be very clear about where it came from and what its origins were. Let us be very clear that we increased it in the last budget as a measure to build a strong surplus. I believe it was a fair measure - a small amount of money that many people buying luxury cars could afford to pay. We have had a constructive discussion in the Senate with the minor parties and the Greens and, as a consequence of that, this bill has passed, despite the reckless -  -  - All the chatter is to hide their deep embarrassment about their activities in the Senate. They are up there defending Porsche drivers, up there defending the drivers of luxury cars, against the interests of the Australian people and lower interest rates for working families and farmers. That has been the consequence of their actions in the Senate. Interest rates will be higher for longer as a consequence of their attempts to raid the surplus and also the reckless spending that they have now committed to. The Leader of the Opposition, in a 20-minute press conference on day 1, spent $20 billion - $6 billion in raiding the surplus in the budget and a further $14 billion. The opposition now have the hide to come into the House and complain that a few people buying top-end vehicles are paying too much tax.We reached a sensible arrangement with the minor parties in the Senate. There has been more economic responsibility in the little fingers of the Greens and the Independents and the minor parties in the Senate than there has been in the Liberal and National parties. This is going to continue, apparently. The Leader of the Opposition is going to pay a very high price if he is going to continue to wreck the budget in the Senate, because it will be clear to everybody who is economically irresponsible in this country and who has a responsible approach to budget management. The IMF have given this government a very big tick today, and the opposition is trying to demolish it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Werriwa for that question and, of course, acknowledge his very long history representing police, particularly during his time with the Police Federation of Australia. National Police Remembrance Day is observed by all jurisdictions and on Monday, 22 September a number of speakers from all sides in this House supported a motion by the member for Werriwa to mark 29 September as National Police Remembrance Day. I am sure that the House would also want me to express support for the 50,000 men and women of Australia's police forces who work in Australia and in our region to protect the lives of those who live in our civilian environment.It is shocking to realise that, in the past 20 years, 111 police officers have been killed on duty. This means on average nearly six a year. Unfortunately, it is mostly young officers who have their lives cut short while they are serving their communities. Out of those 111, 88 were constables. That means that the majority of those who lost their lives were under the age of 30. There were officers like Glenn McEnallay, who was ambushed and shot at close range by four men in Sydney in 2002 while he was sitting in his patrol car. Glenn McEnallay was 26. Last month marked the 10th anniversary since Victoria Police officers Gary Silk and Rod Miller were brutally gunned down during a stakeout to catch two armed robbers. Their funerals, many will remember, touched the nation and, as a recent newspaper article on that anniversary mentioned, most police officers can tell you exactly where they were and what they were doing when they first learnt of that double murder. It is also important at this time to recognise the risks faced by officers serving offshore, who serve in unpredictable and often hostile environments.This year, for the first time since 1944, there have been no police deaths on duty in Australia. Hopefully, we can reach the end of 2008 without that situation changing. If you put your life on the line for the protection of the public on a regular basis, then you are performing a public service of the highest order. It is a level of selflessness that most of us never have to contemplate.In 2006, more than 700 police came to Canberra from every state and territory to witness the commemoration of a national monument to recognise the service of Australian police officers who have died on duty. At the time of its dedication there were 719 names commemorated on individual brass touchstones. Next Monday, five new historical touchstones which date from 1884 to 1999 will bear the names of additional police deaths that have been discovered through ongoing research. It is obvious enough that police are essential to the fabric of a civilised society, and we must continue to show our support for the work they do. They have a unique status, and that is reflected in the exercise of powers that the community permits them to uphold the law. Confidence in the proper use of those powers is essential.The Police Federation of Australia, through its president Vince Kelly, has asked that the government give serious consideration to the creation of a national police service medal for serving police officers. The government has, of course, been very willing to examine that request in more detail. While I understand there is quite a lot of work to be done to advance that proposal, I am pleased to advise the House that the government is working closely with the relevant authorities to clarify the formal requirements and to consider the necessary protocols in detail. I believe we have to talk to the palace about these things.At this time of remembrance it is also appropriate that we give consideration to how we do recognise serving officers. I hope to be in a position to provide the House with an update on the matter of a national police service medal in the not-too-distant future. We thank the thousands of men and women in state and territory police forces and the Australian Federal Police who serve our community so well and confront risky, difficult situations on a daily basis.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. His electorate, of course, is home to one of Australia's primary Air Force bases and he, better than most in this place, understands how important it is for Australia to maintain its superiority in air combat capability in our region and how important that is to Australia's national security. He also understands that the government's next investment in our next generation of air combat aircraft will be the single largest Defence investment ever made in the history of the Commonwealth, with up to $16 billion in outlays.So this is a decision that we absolutely must get right. Despite the best, and reckless, efforts of those who sit opposite, the government will not be pressured into making a decision on the run. We saw that practice from the former government with respect to air combat capability. We saw the public debate and controversy generated by that approach to these important issues when they ran headlong into a rushed decision on the purchase of the US Super Hornets from the US Navy.Let us go back to that process for one quick moment. That spirited debate about air combat capability emerged prior to the last election because the former government failed to properly plan for our future air combat capability. Rather than plan for and anticipate the possibility that the F111 may need to be retired early, the former government simply sat on its hands. And then, of course, off the back of a report, when it was clear that the F111 might need to be retired early, the government subsequently ran into a very quick decision to purchase the Super Hornet so as not to be accused, in an election year, of allowing an air combat capability gap to emerge - determined, in an election year, not to be charged with that important charge. And, of course, the way in which the Super Hornet purchase was entered into was not so much about our national security but about saving the political bacon of the then Prime Minister and those who sat behind him. There was no comparative analysis done with other aircraft - no proper analysis done whatsoever. Indeed, in a sense, an analysis would have been useless, because to meet its political needs the former government directed RAAF to deliver an interim aircraft by 2010, and the reality was that there was only one aircraft in the world that could have been delivered into Australian hands by 2010 - that, of course, was the Super Hornet. That is what the lack of a planning process leads you to in these important areas of defence capability.After the election, as promised, the new government reviewed the Super Hornet purchase and in the end, given all the circumstances, came to the conclusion that, as a filler, the Super Hornet was more than capable of meeting Australia's defence needs. But we did not just leave it at that. We determined to work hard in securing better value for taxpayers' money, securing aircraft more cheaply and securing aircraft with greater capability. These changes are now being put into effect and, as a consequence, the taxpayer will secure better value for money.There is only one fifth-generation combat aircraft in service across the globe at the moment, and that is the F22 Raptor flown by the United States of America. The only fifth-generation aircraft that might emerge on the market in coming years is of course the Joint Strike Fighter. The government does not yet have any guarantees about the capability the Joint Strike Fighter offers, nor about when that capability, if possible, may be delivered or what the cost of that aircraft will be. So we are determined not to repeat the mistakes of the former government, not to be rushed into a decision, particularly given that we do not have to sign up to the Joint Strike Fighter until some time around mid next year. There is no rush to enter into this contract. So we will take our time with this decision to ensure that taxpayers get value for money and that the Defence Force, the RAAF in particular, gets the capability it needs to keep the country safe and secure.Yesterday we took receipt of the Mortimer report on defence procurement in this country. Mortimer appealed for a more rigorous approach to these capability decisions. Yesterday the opposition supported the Mortimer review; today, through their defence spokesman, they want to throw all that rigour out the window. So I have some advice for the opposition leader: this debate coming from the opposition's ventures about our air combat capability does us no good. It is no good for our national security and it is certainly no good for our commercial interests as we go, as a development partner, into further negotiations about the Joint Strike Fighter. We are entering into a commercial arrangement and the assistance from the opposition does the country no good whatsoever. The Leader of the Opposition needs to understand that this is not like going down to the local Rolls Royce dealer to buy the next model. Even if it were, not even the Leader of the Opposition would stump up the cash for the latest Rolls Royce without first getting some assurance of what capability it delivers, what the price will be and when it will be delivered. Leader of the Opposition, I suggest you pull them into line.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question and in doing so indicate that the government is in detailed discussions with a range of industries about the nature of the green paper going to the development of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in Australia. The government are serious about not only getting the scheme right domestically but also making sure that we pull our weight internationally - hence the government's commitment to work with like-minded nations on clean coal technology and carbon capture and storage. It is also fair to say that, in giving proper consideration to these matters, industry have raised their concerns. It is a genuine green paper process, and our responsibility is to take those concerns on board so as to guarantee that we produce a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme which is right economically, in terms of ensuring that Australia is still an attractive place for investment, and also guarantees that we make progress in accordance with our election commitment on reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. I know that she is one of the keenest and hardest-working doorknockers in this House. The fact that she has doorknocked more than 45,000 homes in her electorate in the last few years would have shown her that her electorate actually has a lower than average rate of homeownership. I am very pleased to tell her and to tell other members in the House about the first home saver accounts that Australians aged between 18 and 65 will be able to open from 1 October.It is worth reminding the House that this government inherited historically low levels of housing affordability. When the Howard government came into office, the average home cost about four times the average annual wage. By the time they left office, it was about 7Â½ times the average annual wage. That of course made homeownership a distant dream for many young people. Many of them stopped saving because homeownership seemed so far out of reach. Saving a deposit is particularly hard when rents are high because of course it is very difficult to be putting money aside as well as paying higher rents.This government has been working very closely with the financial services industry to help set up these first home saver accounts, which Australians aged between 18 and 65 will be able to open from 1 October. I am very happy to report that the ANZ Bank, the Commonwealth Bank, AMP and 17 other deposit-taking institutions will have accounts registered with APRA to open from 1 October. In a week's time, hundreds of thousands of young people will be able to set up one of these accounts and start saving a deposit.These accounts provide a very strong incentive for young people to save rather than to spend their money because for every dollar they put into this account, up to $5,000 a year, the government will give them 17c on every dollar invested. For example, if a couple save $5,000 a year, they will receive an $850 contribution from the federal government. If a couple are both saving, they will receive $1,700 from the government on their savings. On top of that, earnings on the accounts will be taxed at the special low superannuation tax rate of 15 per cent. That means that a couple on average earnings putting aside 10 per cent of their income into individual first home saver accounts would be able to save more than $88,000 after five years. The very important thing about this is that that is about $13,000 more than if they had been putting the money into an ordinary savings account - a very important difference. These accounts will help people who would otherwise find it difficult to save a deposit for their first home.One of the great innovations of these accounts is that other family members - parents, perhaps grandparents - can also contribute to these accounts and see that government contribution as well. Particularly parents and grandparents, who are worried about whether their children and grandchildren will ever be well settled in a home of their own, can make these contributions, perhaps helping a young person set up an account on their 18th or 21st birthday. If grandparents, for example, put $100 into one of these accounts for someone's 21st birthday, the government would contribute $17 into that account.I would urge every young Australian who has a job, even a part-time job, to think about putting $20 a week into one of these accounts. By starting small and saving regularly not only do these young Australians develop a habit of saving that will serve them well later in life but also the wonder of compound interest will work on that money so that, by the time they are looking to use that money for a deposit, they will have a nice little nest egg. I will conclude by using the words of best-selling financial commentator and columnist, Scott Pape, who wrote:_ the First Home Saver Account rewards first home savers for developing a long-term savings plan._Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Anything that instils the importance of savings at the start of a young adult's life can only be a good thing.</DOC>

 - The Australian community would be concerned at the manner in which the opposition is seeking to undermine the confidence of the Australian community and our genuine endeavour to actually develop a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme which guarantees that we can do the right thing at home whilst doing the right thing internationally. In that context, I remind the House that on Monday this week the Prime Minister clearly indicated that our endeavours domestically and internationally to make real, practical progress with respect to the development of low-emissions coal technology are exceptionally important.The legislation currently before the Senate going to the issue of offshore carbon sequestration is part of the jigsaw that will enable us to make real progress in accordance with the expectations of the Australian community. The reason they expect us to make progress on this front is that they understand that, unlike what would have occurred with those on the other side of the House, we do not want the lights going out because we are a nation dependent on electricity, 80 per cent of which comes from coal fired power stations. That effectively means that we have to work with business, non-government organisations and like-minded countries and pool our resources in the best possible capacity domestically and internationally to get this low-emissions coal technology correct. It also means that we have to pull together a genuine international commitment with all nations working together to put those resources on the table, because time is running out.I remind the House that it was the G8 meeting held in Japan only a couple of months ago that actually said that we have to have 20 projects in place by 2010, with a view to demonstrating their commerciality by 2020. That is why the Prime Minister, on behalf of Australia, a nation that is dependent on coal for electricity to a large extent, and a nation that does well with respect to the export of coal, worth an estimated $43 billion this year, understands that we have to adopt a leadership position - unlike the failure on the other side with respect to leadership both in opposition and in government.The Australian government is about putting in place a capacity to do the right thing, to guarantee that we have a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme that is relevant to the challenges of the 21st century both at home and abroad. I would have expected more of the former Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, because he understands the significance of this. But I simply say it sadly reflects not on him but on the lack of leadership of the member for Wentworth, who ought to know better as a former minister for the environment.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for her question and for her ongoing interest in infrastructure. Last week I spoke about the widespread support from the business community for the government's infrastructure agenda. Today the highly respected IMF have become the latest body to endorse the Rudd Labor government's approach. The IMF have said in this report -  
Opposition member - Is that what they said? - This is exactly what they have said. I will quote directly from them - and attribute the quote to them. They said:Directors welcomed the establishment of three new funds for longer-term spending on health, education, and infrastructure, with contributions to come from the 2007/08 and 2008/09 surpluses.They went on:Saving some of the revenue from the commodity price boom in three new funds will take pressure off monetary policy in the near term and enable increased infrastructure investment over the medium term.There you have the IMF acknowledging that Labor have put in place our surplus with a purpose.But I am also asked about the importance of consistency in economic policy making for the Australian economy. Earlier in question time we had a question to the Treasurer from the shadow Treasurer. In her question the shadow Treasurer referred the Treasurer to a speech by the Assistant Treasurer dated 4 June and published on the Assistant Treasurer's website. She then went on to refer to a speech given by the Treasurer in the House on 18 June 2008, thereby clearly giving the impression that there was no connection between the two. She indicated that the Treasurer's speech was made in the House but the Assistant Treasurer's speech was just available on the website. If the shadow Treasurer was being fair dinkum she would have stated -  - It's called Hansard! Both speeches were for the same bill. It was a bill from the Treasury - a Treasurer's bill. As is absolutely standard procedure, as the Treasurer was not available at the time to give his speech the Assistant Treasurer gave the second reading speech on behalf of the Treasurer. That is why you have an Assistant Treasurer! - I am responding to the issue of consistency of economic policy, which is not understood by those opposite. So you had a speech given by the Assistant Treasurer on behalf of the Treasurer, and then in the summing up of the bill the Treasurer also gave his own speech - nothing extraordinary there at all. Both speeches, on 4 June and on 18 June, were on behalf of the Treasurer of Australia. Not surprisingly, they were consistent - just as the Assistant Treasurer in the former government used to give speeches to bills on behalf of the Treasurer in this House. The fact that they tried to pretend that there was no connection between the two, the fact that they did not try to table the said speeches, is very interesting. They have been caught out.You can understand why they are worried about a debate about consistency in economic policy. You can understand why they have been so defensive, because this is now the sixth gaffe in some three days - two a day is the average of the member for Curtin. When it comes to plagiarism, when the member for Curtin became the shadow Treasurer she did not ask for extra staff - she asked for an extra photocopier in her office! The fact is that the shadow Treasurer was caught out - caught out plagiarising, and then caught out doctoring Hansard. This is what the Australian online says today:Today Coalition sources confirmed the offending paragraphs of background were provided for her speech from the leader's office -  - The fact is that consistency in economic decision making is important, because they have none over there. When caught out, the shadow Treasurer has attempted to shift blame to the Leader of the Opposition. - That is another offence that I have not raised here. The fact is that the Australian report says:Ms Bishop was understood to be 'ropeable' about the error but willing to take the public flak _No, not willing to openly say that it was the opposition leader's fault - just willing to background it. And the opposition leader's -  - statement has been 'no comment' about the responsibility for that.</DOC>

 - Thank you very much to the member for his question. I am upset that you had to move back there to be able to get a question up! But it is a very serious issue, and I would like to answer this, because I think that what this parliament needs is to be spending more time talking about issues affecting Australian young people. That is one of the reasons why this government recreated the portfolio of the Minister for Youth after the previous government abolished it. And it is one of the reasons why we have been working very hard to set in place programs to make sure that we can look at the impacts of a whole range of different issues on young people in Australia.In regard to the particular issue that you brought up about communications, obviously the minister for communications has a very important role, also, in monitoring these issues, because we know that it is not only young people who are using the internet or who are the victims, sadly, of cyberbullying and a number of other issues. But what we are doing is working right across government to make sure that we can see that every portfolio is tackling how that particular area is impacting on young people. In fact - though I would not like to pre-empt the announcement - tomorrow we will be having some more to say about the creation of the Office for Youth.As I mentioned earlier, the previous government abolished the position of minister for youth. They also de-funded many of the operating programs when it came to young people and cut back on the departmental resources to make sure that young people were getting a fair go from the government. What we will be announcing tomorrow is the creation of the Office for Youth. Their role will be to look across government - whether it be the health department, the communications department or the education department - to make sure that we can see, right across government, all the programs that are being put in place for young people -  -  - I realise that the opposition do not want to hear about what we are doing for young people - so much so that, when we had the last round of estimates, do you know how many questions were asked about young people? Not one. The opposition could not bother turning up to estimates and asking one question about young people. We have got a question; I am trying to answer it, and I am trying to outline the fact that this government -  - takes very seriously making sure that young Australians have access to resources and making sure that we have adequate programs in place right across the board. We, on this side, recognise that there is a massive generational divide when it comes to the issues affecting different groups of Australians and that young people are actually facing a whole range of issues, like those that you mentioned, with the internet, with cyberbullying and with text messaging, and we need new responses to that. That is why we need a bureaucracy that is set up to cater for it, and that is why we need a portfolio allocated to addressing these issues. Your government abolished it; ours has put it back in place. We are setting up the Office for Youth so that we can work on this particular issue -  -  - If you can perhaps just zip it for a minute, then I will answer your genuine question. -  - If the member opposite wants to play politics with this, that is fine; I will tell you the genuine answer. -  -  - You are right. This is an absolute tragedy, what has happened recently in Finland. We want to make sure that we put in place every mechanism to prevent any similar tragedies in Australia. That means that we need to tackle this at a number of levels. We need to tackle it within communications and we need to make sure that we have got protections in place, but also we need to make sure that we are regularly engaging with young Australians and that we are making sure that we give them a voice in these public discussions about the issues confronting them, which are quite unique to their generation and which many members of this parliament did not have to deal with when they were growing up. That is one of the reasons why this government has acted to establish the Office for Youth. We will be next week launching the Australian Youth Forum, which is a way that we can have continual dialogue with young people so that we can -  - 'Another talkfest' says the member for Macarthur. 
Honourable member - Mackellar. - Mackellar, sorry. I apologise to the member for Macarthur. - I take that on board. The member for Mackellar says, 'Another talkfest.' We on this side of the House think it is hugely important that we include young people and that we hear firsthand from them what it is that is happening within their own communities, that we give them credit for the fact that they have a number of different problems and different experiences and different perspectives to what we have had before, so that we can ensure that there are government programs and policies in place to react to them. - I have just outlined two things that we already have done which the previous government never did, and we are going to ensure that we continue to work with young Australians to make sure that we can respond to the changing issues that they have before them, something which the previous government was never able to do because it abolished the portfolio and then took away all of the resources which had been allocated to it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. I know that he is deeply interested not only in the future of Australian technical colleges but in all aspects of the government's education revolution. Can I say, on the education revolution generally, that this morning I was able to introduce into the parliament some important legislation which fits in with the government's education revolution agenda. Towards the end of this year, we will enter the new national education agreement, an agreement for government and non-government schools, an agreement to lift the quality of schooling in every school around the country. Today I was able to introduce into this parliament the funding component for non-government schools, some $24 billion. Importantly, I was able to announce that schools that are teaching Indigenous students will benefit from new resources, new investments, the maximum rate of government contribution and new indexation arrangements, because we want to make a real difference to closing the gap on Indigenous disadvantage.The member asked me about Australian technical colleges. I thank the member for his question because it seems to me important to indicate to the House something that the new shadow minister for education unfortunately does not understand. The shadow Treasurer is not the only new shadow minister to get off to a bad start. The shadow minister for education was on Sky TV being interviewed about his new portfolio yesterday and clearly did not understand the economic and financial problems of Australian technical colleges. This House yesterday noted the member for Bradfield's facility with statistics, something that is well known in this House. He is a man who is very good at remembering numbers. When he was the minister for education, he announced the Liberal Party's proposal to create 24 Australian technical colleges. When he did that, he announced a number of numbers related to that. I suspect he can remember them in his head now, but just to remind him and certainly to inform the member for Sturt, who clearly is not aware of these numbers: the member for Bradfield said that these technical colleges would assist more than 21,000 students at a cost of $289 million over four years.Well, there is a problem with that. The problem is not the ability of the member for Bradfield to remember those numbers; the problem is in the delivery of them, because here we are, four years from when that promise was made, and we have enrolment of 4,300 students, not 21,000, and the budget has blown out to $440 million. That is a training cost of $100,000 a student. In a further assault on the already tattered economic credibility of the Liberal Party - in tatters because of its budget strategy, in tatters because of the gaffes of the shadow Treasurer - now the shadow Treasurer is joined by the shadow minister for education, who went on to suggest this was a good training model and we should be aiming to get to 21,000 students, at a cost of $100,000 a student. This is economic vandalism writ large - the shadow minister for education joining his colleagues in a morass of economic incompetence.The government is moving to better training arrangements, which will certainly be more cost-effective and will certainly cover more students. I am pleased to be able to say that arrangements have been made for the future of three technical colleges. These will be better arrangements and certainly more cost-effective for the long term. The newly elected member for Lyne played an important role in this development and led a delegation to see me. He would know that the ATC in Port Macquarie is moving to be the Newman Senior Technical College. It will be moved back to the Catholic school system. In Western Sydney, the Sydney Anglican Schools Corporation will run the college there. In the electorate of the member for Wakefield, who asked me this question, the ATC will become the Regional Catholic Technical College. These are long-term solutions for the future which will enable training in those communities under better and sustainable arrangements.The arrangements we make for the future of ATCs are in addition to our $2.5 billion investment in Trades Training Centres in Schools. Once again, in the interview yesterday, the new shadow minister for education indicated he does not quite get it when it comes to figures either; the shadow treasurer is not alone. When it comes to figures, he said in respect of a $2.5 billion investment, 'big figures mean nothing'. He might like to tell that to the schools in his electorate who are now invited to apply for a $300 million funding round. He might like to say to those school communities - and those school communities in Liberal seats around the nation - that he says, as the shadow minister for education, that $300 million available now for school applications and school proposals does not mean anything. - The shadow minister has just called out, 'It's a joke!' He might want to say to the schools that benefit from this $300 million that their aspiration to have state-of-the-art trades training facilities is a joke. This government is renewing trade training facilities around the country. We have already distributed money that will benefit 96 schools. They have already succeeded in the first round of applications and there is $300 million more there for a training solution.</DOC>

 - Fuelwatch provides information for motorists to get the cheapest possible petrol. The difference between the cheapest and the most expensive petrol in Sydney today is 22c a litre. I cannot tell you where to find the cheapest petrol -  
Opposition members - Go to Google! - and I cannot tell you where to find the most expensive because the private sector sites that the honourable member refers to have only a selection of petrol stations, not all of them. Lots of people understand that. The people of Western Australia understand that; Fuelwatch has been in operation there for eight years. Perhaps that is why the Liberal Party in Western Australia promised to keep Fuelwatch at the last election. Perhaps that is why Colin Barnett, the new Premier of Western Australia, has said, 'I will not touch Fuelwatch; it works.' We have the Western Australian Liberal Premier saying he will keep Fuelwatch and we have had the Leader of the Liberal Party in New South Wales promising Fuelwatch because Fuelwatch will work. If Fuelwatch is defeated in the Senate, the only people in Australia with the benefit of Fuelwatch will be the only people living under a Liberal government, the people of Western Australia. It shows what hypocrites honourable members opposite are.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Shortland for her question. I know she has a great deal of concern for job seekers in her electorate and, indeed, for those people who are unemployed and looking for work. We have recently gone through a round of consultations with employers, employer bodies, employment service providers and others to make sure we have a system in place that will be effective and that will ensure that there is training that will allow those job seekers to acquire the skills that employers are crying out for in this country. I know the Leader of the Opposition said earlier in this place that we do not have a skills shortage, that we do not a skills crisis in this country, but unfortunately employers in this country know better. They have told us that they cannot, in some circumstances, fill existing vacancies. They also know that their training, delivered by the previous government, was in many respects deficient. The employer body in Victoria, VECCI, made clear that the training that was provided to some job seekers was, in fact, deficient. They referred to some those training services as Mickey Mouse courses. This government is very focused on ensuring that the training delivered to job seekers ensures that they acquire skills employers need. That is why this government will roll out 253,000 training places for job seekers over the course of the next five years. We are going to ensure that those job seekers, particularly those who have been denied access to training because of the failures of the previous government, are given opportunities.I know that, when the member for Wentworth became the Leader of the Opposition, he said that he would like to see people in this country being given opportunities. This government is about providing practical opportunities for those job seekers, some of whom are on the margins of our society. We know the previous government was obsessed about marginals, but over the last 10 years they cared not a jot about those who were marginalised. We on this side of the House are concerned for all Australians. We want to provide opportunities for all Australians, including job seekers who have been left out by not being provided the right forms of assistance that they need. We need to turn around the real problem we have with the very long term unemployed. In 1999, one in 10 job seekers were on the very long term unemployment list. Now, almost one in four are on the very long term unemployment list. That is why we need to ensure that there is sufficient training, proper assistance, mentoring and other forms of assistance that will give to those people who have not been given opportunities the opportunities they need to make their lives more productive for themselves, their families, their communities and this nation.</DOC>

 - I very much welcome this question from the Leader of the Opposition. Can I say to him: we would welcome bipartisanship on delivering the government's budget in these uncertain global times. It seems to me remarkable that the Leader of the Opposition would call for bipartisanship on a day on which his Liberal Party has shown less economic responsibility than every independent member of the Senate and even the Greens. His Liberal Party have stood in the way of the condensate measure in the Senate. They voted against it. It has been delivered on the votes of the government, the Independents and the Greens. He was there ready to punch a $2.1 billion hole in the government's surplus this morning. This morning in the Senate, as we prepared for question time, there was the Liberal Party punching a $2.1 billion hole in the government's budget - less economic responsibility than Senator Fielding, less economic responsibility than Senator Xenophon and less economic responsibility than the Greens. - I was asked about bipartisanship, and let me tell you where it can start. It can start with delivering the Medicare levy surcharge changes the government has reintroduced into the House today in order to give hardworking Australians some tax relief. He could indicate some bipartisanship by saying that he regrets showing the economic vandalism and irresponsibility that the Liberal Party showed in the Senate this morning. He could show some bipartisanship on the delivery of the government's budget.The Leader of the Opposition is a man who claims to know something about economics. Well, you do not need to be an expert to come to this very simple conclusion: in uncertain global economic times, the last thing that we can afford is budget uncertainty here at home. In uncertain economic times globally, we need to deliver budget certainty. If he is offering bipartisanship, that is where it should start - deliver the budget, deliver it in whole and deliver the Medicare levy surcharge.</DOC>

 - I certainly welcome the question. Today we have had the Reserve Bank's half-yearly Financial Stability Review delivered, and it certainly does highlight the difficult global environment that we face. The report adds, I think, weight to the government's view that we are not immune from global difficulties but we are certainly well placed to withstand the fallout. If I could just quote from the report:While the Australian financial system has not been completely insulated from developments abroad, it is weathering the current difficulties much better than many other financial systems.It also goes on to highlight the strengths of our financial system, which is very important at a time such as this. I quote:The Australian financial system has coped better with the recent turmoil than many other financial systems. The banking system is soundly capitalised ... and it continues to record strong profitability and has low levels of problem loans.So the Reserve Bank stresses that we do not face the same problems as those that are at the core of the US financial market troubles. If I could quote again:It is important to note, however, that the ratio of banks' problem loans to total assets remains below the average since the mid 1990s, a period of unusually low credit losses.This report underscores the strength of the IMF report yesterday - two reports which are very welcome. But the government is certainly not resting on its laurels.There are some things we can control and there are some things that we cannot control. One of the things we can control is that we have built a strong surplus to act as a buffer against global uncertainly. I heard earlier the Leader of the Opposition pretend that he was in favour of bipartisanship. The fact that he could do that within 30 minutes of a vote in the Senate where the Liberal and National parties opposed the condensate measure is breathtaking. He would make a cat laugh! His hide is so thick. How can he on the one hand call for bipartisanship and then on the other blow the surplus apart in the Senate? It is like somebody calling for peace and then turning around and throwing a grenade. That is what it is like. It is entirely phoney.We certainly welcome bipartisanship. We would welcome it at a time of global economic uncertainty. We certainly do thank those minor parties in the Senate and the Independents who voted for the condensate measure. We thank the Greens, we thank Senator Xenophon and we thank Senator Fielding. As the Acting Prime Minister said before, they have got more economic responsibility in their little fingers than those opposite have got in their whole body. The hide of them to come into this House and claim to be in favour of bipartisanship! And the hide of the new Leader of the Opposition to claim that he represents some new era of economic leadership!Everybody knows that, at a time of global economic uncertainly, we need a strong surplus. This government has put a strong surplus together to act as a buffer and to fund investment for the future. That process has been given a huge tick by the IMF. If the opposition ever needed a reason to support the government's budget measures in the Senate, it is contained in the Reserve Bank report today. - </DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for ageing for her question, and I would make the following simple points in return. Firstly, the member might like to investigate and find out that the pension has actually been the subject of indexation. Indexation measures were delivered this week and a proportion of the utilities allowance, $128, was delivered this week. So she may want to get her facts right when she asks a question. Point No. 2: the shadow minister for ageing uses the surplus figure. Maybe the shadow minister for ageing might like to reflect on the fact that she is a member of a political party that is determined to destroy that surplus and is acting in the Senate each and every day to destroy that surplus. -  - The second point is that it was the member herself who, in her question, raised the budget surplus. I am simply explaining to her a basic economic fact which members of the Liberal Party seem incapable of understanding. In the walk from the government benches over to the opposition benches they have lost every strip of economic credibility. They no longer seem to understand simple facts such as that they are on a course to punch a hole in the surplus. Had they won the vote in the Senate earlier today, $2.1 billion would have been ripped out of the surplus figure the member has quoted in her question.On the question of the age pension, can I say to the shadow minister for ageing as follows: when the shadow minister for ageing was a member of the Howard government, the minister responsible for families and community services, the then member for Longman, went to the Howard cabinet with a proposal for an increase in the base rate of the pension and the Howard government rejected it. Earlier this year, when the shadow member for ageing said that she and the Liberal Party were committed to an increase in the base rate of the pension, she was slapped down and repudiated by the now Leader of the Opposition, who was then the shadow Treasurer. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition did not advocate an increase in the base rate of the pension until he came last week to sit in the chair of the Leader of the Opposition.Compared with that track record, this is a government that is delivering practical measures. We did it in the recent budget. We delivered for older Australians a $500 cash bonus. We delivered for older Australians a $500 utilities bonus - and $128 of that utilities bonus has been delivered in the last week. Unlike the Howard government, which as recently as last year turned its back on Australian pensioners, this is a government that has said we understand it is tough being on the age pension. We understand that action is needed on the age pension. We also understand that it is important to get that action right - not a proposition that leaves two million pensioners out, as the proposition put by the Liberal Party did; not a proposition that was unconstitutional, as the Liberal Party's proposition was; not a proposition that did not understand the intersections between the age pension and other parts of the social security system. This is a government that has already delivered practical measures to make a difference. This is a government that is proceeding in a responsible manner - both responsible in policy and responsible economically. The Liberal Party is committed to neither policy responsibility nor economic responsibility.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition denied 330,000 Australians tax cuts worth up to $1,500 for many families. Shame! - Today we introduced a new bill to the House, with a clear message for the Leader of the Opposition. He needs to be able to look those 330,000 Australians in the eye and explain why he refuses to support a tax cut for them. He needs to be able to do that. I have been giving a lot of thought to why it is that the Liberal Party is so doggedly hanging onto the threshold of $50,000. After a lot of thought, I have decided that there are only three possible options. The first option is that that there was so much scientific justification for choosing that $50,000 threshold that the Liberal Party dare not change it - ever. The second option would be that the original thresholds were set in such a way that, although they were not relevant at the time they were introduced, they would somehow be magically relevant today when they are being defended by the Liberal Party so doggedly. The third option would be that the Liberal Party think that $50,000 is a high income and they do not think that people earning $50,000 deserve tax relief - something the Leader of the Opposition is trying to contest.On option 1, is there any scientific justification for this threshold that they are so doggedly hanging onto? Members might not remember that I advised the House of some comments made by the then Minister for Health, Dr Michael Wooldridge, about how these thresholds were set. Just in case any members have forgotten, I might remind them. He said:I think the numbers in the end were negotiated with Senator Harradine - it was over a bottle of Jameson's whisky late at night _So much for there being any scientific justification! The second option is that they were not relevant at the time that they were introduced but they were going to be magically relevant today. Dr Wooldridge gave us some assistance on this issue as well. He said:We were happy to successfully get through 12 months, let alone worry about a problem in 10 years _Of course, we know that the member for Dickson, having answered questions in the House on this matter, sat idly by as part of the government as the number of people hit by this tax slug doubled and then tripled - and he did nothing.Option 3 is that the Liberals think $50,000 is a high income. Interestingly, Liberal Senator Simon Birmingham was asked exactly this questions morning. AAP reported that Senator Birmingham conceded that $50,000 was not a high salary. In fact, he said:It is certainly not a high salary. Indeed, it is a working salary.The members opposite are denying people on a working salary this sort of tax relief. Let me quote what Dale, a caller to 3AW this morning, said:I'm one of those poor people, working hard, who has to take a second job to help for bills, and I can't afford PHI in the first place. There is just not the money there.He is pushing $51,000 a year, and he said: 'I can't afford it. The money is simply not there.' All over Australia, people have a sinking feeling, like Dale, that the Liberal Party are not going to help working families. But the only sinking feeling that the Leader of the Opposition has is when he loads up his gondola with too much Italian luggage. I mean, really, this is ridiculous! -  - The thresholds that the Liberal Party are doggedly hanging on to are not logical, they are not designed with any thought of the consequences in 10 years time and now they are hitting families that even Liberal senators call 'those on working salaries'. There is an easy question for the Leader of the Opposition to answer today: does he think people on $50,000 deserve a tax cut or not? The Leader of the Opposition can turn his back, but does he think people on $50,000 deserve a tax cut or not? He can vote on that here and he can provide tax cuts and relief to people earning $50,000. If he is not going to deliver that tax cut, he should jump on his gondola and head back to Venice.</DOC>

 - One clear thing that I can guarantee this House is that we will back public hospitals more than you ever did. Let us get that straight. - The member for Dickson also wants guarantees about premiums. Let us be honest about this. The member for Dickson, who has been in the job only for three days, already knows that it would be totally irresponsible for us to try to make some projections about premiums when private health insurance funds -  - The truth is that the member opposite does not want to have an answer from us on premiums where private health insurers are the ones who make applications at the end of the year for the premiums that they are seeking. It is not the job of government to predict what that will be. It does not matter how loud the member for Dickson yells, the truth is that there is of course very commercially sensitive information - not that we are withholding it - that the private insurers themselves do not provide to government until the application round begins. I will say something else: I notice how readily the member opposite wants to quote the private health insurers. I think that the private health insurers' views on premiums will be about as objective as the member for Bradfield's view would be on the member for Wentworth. This is a ridiculous position.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question. Indeed, the government's nation-building agenda has received widespread support. That is not surprising, because we went to the election with a plan to have an infrastructure minister and infrastructure department, and we have done it. We had a mandate to introduce legislation to establish Infrastructure Australia, and we have done it. We had a mandate to establish the Building Australia Fund, and we have done it. We did this over a number of years in the lead-up to the November 2007 election. In that period we were surprised, frankly, that the opposition continued to ignore infrastructure, as they had for 12 long years. It is therefore not surprising that the government's agenda, particularly the agenda of establishing nation-building funds in terms of infrastructure, education infrastructure and health infrastructure, has received such widespread support. We stated that our priorities would be rail, road, ports and broadband. Once again, that has received widespread support from the Australian business community. Just yesterday the International Monetary Fund released a report endorsing the government's strong approach on these issues. That is why I was surprised that those opposite have learnt absolutely nothing during this process. In today's Australian, on top of their attempt to trash our budget surplus, the new shadow minister for infrastructure - they did not bother having an infrastructure minister in government - has threatened to oppose the Building Australia Fund. He has threatened to oppose nation building - quite an extraordinary position.They have come up with a whole range of reasons for that perhaps being the case. They have argued that there are some weaknesses in the Infrastructure Australia legislation. I remind them that they moved amendments in the Senate, which we rejected when they came back to the House, and then they folded their deck of cards and voted for Infrastructure Australia. They did that because of pressure from the business community, who want a nation-building agenda, but also because of pressure from people in their electorates, who want issues such as urban congestion addressed with support and national coordination from the federal government.There is criticism about some of the arrangements that are made regarding the way that the fund will be managed. That is pretty extraordinary, too, because of course we have stated that the Future Fund Board of Guardians, which they set up, will manage the funds. We are currently finalising the arrangements to allow the fund to be set up by 1 January 2009. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I will quote from the Merchant of Venice: 'I am not bound to please thee with my answer.' - I certainly will, Mr Speaker. Those opposite need to understand that in threatening the Building Australia Fund they are threatening support for broadband access for Australians. They are threatening solutions to urban congestion. They are saying that they want parents to remain stuck in traffic jams rather than spend time at home with their kids. The fact is that their opportunism knows no bounds. In threatening to oppose these funds in such an extraordinary fashion, they are showing just how out of touch they are with their constituents in their electorates and also with the business community, with the Business Council of Australia, with the Australian Industry Group - with every other business organisation in this country that is supporting the Building Australia Fund and supporting the other long-term investment funds. They should wake up to themselves, get in touch with their electorates, get in touch with their business community and support Labor's nation-building agenda.</DOC>

 - I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for his question. This is a government that believes there should be proper processes when it comes to disbursing government funds. That was not a belief shared by the Howard government when it had its Regional Partnerships program - and do I need to remind members of the Liberal Party about the things that were uncovered about the Regional Partnerships program and its straight-out, unmitigated political manipulation by the Howard government for the advantage of the members in marginal and National Party seats? - I can understand why members of the opposition and Liberal Party do not like to be reminded of their shameful track record when it comes to regional rorts - a shameful track record of waste and manipulation for political purposes. - Can I remind members opposite that the approach of this government is one where we have established Infrastructure Australia to advise on infrastructure decisions, the first time that we have had a body to comprehensively look at the need for a nation-building agenda. Looking across this country, we know there are communities that are crying out for nation-building projects. We have urban congestion, we have bottlenecks when it comes to rail, when it comes to ports, when it comes to the transfer of goods from rail to ports. These are economic capacity constraints. They are things that confront working Australians every day as they try and do something as simple as travel to work.Infrastructure Australia is there to provide objective advice. When it comes to the other funds that the government is establishing - for example, the Education Investment Fund in my own portfolio - there will be an objective advisory structure. All of this stands in stark contrast to the days when the former member for Dawson would manipulate documents immediately before caretaker periods in order to splash money out in marginal seats to assist Howard government members - a shameful track record, one that Liberal Party members should recall, and one of these days they should apologise to the Australian people for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. The government is committed to delivering long-term sustainable growth for Australia. In order to do that, the government has set out a very clear plan to pursue that objective, which is focused on the development of long-term investment in infrastructure through the three big infrastructure funds and on establishing major projects, such as the national broadband network; the education revolution; taking action on climate change and water, which is long overdue; improving productivity in our workplaces and businesses through deregulation and regulatory reform; and the most important element of all, maintaining a strong budget surplus.The opposition's response to the government's plan has been totally incoherent. The opposition tell us that they support lower taxes and, apart from lower taxes for Ferrari buyers and Porsche buyers, their track record suggests the opposite because they have just defeated in the Senate a reform measure with respect to the Medicare levy surcharge that would have delivered substantial tax relief to thousands upon thousands of middle-income families in Australia. They say they want to spend up big on pensioners, and yet they have defeated the government's initiatives in the Senate with respect to dental services for low-income earners and pensioners. So they did not seem to really care very much about pensioners there! While they are suggesting the government should spend up big helping pensioners, at the same time they are endeavouring to make it much harder for the government to do that by blowing giant holes in the surplus. And they claim to be the party of responsible economic management! They are deliberately spreading fear, deliberately seeking to talk up the risks to the Australian economy by suggesting that Medibank Private and private health insurers are in financial difficulties, thereby undermining confidence amongst investors and consumers, with significant potential negative impacts for the economy into the medium term.A couple of days ago I confessed that I was feeling a bit nostalgic about the absence of the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bradfield. I am sad to say the feeling is getting worse. There has to be some treatment I can get for this condition. It is getting worse. - I have no idea what is on billboards in Sydney. The former Leader of the Opposition, on major economic issues, had a habit of sitting on the fence. At least he knew where the fence was. That was helpful. The current Leader of the Opposition and shadow Treasurer have been all over the place with respect to the opposition's economic policy in their first week and a half in place - plagiarising the Wall Street Journal, not knowing the Reserve Bank interest rate and, most importantly, in the Senate by knocking over tax relief for middle-income earners. In truth, the opposition do, in reality, have a plan, even though they do not know they have a plan. Their plan is simple. The Liberals have a three-point plan for economic policy: spreading fear, spending money and wrecking the surplus. That is the three-point plan for economic management that the Liberal Party are putting forward.The government has a very different plan. The government has a plan that is built around investing for the future, that is built around investing in infrastructure and skills, that will deliver the economic capacity that will deliver prosperity into the future, that will deliver sustainable long-term growth for Australia's economy and ensure that the working people and pensioners of this country have decent living standards in the future. The government will stick to that plan. The government remains committed to delivering that plan, notwithstanding the obstruction and resistance in the Senate. We will continue to pursue all of the elements of our budget in order to deliver the surplus that will be the foundation stone for long-term sustainable growth.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I do not necessarily accept the premise of the opposition's critique of the proposal that we are putting. - The Treasury figures are indeed out there.An opposition member - Do you accept Treasury's figures? - Of course I accept the Treasury figures: less people will be dropping out. But I do not accept the opposition's critique of the consequences of that. I do not accept it for one minute because your critique says that that therefore has an extraordinary impact elsewhere in the health system. You come in here and carry on about the public hospital system, when this government has put an additional $1 billion into the public hospital system. They have the hide in the Senate to vote down a tax cut for hundreds of thousands of working families. You should be absolutely embarrassed by your performance in the Senate.We will run the bill back up into the Senate, we will appeal for the support of the minor parties and the support of the Greens and we will get the support of the Australian people, because they deserve some tax relief, which has been denied them by the Liberal and National parties.Why is there an advantage in the first year? Because the indexation arrangements are entirely different. That is why. In the first year it does cost more, but in the end there is a greater saving. That is the case. If you are incapable of understanding that and incapable of understanding the Treasury modelling you are not fit to be the health spokesman.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lindsay for his question. I am sure all members of the House are very mindful of the devastation caused 12 months ago by the outbreak of EI. There have been different estimates of the total cost to industry. The figure of $1 billion is often quoted. It is probably fair to say that we will never know the full extent of the cost of that outbreak. Therefore we can understand the anxiety felt by many of those involved with the horse industry with the reports overnight - and more information has come out today - that, of the 74 horses in quarantine at the Eastern Creek quarantine station, one horse has tested positive for equine influenza. An immediate retest on the same sample was done last night, and on the retest it came back negative.Each horse is tested some five times - twice on pre-export and three times on arrival in Australia. This horse had already passed the first four tests, with negative findings. The fifth one came through with a positive finding and there was an immediate retest, which again came out negative. As an extra precaution to make sure that there is no equine influenza within the quarantine station, each of the 74 horses within the station has now had two samples taken, and they are being sent to two separate labs - the Camden lab and the Geelong lab. Those tests will be done independently, and in the next few days we will know whether or not the negative tests we have had in every other instance are confirmed by the independent sampling.Under the new quarantine arrangements for imported horses, each horse has these extra tests done - two pre-export and three post-arrival. The Eastern Creek quarantine station was already in lockdown and remains so. No horses will be released until the test results confirm that they are indeed free from equine influenza. Quarantine measures at Eastern Creek have been strengthened since last year's outbreak to include 24-hour security, close monitoring and strict enforcement of quarantine procedures. Revised import conditions also now enforce a strict vaccination requirement for horses entering pre-export quarantine facilities.On 12 June this year I released the government's response to the inquiry by Commissioner Ian Callinan AC into the outbreak. The government accepted every single one of the 38 recommendations to strengthen our quarantine measures for imported horses. These recommendations are being implemented with the cooperation of the horse industry, importers, airports, airlines and freight handlers. This week I met with internationally recognised quarantine expert Dr Kevin Dunne, who has been appointed interim Inspector-General of Horse Importation by the government. A little over two hours ago I spoke with him on the phone and he was on-site out at Eastern Creek.Â The government takes Australia's quarantine and biosecurity challenges seriously. We need to do all we can to ensure all Australians and other nations have confidence in the integrity of our systems and we act quickly and efficiently when facing challenges like those at Eastern Creek. As we head towards this year's spring racing carnivals, I acknowledge that the tougher quarantine measures do create some inconvenience for industry. But they also place Australia and the horse industry in a much stronger position to withstand threats to our biosecurity.</DOC>

 - I am delighted that the member has asked me that question. He asked me a similar question yesterday. It relates to the luxury car tax, which those opposite tried to defeat in the Senate, tried to vandalise the budget surplus in the Senate, only a few days ago. We got a lot of common sense out of the minor parties in the Senate and they voted for a revised proposal. What occurred in the House later on yesterday was - I think it was suggested by one of the members of the National Party up there - that, when I said that the Liberal and National parties had introduced this luxury car tax, he got up and said they had not. In fact, they did. The member for Higgins introduced the new luxury car tax in 2001.Opposition members - No, he didn't. - Yes, he did. He introduced the new luxury car tax in this House in 2001. We put a proposal to increase the luxury car tax from 25 per cent to 33 per cent in the budget so that there would be a small saving from people who bought luxury cars to assist us in the savings process of building a very significant budget surplus. As a consequence of the vandalism of those opposite in the Senate and their inability to be reasonable in the passage of those budget measures, we agreed to some changes with the minor parties in the Senate.The member opposite pretends to represent rural people, when he knows that most four-wheel drives are completely unaffected by this increase in the tax. Things like farm utes are not affected at all. But some fuel-efficient vehicles that are luxury cars were exempted as a result of amendments carried in the Senate. The consequence of those amendments is as the member has indicated. But the fact that those amendments occurred is the fault of the Liberal and National parties in this House. They put the interests of Porsche drivers ahead of the interests of average working families and people living in regional areas. It is as simple as that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Melbourne Ports for his question. Yesterday, this House passed the second stage of the Rudd government's reforms to remove same-sex discrimination from Commonwealth laws. In fact, the laws that were passed by this House yesterday remove discrimination from some 68 laws, with knock-on effects to others. They include the areas of social security, taxation, Medicare and educational assistance.The debate took place over some three days, and there were some outstanding contributions from members from both sides. I congratulate those who participated. I expressed disappointment yesterday, however, that one member was absent from the debate, and that was the member for Wentworth. Members will recall that before the last election, the member for Wentworth circulated a newsletter -  -  - Members in the House will recall that before the last election, the member for Wentworth circulated a newsletter to his electorate in which he supported the need for reform. Indeed, that newsletter referred to statements such as 'Turnbull takes on mission for gay and lesbian rights' and 'Malcolm Turnbull has embarked on a personal crusade to convince his' -  - The statement contained in the newsletter was that, 'Malcolm Turnbull has embarked on a personal crusade to convince his cabinet colleagues.' The article also quoted the honourable member, 'I pledge to continue the fight until justice is done.'I personally accept that the honourable member is entirely genuine and sincere in expressing those views - that is accepted. But clearly, now that he is in the position of Leader of the Opposition, he has the ability to exert a little more than a degree of influence on his colleagues. It was sincerely disappointing that the honourable member did not counter some of those more extreme sentiments that were expressed during the course of the debate yesterday. Indeed, I note that a spokesman for the honourable member told the Age newspaper - or, at least, it is reported in the Age newspaper - that the honourable member had spoken on the first reading of the bill. I think the record will show otherwise.But, at the end of the day, these reforms are long overdue. They do nothing more and nothing less than remove discrimination against a group of fellow Australians who have been discriminated against for far too long. They do not undermine in any way, shape or form the institution of marriage. That is made quite clear in legislation that has supported in this House - that marriage is between a man and a woman. As I say, these reforms do nothing more than remove unjustified discrimination that has occurred for too long. I genuinely believe that the Leader of the Opposition is sincere in his views on this matter, and we look forward to him using his new position to secure passage of the legislation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The government is aware that some local government councils around Australia are exposed because they have had investments in organisations such as Lehman Brothers. Some may have had investments in other subprime type products.Most of the high-exposure councils appear to be in New South Wales and Western Australia. All other states have relatively little exposure to these types of investments. Of course, as we all know, local government is established by state and territory legislation, and it is the responsibility of the states and territories to exercise proper financial oversight of council investments. I note that the New South Wales and Western Australian governments have commenced reviews of the local government investments in 2008 and have certainly significantly tightened up on the oversight of local government.I am also aware that some councils in New South Wales are contemplating legal action to recover some of the investments. So that is the extent of our knowledge of the exposure of local government to these investments, but as we have been saying in this House for a long time and has become readily apparent in recent times -  - I know he is a new shadow minister, but the truth is that they are not accountable to us. But we certainly do take a deep interest in these issues. - If they want to play this silly game, when were these investments made and were they accountable to the previous government? If you want to play that serious game, when were the investments made? Many Australians, who are very genuine, and many organisations, both government and corporate, have made investments in these products. They are going to live to regret the investments in these products. People around this country and around the world have been victims of what has been the fallout from the US subprime crisis. We have said repeatedly that we need to strengthen our system as much as we possibly can. As I have said to the House of a number of occasions, we are implementing in full all of the recommendations in the Financial Stability Review, and we have been doing that this year. We have introduced legislation in this House to pursue those recommendations, to strengthen our financial system. We will continue to do that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question and note that she is herself a very passionate advocate for the interests of young people in Adelaide's south, as well as I believe being the youngest member of this House. It is my great pleasure to provide both her and the House with further information about the Australian government Office for Youth, which was launched earlier today. Our government recognises that young people today face some complex and unique challenges quite unlike those experienced by previous generations. Media reports just this very week highlight issues such as the prevalence of self-harm practices, predominantly amongst teenage girls; the intense and increasing focus on body image; and emerging challenges, such as cyber-bullying, which accompany new technologies.In addition to so-called youth issues, we also recognise that there is a generational divide in the opportunities and experiences of younger Australians across a broad range of portfolio areas. Many young Australians have quite different challenges and experiences in areas such as the costs that they pay for their education, the struggles for first home ownership and the consequences for them of dangerous climate change when the rest of us may not be here to pay the full price. Clearly, different times and different issues require different mechanisms and measures. Through the establishment of the Office for Youth, the Rudd government will be well placed to honour its election commitment and respond to the particular issues, challenges and needs of our youth.The office will undertake a number of key roles. They will play a strategic role across government to bring a youth specific focus and ensure that the very best policies, programs and services are in place to serve the needs of young people. They will provide a safety net to alert government to issues and initiatives going forward which may have particular implications for young people. They will work on a few targeted priority areas. I can announce that one of the first of these will be working with the ministers for health, communications and the status of women to address what has been identified in major national surveys as the No. 1 concern of Australian youth, that being healthy body image. The Office for Youth will ensure that, at a structural and policy level, there is a dedicated focus on young Australians. Our efforts to serve this generation well will be further boosted next week with the official launch of the Australian Youth Forum, an initiative to better directly engage with both young Australians and the youth sector.This government is strongly committed to making a real difference in the lives of Australia's youth. The announcement today of the Office for Youth is yet another one of our election commitments that have been honoured. It is yet another step forward towards undoing the damage that was done by the previous government in this area. Most importantly, it is another way that the Rudd government is demonstrating its commitment to ensuring that young Australians are empowered, are included and are well supported by their government.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for her question. I am happy to answer questions on liquidity in our banking system. It is a very important issue, and perhaps it has never been more important than it is at the moment. I would like to remind anyone who is commenting on liquidity issues that we are in a very difficult period in which matters of confidence are paramount and we need to keep our comments balanced. I would like to just quote from the Reserve Bank's Financial Stability Review, which was published today, which I think gives a pretty good and comprehensive analysis of what is going on in the banking sector, what is going on with deposit-taking institutions, what is going on in terms of securitisation and so on. I would commend her to have a look at that. I just want to quote a little from the report:The Australian financial system is well placed to weather the current difficulties in the global financial system _ the Australian banking sector continues to be highly profitable. The system is soundly capitalised and the banks have high credit ratings and relatively little exposure to US sub-prime - debt. That is very important. When we are talking to this issue, we have to continue to repeat that so this country does not get mixed up with the problems that are occurring in the United States. Any loose talk along those lines can be very hurtful to confidence and certainly not very helpful in the current environment.That report card, if you like, from the Reserve Bank today is not an argument for complacency. It is an argument for confidence in our system. If you go through that Reserve Bank report, you will see that they do make the comment that in the securitisation market at the moment things are very difficult and that those organisations, including smaller banks and other institutions that have been relying on securitisation, are having great difficulty. As a consequence, the deposit-taking institutions are doing more business. Certainly those who are in the big four are doing more business. That tends to indicate to me that we may have some issues in terms of the competitiveness of our mortgage market and that they may need to be addressed in the near future. The government put legislation through this House in June -  - I think the problem lies with the member, Mr Speaker. In June, we took steps to support liquidity in the bond market, but we also broadened the investment powers of the AOFM. We did this to provide increased flexibility to respond to difficult global circumstances. These powers are there if they need to be used, and they will be used if it is necessary.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for his question and the member opposite for her contribution on addressing global warming, which is to put shadecloth over the Great Barrier Reef. They would not ratify Kyoto but they had the bits of green out ready to go. - The government takes seriously the need to have a comprehensive approach to tackle dangerous climate change. In delivering the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, we have committed to providing assistance to Australian households to take practical action to reduce their energy use, to save on energy bills and to make a tangible contribution to reducing carbon pollution. We are bringing forward a national strategy on energy efficiency to provide the coherence and national leadership in this area that has been lacking for the last 12 years - leadership for business, for industry and for households to take cost-effective energy efficiency actions.I note, today, a new report from the Brotherhood of St Laurence, KPMG and Ecos Corporation emphasising the importance of energy efficiency for households, particularly those on low incomes. We welcome the contribution of that report. It is something that the government understands very well. In fact, we are putting in place some $1 billion of household and community renewable energy and energy and water efficiency measures, which we have announced in the recent budget. Since 1 July, over 2,200 schools around Australia have registered to become solar schools. We very much welcome the great interest that communities and schools are showing around Australia for the Rudd Labor government's program. We will be providing more funding and more installations of PV solar systems in 2008 and 2009 than in any year in Australia's history. This comes after -  - the member for Flinders, who is making interjections across the chamber, jumped out of an aeroplane to tell us how the solar industry was in free fall. Within days, we found that the figures on solar applications for the PVs were at record highs. Memo to the member for Flinders: look before you leap.If we look at the coalition policy approach in this area, we can see that there is scant evidence that they recognise the importance of the scale of the challenge, or the role that constructive programs and a comprehensive strategy can bring into play. Next month, I am pleased to say, we will start seeing the first energy rating labels appear on televisions, which are one of the fastest growing sources of household energy use. Households will soon be able to identify cost-saving, super efficient appliances through new 10-star labels. Last Sunday, in Melbourne, I was pleased to announce, with the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, the Green Precincts Fund - a commitment of some $15 million to support at least 10 high-profile energy and water saving projects around Australia. We have launched Green Precincts -  -  - Water savings - that is absolutely right, as the member opposite interjected. The member for McEwen then left the chamber. 
 - Despite a team that some of us here support not going quite as close to the grand finals as it possibly could, we were very pleased to launch the Green Precincts project at Windy Hill in Melbourne - home of the Essendon Football Club. It is also a community facility where families come to kick a footy around with their kids. They will be installing an innovative 800,000 litre water storage system under the oval and utilising other renewable energy technologies. Good on you, Bombers. It is a fantastic program that is delivering on one of this government's election commitments. These are responsible and positive measures that we are taking now, like the response from the community and like the 2,200 schools that are already registered to become solar schools. This government is delivering on energy efficiency and tackling dangerous climate change.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. It is true that late last year and early this year it was very difficult in the securitisation market. It is also true that as recently as only a month ago a number of those institutions that were active there were beginning to be successful again. Of course, that has now been dramatically affected by the events of the last couple of weeks. That is the very simple answer to the member's question.What we are doing is keeping in constant contact with our regulators. We want to ensure that the system is robust - it is well capitalised through this difficult period. The one thing we will not be doing is making silly suggestions like that made by the Leader of the Opposition that we should somehow go out and buy US-style bad debt. That is what he said to Laurie Oakes last weekend. I note there has been a fair bit of commentary about the Leader of the Opposition's statements to Laurie Oakes last weekend, not the least of which came from the member for Higgins on Lateline on Tuesday night. The member for Higgins was not impressed at all on Lateline on Tuesday night. If I could just have a look at what he had to say, this is Peter Costello on Tuesday night:I'm going on to make the point in my view no major financial institution in Australia has the exposure to the subprime of anything like the dimension of the United States.And then:TONY JONES: Why doesn't Malcolm Turnbull repeat what you say?PETER COSTELLO: You ask Malcolm Turnbull what he's on about, I'll tell you what the situation is.TONY JONES: But is it economically wise to be recommending the Government back financial institutions if they don't need backing?PETER COSTELLO: If an institution gets into trouble in Australia, there has been backing. HIH is an obvious example.That has to be the understatement of the week! The government is watching and monitoring this situation closely. The government is in daily contact with all of our regulators. We stand ready to take any action that is required. But our system is healthy - and you can see that from the report today from the Reserve Bank.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wakefield for his question. The Rudd government believes that good workers should not be dismissed on the spot for no reason and with no remedy. At the same time, the government recognises the special circumstances of small businesses. They have no human resource management departments. They cannot easily redeploy their staff to other divisions or to other workplaces. They do not have the time for drawn-out processes and cannot pay expensive legal bills. Compared with larger businesses, small businesses will benefit under our unfair dismissal system from a doubling of the qualifying period from six months to 12 months, during which time no claim for an unfair dismissal can be made. Small businesses will also benefit from a simple, six-paragraph Fair Dismissal Code, which, if followed by a small business owner, enables the employer to dismiss an employee fairly.I want to thank the members of the Small Business Working Group and the union working group, who worked so hard and so cooperatively with the government in developing this simple but fair system. In working together, we have shown that you do not have to make a choice between fairness and efficiency.I am asked by the member for Wakefield as to the reaction that we have received to the announcement by the Deputy Prime Minister of the government's arrangements for unfair dismissals for small businesses. I am very pleased to be able to report that the National Farmers Federation has indicated its support for the regime and it has said:Farmers sign off on Govt's 'Fair Dismissal Code'THE National Farmers' Federation (NFF) today endorsed the Australian Government's Fair Dismissal Code _ as 'striking a sensible, practical balance for employers and employees'.There has also been reaction from the Council of Small Business of Australia, COSBOA, headed 'Fair dismissal code acceptance':Small business can be pleased with the outcome as this tool provides a simple checklist to follow which ensures employers can be protected from fraudulent unfair dismissal claims.And the Australian Industry Group has said that the fair dismissal code for small business will be short and easily applied. So there you go, Mr Speaker - endorsements from small business representative organisations.But I was asked about obstacles to the passage of this legislation. Well, senior coalition frontbenchers have indicated their opposition to providing protection against unfair dismissal for the employees of small businesses. Just a little earlier this month, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, now the shadow Treasurer, confirmed that the opposition would adhere to three core principles, including a small business unfair dismissal exemption. So there is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying that the coalition will support an ongoing exemption - that is, oppose our fair dismissal arrangements. Also, the shadow small business minister said, earlier in the year, that any attempt by Labor to apply unfair dismissal laws to small business will receive his absolute and confirmed opposition.So what happened a couple of weeks ago to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow small business minister under the new leadership of the Liberal Party and the opposition? They were both promoted. They were both promoted because the Leader of the Opposition is opposed to providing basic protections for the employees of small businesses. The Leader of the Opposition is saying that four million Australians who work in small businesses should be able to be sacked on the spot with no explanation and no remedy.The truth is, under the new Leader of the Opposition, the Liberal Party is still the party of Work Choices. No matter if there is a change in the leadership; the Leader of the Opposition is leading the party of Work Choices. I would urge the Leader of the Opposition, here and now, to repudiate his deputy leader, to repudiate his shadow small business spokesman and to pledge his support for the government's fair dismissal system. But he will not, because the Liberal Party was, is and always will be the party of Work Choices.There is a pretty clear pattern here, and the pattern is that the Leader of the Opposition does not support the vulnerable in this country but supports the powerful in this country. We have seen that in relation to the budget measures and the behaviour of the Leader of the Opposition and his party in the Senate. What has happened? Increasing the threshold of the Medicare surcharge would have provided much needed relief for people earning between $50,000 and $100,000 - opposed. They were opposing that tax cut for these people in the Senate. What are they doing in relation to the Commonwealth dental scheme? They are opposing our ability to restore the Commonwealth dental scheme. - I will indeed, Mr Speaker. While they are opposing these measures for vulnerable people, they are also opposing a condensate tax increase that would have affected some of the wealthiest companies in this country. If they got their way, it would ensure that those companies would keep more of their earnings. They were opposing a luxury car tax -  - I saw on television today the actor Michael Douglas doing some very important work with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and it reminded me of the Leader of the Opposition. - The Leader of the Opposition is the Gordon Gekko of Australian politics. You are the Gordon Gekko of Australian politics!</DOC>

I think it was very generous of the member for Kennedy, who must have consulted with the member for O'Connor in the drafting of that question! In response to the member for O'Connor's question, can I say the following. No. 1, it is interesting to me that he should be questioning about greenhouse gases, when he sits in a party of climate change sceptics. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. No. 2, can I say to the member for O'Connor that, of course, the government is very happy to look into the questions that he has raised - should he seriously want to pursue them - and provide him with a briefing on the matter. But it does seem to me that the member for O'Connor might want to think seriously about the policy settings of the party of which he is a member when it comes to climate change before coming into this House and feigning any degree of concern about the matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cunningham for her question, as we draw to the end of another sitting fortnight in the federal parliament - and an interesting sitting fortnight it has been. It started with the memoirs of the member for Higgins, was inclusive of a change of leadership with a new Leader of the Opposition, encompassed a gaffe filled start by the new shadow Treasurer, and today gave us, most remarkably, the spectre of an opposition gagging its own suspension motion and appointing the member for O'Connor to be in charge of Liberal Party tactics in this place - a remarkable week in Australian politics.I am asked, at the end of this remarkable fortnight in Australian politics where we have seen these events emerge, about progress in the government's agenda on workplace relations and getting rid of Work Choices. Can I remind the House that the government has already delivered the end of Australian workplace agreements through its transition act and before the end of the year we will introduce into this parliament the rest of the government's Forward with Fairness agenda. That agenda will introduce fairness and balance back into Australian workplaces - a safety net that people can rely on, a fair bargaining system, a new industrial umpire and a fair system for unfair dismissals. We know the history of Work Choices and Australian workplace agreements is one of rip-offs. We know from the data that 63 per cent of Australian workplace agreements cut penalty rates, 52 per cent cut shift loadings and 51 per cent cut overtime.I am asked by the member for Cunningham about progress on analysing the impact of Work Choices on working families. At the end of this sitting fortnight I regret to inform the House that a new analysis is not available. I had hoped that with the publication of the member for Higgins's memoirs we would have the inside story of Work Choices and we would have access, finally, to the inside information about how much the Howard government knew about how bad Work Choices was. I even went to the trouble of getting a discounted copy of the member for Higgins's book out of the remainders bin at a bookshop. It cost me slightly over $30 - discounted from $55. The bookshop proprietor said to me, 'If you picked out one that was signed I'd give you 10 bucks to take it out of the shop!' But the one I picked out of the bin was not signed so I actually had to part with $30 for it, but not $55. Having parted with the money to help the member for Higgins's book sales, to help him with his royalties - I am a generous woman - I looked -  - Well, he is offering to sign it and then I can give it to someone and give them 10 bucks to take it as well. Despite my act of generosity in supporting the member for Higgins's income stream, I had a good look at it and the words 'Work Choices' were not mentioned once - not once! Writing the history of the Howard government, you do not mention Work Choices. Purporting to write about the last term of the Howard government, 2004 to 2007, you do not write 'Work Choices' in there. - I was asked about updates to analysis on Work Choices and I thought that the member for Higgins's book might be of use in that regard, but unfortunately it was not. The member for Higgins's book, though, does take the opportunity to chide the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, on tax policy. That is an interesting addition to the member for Higgins's book. To quote The Merchant of Venice, I suspect the member for Higgins knows that all that glistens is not gold and he has worked out that the member for Wentworth's claims to economic responsibility are as fraudulent as fool's gold itself. Can I also say that I do have good news for the House, on the question of new analysis, of the impact -  - Get back to the book! -  - I am doing everything I can to help the member for Higgins with those sales, because I do think it is demeaning that it is in the remainder bin so quickly after publication. I am happy to help push the book. I am in a position to advise the House that a new analysis of Work Choices will shortly be available. The member for Higgins promised us a sequel, and here it is, the sequel to the Costello memoirs, 'My Role in Work Choices', and this time the co-author is the HR Nicholls Society!</DOC>

 - The global financial crisis is affecting the stability of the global financial system and is affecting the real economy worldwide. Australia, as a result, is being affected as well - and that goes to the cost of finance on international markets, it goes to the prospective growth in our economy and it goes to employment as well. The challenge we all face at present is how to maintain the stability of the global financial system. National actions in this respect are important, but what is even more important is coordinated international action. The actions which the government announced yesterday are consistent with international proposals which have been advanced most recently in bodies around the world, including the G7, the IMF and the G20.The measures taken in Australia are designed to do two things. One is to ensure that we maintain confidence in Australia's banking institutions, confidence which has been underpinned since this crisis began by repeated reports from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. But when it comes to the concerns of deposit holders, which have been heightened by the events which they have seen unfold around the world, it is important to deal with those concerns as they are presented to us. On the question of the impact of the government's guarantee of term funding arrangements by Australian banks around the world, the reason for that measure is to ensure that our banks are not discriminated against as they face other banks in international credit markets which are the beneficiaries of sovereign guarantees. That is the basis for the Australian government's action on that measure yesterday.The honourable member asks the impact which the measure has in relation to the Australian taxpayer. First and foremost, our responsibility is to guarantee the stability of the financial system as that affects all taxpayers, all householders, over an extremely long period of time. But, secondly, in terms of ensuring that this is not simply an act which benefits the banks but one for which there is an appropriate return to the taxpayer, as I indicated yesterday in my remarks when announcing these measures, the Australian government will also be attaching an insurance premium to the measures extended to the commercial banks. The details of that insurance premium will be settled between the Treasury and the economic regulators and the institutions concerned. We believe that is a right and appropriate measure. But the challenge for the future, and the challenge for all of us in this place, is to act responsibly and to speak responsibly in order to maintain the continued stability of this financial system. This is not just something which affects the banks themselves. The stability of the banks in our local communities is of direct relevance to the interests of households, and that is why the government acted decisively yesterday.</DOC>

 - The question asked by the honourable member provides me with the opportunity to inform the House of developments overnight, particularly in relation to an emergency summit of leaders in the 15-member euro zone presided over by the President of France, President Sarkosy. This goes of course to integrated measures on the part of the Europeans in response to the global financial crisis. At that meeting European leaders agreed to guarantee, for an interim period and on appropriate commercial terms, new debt issued by banks. President Sarkosy said:Banks need to be loaned money. So that this confidence is restored, states will have the possibility to guarantee the loans that banks take out, guarantee them under different forms.That reflects President Sarkosy's position, reflecting in turn the combined position of the euro zone economies meeting in Paris overnight, Australian time. The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, said that these measures:_ will allow markets to start functioning again, that was our aim. It is a strong message to the markets.The House will be aware that the Australian government yesterday made a similar move. Our package includes a guarantee for term wholesale funding which formed the basis in part of my answer to the previous question, from the Leader of the Opposition. But the core rationale, apart from overall efforts to stabilise the global financial system, was this: to ensure that Australian banks were not going to be penalised in global credit markets as a consequence of the sovereign guarantees being provided by other governments, nationally, to their banks.A critical challenge that we were presented with is this. Around the world there were a number of banks whose balance sheets were actually in very bad shape. As a consequence, governments in those countries acted in order to improve their reputational standing in global credit markets, and they did that by extending sovereign guarantees to the loan raising which those banks were engaged in. The problem that presented our banks was as follows. Despite the fact that our major banks had no problems on their balance sheets, despite the fact that they were registering strong profits and despite the fact that our regulatory authorities properly and entirely appropriately underpinned their continued strong position, the fact that sovereign guarantees were extended by foreign governments to their banks, often in bad credit state, meant that prospectively we faced a problem where Australian banks would be discriminated against in the global financial market. The direct consequence of all that is the flow-through in the availability of commercial credit to the general credit activities of Australian banks within the domestic market, not just in the mortgage sector but crucially also in the business sector, in the commercial sector of the Australian economy. The attitude that I took as Prime Minister was that I was not prepared to stand idly by and allow that to happen because the roll-through consequences of those actions as they affected Australian banks long term would in turn affect households and in turn affect businesses. That is why we acted.The second set of measures we took yesterday related to the protection of depositors under the financial claims scheme. Our attitude as a government was that the time had come to guarantee all deposits, whatever their size, in the Australian banking institutions for a period of three years - that is, to guarantee deposits, whether they are in banks, whether they are in building societies, whether they are in credit unions, to ensure that individual Australian families, that pensioners, that carers, that small businesses should have absolute confidence in the robustness of these financial institutions. It was the right thing to do. It was the right thing to do also because we saw again around the world various governments, in far, far more difficult situations than we find ourselves in Australia, acting in this regard. And as a consequence again this was potentially going to have an impact on the way in which international credit markets looked at Australian financial institutions. Therefore, it was necessary not just to allay the concerns and anxieties of individual deposit holders but also to ensure, in terms of the reputational status of our banks worldwide, that that factor would be removed from any doubts on the part of global credit-lending institutions. So, again, as Prime Minister of the country the view that I took was that I was not prepared to stand idly by and allow the concerns of households, of working families, of pensioners and of carers about the banks to go unaddressed. That is why we acted.A third measure which the government announced yesterday goes to the availability of funding for non-authorised deposit-taking institutions. Further to the Treasurer's announcement in September, the government has decided to direct the Australian Office of Financial Management to purchase an additional $4 billion in residential mortgage backed securities. The government has been monitoring the market closely and has determined that an additional $4 billion in funding is required for the purchase of residential mortgage backed securities from non-ADI lenders, those being lenders who are not banks, building societies or credit unions. This will be done by the Australian Office of Financial Management. This will benefit Australia's mortgage market and ensure that this sector of the lending market has access to funding for their future operations.The reality is that the global financial crisis in recent days has entered into a new and dangerous phase, with real impacts for growth and real impacts for jobs both in Australia and abroad. Therefore, the government have taken the view that the surplus that we spent a lot of time and a lot of effort putting aside in the May budget, putting aside for tough times, is there to be used to deal with these tough times. The purpose of the surplus is to deal with the tough times ahead and my message to the nation today is that those tough times have arrived. Therefore, the government remain determined to deploy that surplus intelligently to deal with the long-term support of positive economic growth in Australia and to deal with the necessary supports for households.We are well positioned to weather this crisis. We have taken the necessary steps yesterday to assist in continuing to stabilise the Australian financial system and to ensure that that stability which we already have will be maintained into the future, given what is happening in the global marketplace. But beyond that, this global financial crisis and the entering into of this new and dangerous stage and its impact in the real economy around the world on growth and jobs will have an impact in Australia. We are glad on this side of the House that we took the measures necessary to set aside a surplus for the period ahead - a significant surplus, a surplus which is designed to deal with tough times. Those tough times have come and we are well prepared to act in anticipation of them.</DOC>

 - The Secretary of the Treasury has advised me that, based on his consultations with the financial regulators, this guarantee will be extended to Australian lending institutions as they seek to raise capital in international credit markets. Furthermore, he has indicated to me that the precise insurance premiums to be attached to each of them will be negotiated separately with those institutions and in doing so will be mindful of their general circumstances as far as their previous lending arrangements internationally. This is a prudent and proper approach to be taken. It is right that we take this action to stabilise the financial system for the future. These institutions have fine, first-class balance sheets as of today; they have fine, first-class balance sheets as indicated by the Australian prudential regulators; and, for the future, this measure has been necessary to ensure their future lines of credit from international credit markets. We believe this is an entirely appropriate course of action.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. Yesterday the Prime Minister announced that the government would guarantee upon application term wholesale funding by Australian banks. This step will ensure that our banking institutions have the best possible access to global capital markets. We are all aware that developments in global financial markets over the past year or so have increased the difficulty for financial institutions to raise funds in those markets. There is no suggestion that the measure that the government has taken is in any way reflecting circumstances in Australia; it is a reflection of increasing difficulties in international markets that our banks and financial institutions face. In particular, it is a reflection of the fact that a number of other key governments around the world have taken steps of a similar nature that change the relative attractiveness of major financial institutions internationally for lending and therefore if we were not to take an initiative of this kind with respect to Australian financial institutions, notwithstanding that they are very strong, well capitalised and well regulated, it would place them at a significant disadvantage relative to other financial institutions competing for the same funding in global markets. We have seen in recent times the significance of this through increases in the price of borrowings for our financial institutions internationally flowing through to increases in market interest rates and therefore were the government not to take an initiative of this kind there is a serious concern that we would see that occur even further.These measures are designed to ensure that Australian banks can continue to do their job. The banks will be charged a fee, negotiated specifically with them according to their circumstances, for access to this guarantee. The measures are critical to the Australian economy and to protecting Australia's economy from the worst implications of the global financial crisis.It is also important to note that there are significant institutions in our economy that engage in lending money, particularly for mortgages, who will not have access to these guarantees because they are not approved deposit-taking institutions. But they are significant players in the market. In particular, their activities are very important for sustaining competition in the mortgage market. In order to ensure that the playing field remains even and that competition remains strong, the government has also decided to make available up to $4 billion through the Australian Office of Financial Management to these institutions for borrowing for high-quality mortgage purposes for on-lending for high-quality mortgages.As the Prime Minister has indicated, the government is also determined to provide a general guarantee for all bank deposits - all deposits in approved deposit-taking institutions - for a period of three years on top of the proposed legislation that is in the process of being pursued by the government to guarantee all deposits up to $20,000. Again, this initiative was taken by the government in response to similar initiatives occurring internationally. The key point about all this is that we are not immune from the implications of the international financial crisis. We have moved into a new and dangerous phase of this crisis. It is already impacting on jobs and growth in Australia and we can expect it to impact further.Equally, the regulatory initiatives undertaken by governments overseas, by central banks overseas and by regulators overseas change the global environment in ways that Australia is affected by. We have already seen this with respect to the rules regarding short selling in the Australian stock market being changed in response to decisions being taken overseas, and similar logic applies in this case. Australia's banks and financial institutions generally are well capitalised. They are strong, they are responsibly run, they are well regulated and they will remain so. It is very important to ensure that they are not disadvantaged and that Australian householders, homebuyers, workers and people generally are not disadvantaged economically by them being in a second-tier position relative to other banks, including significant banks that are much less robust than they are, in international capital markets. That is why the government have announced these initiatives, and we believe they will be very important in ensuring that we minimise the inevitable impacts of this new and dangerous phase of the global credit crisis.</DOC>

 - The first point is that it is necessary to ensure the future stability of the financial system. In particular, it is necessary to ensure that our banks remain capable into the future of raising commercial loans on the international credit market. That is the first responsibility. As I indicated in my answer to an earlier question, it has been important for us to take that action now, in particular when there was a danger of our institutions being seen in a different light to those of other institutions because of sovereign guarantees provided elsewhere. Secondly, as I have indicated in my answer to the honourable gentleman's question, each of these institutions will be charged a fee. The fee will ensure that taxpayers receive appropriate compensation for providing the guarantee and that financial institutions pay a price for the benefit of the guarantee. Furthermore, the fee will also ensure that the facility is no longer utilised when market conditions normalise, as was reflected in my statement yesterday. This will help to support the future recovery and the operation of financial markets independent of government support. In other words, the construction of the fee will be done in a manner which encourages not just responsible behaviour of financial institutions in the international credit market but also the non-use of that instrument in the future once credit conditions normalise. The precise detail of the fee and its arrangements will be tailored accordingly.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question and for the great work he does with both the Tea Tree Gully Business Enterprise Centre and the other business enterprise centre in his local area, the Salisbury Business and Export Centre. It is stating the obvious, I guess, to say that the world is in the grip of a serious financial crisis, and it is usually small businesses that are among the first to be affected by a credit squeeze. I had discussions with members of the financial community late last week and the situation as of that time was as follows. They told me that finance is still generally available to small businesses that have credit facilities with major banks. In that respect, at least, it is business as usual for many small businesses.In respect of finance for expansions such as office upgrades, a few months ago that sort of finance was readily available; it is now more difficult to obtain, though I am advised that, if a very good case is made, the finance is still available. This was the situation before the Prime Minister announced sweeping measures to guarantee bank deposits and to inject more capital into the system. It is therefore to be expected that these initiatives will improve the availability of finance to small businesses. While no-one can predict the course of the financial crisis over the coming days and weeks, the government will continue to monitor the situation and keep in touch with both major financiers and small business organisations. We are very proud of the hard work and enterprise of Australia's 1.9 million small business owners. I urge the major banks to join with Westpac and pass on the maximum possible amount of the recent one percentage point reduction in the Reserve Bank's cash rate, and I urge the major banks to maintain the flow of finance to small businesses, who, after all, are responsible for providing jobs for almost four million working Australians.</DOC>

 - First of all, the only institutions which would be eligible for this guarantee in the first place are APRA regulated institutions - first and foremost. - The honourable gentleman says he knows that. It is not necessarily reflected in his previous questions. Further, when APRA assess the eligibility for each institution for their individual access of this facility, APRA will further assess their circumstances, as you would expect. On top of that, APRA's wide-ranging powers now, as the honourable member would know, enable APRA to go into the books of any institution at any time to make any assessment about their overall credit worthiness. That is the context within which the specific measures that I referred to before occur. Those specific measures go to the actual construction of the insurance fee or the fee imposed on the institution using this facility for the future. That, in turn, is designed specifically to encourage institutions, once global credit circumstances return to normal, to then return to the normal credit market. Therefore, the framework is this: APRA with enormous powers; APRA regulated institutions only being those capable of using this facility; APRA going through each institution upon application for use of this facility; and then the individual construction of the fee itself applied to each institution being designed and tailored in a way to encourage institutions to return to the normal credit market when the credit market normalises.I conclude by saying this: this government remains determined to take whatever action is necessary to maintain the stability of the Australian financial system. We do not baulk at any measure. We have indicated our determination to take decisive action when it is necessary. We did that yesterday and we have done so ahead of the international curve.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. As the Prime Minister has made clear, the global financial crisis is affecting growth and jobs right across the world, and that means it will affect growth and jobs in this country as well. A recession in the United States and a possible recession in Europe will impact on economic growth in this country, and unemployment in Australia will rise. It is a global crisis, but it has local consequences.Whilst the International Monetary Fund expects that Australia's economic prospects will be more resilient than those of other developed countries, both the government and the Reserve Bank expect the growth rate in employment to slow down in the period ahead. The most recent employment figures continued to show low unemployment, with a rate of 4.3 per cent and with 14,000 fewer people unemployed today than in November 2007. But, while this result is good, the government has always been upfront with the Australian people that a combination of slowing global growth and the effects of 10 consecutive interest rate rises under the Liberal government meant that we were likely to see a slowing in employment growth and a rise in the unemployment rate. The figures presented in the May budget indicated that unemployment was predicted to rise to 4Â¾ per cent by the June quarter 2009. The government does expect a moderate rise in that forecast, and the exact forecast will be finalised and published in MYEFO later this year.This makes it really important - vitally important - that the government take a proactive role in these difficult times, and we are well placed to do this. The reason that we brought down a budget with a $22 billion surplus earlier this year was to give us a financial buffer to act for the future. The government is taking specific actions that matter. Our reformed employment services system is designed to better help the unemployed to find work, and last month we announced an additional 15,000 productivity places for reskilling the unemployed. These places come on top of the investment of 50,000 places already made this calendar year as part of an investment of $1.9 billion, and that takes the Rudd Labor government's total commitment to 645,000 places over five years.Importantly, too, the government has acted on fairness at work. One of the first acts - indeed, the first bill introduced into this new parliament when it met at the start of this year - was to take Australia through to the government's Forward with Fairness policies. Specifically, that first act guaranteed that in workplaces around the country there is a safety net at work on which workers can rely - a safety net which cannot be stripped away. In good times and in bad times, Work Choices is bad policy. The sole or central aim of Work Choices was to enable the safety net to be stripped away. The government has already corrected this. Now no Australian worker needs to fear having the safety net stripped away. Work Choices is bad policy. It was bad policy in 2007. It would be particularly bad policy now if it were in operation allowing safety nets to be ripped away. The Rudd government is committed to fairness and to managing the economy in the interests of working Australians and their families.</DOC>

 - The state of the balance sheets of all Australia's major banks is available to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. That is already the law. I am surprised, therefore, as to why the honourable member asks this question. Secondly, I already said in response to the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition before that those institutions which are able to access this facility that the government decided upon and announced yesterday are all APRA prudentially regulated institutions. Furthermore, when applications are received from those institutions to use this facility, then they of course will be separately assessed by the regulators as well.Can I say this to the opposition at this point, when there has been much talk about bipartisanship: this measure has been recommended to the government by the Australian regulators - the Reserve Bank, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Treasury. I would suggest that, if those opposite were serious about bipartisanship at a time of global financial crisis, getting behind the regulators would be a good thing to do.</DOC>

 - The government is indeed committed to rebuilding our nation's infrastructure as part of securing our long-term economic prosperity. A strong economy is indeed vital to weathering global economic conditions, and the global financial crisis has made action even more urgent. Our approach has been endorsed by key business organisations and economic institutions both within Australia and overseas. The latest to support the Rudd government's nation-building agenda is the OECD. Released last Friday, its Economic survey of Australia 2008 stated:The programmed increase in physical and human capital is needed to overcome bottlenecks.It went on to state:The recent creation of funds that will channel budget surpluses into financing investment in infrastructure, education and health could play a valuable role in improving the quality of spending, especially since the intention is to select projects on the basis of cost/benefit analysis.These comments by the OECD follow on from the comments of the IMF just last month, when they said:Saving some of the revenue from the commodity price boom in three new funds will take pressure off monetary policy in the near term and enable increased infrastructure investment over the medium term.The OECD, of course, made particular mention of the rigorous cost-benefit analysis that will be undertaken by Infrastructure Australia.Individual Australian business leaders have also expressed support for the government's approach. Don Argus, the Chairman of BHP Billiton, has expressed his concern that Australia is more vulnerable because of failure on infrastructure over recent years. Indeed, he said that Australia's infrastructure capital stock to GDP ratio has fallen by over 10 per cent over the past 12 years. That is the view of Don Argus, Chairman of BHP Billiton, when talking about the importance of infrastructure being able to fulfil the economic capacity of the nation. Infrastructure Australia, in establishing an independent advisory council, will have a critical role in this.The call for action on infrastructure does not just come from the international community; it does not just come from Australian business leaders. It also comes from Colin Barnett, the Premier of Western Australia, who has said that we do need to accelerate some of the big infrastructure projects. It appears that just about everybody accepts the importance of nation building, particularly at this time of global financial crisis - everybody except for those opposite, and I call upon them to support the Building Australia Fund, to support the government's nation-building agenda and to get on board, because we do need to address the 12 years of neglect that Don Argus and other business leaders have correctly identified.</DOC>

 - On the question of tax cuts, as the honourable member would know, the government delivered in full on tax cuts not just for the coming financial year as of 1 July but for subsequent financial years as well - in fact, a $45 billion package of tax cuts. The problem with the opposition's position on this is that they assume that there is something inherently wrong with nation building. -  - That is the actual inference of the opposition Treasury spokesman's question; otherwise, why would she ask it and why would those in the Senate be seeking to block the passage of the relevant legislation? It is because, in their heart of hearts, they actually do not believe in nation building. If that is not the case, why is that legislation being blocked in the Senate? I do not understand. If it is not the case then why was the attempt just made by the opposition Treasury spokesman to cast doubt on a nation-building agenda? - I would suggest on the intervention from the honourable member who sits on the opposition front bench in defence of alcopops that, in a time of serious global financial crisis, unblocking the budget surplus in the Senate is of critical importance. I would suggest to those opposite that the responsible course of action is to ensure that the government has access to surplus funds to deploy for this country and to underpin our long-term economic growth. That is the responsible course of action. What we have on the part of those opposite is a very serious policy posture - namely, how to continue to provide a tax cut for a bunch of booze companies. I would suggest that that actually represents an alternative approach. Can I say to those opposite that the challenge is this: in these times of global economic crisis you are either responsible in putting aside a surplus in the first place and responsible in deploying that in support of long-term economic growth, or you take a short-term populist approach. Our attitude is clear cut. We will take whatever decisive action is necessary for the future of this economy. We will ensure that we will boost economic growth by supporting the national economy by necessary measures and by supporting the household economy as well. That is the right balance for the future, the national economy, the national infrastructure and the household economy as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for this question. It is particularly timely given the previous question about the sorts of tax relief that might be able to be provided in these difficult circumstances. The Rudd government's plans to provide immediate tax relief to 330,000 Australians is being blocked by the Liberal Party opposition at a time when the Treasury spokesperson sitting opposite says that we should consider providing tax relief to Australians. It is her party that is blocking that relief being provided to 330,000 Australians immediately if the Liberal Party were to change their position. Our government's decision to increase the thresholds is the first time that these thresholds have been revisited since they were established in that vastly technical way - over a bottle of whiskey with the former minister for health.Since the government announced these changes, I am sure that many people, both on the other side of the House as well as on our side of the House, have been receiving correspondence from residents. It may be that as health minister I am receiving more of those than most. I thought that this would be a good opportunity to take the House through some of the examples of what working Australians are saying about the Liberal opposition blocking this measure.Let me take, for example, David from Western Australia, who wrote the following on behalf of his son: 'My son's situation is a clear example of why it is grossly unfair to impose the levy on those earning just $50,000. With penalty rates, he earns $52,000 per year, or $750 per week after tax. He has an average mortgage on a three-bedroom home and pays $550 a week. His unavoidable expenses for utilities and car registration are $100 per week, leaving him with $100 per week for food, entertainment, clothing and fuel. If the government is refused the opportunity to amend the threshold, he will also be forced to pay health insurance out of what is left of his $100 a week.' This is an example of a working person who is being let down by the Leader of the Opposition at a time when they can scarcely afford it.I will read another example, this one from Mark in the ACT. He clearly articulates why the government has taken this step. He says: 'I, like many thousands of Australian taxpayers, was forced by the Howard government into a lose-lose situation. The losers are the taxpayers; the only winners are the private health funds.'This morning there was a glimmer of light - a small sign that maybe the Leader of the Opposition was thinking of changing his mind on this matter. This morning, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'At a time when you want to stimulate the economy, raising taxes is not a very good idea.' Here he has an opportunity to lower taxes. Here is a chance for him to put an end to this bracket creep, which every year has been catching more and more Australians unfairly in its clutches. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to do more than simply say that he believes in lowering taxes and instruct his party to vote for this measure to provide this relief to 330,000 Australians across the country. This is a real test of whether the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to provide tax relief. He can do it today in this House; he can do it tomorrow in the Senate. We put out the challenge: do you want to lower those taxes? Here is the opportunity.</DOC>

 - One of the remarkable things about the opposition's position on pensions is the fact that they leave so many millions of pensioners out. I say to those opposite that if they were serious in the policy debate on this they would have had a consistent and comprehensive position all along. Secondly, if those opposite were serious about pension reform - and the member who has just asked the question was in cabinet for a long time - when did they argue to reform the pension and why didn't the Howard government act to reform the pension for 12 years?My third point is that we are committed to a policy of long-term pension reform. As I said in my answer to the question put to me before, the government believes that the right course of action is to act decisively to continue to support economic growth in the Australian economy in the future. We will do that. This government, despite considerable criticism from various people in the commentariat and from those opposite, put to one side a significant surplus for the budget in May. The reason that we put aside a surplus was to have that surplus to deal with tough times in the future. Those tough times have arrived. We are in a position to deploy the surplus. We will deploy the surplus in the interests of underpinning long-term positive growth in the Australian economy and in the interests of supporting the household economy as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I know the importance that she places on improving Australia's trade performance. The fact is that the global crisis is undermining confidence. One indication of that is that spot prices for most commodities have taken a dramatic drop. This underscores the reason why when coming to office we said that we were going to set about developing a new trade policy that positioned Australia beyond the resources boom. This trade policy recognises the importance of diversification both in content as well as the direction of our trade focus. The other point that I would make is that improving trade performance is another arrow in the quiver of building confidence. The reason for that -  -  - The opposition never understand when in government the importance of increasing trade performance. They presided over 72 trade deficits in a row and they did that in the middle of a resources boom. Just imagine what it would be like if they were still in charge today. They never had the wit or wisdom to understand the importance of this diversification. Why does trade matter? It matters because world trade grows three times faster than world output. If economies are to secure their economic future, they have to engage in trade. They also have to pursue policies that not only liberalise trade and open markets but do the structural reforms to the economy to make sure that they are competitive enough and productive enough to achieve that outcome.Recently, we concluded a free trade agreement with the ASEAN group of nations. I have spoken in the House about this before. In the break I had the opportunity to visit both Malaysia and the Philippines. Today, in discussions with the Prime Minister of Vietnam I had the opportunity to engage three of those countries in the new framework that this ASEAN free trade agreement gives us to better diversify and to strengthen our trade between those countries. This is not just off the back of the platform that is the multilateral negotiations but by sensibly driving the bilateral relations to continue to strengthen our position.We have a great opportunity in the ASEAN region and in Asia as a whole. People have talked before about the IMF report, which does show that world growth is slowing, but growth in Asia is still solid and this is where we do have to engage. We have to engage on a broader front than was hitherto the case. We have to diversify into the services economy because it represents 80 per cent of our GDP but only 23 per cent of our export market. Why is it that the previous government was never able to perform better on the services front in all of its 12 years? The fact is that it had a narrow view as to what trade policy involved. It focused primarily around agriculture, not elaborately transformed manufactures or services. It has been to the detriment of this country and it has taken a Labor government to come back into office to get the balance right. I assure the House that we will do everything possible to ensure that we do get that balance back.</DOC>

 - We seem to get a policy a day from the opposition at the moment. I listened carefully to what the member for North Sydney said about what happened with the then government's use of revenue streams from the resources boom starting back in 2001. I listened very carefully. Here we are in the year 2008 and we have infrastructure bottlenecks off coal ports in New South Wales and Queensland, we have a national road system which is clogged in our major cities and we have no action on urban congestion in terms of establishing a comprehensive urban rail network. We had virtually no action in laying out a national high-speed broadband network. You begin to ask yourself this question: what happened to the $390 billion beyond the parameters which Saul Eslake and others spoke about so much last year? He posed the simple question: name a single infrastructure item, a single item of productive investment in the future, to which you could attribute that beyond parameter growth in government revenues which the previous government benefited from through the resources boom. His answer was: none. What I would say to the opposition is: we stand proudly by our nation-building agenda. We intend to build the nation's infrastructure; we intend to deploy the capital of the nation in building future economic growth. We will build the nation's roads, build the nation's ports, build the nation's railways and build the nation's high-speed broadband because it is in the long-term interests of this economy that we do so and it supports economic growth on the way through.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon who, with the member for Lingiari and me, was fortunate to be able to attend the Inpex announcement in Darwin last month. This announcement in this current financial environment is very important for Australia. The announcement of Inpex last month in association with the French company Total potentially represents a proposed investment in Australia of $24 billion. Such an announcement from the Ichthys field in Western Australia represents the first potential development of the Browse field, which over time presents Australia with wonderful LNG export opportunities which are very important from a trade perspective.Inpex's announcement confirms that Australia remains a very attractive place for investment. That is important in the tough global economic environment that we confront as a nation today. We are still a very strong and attractive place for investments. When you think about that you understand why it is so important to Northern Australia. It potentially represents 2,000 jobs in construction and an extra 300 long-term jobs in production, which historically are high-paid, high-skilled jobs. It also presents for the Northern Territory significant business opportunities for small and medium sized businesses to actually grow and develop expertise in the LNG industry in the north of Australia for the future. For Darwin it also represents a very strong statement that Darwin has come of age as a major industrial province in Australia.From the Australian government's point of view, we are not content with the Inpex announcement alone. We are not accepting of the fact that in the last 30 years there have been developed only two major LNG export provinces in Australia - the North West Shelf and, to a lesser extent, the Northern Territory. We are a gas-rich nation. We have to continue to work with the state and territory governments and the private sector to actually secure investment in projects such as Gorgon, Sunrise, the Kimberley and Gladstone.I am also pleased to report to the House in that context that the Timor-Leste government has appointed a Sunrise commissioner and the first meeting of the Sunrise commission will occur in Perth towards the end of this month. Hopefully, this will be another step forward in the development in partnership with the Timor-Leste government of further LNG export opportunities to the advantage of both countries.But you should also appreciate that the LNG industry is important in terms of climate change and the issue of the environment. For every tonne of CO2 emitted in Australia during production, LNG saves four tonnes of CO2 when consumed in Japan and nine tonnes when consumed in China. In a carbon constrained world, Australian LNG is therefore very important to maintain continued sustainable growth in Asia - in places such as China, Japan and India - which is exceptionally important to Australia's future economic prosperity. It is therefore our responsibility to continue to work in this tough global environment to secure investments such as this, because these investments are fundamental to our economic and social future. They create a foundation for jobs, investment, exports, infrastructure and economic growth.The investment also potentially represents over time a big boost to export revenues for Australia. By way of information to the House, forecast production volumes from the Inpex project - eight million to nine million tonnes of LNG per year - are about equal to 50 per cent of current LNG annual production and 60 per cent of Australia's current condensate or light crude oil. - Unlike the member for O'Connor, this side of the House is delighted with the Inpex investment. It is in Australia's best interests and it is a very strong statement that we are an attractive place for investment. It is a significant project for Australia and a significant project for Northern Australia. It is our responsibility to make the most of these investment opportunities.I was also pleased to see only in the last fortnight the first shipment of LNG from Western Australia out of train 5 on the North West Shelf. At the end of this week, to build on these initiatives, I will be travelling to Perth to meet with the Western Australian Premier to indicate in very clear terms that, from the Australian government's point of view, we will be doing everything possible with every state and territory government to secure similar investments because, unlike the member for O'Connor, we understand what is in Australia's best national interests.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Canberra for her question. I know that she has a lot of first home buyers in her electorate and I know that her concern goes not just to the mums and dads and families in her electorate but particularly to some of her constituents with disabilities. We went out to Abbeyfield in her electorate and visited a wonderful facility there with the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services as well.The Australian government is very concerned about the effects of the global financial crisis and we know that many Australians are watching housing markets in the US and elsewhere. Of course, we are not immune to world economic forces, but there are a number of significant differences between Australian housing markets and those overseas, and they include the comparatively strong financial sector here in Australia and the action that the government has taken to make sure that it remains that way. We also have non-conforming loans running at about one per cent in Australia, compared with about 15 per cent in the United States.A critical difference as well is that we have a shortage of housing rather than an oversupply, as you see in the United States. In fact, Treasury estimates that we have a shortage of about 30,000 homes a year fewer than we should be building to keep up with underlying demand, and many would say that that is a conservative estimate. Indeed, that is one of the reasons that we set up our National Housing Supply Council, a council of eight leading experts in the housing industry to pull together the best evidence to tell us more about the mismatch between supply and demand for housing here in Australia. Just last week I met with the council again to discuss their progress and their views about the pressure points in the housing market here in Australia. We spoke about the affordability problem that continues to be faced by first home buyers, about pressures in the rental market, about the need to improve the efficiency of the housing market and about the implications of the global circumstances on housing supply.Of course, all of our programs are squarely targeted at meeting these challenges, and housing affordability for first home buyers, for example, is being tackled by our first home saver accounts. We have already delivered on these accounts, a $1.2 billion commitment from the last election, and the response has been first-rate. Indeed, a piece written by Laura Anderson in the Adelaide Advertiser quotes the ANZ as saying:There has been significant interest, beyond our expectations _A spokesperson from Members Equity is quoted as saying:A lot of people are ringing up, particularly parents who realise it is a good mechanism to develop secure savings for their children.The Commonwealth Bank is quoted as saying the response has been 'extremely encouraging'. Collecting substantial funds in these new accounts is particularly important at a time when having access to savings is very important in the economy. At the same time, the government has injected substantial funds into the non-bank-lender mortgage market, a move that has been welcomed by economists, by mortgage providers and, of course, by the opposition. We have also had a very substantial amount injected into new measures to stimulate building both in the rental area and for homeownership through our first home saver accounts; our National Rental Affordability Scheme, which will see the building of up to 50,000 new rental properties in coming years; and our Housing Affordability Fund, which will bring down the cost of new homes to purchase. Of course, there are no silver bullets when it comes to housing supply in Australia, but a sensible approach over the long term will certainly help us to meet the challenges ahead.</DOC>

 - The industrial disputation around the country in large part occurs in the context of a range of disputes between companies and unions or those representing individual workers in workplaces. The details of each dispute are going to be localised to the circumstances in those businesses. The key thing for the future is to make sure that we get the balance in Australian workplace relations right. That is a balance between fairness and flexibility. -  - I notice that those opposite are beginning to jeer. Can I say this to those opposite: when you have softening employment and increasing unemployment around the world and therefore have softening employment and increasing unemployment prospectively in Australia, working families dealing with the reality of the workplace would not want the protections available to them under Work Choices, because Work Choices stripped away basic protections in the workplace. Those opposite received such a caning at the last election because working families believed, rightly, that the balance had been got wrong. What we know from the interjections of those opposite is that they remain the party of Work Choices. In their heart of hearts and their mind of minds, they still believe in Work Choices, despite political protestations to the contrary. Therefore, in the future, if they were to return to the treasury bench, Work Choices would be back.I say this to those opposite: if working families concerned about employment in the future were given the opportunity of dealing with Work Choices on the one hand or a fair and balanced industrial relations system on the other, they would vote for a fair and balanced industrial relations system. They did at the last election. We are delivering on that for the future. It is the right thing for working families, who are facing real challenges ahead, and we need to make sure that they have every protection possible.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. When the new opposition leader first took office, he extended the hand of bipartisanship to the government and almost in the same breath recommitted the opposition to continuing to tear down the government's budget in the Senate. In more recent times, notwithstanding the supposed commitment to bipartisanship on the part of the opposition in the very difficult international financial circumstances that Australia finds itself in, we have seen the opposition spreading fear - for example, about the state of Medibank Private and private health insurers - seriously misrepresenting comments by the Prime Minister, as the shadow Treasurer did only a few days ago, attacking the Reserve Bank and claiming credit for decisions on interest rates by Australia's major banks. Malcolm still thinks he is in charge, apparently.It is notable that, notwithstanding the renewal of the rhetoric about bipartisanship by the opposition yesterday, actions have not changed. The position that the government faces in these very difficult circumstances regarding its budget in the Senate is that the opposition thus far remains committed to continuing to punch holes in the government's surplus, the nation's insurance policy, in the Senate. In fact, I note that today it has been reported that Senator Steve Fielding has stated that he will support the government's remaining tax budget bills. Notwithstanding that he does have reservations about some aspects of them and has indicated those reservations previously, he will support those budget bills regarding the taxation of so-called alcopops and the Medicare levy surcharge because of the international financial crisis.I commend Senator Fielding for taking this position and I would also indicate that it is the government's view that the other non-government and non-opposition senators, the Greens and Senator Xenophon, have also taken broadly a responsible position with respect to the government's budget bills. It is a pity that the so-called alternative government, while extending a purported hand of bipartisanship to the government, on one of the most critical aspects of the nation's economic policy settings is still seeking to tear down the budget surplus, the nation's insurance policy, the nation's buffer against the implications of the global financial crisis, in the Senate. I would urge the opposition to have a think about precisely where it is now positioned. At this stage, the opposition is being given a lesson in economic responsibility by the Greens, by Senator Fielding and by Senator Xenophon. I would urge the opposition to think very carefully about its actions in the Senate. We now have a very difficult situation to deal with in this country where the state of the budget surplus and the government's budget bills in the Senate are of crucial significance. So, if you want to be bipartisan, how about you start acting like it.</DOC>

 - The government in 12 months has delivered on what the previous government failed to deliver in 12 years. They had 12 long years to act on pension reform and did nothing. What this government did at the time it announced the last budget was commission the Harmer review and that review will report next February. Furthermore, the government has announced other measures today, of which the honourable member will be aware. My position and that of the Treasurer and the government is that we will prosecute long-term pension reform by the time of the next budget, as we have already indicated.</DOC>

 - The global financial crisis, as I have said before, is the economic equivalent of a rolling national security crisis. Its impact is being felt across the global economy in credit markets, stock markets and the real economy in growth and jobs, and we in this country are not immune to it. Events overnight underscore the importance of decisive action in responding to these events. The governments of France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Austria formally committed overnight to guarantee interbank loans. Furthermore, they undertook to take equity stakes in banks. The government of the United Kingdom acted to take a majority stake in HBOS and in the Royal Bank of Scotland. These are extraordinary moves in meeting extraordinary challenges in these extraordinary times.This global financial crisis has now entered a new and dangerous phase for us all. The IMF - the International Monetary Fund - has already indicated that if the major economies in the world are not already in recession they are on the cusp of recession. The IMF is now forecasting the slowest growth in the advanced economies for over a quarter of a century.The government has resolved to take necessary early and decisive action to secure Australia's long-term economic future. Today, on behalf of the government, I have announced a $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy to strengthen the Australian economy during the global financial crisis. The government has resolved not to sit idly by while Australian households suffer the worst effects of the global crisis, a crisis which our households did not create. The government will not stand idly by while we need to take decisive action to support the long- and medium-term growth of the Australian economy and to support the household economy on the way through. It was for these reasons that I announced today this $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy.The first part of it goes to pensions. To boost household consumption and to assist older Australians and carers the government will provide $4.8 billion to fund a one-off payment of $1,400 to single pensioners and $2,100 to couples. This payment will also be made to Commonwealth seniors card holders. This measure will benefit around four million pensioners, seniors and carers. We will also provide a one-off payment of $1,000 to carer allowance recipients. This will be a down payment on the long-term pension reform that the government is currently working on through the Harmer review. This amount over a nine-month period, that is, from now until 30 June next year, represents the equivalent of some $35 per week for single pensioners and some $24 per week for members of a married couple. As I said before, this $4.9 billion package goes to all pensioners, not some pensioners.The second part of the government's Economic Security Strategy is as follows. I announce today that those families currently in receipt of family tax benefit A will receive a further payment of $1,000 per child. This payment will also be made to each dependent child who attracts youth allowance, Abstudy or Veterans' Children Education Scheme entitlements. This measure will benefit around 3.9 million Australian kids. These payments will be delivered by December at a cost of around $3.9 billion. This $3.9 billion commitment will benefit some two million Australian families and, like the pensions measure I referred to before, will be delivered in December.The third part of the government's Economic Security Strategy for the future goes to housing. The construction sector and private dwellings investment are important generators of economic activity in this country. They are also important for the wellbeing and the living standards of Australians. To strengthen this important sector of the economy, the government has resolved to introduce a new first home owners boost. This measure will cost around $1.5 billion in 2008-09 and around $350 million in the following financial year. This measure will benefit around 150,000 first home buyers.The fourth measure I have announced today is a $190 million program over two years to provide enhanced training support for the workforce. This will be delivered through an additional 56,000 places for the 2008-09 Productivity Places Program. Finally, the government will also accelerate our historic nation-building program. We will bring forward the consideration and implementation of projects under our various future investment funds. I have asked ministers to bring forward interim lists of proposals, as we have done already with Infrastructure Australia, for funding through the Building Australia Fund. This will allow implementation following appropriate and rigorous evaluation with initial work on projects commencing in the year 2009.The government has built a strong surplus over the last year. That surplus was a prudent and appropriate measure to build up as a precaution against tough times ahead. Those tough times have now arrived, and the government is now deploying the surplus for the benefit of the nation and for the benefit of the Australian people. The total cost of the Economic Security Strategy is $10.4 billion. This, we believe, is large enough to make a significant contribution to strengthen the Australian economy into the future. The reason we have been able to move quickly and so decisively lies in the strength of the budget the Treasurer delivered in May this year. We believe this is the right course of action. It is an early course of action. It is a decisive course of action. It is a responsible course of action to underpin positive growth for the Australian economy in these difficult times brought about by the global financial crisis and to support the interests of households as well.</DOC>

 - Firstly, on the question of growth, the honourable member will be familiar with the forecast which has been put into the budget and released by the Reserve Bank. Obviously, following recent developments in the international economy, we will see a further slowing in growth and a further acceleration of unemployment across the major economies in the world, including Australia. That is why we have taken these measures. We believe it is the right and responsible course of action. Secondly, in response to the honourable member's question, the Reserve Bank itself determines the future directions of monetary policy. We on this side of the House supported in an unqualified manner the decision taken by the Reserve Bank to reduce rates by 100 basis points in recent days following 10 interest rate rises in a row under the term of the previous government. Future interest rate settings lie with the Reserve Bank. Our responsibility is to make sure that monetary policy and fiscal policy are headed in the right direction and in the same direction. Given the extraordinary events in the international economy coming off the back of a global financial crisis, these are the right policy settings for Australia now, for the economy and for households.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. This weekend, I met with international colleagues at the IMF and at the World Bank annual meetings. I also attended an emergency meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors, which was also attended by the United States President, George Bush. Discussions at these meetings underscored, I believe, that the global financial crisis has entered a new and dangerous phase that has fundamentally changed the circumstances the globe is in and, therefore, the circumstances Australia is in. It is pretty clear that the financial crisis is spreading from the United States, throughout Europe and now, in some ways more remarkably and unexpectedly, into emerging economies in our region.The IMF's World economic outlook released this week said that there would be little or no growth in 2009 for the world's major developed economies: the US, Europe and Japan. It concluded that we will see slower growth in emerging economies as well. That is really before you get to the quite remarkable events that have occurred in the last four or five days. The view of leaders at all of those meetings was that we are in the midst of a major crisis in the modern market economy - one that requires co-ordinated action, one that requires discipline and one that requires leaders around the world to unite in a way in which they have never united before. It is pretty fair to say that, when we had the Asian financial crisis, which prompted the formation of the G20, the sort of international action that was required after that did not occur to the extent that it should have occurred. Of course, what we now find is that there does need to be major, long-term reform of the world's financial system, and Australia believes that G20 finance ministers are well placed to lead that reform.The other thing that came out of the meetings was the very strong view that, given the nature of events of recent times, most importantly governments move as quickly and as effectively as they possibly can. The need for action was seen to be urgent, and the sooner governments move to protect their people the better. I am pleased to say that in the time between when I left the United States and today there has already been further coordinated action around the world. That is badly needed and it reflects the goodwill that came out of those meetings and that is required if we are going to stabilise the global economy.Of course, the government has made the point on many occasions that, if you are going to be in any country in these circumstances, the country you would want to be in is Australia. But we are not immune, and we do have to take action. We welcomed the decisive action of the Reserve Bank when it comes to monetary policy only a week ago. But all nations in the room were also of the view that there needs to be substantial action in many countries, depending on circumstances, on fiscal policy. Because in the May budget we built a strong surplus, and we built it because we knew that there was the possibility of further global instability, we are in a position to ease fiscal policy. It is a surplus, of course, those opposite argued we did not need. They argued that we did not need it in the lead-up to the May budget and now they are still attacking it in the Senate.We are determined to do everything that is responsible in these circumstances, given the nature of the global shock that we are about to experience, to strengthen our economy. That is the thinking and the analysis behind the package that the Prime Minister launched today. It is also the thinking behind the announcements the Prime Minister has made in relation to our deposit-taking institutions and it has been the thinking behind so many of the actions that this government has been taking to strengthen our financial system since we first met with the Council of Financial Regulators in February this year.Everybody will recall that this was a very significant issue throughout January, February and March. Fortunately, it stabilised for a time following the rescue of Bear Stearns. Of course, over the last three weeks it has taken that dangerous new path that is so threatening to global growth and therefore to our economy, to businesses and to households. That is why we have announced the package that we announced today, this $10.4 billion strategy. We expect the strategy and this package will leave us comfortably in surplus - and that is a good thing. Surpluses are there for tough times, and tough times have arrived. -  - It is that sort of juvenile point-scoring that the country does not need. -  - The Leader of the Opposition says he supports the package. If he supports the package, that is terrific. That is very good if he supports the package. But you cannot support it on one hand and then oppose it on the other. You simply cannot do that. So it certainly would assist if those opposite were to rapidly pass the remaining budget measures in the Senate. That would certainly assist. It would certainly be an act of unity to pass the remaining budget measures in the Senate required to build the surplus as a buffer in these times of international uncertainty. That is why the meetings in Washington were so important. -  - When it comes to a global solution, we are all in it together. The government is going to work hard internationally to get reform in the longer term and to work with other governments to make sure that in the shorter term we get the response in terms of monetary policy, fiscal policy and other measures required to stabilise our financial system.</DOC>

 - The government is committed to responsible economic management. If the previous government was committed to responsible economic management, it would have done something to invest the $390 billion which it had in extra parameter growth in budget revenues coming off the back of the resources boom in this nation's long-term infrastructure needs. That would have been setting Australia up for the future.What would have been setting Australia up for the future as well is as follows: it would have been investing in the productivity needs of the Australian economy for the future; it would have been dealing with the nation's health and hospital infrastructure for the future; it would have been investing in all the productive capacity and social needs we need for the future; it would have meant using the $390 billion which was realised on the back of the resources boom responsibly and effectively for the future.Can I say this to the Leader of the Opposition: not everything on planet Earth is the product of his personal wisdom and initiative. I have to say to the Leader of the Opposition that there are measures taken now, responsibly, by this government dealing with the realities of the global financial crisis which are the right course of action for Australia now. If he wishes to deliver the House a message about responsibility, could he walk a few metres that way to the other house, where $4.3 billion worth of revenue - constituent parts of the government's budget surplus - lies blocked in the Senate, where the Greens are acting responsibly, where Senator Xenophon is acting responsibly, where Senator Fielding is acting responsibly and where the Liberal Party of Australia is acting less responsibly than the government of Cuba.</DOC>

 - As the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have outlined, the international financial crisis is moving into a new and more dangerous phase. We are all aware of these circumstances: credit markets being gummed up, share markets falling and major economies either heading towards recession or predicted to be in recession shortly. Australia is much better positioned than almost any other major economy in the world to deal with these circumstances, but we are decidedly not immune. The government has been dealing with the consequences of these problems since the latter part of last year and has taken a number of measures over the course of that time, including building a very strong budget surplus - and I will deal with that question in a minute. The government has also taken action to make available $4 billion through the Australian Office of Financial Management to sustain non-bank mortgage lending, has initiated deposits protection and has, of course, increased the government bond market liquidity.The circumstances have now changed and even more decisive action has been required. That is why over the past couple of days the government has acted to put in place guarantees of domestic banks' deposits and also wholesale fundraising. The government has, in addition to that, today announced a $10 billion one-off economic stimulus, an economic strategy to ensure that growth and employment are sustained in the face of very, very strong downward pressures coming from these international circumstances. Those of us who have lived through the previous economic downturn know how quickly an economic downturn can spread and how important it is to take decisive action early to ensure that growth, economic activity and employment continue to survive and prosper.Even as our economy is slowing, we have the pressures internationally mounting. Although we do have forces pushing back against those pressures - particularly substantial interest rate cuts and the decline in the value of the Australian dollar, both of which have a significant stimulatory effect - and, of course, the so-called automatic stabilisers in the fiscal position will take some effect and therefore push back and stimulate the economy to some degree, the government has reached the conclusion, based on the advice from its advisers in Treasury and other advisers, that that is not going to be enough to sustain growth at a reasonable level in the Australian economy. I emphasise again that the Australian economy remains in fundamentally good shape, and the issues we are dealing with here are issues that are emerging from the international financial crisis. Notwithstanding the strong shape the Australian economy is currently in, we have to take decisive action to ensure that the wellbeing of Australians is maintained and that we do not see Australia head into a serious economic downturn.Now I would like to turn to this question of the surplus. It appears that the primary contribution of the allegedly bipartisan opposition to the debate on this matter today is going to be a kind of schoolyard assertion that it is actually their surplus - it is not our surplus; it is their surplus. It is the nation's surplus, and we are engaged in making decisions on behalf of the Australian nation to deal with the very challenging economic circumstances that face Australia. Mr Speaker, perhaps you would like to just think back five or six months and actually contemplate some of the detail of the surplus that was put in place and is now being mobilised to ensure that we can continue to have the Australian economy grow and employment remain strong. We had in the budget $7.3 billion worth of savings measures - in fact, 100 pages more in the main budget statement because of the very large list of savings measures. Those savings measures were designed to tackle things like the fact that the former government spent $457 million in 16 months on government advertising. It spent $350 million in a year on its infamous Work Choices program. It raised the level of spending on government grant programs from $450 million in 2002 to $4.5 billion in 2007. We put in place a very substantial set of savings in order to ensure that the budget surplus would be as strong as it has become and that the Australian nation has an insurance policy, a buffer, for precisely the circumstances that we currently are contemplating.So I would suggest to the opposition, who have been buzzing around like a bee in a bottle on economic policy all year and who have been unable to land on a single position for any longer than about five minutes: if you are fair dinkum about being bipartisan about these very serious issues facing Australia then let us see you be bipartisan, let us see you change your position in the Senate on the remaining budget measures, which the minor parties and Independents have been responsible enough to deal with seriously, and let us see you understand that giving alcopops manufacturers a free kick is less important than ensuring that Australia's pensioners and families are well protected in the circumstances that we currently face. If you are fair dinkum about tax cuts then let us reverse your position with respect to the effective tax cut that is involved in increasing the threshold for the Medicare levy surcharge.Those are the issues that you need to confront if you are fair dinkum about being bipartisan and joining with the government in tackling this very serious international financial crisis and its implications for Australia. Instead of posturing like little kids in a playground about it being your surplus, how about dealing with the issues in the Senate and passing the government's budget so that the surplus can be used for the purposes for which it was intended.</DOC>

 - I certainly do, and they are currently being implemented. I do not know what the shadow Treasurer thinks is going on, but the council of economic regulators and APRA have been most emphatic about all of that. There have been very important and worthwhile reforms come through that process. What they basically go to is the capital adequacy requirements in our banking system. That is what they go to, and that has been the source of the problem globally. Thankfully, it has not been a problem here.It has not been a problem here because, particularly in the past year, APRA has been very effective in going out there and working with each of our deposit-taking institutions to ensure that a number of things happen: basically, that those standards are put in place or are being put in place and also encouraging all of those institutions with some form of exposure to events that are occurring internationally to declare them. That has been happening. APRA has been performing its role well when it comes to the implementation of all of the rules that apply to the Basel process and many other things as well. Everybody in this House can be comforted that that is the case.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I know that she across a lifetime has been deeply interested in training, not only while she has served in this parliament but before as a TAFE teacher. As I indicated to the House yesterday, as a result of the global financial crisis, the looming US recession and slowing world growth, the government expects to see a weakening of employment growth in this country. Today, the Rudd government has announced its $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy to strengthen the Australian economy. A key part of that package is a new investment of $187 million to create an additional 56,000 training places during the course of this financial year. This is a significant injection of new funding and it is a crucial element of the strategic approach being taken by the government to these difficult times.We know that skill shortages continue to exist in our economy and that they are hurting businesses and hurting those Australians who lack skills and who would be more employable with additional skills. The government, through these 56,000 new training places, is strengthening our ability to assist those who have lost jobs to ensure that they can retrain in required skills; skills which employers are crying out for.This $187 million funding injection will effectively double the Productivity Places Program from 57,000 training places to 113,000 training places. It will take the government's total investment in training places to more than $400 million since April this year. There has been huge demand for the productivity places since they were first distributed in April this year, with more than 50,000 job seekers enrolled and over 11,000 having already completed their training. It is important to note that these places are deliberately targeted to areas of skill shortage. Of those who have fully completed their training, almost 1,000 job seekers who have been referred for training by employment service providers have already obtained jobs. This is an excellent outcome for a new program.The new places that are being announced today are in addition to the 15,000 extra places that I announced in September. The new places will be available for job seekers who seek skills at the certificate II, III and IV levels and 1,000 places will be allocated as structural adjustment places to provide specific retraining opportunities and targeted support to displaced workers. With these new places, the Rudd government's total commitment to the Productivity Places Program is more than $2 billion, with more than 700,000 new training places available over five years. This country has suffered a decade of neglect under the former government of our skills and training needs. The Rudd government was elected to address that more than a decade of neglect. The Productivity Places Program is doing just that with an additional new investment of $187 million today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The fact is that we have been strongly supporting APRA. I have been meeting with them more regularly than has ever occurred in the history of this country and since APRA's creation. We have been very supportive of APRA. I meet with APRA regularly and I also meet with them as part of the Council of Financial Regulators, which includes ASIC, APRA, the Treasury and the Reserve Bank. All of those bodies that receive funding from us have indicated to me that they have sufficient resources to do their job. If they indicated to me that they needed additional resources, then of course they would be forthcoming. Also the member would be aware that APRA has as a source of funding money that it receives effectively on a fee-for-service basis. So, if APRA required further resources, they would of course receive them.For these questions to come from those opposite is just a little bit rich. Those opposite sat on the recommendations of the HIH royal commission. There was one that they did not implement. It was the recommendation for a financial claims scheme. They did not touch it. They did not touch the recommendation for a financial claims scheme, so when we came to government we did meet with all of our regulators to discuss their resourcing needs and also, in early February, to discuss the then seen implications of what was going on in international financial markets.One of the strong recommendations to us at that stage from those regulators was to proceed with a financial claims scheme. We therefore put that process in motion and made an announcement about that in this parliament - something those opposite could not see their way to doing for a number of years. We have taken all of these issues very seriously. We think that there is a way to go yet when it comes to the problems in financial markets and we will not hesitate to take any further action to strengthen either our regulators or our financial system. But at all times through this year we have worked very closely with our financial regulators to ensure that the country gets the best possible outcome.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question and his particular interest especially in supporting the pensioners and seniors on Bribie Island that I know he does so much for. Today is a red-letter day for Australia's age pensioners, for our disability support pensioners, for our veterans, for our carers and for working families. The government's measures that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced earlier today will give extra much-needed support to four million pensioners and 1.9 million Australian families. These changes, these much-needed increases in support, are a down payment on our pension reforms for the future, and it is only this government that is going to deliver long-term pension reform to make sure that the pensioners of Australia are able to have a decent standard of living into the future.I am very pleased to inform the House that already there has been a very positive response both from Australian seniors and from disability organisations. From the National Seniors association we have had comments already, saying that older Australians have warmly welcomed the federal government's move to provide generous lump sum payments to pensioners and low-income self-funded retirees in time for Christmas. The National Seniors chief executive has said that the government has 'clearly recognised the pressure that older Australians are under', and he goes on to say - and I think this really sums it up - that in a real sense it means being able to 'buy presents for their grandchildren, have ham on the table, or fix that leaky roof'. We do hope that it does help pensioners and other senior Australians do those extra things around the house that they need to do. National Seniors go on to say - and they are an important part of the national pension reform process - that they welcome this move and look forward to working with the Labor government through its pension review in building a sustainable pension system over the longer term.We have had similar comments from the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association. They are saying, 'Thankfully, this measure covers all pensioners and carers,' and they go on to say that it is a 'very, very welcome step'. The Fair Go for Pensioners Coalition also says, 'Very welcome news to build confidence and security among pensioners and seniors in this two-part announcement by the Prime Minister both in the immediate in which pensioners will be pleased to do their bit for the community by spending this money on essentials and helping to boost the economy and in the security that the long term is going to be looked at.' Certainly this is recognised by the Fair Go for Pensioners Coalition. There were similar comments from the Council on the Ageing and also the National Disability Services organisation, recognising for the first time that these payments have been extended to people on the disability support pension and recognising that they too need this extra help to make sure that they can make ends meet.This is a very important day for all pensioners, veterans and carers because they do need immediate support. They need our long-term reform and they will get it. Families also can rest a little bit easier as we come up to Christmas. Families who are receiving family tax benefit part A will get a one-off payment of $1,000 for each child in their care. That is $1,000 for three-quarters of Australia's families so that they can have a little bit extra to make sure that all the costs that they face will be easier for them as Christmas comes. This is a very important announcement for all of these Australians who need our support. As a result of this measure, we will be able to see growth continue in our economy.</DOC>

 - The very first implication is that it will put much more confidence back into our deposit-taking institutions. - You could not get anything more fundamental to the commercial paper market, to the health of households or business than actually putting confidence back into the system and making sure that liquidity flows again. That is the whole problem globally and in this country because there is a credit crunch on and banks are not lending to each other. Accessing commercial paper has also become nigh on impossible. So the very first thing that has to happen - and all of the leaders that gathered over the weekend were intent on this - is making sure that we did everything in the first instance to strengthen our deposit-taking institutions as the first step in freeing up lending in economies around the world. That is absolutely critical and that is why we took the step that we did, because the arteries of the economy have become clogged because credit was not available. The economies around the globe were choking and, of course, commercial paper was part of that. Doing what has been done here but also doing what has been done internationally is absolutely fundamental to getting liquidity flowing again.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Lindsay for his question. He obviously has a lot of young families in his electorate and he also has a lot of land that is ready to be built on. This measure will restore a lot of confidence in the housing market and hopefully see some new homes put on that land.I am very pleased to report that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer today announced a $1.5 billion boost to confidence in the housing market in Australia. First home buyers who are purchasing newly constructed properties will see the value of the First Home Owner Grant triple from $7,000 to $21,000 for newly constructed homes. It is a very significant new investment. People who are purchasing existing homes will see the value of their First Home Owner Grant double from $7,000 to $14,000. These increased payments are effective immediately and will be available on all contracts entered into between now and 30 June 2009.While our housing market has not seen the turbulence of overseas markets, lending finance for owner-occupied housing did fall by 2.1 per cent in August against July and the number of dwelling units approved in August fell by 3.7 per cent against July, seasonally adjusted. This boost will increase confidence in the housing market coming particularly on top of the one per cent cut in interest rates. It will give significant extra assistance to young people, families and individuals thinking about entering the housing market. I think many of them will find that they bring forward their decision to purchase because of these extra measures. Encouraging new building is also particularly important in current economic circumstances.We have seen a number of housing industry associations welcome this move very enthusiastically. The Housing Industry Association expects the initiative announced today to provide a boost of 15,000 in the production of new dwellings. Dr Ron Silberberg said:This measure will provide an immediate stimulus for new housing and help restore business confidence across the sector particularly in the building product manufacturing sector.From the Master Builders Association of Australia, Wilhelm Harnisch, the CEO, said:The tripling of the first homeowners grant for new homes will boost confidence _He went on to say:Kick starting the housing sector is a proven success formula for stimulating economic growth because of the multiplier effects it has on the broader economy in terms of providing jobs as well as stimulating the manufacturing and retail sectors.From the Residential Development Council, the executive director, Caryn Kakas, said:The tripling of the grant to $21,000 will get builders building again.She went on to say:There has never been a better time to introduce this cash injection.The statement went on to say:Ms Kakas believes directing the first home owners grant at first home buyers buying new homes will not only help fix our critical shortage of housing but also provide a much needed boost to the economy.This new measure is very important, it is great for first home buyers and it is great for the economy.</DOC>

 - The government's first responsibility is to take every necessary action to maintain the long-term stability of the Australian financial system, and we take that responsibility very seriously - hence why we made the statements we made a week or so ago about the pass-through of the recent 100 basis point decrease in official rates by the Reserve Bank, in contrast to the populist statement by the Leader of the Opposition, who as a former merchant banker should know better that in these difficult times -  -  - The interjection from the Leader of the Opposition is that he does know better. He knows better than the Reserve Bank of Australia, he knows better than the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, he knows better than the Secretary of the Treasury, he knows better than the council of economic regulators and he knows better, on his own admission, than anyone else on God's earth on this question. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition: there are some serious issues at stake here. It is a global financial crisis requiring decisive action by governments around the world, including this government, to maintain the stability of our financial system and we will act in accordance with the regulator's advice in this difficult time rather than take short-term, populist positions in order to secure a headline.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Capricornia for her question and acknowledge her long-term interest in infrastructure development, particularly in regional Queensland. Certainly an important part of the Prime Minister's announcement today was the bringing forward of the Rudd government's nation-building agenda. This is an important component of our long-term economic response strategy. Accordingly, the government has asked Infrastructure Australia to bring forward its interim national priority list to COAG by December, and today of course has also announced bring-forwards re the announcements about our long-term education infrastructure investment fund and our long-term health infrastructure investment fund.This will assist the government in making key decisions on allocations from the Building Australia Fund, enabling work to commence in 2009. We have already set aside for the Building Australia Fund some $12.6 billion, with further contributions to be expected from future surpluses. Actions to remove infrastructure bottlenecks will strengthen our economy and secure economic activity in the short term. Over the medium to longer term, infrastructure investment will expand our economy's growth potential. Of course, the Reserve Bank warned on 20 separate occasions about capacity constraints in the economy.In addition to this, we are also rolling out the Commonwealth's biggest ever investment in road and rail lines - some $26 billion over the next six years. In our first budget, we also got work started. We brought forward some half a billion dollars for projects that were not scheduled to start until next year, projects such as the Ballina bypass in the electorate of Page in New South Wales and the Townsville port access road in Queensland, which will have an impact on the electorate of Herbert and the electorate of Dawson. There is also the new Perth to Bunbury highway in Western Australia, the Northern Expressway in Adelaide and the West Gate Bridge in Melbourne. In all of these projects there are currently bulldozers and construction workers out there tackling bottlenecks because of the foresight in the first Rudd government budget.A strong economy is the best defence in dealing with a global economic downturn, but I am asked: has there been any opposition to this strategy expressed? Of course, there has been a range of opposition expressed. The shadow minister for finance last week sought to redefine the meaning of 'infrastructure' when he told listeners to 2UE:You know what the biggest investment in infrastructure is? Investing in people. Giving them tax cuts, helping them pay their bills everyday. Giving them a job. That's what I call investing in infrastructure.So we ignore it for 12 years, then when there is action on nation-building infrastructure we try to redefine what is meant by infrastructure!You might have thought, therefore, that there would be support for the package that the Prime Minister announced today, which will give benefit to pensioners, carers, disability support pensioners, recipients of family tax benefit A and working families. You would think that there would be bipartisan support out there, but the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate has blown that away as well, because on 2GB on 14 October, today, about an hour ago - it pays to keep attention on what those opposite are saying on 2UE and 2GB - Senator Joyce said this: 'I do have a concern that if you pay people lump sums it can end up against the wall.' So much for the bipartisanship for those working families, pensioners and carers under financial pressure that those opposite have told us they are so concerned about. The bipartisanship could not last a minute. At the same time as the Leader of the Opposition was standing up expressing bipartisan support, the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate was on radio in Sydney tearing it down - just like those in the Senate are determined to tear down our surplus. The problem with those opposite is that they are only consistent in their inconsistency. They cannot maintain a consistent economic position, and a consistent economic position is absolutely critical, particularly in times of global financial uncertainty.</DOC>

 - As the Leader of the Opposition would be aware from the briefing he has had today from Treasury at the instigation of the government, first and foremost, all those institutions which would make an application for access to this particular guarantee are APRA regulated. Secondly, he would be aware from that briefing that, when making an application for access to that particular guarantee, APRA would further examine the suitability of those institutions. Thirdly, APRA also would then, together with the government, enter into negotiations with each individual institution about the terms of the guarantee and any insurance premium which would be attached to it - in other words, the fee attached. In terms of the commercial disclosure arrangements associated with those matters, we will take the advice of APRA and we will inform the Leader of the Opposition in due course.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. Because the global financial conditions have included a sharp depreciation in the Australian dollar, there has been a presumption made by many that the current circumstances are great for Australia's farmers. It is important to put on the record of the House that that view is just plain wrong. It is true that, to the extent that exporting is part of the equation, the depreciation in the dollar provides some opportunities there, but it is a lot more complex than that. There is welcome relief, for example, for some industries which have been under pressure for some time, in particular the pig meat industry. It is also militating against some of the falling commodity prices in soft commodities, particularly wheat. There are a number of reasons for the drop in those soft commodity prices. They are not only related to changes in demand; also, some of the players who have been part of global speculation in those soft commodities, such as Lehman Brothers, by exiting the market have therefore changed the demand in the futures market on wheat as well.Sales are only one part of the equation. Most farm inputs are also themselves imported. There has been a good deal of discussion in this House for some time over the cost of chemicals, fertiliser and fuel. The fall in the dollar means that, where there has been a minor easing in some of those areas, that is not being felt by Australia's farmers because the dollar is going down at the same time. Where there might have been an easing on the global price, our capacity to purchase those global farm inputs is itself diminished as well.Conditions will remain tough for Australia's farmers for some time. The most important requirement always is rain. We know how difficult that has been to come by in some parts of the country. There are also many pressures, as I have described, which come from being part of an international market. Anything which stimulates demand and activity in the economy helps farmers with their sales throughout the nation and importantly helps to sustain rural cities and towns. Just as the impacts of the global financial crisis do not stop at the borders of capital cities, so too the government's Economic Security Strategy reaches every part of rural and regional Australia. It is important for the impact on rural and regional Australia that the payments to pensioners and carers will be felt in those towns. It is also important to note that so many farm families are income poor but asset rich. That is why the payment of $1,000 for eligible children being linked to eligibility for family tax benefit part A is so important - that the asset rich part of the equation will not preclude farm families from being otherwise eligible. These measures combine to help farmers during what is, for many, a very difficult time. And it is likely to continue to be so, but they do provide a helping hand.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member's question about pensions, can I say a couple of things. The first is that we, in the measures we have announced today, have indicated that we will cover all pensioners and carers, not just one group of them. Secondly, we have indicated that, if you take the amount we are proposing by way of a one-off bonus to single age pensioners, that is equated over nine months to an amount of about $35 a week. It seems to me to be a number in excess of one floated recently by a certain political party, even narrowly ascribed to one particular group of pensioners. Thirdly, I say to those opposite, if the honourable member who asked the question was really serious about pension reform, what did he do for 12 years?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question on this important issue. Regrettably, the prospect of terrorism remains a reality of modern times. The government continues to work hard to ensure that Australia is prepared to meet those challenges. This morning Australia's largest counterterrorism exercise, Mercury 08, got underway. The exercise is designed to enhance Australia's capacity to prevent, to prepare for, to respond to and also to recover from multiple threats or acts of terrorism.Over the next four days our security and policing agencies will be put to the test by simulated terrorist attacks in Queensland and Western Australia. The lessons learned from the London bombings of 2005 show us that regular national security exercises increase the ability of our security and emergency services to respond effectively to incidents such as those. Mercury 08 will involve the Prime Minister, the Queensland Premier and the Western Australian Premier, as well as federal and state government departments, security agencies, law enforcement personnel, crisis coordination units and emergency management teams. The Commonwealth's National Security Committee of Cabinet will also be meeting during the course of these exercises to make decisions about Australia's governmental response to these exercises. The exercises will robustly test whole-of-government decision making, information sharing, intelligence management, critical infrastructure protection and the important area of airport security. The exercises will test interoperability between civilian and military counterterrorism capabilities. The new national counterterrorism alert system that I announced earlier this month will also be tested during the course of these exercises.The exercises have attracted extensive overseas interest. In fact, there will be some 44 high-level observers from 18 different countries, and obviously the feedback that will be exchanged between all observers and participants will be of value to all. Australia's national security arrangements are strong but there is no doubt that regular exercising can further enhance those capabilities. Finally, I would like to thank everyone involved in the exercises. The work of our security and policing agencies will clearly be visible to all, but I would like to acknowledge the behind-the-scenes work of the Protective Security Coordination Centre as well as Emergency Management Australia, who have done an outstanding job in the preparation of these exercises. There is no doubt that at the end of the day, after the exchange of information from these exercises, the efforts of everyone involved will assist in making Australia just that much safer.</DOC>

 - You know things are going badly in question time when the 10th question from those opposite is called the 'rally the troops' question. That is what this one has been all about. The $390 billion is a figure which has been in the public debate from Saul Eslake for a long time. Those opposite have never bothered to refute it, I notice. Can I just say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you look at the obscenity of the amount that those opposite spent in the public advertising campaign on Work Choices, those opposite should hang their heads in shame. Go beyond Work Choices, that absolute orgy of public advertising that those opposite engaged in, week after week, month after month, year after year. You could not turn the telly on without those opposite describing their virtues to the Australian public, courtesy of the public taxpayer. I do not stand opposed to public advertising when you are giving the public critical information or when you are asking for the public to do something, but the Work Choices extravaganza is a classic example of absolute and unacceptable waste - and that is before we go on to the rainmaker. How much was it that the rainmaker got? - $10 million. What electorate was he from? - Was he from the electorate of Wentworth? So we had that whole Regional Partnerships program, which was - how much? - Hundreds of millions of dollars through Regional Partnerships. As we know, there was a very rigorous selection process to make sure that they all passed the public policy test, including the rainmaker test in Wentworth, in order to get a lick of government money and demonstrate what a fine bunch of fiscal fellows they were. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that he could make a better fist at an end-of-batting question than that. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on Work Choices to tell the working people of Australia they would be better off under Work Choices - hundreds of millions of dollars on the rest of the public advertising campaign, not to mention the rainmaker initiative within his own electorate. The Leader of the Opposition's question really needs to be rethought and reput in a more appropriate fashion.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I was pleased to be joined yesterday by Glenn McGrath and many members of this House, from both sides and the crossbenches, to announce the location of 44 breast care nurses across the country, to be trained and employed by the McGrath Foundation, who will provide improved services in local communities close to people's homes. This $12 million commitment will support breast care nurses working in towns like Bathurst; Geelong; Cairns, in the electorate of the member who asked the question; Wagga Wagga; Victor Harbor, in the electorate of the member for Mayo; Campbelltown; Gladstone; Ballarat; Mackay; Coffs Harbour; Sale; Roma; Kingaroy; and Horsham. I could go on and list the whole 44. Those 44 communities are going to benefit from having breast care specialist nurses in their communities, close to where people are diagnosed with breast cancer.We know the sad facts are that more than 12,000 women have a diagnosis of breast cancer each year. These nurses will provide vital care for women facing this life-threatening condition. They provide vital information. They are specifically trained in dealing with breast cancer. They provide practical and emotional support. I would like to quote Jane McGrath from when she was rediagnosed with cancer in 2003 and first had access to a breast care nurse. I want to quote what she said about the value of a breast care nurse, because the announcement yesterday that we are able to provide this service to 44 more communities across the community is part of a tribute to her and Glenn. She said that the breast care nurse was:Someone who could answer the questions only a nurse could answer whilst also being the support I needed to unload my frustrations and emotions.Having access to a breast care nurse allowed me to be Jane McGrath, the friend, the mother and the wife - not just Jane McGrath, the breast cancer survivor.It was Jane McGrath's view that breast cancer nurses play this very valuable role, and I am very pleased that the government is going to be able to work with the McGrath Foundation to provide this vital support in so many communities. Eighty-nine per cent of these nurses are going to be located in rural and regional areas where the current services are lightest on the ground.Of course breast cancer is a terrible disease that we are determined to fight in all ways that we can. This is just one of a number of initiatives that have recently been announced by the government, including our instigation of a reimbursement scheme of up to $400 for women who have had a mastectomy following breast cancer. It will be easily available across the country through Medicare and will also provide help and support to many women who have gone through, and suffered greatly from, breast cancer.The government continues to provide 90 per cent of the funding for the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre, a world-leading research centre fostering an evidence based approach to diagnosis, treatment and support. I was pleased to be able to announce at the start of the month that the government is investing $2Â½ million to support one of the largest ever research studies into breast cancer which will involve 100,000 women - and may I take this opportunity to encourage people to participate in that research if they are eligible - and a further $2Â½ million is going to be contributed by the National Breast Cancer Foundation itself.Last Friday I, like many other members in this parliament, hosted a local event in my electorate: a BreastWest yum cha lunch. I want to mention this because I was struck by a comment that was made at this fundraiser in support of the Sunshine breast services. The local breast surgeon, Dr Meron Pitcher, said, 'Twenty-five years ago, a diagnosis of breast cancer was a death sentence.' Thankfully, due to advances in medication and treatments, this is no longer the case, and I hope that in another 25 years we will look back and see a further reduction in lives claimed by breast cancer and an improvement in the quality of life, vastly assisted by specialist staff such as these 44 breast care nurses that will start across the country very soon.</DOC>

 - The government and its advisers have been examining the impact of the global financial crisis on the Australian economy throughout the course of this year. Specifically, as you would expect, in terms of the impact on growth, officials and ministers have been examining the detail of that over the last several weeks and we have been working our way through the detail of it. As the honourable member would be aware, meetings occurred over the course of the weekend on the finalisation of the government's response to what I believe to be a significant change to this country's medium-term growth prospects.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. Overnight the United States took further action to shore up confidence in financial markets. The plan has several elements. The first is a $250 billion voluntary capital purchase program for US financial institutions. As part of this plan $125 billion will be injected into nine banks in coming days. This is a further and extraordinary measure by the United States government. Second, there will be an exemption allowing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to temporarily guarantee the senior debt of all FDIC insured institutions.Developments in the United States overnight underline the absolute importance of this government and this country acting responsibly in dealing with the challenges not just to the financial system but to the real economy flying from the global financial crisis. That is why the government took the action that it did over the course of the weekend to guarantee deposits for banks, building societies and credit unions. That is why the government took the action that it did over the weekend to provide a guarantee in relation to the term wholesale funding arrangements of our banks as well in order to ensure that loans could continue to flow into the Australian economy for real businesses generating real jobs for the future.The second part of the government's response to the challenges of the global financial crisis is in the economic securities strategy which the government outlined yesterday. The elements of that strategy go to pensions, families and housing as well as to training and nation building. The honourable member asks about the response which the government has made to the crisis and recent developments. I am pleased to inform her about the particular implications in her community in Western Australia of one of the measures announced by the government yesterday, and that is the measure relating to pensions. To boost household consumption and to assist older Australians and carers the government will provide $4.8 billion to fund a one-off payment of $1,400 to single pensioners and $2,100 to couples. To put this into context, in the member for Hasluck's electorate this means that 13,920 pensioners and carers will benefit.Secondly, in relation to families, in the measure we announced yesterday was a one-off payment for eligible recipients of family tax benefit A for $1,000 per child - again, a payment to be made in December this year. This measure will benefit around 3.8 million Australian kids and some two million Australian families. These payments will be delivered by December at a cost of around $3.9 billion. Going to the honourable member for Hasluck's electorate in Perth, in Hasluck there are 17,355 children from some 9,013 families who will benefit from this measure. Again, this is a practical measure.On housing, the third area of the government's strategy, the measure we have announced will boost the first home owners grant through what we describe as a first home owners boost, that is, doubling the grant from $7,000 to $14,000 in the case of first home owner purchases in the period ahead and tripling that grant for those who are purchasing not just their first home but a new home as well to $21,000. We understand that this measure is designed to benefit around 150,000 first home buyers in Australia.The training packages we announced yesterday go to the doubling of the Productivity Places Program already announced by the Deputy Prime Minister and we look further to the government's announcement in December of its response to the interim project lists which come out of general infrastructure, hospitals and education in unfolding the government's nation-building agenda for the future. The cost of this package, as the honourable member will be aware, is in excess of $10 billion. That has been made possible because the government has planned ahead, putting aside a sizeable budget surplus in order to deal with the challenges of the future and, in putting that surplus to one side, planning for the future and drawing on it. -  - For those honourable members interjecting from opposite, I have one message for them: to assist working families, pensioners and carers, it would help a lot if they unblocked the further $4 billion plus worth of measures that they are currently obstructing in the Senate. We hear many pious political statements about bipartisanship. Bipartisanship begins in the Senate, and that action begins with passing $4.3 billion worth of measures which are fundamental to the budget's bottom line into the future and also of great help in delivering the support that the government has made available to the community through the Economic Security Strategy announced yesterday.Finally, the honourable member asks about responses to the global financial crisis. I also announced earlier today that the government is examining measures to address excessive executive compensation in the financial sector. Those who have followed developments in recent times will be familiar with the way in which remuneration packages in certain financial institutions have made this financial crisis worse. What we have indicated today is that the government, in partnership with APRA, will now develop a template not just for this nation for the future but also for examination by the G20 and other international institutions of how excessive executive compensation can be reined in in the future. We believe this is the right course of action. It is not only the right course of action in terms of fairness; it is the right course of action because it is also intrinsic to sorting out the long-term stability of the financial system. The global financial crisis impacts on the real economy; it impacts on the financial system; it also impacts on how we design our regulations for the future. The government's belief is that we have to act at all these levels. That includes making sure we have regulations in the future to deal with some of the excessive greed we have seen in private financial institutions in recent times in Australia, internationally, and consistently.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. At the weekend's IMF meeting, World Bank meetings, G7 meetings and G20 finance ministers meetings, there was a long discussion about the need for there to be coordinated action as well as decisive action, given that the global financial crisis does represent the biggest threat that we have yet seen to the modern market economy. I am pleased to see that in the last 48 hours governments around the world have all moved in a coordinated fashion. It was certainly pleasing to see the initiatives overnight from the United States. I did discuss some of those matters with my counterpart in the United States, as indeed I have been continuing to discuss these matters with counterparts elsewhere in the world.The initiatives in the United States overnight - an injection of money for capital into banks, a guarantee for financial institution lending and so on - are all welcome. Of course, initiatives will change from country to country, depending on the circumstances in those countries. And of course, as the government has said, we are better placed than many other nations, but nevertheless, because of the threat to growth, the need for action is still as urgent. That is why we have acted swiftly. It is why we acted swiftly to announce the interim guarantee on deposits and term funding and the additional money to residential mortgage backed securities. It is also why we announced the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy to strengthen the Australian economy. We can do this today because of responsible decisions the government took in the budget. The IMF noted in its World economic outlook:_ sound fiscal positions provide scope for allowing automatic stabilisers to operate in full and for judicious use of discretionary stimulus if the outlook deteriorates further.That is indeed the background to the package that the Prime Minister produced yesterday. This government simply will not sit on our hands. In these uncertain times there is need for immediate action to strengthen our economy.I am pleased to hear that those opposite acknowledge that and support it. That is a good thing. But, of course, they cannot have it both ways. They cannot on the one hand say they support it and then on the other hand keep nitpicking around the edges. -  - You either support swift action or you do not. These are serious times for the global economy, serious times for our national economy. What we need here is decisive action. That is why the government has taken it. And it just would be good to see the opposition get behind it.</DOC>

 - The basis of the economic advice lies in the IMF public report on the state of the global economy and the growth projections for the major developed countries going forward. And, if the Leader of the Opposition had paid attention to its contents, he would see downward revisions of growth in the world's leading economies by one per cent worldwide and in the industrial economies by a figure close to two per cent. It was a prudent course of action - given the downwards revision of global growth, the downwards revision in growth in the major industrial economies, a two per cent downwards revision of China's economic growth, together with the downwards forward projections for commodity prices, and what is happening with the business and consumer confidence indicators around the country - to act and to act decisively. This government did so. We stand by the package.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Port Adelaide for his question and I acknowledge his contribution to work that is occurring in the government in a range of areas, particularly as Chair of the Public Works Committee. The package that the government has announced, the Economic Security Strategy, has been widely welcomed by the Australian community. It has been widely welcomed by business organisations, by major businesses specifically and, of course, by pensioner organisations and a range of other community organisations.There has been a level of confusion in some commentary about the significance of the package and its economic effects. I note, for example, that there has been some suggestion that because it is based around one-off payments, temporary payments, in some way this might lead to a short-term effect that then dissipates very quickly. That is actually not correct. It is important that we get one-off payments because they will produce a ripple effect throughout the economy over a relatively extended period of time and certainly well into next year. So the suggestion that somehow the impact of this package will be restricted to the latter part of this year and then its effect will essentially dissipate is entirely wrong. It reflects a misunderstanding of the dynamic effects, as economists call them, of such packages. In particular, what it reflects is a misunderstanding of the whole purpose of such a package being put in place. As more money is being spent, that means that a whole range of businesses have slightly higher turnovers, which in turn means that the owners of those businesses have slightly higher incomes, that the level of employment that they initiate will be slightly higher, that they will not put off people they might otherwise have put off, that they will not have shorter hours for others - and they in turn have slightly higher spending power, which in turn ripples through the economy.The precise scenario that this package is designed to ameliorate is the situation where the external effects of the global financial crisis are causing the reverse to occur - where people put off workers, where businesses have lower turnover, which in turn means that they have less to spend, which in turn has a knock-on effect on other businesses and the like.It is understandable that there might be some degree of confusion and misunderstanding about the nature of the government's package, and its implications and its likely effects over time, in the wider community. But it is not just elements of the wider community that are confused. Unfortunately, the opposition is highly confused - highly confused about precisely where it stands on the government's package, highly confused about whether or not it supports the package and, indeed, what its own position is. The opposition cannot decide whether or not to support the package, it cannot decide whether or not to agree with individual components of the package and it cannot decide whether or not to propose an alternative.Yesterday we saw the Leader of the Opposition stating in a press conference that in his view the impact of the boost to the First Home Owner Grant was 'very unlikely' to overheat the Australian housing market, and he noted that housing prices had softened. The member for Cook today on ABC radio stated quite the opposite, referring to the purported propping up of house prices and stating that our housing market was actually quite strong. This is the shadow minister with responsibility for this area. So there is a direct contradiction between the shadow minister and the Leader of the Opposition.Secondly, the good old reliable, infamous member for Warringah had the gall to suggest that the motivation for the package that his party, his leader and, ostensibly, he himself support, was 'political panic'. So, by implication, the timing and all of the other elements of the package that have been ticked off by the opposition were somehow derived from political panic.Thirdly, and finally, we had the statement today on Heart FM by the Leader of the Opposition, which was: 'We would no doubt have designed it differently.' So, even though they support the package, 'We would no doubt have designed it differently.' So they support the package but they think it should have been done a bit differently, its components should have been a little different. But they will not let us in on the secret; they will not tell us what the different elements of that package should be. Yet again, the mask of bipartisanship is slipping and revealing the reality of endless partisan sniping.We have had the member for North Sydney jubilantly claiming that he proclaimed a few months ago that there would be a recession. We have had the member for Curtin completely verballing the Prime Minister and making claims about statements he made. We have had the Leader of the Opposition claiming credit for the banks passing on interest rate reductions. I think the opposition needs to have a bit of a reality check here.It would be fair enough for the opposition to insert into public debate a legitimate critique of the government's package to indicate that they oppose the package, they disagree with it or they disagree with elements of it, and put forward arguments, and we would debate that. We would inevitably disagree with the view put forward by the opposition, but that would be fair enough. Equally, it would be fair enough if the opposition properly signed up to the government's package and indicated that they believe that this is the correct decision, the correct approach, in the circumstances. But the opposition refuse to do either; they refuse to take either path. They are left once again mired in mindless, random sniping - and I would suggest to you, Mr Speaker, that serves no-one's interests, not even theirs.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition points to the growth data that was put out by the IMF recently -  - The Leader of the Opposition in his question just now referred to my earlier answer which referred to the world economic outlook data provided by the IMF, and that contained within it the downward revisions in growth which we referred to before. Furthermore, on top of the international data to which I referred before, I would draw the honourable member's attention to the statement by the Reserve Bank of last Tuesday, when they undertook a 100-basis-point cut. It is worth reflecting on this, because it is in the public domain -  - I think the honourable member would actually benefit from listening to the Reserve Bank governor; although he often says he knows more about the economy than the Reserve Bank governor. The Reserve Bank governor says in his statement:Economic activity in the major countries is also weakening, and evidence is accumulating of a significant moderation in growth _He goes on further to say:The recent deterioration in prospects for global growth, together with much more difficult market conditions _ now present the risks that demand and output - this is about Australia - could be significantly weaker than _ expected._Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Given that background, the Board judged that a material change to the balance of risks surrounding the outlook had occurred _ - What the opposition are doing now is questioning whether this package is necessary at all, having provided bipartisan support for the package yesterday. It is a remarkable state of affairs. What those opposite would have us do is sit around twiddling our thumbs, waiting for growth data to pop out the end of the system in nine months time, and then say, 'Wow, we should have acted.' The Governor of the Reserve Bank put out a statement last Tuesday justifying a 100-basis-point reduction in interest rates. We understand the impact of that and other data; those opposite plainly do not. That is why we support a $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy for the future of the nation, even if those opposite fail to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question. I would note his particular interest in education and training and his passionate interest in adult literacy, having taught himself to read as an adult - a fantastic story. Yesterday, as part of the government's Economic Security Strategy to see Australia through these tough times, the government announced a new investment of $187 million in training places for job seekers - these training places to be in areas of skills shortage. This new investment, announced yesterday, will provide 56,000 new places - almost doubling the number of places in the Productivity Places Program, which began in April. The new investment is there to provide support for individuals who lose their job and need to retrain. We know that in our economy there are businesses and industries that are crying out for skilled workers; so, if someone has lost a job, these productivity places are there to provide them with skills in areas where there is still strong demand.I am pleased to say that the government's policy has been welcomed almost across the board - by industry, training providers, support agencies and the not-for-profit sector. Jim Barron, the CEO of Group Training Australia, said this about the package:The injection of funds into skills development and training will have an expansionary impact on the economy while quickening the pace of re-skilling in critical areas of labour shortage.The Australian Industry Group welcomed the new training places in the following terms:It is encouraging that the take up of the productivity places has been so positive and very encouraging that the government has acted to meet this demand. The 10,000 new structural adjustment places to be made available to help displaced workers in the automotive and manufacturing industries are also most welcome.Then the CEO of the Australian Mines and Metals Association, Steve Knott, said:Productivity initiatives, including increasing the skill pool available to the resources sector, is a sound economic decision.Mission Australia said:In a time of financial turmoil it is the people at the margins who suffer first. For many, this training program is a pathway not only towards sustainable employment but also social re-engagement. For training providers like Mission Australia, the increased places mean we can provide more assistance to more people, and we can do it this year.Finally, the National Employment Services Association said:The increase in places from 57,000 to 113,000 is welcomed by all agencies working to increase the economic and social participation of Australians, particularly those who are facing particular disadvantage.There was even an endorsement from a young apprentice, a carpentry apprentice, Brodie Chambers, who was in today's Adelaide Advertiser. He said:At school it's drummed into you to go to uni, but there's a big need for trades and this shows that it is just as good to have a trade certificate as going to university _That was the message from young Brodie, and he is right. I said that our package was welcomed almost across the board because, of course, the vote quibbling, the voice of dissent, the voice that is not sure whether it is in support of or against the package is of course the voice of the Liberal Party, the voice of the opposition. So the shadow minister for employment participation, the member for Boothby, is there expressing concerns about this package, despite the fact that he has never apologised to the Australian people for the more than a decade of neglect engaged in by the Liberal Party in government of skills and training needs. This is a shadow minister who has expressed concern about a program that has already delivered more than 50,000 training places to Australians who needed them and is now expressing concern about a program where we are adding 56,000 more training places. It falls straight into a pattern from the opposition, where they talk out of one side of their mouth and say they support the package; they talk out of the other side of their mouth and they oppose the package. You have got to make a decision: are you for it or against it? This is an opposition with no idea, no plans and certainly no strategy in education and training.</DOC>

 - I thought that the opposition did support the package, but obviously not. As the Prime Minister has said, as I have said and as the finance minister has said, the government will publish a full budget and economic update at MYEFO, which will be released within the next month. That is the reasonable thing to do, that is the sensible thing to do, and I can tell you it will not be published at 4.30 pm on Christmas Eve, because that was the practice of the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins. We will put it out there in plenty of time for there to be plenty of scrutiny, because we do believe in transparency. We will publish MYEFO within the next month. We will do that. It will be out there for all to see and we will do it in a way which does not disadvantage the opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lindsay for his question. He understands that the government's stimulus package not only represents a prudent response to the turmoil that is convulsing world markets but also is an opportunity to assist, in a meaningful way, those in the community who are doing it tough. I am sure the member for Lindsay would welcome the fact that 10,176 single pensioners and carers in his electorate will receive the $1,400 lump sum pensioner payment and, importantly 10,774 pensioner couples will receive the $2,100 lump sum payment in his electorate, in addition to the family payments in his electorate, which will go to 13,786 families for the 27,680 children in their care.The $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy announced yesterday by the Prime Minister and Treasurer is designed to support the continued positive growth in the Australian economy as we feel the very real impacts of the world financial crisis. As various international bodies have pointed out, Australia is well placed to get through this crisis, and it is; but it would be irresponsible for the government to rest on its laurels and not take decisive action to ensure continued growth. It is important that the Australian government do everything it can to get in front of the game.Of course, once a stimulus package is decided upon, there are a number of opportunities - indeed, a number of responsibilities - for the government of the day: the responsibility to grow the productive capacity of the economy by investing in infrastructure and to grow our capacity to deal with the skills shortages across the economy, as the Deputy Prime Minister has referred to. The other responsibility is to use the stimulus package as an opportunity to assist those in the community doing it tough - those who need assistance with cost-of-living pressures. This is a responsibility the government took very seriously with the lump-sum payments to pensioners, veterans and carers, as well as those to families.You would think that would be welcomed by all honourable members and senators. You would think that all honourable members and senators would recognise that pensioners and families are doing it tough and that it is a wise use of the stimulatory package to give them some assistance in these times of uncertainty. But that is not the view of the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. Yesterday Senator Joyce, a member of the coalition leadership team - this is not just any member of the coalition; this is a member of the coalition leadership team - said this on Radio 2GB:I do have a concern that if you pay people in lump sums it can end up against the wall _That is what the leader of the National Party in the other place said. Honourable members could be forgiven for saying that you could not think of a more offensive thing to say to Australia's pensioners, but they would be wrong, because he thought of something more offensive to say today. The Leader of the National Party in the Senate said this as he walked into parliament:I'm worried about when big chunks of money turn up in one fell swoop just before Christmas, because a couple of weeks later you see a lot of Australia's $10 billion scattered around the floor with 'made in China' on the back.That is what the Leader of the National Party in the Senate thinks. The snobbery of the Leader of the National Party in the Senate belies not only his lack of economic understanding but also his lack of confidence in Australia's pensioners and families to spend their money as they see fit. That is what it underlies. I do not think the pensioners of Lindsay or any other electorate would appreciate being lectured by the opposition on how they should spend their money. They will spend it on getting them through tough times.I note that the opposition cannot even be consistent in their hypocrisy. As the Leader of the National Party in the Senate yesterday criticised the lump sums, the shadow minister for ageing put out a press release claiming credit for them, saying that she had called for them back in May. Perhaps she was taking her cue from the Leader of the Opposition, who famously claimed credit for the banks passing on most of the interest rate reduction recently. I understand the Leader of the Opposition will soon announce that it was really he who invented the internet as well. He is perfecting the Kath and Kim approach to economics - holding a press conference and saying, 'Look at me, look at me.' That is the Kath and Kim approach to economics. The opposition speaks with many voices on this issue; the government speaks with one - one of responsibility and compassion.</DOC>

 - The Treasury has strongly endorsed this package because it is our key economics adviser. Of course, this is, by definition, a package which is being put in place to strengthen growth - and to strengthen growth at a time when the Reserve Bank is easing monetary policy and to support that easing. I am not sure whether the shadow Treasurer actually understands the fundamentals of economics at all. We are having an easing of monetary policy and because growth is slowing we have decided to stimulate our economy. That is what is required at the moment, and that is what the Treasury has supported in our discussions with it. That is what all advisers and leaders around the world are looking to do - everyone except, apparently, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer.We have brought forward this package because it is very important to get ahead of what is occurring internationally, to act early and to act decisively. We have done that, and all of the forecasts will be published when we publish MYEFO, in the normal, transparent and open way - and that will be in the next month. But those opposite want to have it both ways. They want to pretend, on the one hand, that they support the package. Of course, what the package is doing is drawing down on the surplus, but who opposed the surplus's creation in the first place? Those opposite did. The Leader of the Opposition said, prior to the last budget, that we did not need a larger surplus. That is what he said, and since that time he has been trying to vandalise the surplus in the Senate. We are in this position of strength in our economy precisely because the government had the foresight at the May budget to anticipate that there could be a turn for the worse, and unfortunately there has been. But we will act, we have acted and we will continue to act in the Australian national interest.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Forde for that question. When I was in the electorate of Forde recently with him he took me to a number of new developments. It is a very fast-growing part of South-East Queensland and of course it has all of the challenges that fast growth brings with it, but the member for Forde is very well connected with his local government up there and with his local developers and together they are making a great effort to manage the fast pace of growth.Yesterday, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister announced a major measure to improve confidence in the housing market: the doubling of the first home owners grant from $7,000 to $14,000 on existing homes and the tripling of the grant from $7,000 to $21,000 for new homes. This measure will provide a much-needed confidence boost, both to the housing industry and to the economy as a whole. It will stimulate much-needed new building across the housing sector. In fact, the HIA have estimated that we will see an extra 15,000 homes built because of this measure. It will certainly allow people who were considering buying a home to bring forward that purchase. People who are buying existing homes might just have a couple of thousand dollars left at the end of the day to buy the new refrigerator they might need when they are moving into their new home, particularly if they are moving out after living with their parents, for example.This investment, of course, has a multiplier effect across the whole of the economy. That is why it is such an important part of our economic security package and has been so strongly supported by the industry. I spoke yesterday about the endorsements of the Housing Industry Association, the Residential Development Council and the Master Builders Association. Today I would like to tell you of some of the comments that have been made by Noel Dyett, of the Real Estate Institute of Australia. He says:This decision, combined with last week's reduction in interest rates, should provide a much needed impetus to first home buyers who have been waiting to enter the housing market.That was a terrific comment from the Real Estate Institute.Paul Lahiff, who is the managing director of Mortgage Choice, whom I met with last week, said that it is a 'bold and positive move by the government that will improve the sentiment throughout the entire property sector'. Joe Falanga, the sales manager of Lily Homes, was quoted in today's Sydney Morning Herald as saying:Â _ once you start talking about $21,000 it's different. Within a few hours we got calls.The most significant response and feedback that we have had about this new measure has been from the many people who have been ringing my office and the state treasuries wanting to know about how to access these new benefits. The first thing to say to those people who are considering entering the housing market now is to contact their state treasuries in the normal way that they would if they were getting the first home owners grant. I know that our Treasurer has already written to his state colleagues to request their urgent implementation of this new measure.The eligibility requirements for the new benefit are the same as for the first home owners grant: you must be over 18 years old, neither you nor your partner can have owned a property previously, you have to live in the home as your principal place of residence for six out of the first 12 months of owning the place after settlement and you have to sign a contract for the new home between 14 October - yesterday - and 30 June. This new measure is a time limited measure. It ends at the end of this financial year - 30 June 2009.This measure will make an enormous and real difference to young Australians who have been waiting to get into the housing market. Saving a deposit has been one of the biggest barriers to entering the housing market for some time now, and this measure makes that entry into the housing market just a little bit easier. There was a young couple from Altona who were reported in the Herald Sun today as saying this 'will make a huge difference. It will probably cover all our stamp duty and leave a little left over for appliances and furniture'. The young couple featured in today's Herald, due to be married in January, said, 'What a relief; we might be able to crack a place we like.'</DOC>

 - I am not sure that this is within my portfolio responsibilities, but I am happy to answer the question. It is a very good question. The government has decided to act with respect to the Economic Security Strategy because there are very strong downward pressures being exerted on the Australian economy by the international financial crisis. Those downward pressures, as was indeed noted by the leader of the member for North Sydney, the Leader of the Opposition, are already having a significant effect on the economy, and the housing sector, of course, is an important part of that. I do not make any projection about the specific effect that the first home owners grant increase will have. That will be very difficult to determine and to extract from the wider economic data, but it is part of an overall strategy which is designed to sustain economic activity, in that case in a specific sector that is crucial to the wider Australian economy. It is designed to push back, by stimulating spending and by stimulating economic activity, against those very powerful downward pressures that are being exerted by the global financial crisis on the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. I note what a strong interest he has in assisting our older Australians. This government is delivering for our older Australians. Our $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy announced yesterday decisively acts to assist the nation's four million pensioners, carers and seniors who are doing it tough. The immediate $4.8 billion down payment on long-term pension reform provides immediate relief for elderly Australians and it builds on the $7.5 billion in support this government provided in its first budget.For elderly Australians the financial crisis has placed increasing pressures on budgets already stretched by the rising cost of living. That is why yesterday's announcement is not our final statement on pension reform. The decisive action taken in the Economic Security Strategy delivers for older Australians right now, but we are committed to long-term pension reform, to be delivered next year. These one-off payments will not be taxed and will not be included for income-testing purposes. People who live in our nursing homes will be able to keep the entire lump sum. These one-off payments are a sensible measure with a lump sum of $1,400 for a single age pensioner and $2,100 for a couple. Make no mistake: a one-off payment like this will make a huge difference to the lives of so many older Australians, whether it is about covering their day-to-day living expenses, their household repairs or preparing for Christmas. It is our older Australians who built this nation. These are the people who defended our country, these are the people who paid their taxes and these are the people who have raised their families. It is this government that is delivering for them with this package.</DOC>

 - Frankly I am astonished by this question, because had you perhaps asked me at the time that those words were spoken, 'Should there be an injection of $10 billion of additional government spending into the Australian economy?' I would have said no to that as well. Why? Because the economic circumstances were dramatically different at the time. I suggest to you that, if you would actually like to be a contender for one of the senior economic ministries in this place, you might learn something about economics.One of the reasons why you have variable positioning of government spending and different initiatives is that they are designed to deal with the macroeconomic circumstances that the government confronts at the time, which means that if you inherit an overheating economy with government spending running at five per cent in real terms, putting upward pressure on inflation, then you cut spending. It is as simple as that, because you seek to counteract the inflationary pressures that your predecessors, like the member for Higgins, have left for you to deal with. But if, as a result of international pressures, as a result of the global financial crisis, you have very substantial downward pressure on economic activity, which includes downward pressure on activity in the housing sector and housing prices, then it is good policy, whether in housing or across the board, to push back up again. So perhaps before you purport to be shadow finance minister you should take some economic lessons.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question and for her longstanding interest in matters to do with veterans, particularly on issues around the Ballarat POW memorial but also on Long Tan medallic recognitions, amongst a range of other issues. The government's package produces an outcome for over 326,000 veterans affairs beneficiaries with respect to the payment of $1,400 to singles and $2,100 to couples. This is well deserved and clearly, in the circumstances we face in the current economic situation, something that is much needed. It is something that I think shows that this government has recognised that there is a need to act and so has done so. It is also, if you like, as the Minister for Ageing said earlier, a down payment on a further, more comprehensive approach to dealing with the issues of the income of pensioners into the future, and we await the outcome of the Harmer review and action from government at that time.I am also asked whether there are alternative positions with respect to this, and I am reminded of the fact that the opposition has had positions with respect to the needs of pensioners, particularly the needs of veterans, in the last several months. The House would recall that the member for Bradfield, the then opposition leader, back around 9 September, was of the view that what was needed was an immediate $30 increase for single age pensioners, but he made a point of stipulating quite clearly that everyone else was excluded. This was rightly pointed out at the time as something which excluded disability pensioners, which excluded veterans, which excluded a whole range of people who in fact had a real need.Subsequently we had a change of opposition leader and we had a change of position. Once again, we would recall that the member for Wentworth, in his interview with Laurie Oakes, was asked what in fact his position was with respect to the $30 payment. Suddenly it was also to cover single age service pensioners. And so it went on. Of course what we discovered at that time was that there had been a late change made to the motion in the Senate to include veterans. The opposition maintained that that covered somewhere in the region of 70,000 single service pensioners - but of course that showed once again that they did not actually understand what they were doing. When you go to the question of single service pensioners, you find that it actually includes a large percentage of partners - partners who in fact are not veterans under any legislation that we operate under, partners who in fact would have been excluded under the very definitions that they had used. So they talked about 70,000 being covered; it was probably closer to somewhere around 40,000.What the opposition's position at that time was really about was probably best summed up in an interview that the shadow minister for finance, the member for North Sydney, did with Steve Price on 24 September:JOE HOCKEY: Okay, so, what - you're saying we shouldn't be a voice for pensioners?PRICE: Happy for you to be a voice for pensioners.HOCKEY: Well, that's what we are.PRICE: It would've been better if you had been a voice last year when you had been in office.HOCKEY: Okay, well, you're making that political point. I say to you we are not going to because - PRICE: It's a factual point, it's not a political point.Steve Price went on to say:I'm happy for you to fight for them but it would have been better if you had fought for them when you were actually able to do something.We on this side of the House know that you did not, and you on that side of the House know that you did not also. You pulled a stunt, and we said what the stunt was. What these changes that we have announced do is cover a lot more than what you did with your stunt. For example, some 105,000 -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I apologise. There are many things I have accused you of over the years and it is very unfair of me to actually put you in for this one. - I certainly won't! What I will say, Mr Speaker, is that the proposal by the opposition excluded, but we have included, over 105,000 war widows - people who have lost their partners in the service of this country. It also includes some 90,000-plus partner service pensioners, who are the partners of those who have served our country. It also includes some 70,000-plus married service pensioners.The fact of the matter is that the proposal that the opposition had - and there were many that they had - did not deal with the real issue here. What the government has done is a very good first step in dealing with the issues around the question of pensioner incomes into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Banks for his question. Of course, Banks electorate is absolutely full of Australians who stand to benefit from this measure, if the Liberal Party would just direct its senators to vote for it later today in the Senate. Our economic security package will benefit many of the constituents in Banks - pensioners, veterans, families, carers - but we would like to help more people in the electorate of Banks and in every other electorate by providing tax relief to 330,000 Australians. We were always convinced of the benefit of this measure when it was announced in the budget, but events of the last few weeks give us even more reason to be arguing for the Liberal Party to support this measure in the Senate.There are three important reasons for passing this measure - in addition to the many which have already been aired in this place and elsewhere over the last few months. Firstly, we know when families are struggling that they are already making tough choices on the way they spend their money. We think it is unimaginable that the Liberal Party would want to direct how they spend that tight, remaining budget. The Leader of the Opposition wants to give working families earning less than the average wage a choice between paying for private health insurance that they cannot afford and paying a tax that they cannot afford. We do not think that is fair, we do not think that is just and we think the Liberal Party should support this measure in the Senate.Secondly, the opposition are depriving the economy of another source of stimulus at this time of difficulty. We could be putting money back into the pockets of Australians but the Liberal Party is standing in the way, stopping this money going to thousands of families and singles across the country. Thirdly, this measure also helps to bolster the surplus at a time when the importance of the surplus is starkly apparent. In other words, not only is this good policy, as we have been arguing for many weeks; it will restore choice in our health system, something those opposite pretend they stand for. It will deliver tax cuts to working families after 10 years of inaction and it is the economically responsible thing to do.On Monday, the Leader of the Opposition said, 'At a time when you want to stimulate the economy, raising taxes is not a very good idea.' Here is a chance to lower taxes. I ask the Leader of the Opposition whether he will direct his Liberal Party colleagues in the Senate to vote for this measure. For a couple earning $60,000 each a year, this tax cut could deliver them $1,200 just like that if the Leader of the Opposition would walk across to the Senate and ask his senators to vote for this measure. The Liberal Party have to decide whether or not they stand for tax relief. If they are for tax relief, they should be voting for this measure in the Senate.</DOC>

 - If the Leader of the Opposition had listened today to the questions I was asked by the gallery at the National Press Club -  -  - I was about to return to what was said earlier today and to repeat it here - the most recent data available to the government was about growth with a '2' in front of it and, secondly, in the current global economic environment, what Australia needs is a buffer for the future. That is why we have provided the Economic Security Strategy. It is the right course of action. It is done responsibly on the basis of what is occurring internationally, on the basis of what is happening with forward commodity prices, on the basis of softening in China's economic growth, on the basis of the softening in global growth and the most recent statement by the Reserve Bank as of last Tuesday. It is the right course of action.What we have had throughout question time is the Leader of the Opposition walking both sides of the street. The Leader of the Opposition says in one press statement that he supports a $10.4 billion economic package for the nation but in every question he has authorised in question time today he has sought to undermine that package - walking both sides of the street, on every question that has been put - for example, on questions about taxes, when in the Senate at the moment they stand in the road of tax measures which would benefit 330,000 to the tune of up to $1,200 a year - walking both sides of the street, on a whole range of policy questions. We have seen again recently the Leader of the Opposition saying, on the one hand, that he supports the economic regulators but, on the other hand, casting doubt on the regulators; saying, on the one hand, that he supports what APRA and the Reserve Bank are saying and, on the other hand, saying that the Reserve Bank's statement about the robustness of Australian financial institutions may not be exactly accurate. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: his pursuit of a short-term, populist headline in the newspapers may suit a short-term political agenda but it is no substitute for the long-term economic leadership which Australia needs today.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. As the minister for transport the safety of the travelling public will always be my No. 1 priority. At 3.30 pm local time on Tuesday, 6 October, Qantas flight QF72 from Singapore to Perth made a safe emergency landing in Learmonth, Western Australia. The plane had to land because at 37,000 feet the plane unexpectedly pitched downwards for a short period, dropping hundreds of feet. For the 303 passengers and 10 crew on board, this was a frightening and traumatic event. More than 70 people were injured in the incident. I would like to place on record the government's gratitude to the Qantas crew, the ground staff, the police and the hospital staff who assisted the injured and distressed passengers and crew. I think I speak on behalf of both sides about that issue.The Australian Transport Safety Bureau says that the crew's timely response led to the recovery of the aircraft trajectory within seconds. I note the many tributes paid by the passengers to the pilot and crew of the aircraft and I also pay tribute to them. The quick and effective response of the pilot and crew is testimony to their training and their professionalism.From the evening of 6 October until Monday, 13 October, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau investigators were on site at Learmonth and in Canberra. Also helping with the investigation are the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, Qantas and investigators from the French government equivalent of the ATSB. As is normally the case in these investigations, Airbus, who were the manufacturers of the plane, are also providing valuable technical assistance.The ATSB announced yesterday evening that it has identified a computer fault as the likely cause of the incident. According to the ATSB, it appears one of the plane's onboard computers sent false information to the flight control computer, causing the autopilot to disconnect and, a short time later, causing the plane to quickly pitch downwards. Yesterday Airbus issued urgent instructions to all airlines using its planes on what to do in the very unlikely event that a similar computer fault occurs. Investigators now know what the likely cause of the incident is, but work is continuing on why the incident happened, and I intend to keep the House updated on these matters.The ATSB will work with Airbus's component manufacturers in the USA and France to determine why the onboard computer malfunctioned as it did. CASA, the independent safety regulator, is keeping a close eye on the investigation. This appears to be an isolated incident and CASA accepts the manufacturer's recommendations, which will ensure these aircraft can continue to operate safely. The ATSB will release a preliminary factual report in early November, within 30 days of the accident, and the ATSB will immediately bring any critical safety issues they uncover to the attention of relevant authorities. I will be guided by advice from the ATSB and CASA, who are working closely with Airbus and Qantas in this investigation. The government will ensure that any necessary safety action is taken.</DOC>

 - What I said yesterday was that the government had before it the budget forecast, those from the RBA and, of course, those which were also outlined in the IMF's World Economic Outlook for growth, all of which had a number with a '2' in front of it for calendar 09 or financial 08-09. What I further said was that the government judged it necessary to have a financial stimulus package to provide a buffer for growth into the future because of the difficulties which were arising through recent developments on global financial markets. The government stands by its policy. It has acted prudently, it has acted early and it has acted decisively.</DOC>

 - There has been further turmoil overnight on global share markets as US equity markets had their biggest fall since 1987. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.9 per cent, the S&amp;P 500 by some nine per cent. We also saw significant falls in the United Kingdom, France and Germany of between seven and six per cent. Falls on share markets and commodities markets reflect a general concern that the global economy is slowing rapidly. In fact, US retail sales fell by 1.2 per cent in September, their biggest monthly drop in three years. These concerns have been added to last night by the Chairman of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, who said:By restricting flows of credit to households, businesses, and state and local governments, the turmoil in financial markets and the funding pressures on financial firms pose a significant threat to economic growth.The IMF is now forecasting the slowest growth in advanced economies for over a quarter of a century. In other words, the impact that we have seen in terms of financial market turbulence and instability in recent times has flowed through not just to equities markets but also to the real economy, and that of course has implications for jobs.This underscores the importance of early and decisive action here in Australia. The Australian government has acted responsibly in this respect. On Sunday the government took action to guarantee all Australian bank deposits to build confidence and stability in our banking system. We also guaranteed term funding arrangements for banks in order to ensure that banks could continue to provide credit to those seeking credit in the real economy, including business and small business as well as households. On top of that, on Tuesday the government acted to strengthen the national economy and support household budgets with the release of the government's $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy for the future. The government has acted to give financial support to seniors, to carers, to pensioners, lower and middle-income families and first home buyers. Furthermore, the Economic Security Strategy will allow greater spending by families and by seniors on consumption, home buying and construction. These all represent vital economic stimulants for the future. At a time when the global economy is going backwards at a pace of knots, this level of stimulus is absolutely necessary and it is responsible, and it should obtain genuine bipartisan support.The government welcomes the support we have received from the Australian business community on this package. The BCA President, Greig Gailey, said the $10.4 billion package is 'the right response to the threat of economic slowdown'. He said:This package contains all three ingredients to have maximum impact. It is well-timed, well-targeted, and temporary.AiG's CEO, Heather Ridout, said:These spending measures will complement the recent interest rate reductions and steps to underwrite confidence in our banking system.In coming days and weeks we will continue to work with business and industry groups on Australia's response to the global financial crisis. The Treasurer, the Assistant Treasurer and I will be meeting with business leaders tomorrow in Sydney to discuss the impact of the global financial crisis further with industry leaders and work with business leaders to determine further appropriate collective responses by the government to what is a global financial crisis impacting not just Australian capital markets and equities markets but the real economy as well.The government remains determined to act, and to act decisively, whenever necessary to respond to the challenges which now present themselves to the Australian economy for the future. We have acted accordingly on the weekend. We have acted accordingly on Tuesday. We will act in the future in relation to infrastructure provision. And we will take whatever further action is necessary to ensure the long-term health of this economy and to help Australian households on the way through.</DOC>

 - What puzzles me about the opposition's attack on this is, first of all, that they have given bipartisan support for this package and within 24 hours there is no longer bipartisan support for this package. We have an opposition determined to engage in short-term partisan politics rather than participate in a long-term economic security strategy for the nation. I draw the Leader of the Liberal Party's attention to the following facts. The first goes to the growth numbers for the Australian economy, which I have referred to before. The second is the real information contained in the IMF's most recent report on both the global economy and on the developed economies within that. The October IMF report points to a downward revision in the growth projections for 2009 of about one per cent for the global economy. Secondly, it goes to a further revision downwards by about one per cent for the advanced economies. In the case of the global economies, what you had was the fourth downward revision within a year and in the case of the advanced economies a revision down to growth which is practically zero, which would see across the advanced economies a level of growth lower than we have seen for the last 25 years. That is the first set of factors which galvanised the government's attention.The second is this: what has happened with growth in the Chinese economy as well? Revisions downward in the Chinese economy in terms of their growth -  - I find it remarkable that the alternative Prime Minister of Australia says that growth in the Chinese economy is irrelevant to the future growth prospects of the Australian economy. I think it reflects a level of illiteracy about the impacts of growth in the global economy and in one of Australia's most significant export partners and the most significant demand element out there in the global economy at present. And with one brush of the hand he says, 'China is not relevant.' He assumes therefore -  - In the most recent IMF report we have revisions down by one per cent in global growth and revisions down by one per cent in the growth of the most advanced economies. There are also revisions down in Chinese growth, which uniquely the Leader of the Opposition seems to think irrelevant to growth prospects in this economy - a remarkable conclusion. On top of that you should have a close look at what has happened most recently in business and consumer confidence indicators around the world and in Australia. The growth data for Australia is that which was outlined in my answer to the honourable gentleman's first question - the budget projection for 2008-09 of 2.75, the RBA's most recent statement of 2.25 and the figure of 2.2 in the IMF's report. This is the data which is before the government.What the opposition leader suggests is that what is going on in the global economy in the period ahead is irrelevant to how those growth numbers will be affected in the future. And I say this to the Leader of the Liberal Party: these numbers for the global economy predate the convulsions in global stock markets and capital markets of the last two weeks. Therefore, the logic which flows from this is transparently obvious: if you have a revision down in growth globally of one percentage point, and that is prior to the convulsions in stock markets and capital markets in the last couple of weeks, it is a wise course of action to create a buffer against Australia's future growth prospects. One per cent of Australian GDP is $10 billion. Therefore if you are seeking to construct a buffer for the future it is within that ballpark that you should be aiming in order to ensure that you are providing a proper buffer for growth in the future.But let us look carefully at the economic strategy which the Leader of the Opposition is advocating. He is advocating that this government should wait until MYEFO and wait until the new national accounts data emerges to demonstrate what the actual growth numbers for the future will be. I say to those opposite: the response to the global financial crisis is along these lines. You either act early and decisively before there is a problem -  - Effectively what the Liberal Party is saying is: 'Wait for the data to roll in in the future and then decide it is time to act' - by which time it is too late. The advice from the Treasury is that you act early, you act decisively and you act responsibly. This government has done so in order to create a buffer for economic growth for the future. What is remarkable about this intervention by the Leader of the Opposition is that it does go to a question of the character which he deploys in this economic debate - always walking two sides of the street: on one day saying that he gives this package bipartisan support and on the next day seeking to undermine it. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. In recent weeks the global financial crisis has entered a new and dangerous phase. It is a new and dangerous phase that those opposite do not seem to recognise. But the Rudd government has been acutely aware of the possibility of this global financial crisis deepening. - The member over there just said that the opposition warned us about this in April - is that right? Well, this is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say on 30 September at a press conference:There is nobody that would have predicted these events a year ago or even a few months ago.That is what he said. And this is what he said on 1 October:_ as recently as March people felt _ the worst had passed. But it has got a lot worse and the events of the last few weeks would not have been predicted a few months ago.So what did he say last night? What did he say in his address to the nation? This is what he said -  - The government has been ahead of the game - ahead of the game all year. But this is what the Leader of the Opposition said last night:_ governments should have acted a lot earlier _ - The point is this, Mr Speaker: the Leader of the Opposition is walking both sides of the street. These are dangerous events and in recent times they have taken a turn for the worse, and what that demands is immediate action -  - decisive and immediate action, and that is what is being delivered by the Rudd government because of the events in recent times. But we have been ahead of the game all year. We have been in discussions with the Reserve Bank, with the Treasury and with our international counterparts since January this year. And, of course, in the May budget we highlighted the risk to this economy from international forces. That was very much highlighted in our argument for a strong surplus. This is why in June this year we strengthened the investment mandate of the AOFM, it is why we introduced a financial claims scheme -  - it is why we moved to crack down on short selling. We just had an interjection from over there that the Financial Claims Scheme was their idea! It was recommended to them in 2003, after the HIH royal commission, and ignored. So we have been ahead of the game from the very beginning. They are walking both sides of the street. They would rather wait for events to overrun us. We will not do that; we will take decisive and strong action.</DOC>

 - The Prime Minister and I have indicated that MYEFO, the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, will be produced in the next month, and those contingent liabilities will be contained in those documents. They will be contained in those documents, as is usual practice. MYEFO is a very important document. I think I remarked in the House yesterday that the practice of the previous Treasurer was to deliver it at a time when people were not around, just before Christmas. -  - MYEFO from those opposite -  
A government member - Christmas Eve. - Christmas Eve it was - on the 21st. - Ten of the opposition's MYEFOs when they were in government were released more than six months after the budget. I remember the day well; everybody had left Canberra. There are people up there who remember it as well because it was the day on which the former Treasurer reneged on their promise in terms of the childcare rebate. They decided to publish it just before Christmas so nobody would notice they were going to make families wait two years for their childcare cash rebate. -  - That is why it was published right on Christmas Eve: because Christmas followed the weekend and nobody was in Canberra. Nobody was in Canberra; they had all gone home. They tried to bury it -  -  - Unlike those opposite, we will produce MYEFO, the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. We will produce it next month. All of these figures will be -  - She says, 'Why not now?' Because it is being prepared by the Treasury. We will deliver it earlier than it was delivered by them on at least 10 occasions, because that is the responsible thing to do. The responsible thing to do is deliver it in a measured and considered way. All of that data which is being asked for by those opposite will be there for all to see. But what is all this about? To hide their embarrassment they are trying to walk both sides of the street. They are trying to pretend they support the package and then they are trying to nitpick at it around the edges all the way through because they do not support it and because they do not want to stand up for the national interest. We have taken a decision to get ahead of the game by strengthening our economy, because of what is occurring in the international economy. If those opposite cannot understand what is going on in the international economy, given all of the events in the United States, in Europe and in the emerging economies, then they simply do not get it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Isaacs for his question, because it is important that the House is aware of the powers that APRA has, on behalf of the government and the Australian people, to protect bank deposits in these difficult times. Following the announcement of the guarantee of bank deposits by the government, it is also important that the House is fully aware of the substantial powers that APRA has to protect government funds.Of course, Australia's regulatory framework and APRA's powers have been recognised as being among the best in the world. APRA has the power to request any information from a deposit-taking institution and can direct the institution to do or not do anything in relation to the conduct of its business. This includes giving directions to an institution to correct its behaviour before a crisis happens. If an institution is likely to fail, APRA can organise a compulsory transfer of the business to another willing institution. APRA has the power to remove any director or senior manager from office or to direct the institution to undertake or not undertake various financial transactions. APRA may appoint itself as a statutory manager to replace the management of a distressed institution.The government has given APRA even further powers in this climate of uncertainty. APRA will be able to, if needed, more easily change the ownership of a bank by issuing new shares, selling shares or cancelling shares. This is important because, in times of distress, APRA will be able to strengthen the financial institution in question in a short period of time and avoid damage to deposit holders or the financial system more generally. In the unlikely event that an institution failed, the government through APRA would take control of the institution's insolvency. And, if the government is not fully compensated through the insolvency proceedings, a levy on financial institutions can be imposed to ensure taxpayers are not out of pocket due to the financial collapse.I am asked by the member for Isaacs if there is any criticism of these powers. I can report to the House that, despite all these powers and the strengthening of these powers by the government, the Leader of the Opposition continues to quibble as to whether the powers are strong enough. We saw this again last night in the latest instalment of Kath-and-Kim economics - also known as the Leader of the Opposition's address to the nation, his latest 'look at me' moment. Last night the Leader of the Opposition again said:_ we are concerned to ensure that safeguards are put in place so that Government guarantees offered to banks do not result in taxpayers picking up the tab for bank losses.That is what the Leader of the Opposition said last night, despite the fact that, in his speech to the House on the bill, he recognised the safeguards that are in place. It is the conviction politician saying one thing in the address to the nation and saying anything in the House to gain popularity.I am also asked about criticisms of government actions. As the Treasurer has outlined to the House, last night the Leader of the Opposition criticised the government for not predicting this crisis, despite just a few weeks ago saying that nobody could have predicted this crisis. Even the American version of Kath and Kim had more credibility than the Leader of the Opposition last night; it was a joke. But it gets worse. This morning, the member for Aston went one better. The member for Aston, the member for Higgins's campaign director, went on Sky's Agenda with the member for Rankin and said this: 'The member for Higgins has been warning of the financial tsunami for some months.' We know he is the campaign director for the member for Higgins, and he is still at it, saying the member for Higgins has been warning of a tsunami for some months. In fairness, the member for Higgins did talk about a financial tsunami last year. There is only one problem: he was talking about and predicting a tsunami arising out of policy decisions made in China. This is what the member for Higgins said on 26 October last year:_ the day they - referring to the Chinese - decide to float their currency, you will get a huge reversal of financial flows around the globe which will affect all exchange rates. That is why I compare it to a tsunami.Mr Speaker, through you, with the greatest of respect, can I send a memo to the opposition: China has not floated the yen - that is not the cause of the international crisis. -  - China has not floated its currency. I do not blame the member for Higgins -  - for not predicting this crisis, but they should not pretend that he did. - We do not blame the member for Higgins for not predicting this crisis, but we do blame the member for Aston for claiming credit for the member for Higgins for predicting something he did not - for predicting that the Chinese would float their currency -  -  - Yuan is what the Chinese currency is called - and then claiming, in hindsight, that he knew it was coming. I do not know what is worse on the other side: the Leader of the Opposition claiming to see the future or the member for Higgins refusing to acknowledge the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for her question. She will be very delighted, as will her constituents, to know that the Senate, just before we commenced question time today, passed the Medicare levy surcharge bill. This means that working families earning under $140,000 or singles earning under $70,000 will get immediate tax relief as a result of these measures. Two hundred and fifty thousand Australians will receive these immediate tax cuts and for many people it will be $1,200 and $1,300 that is very much needed for working families at this time. At a time of economic uncertainty, an agreement having been reached in the Senate provides certainty to these hundreds of thousands of Australians. At a time of tight family budgets, it gives those families the choice about how they will spend their money. And at a time when economic stimulus is needed, it is putting money back in the pockets of 250,000 - one quarter of a million - Australians. And at a time when there is, of course, importance in a strong budget surplus, this is delivering $380 million to the budget bottom line. But as I have said, perhaps most importantly this bill removes an unfair tax trap for every Australian earning under $70,000 and every family earning less than $140,000 - not just today, with the measure being passed in the Senate, but into the future. The new Medicare levy surcharge thresholds will be indexed for wages growth, meaning that the community will never again be able to be stuck in the tax trap created by the previous government.I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of senators from the minor parties: the Greens, Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding. They have been very constructive and reasonable in their discussions. I do have to say that it is a bit remarkable - and in some ways disturbing - that these senators have shown much appreciation of the economic circumstances that we are in, and much preparedness to discuss a sensible resolution of this matter, when the Liberals have had no such inclination at any time. At this time of great global economic uncertainty, Senators Xenophon and Fielding and the Greens have recognised the need for economic responsibility - something that the Liberals seem incapable of doing.I do want to remark that it seems to me that the vote in the other place earlier today has really highlighted a problem for the parliament. The problem is that those opposite us, even at a time of global economic uncertainty, are more interested in giving tax cuts to the alcohol industry than they are in giving tax cuts to working families. I am proud of this measure, and people on this side of the House will be delighted that we are providing relief to many thousands of Australians - something that the Rudd government has long argued for and will always stand behind.</DOC>

No Treasurer would do that. These arrangements will be developed by the Treasury.

 - Australia is facing very powerful downward pressures on our economy from the global financial crisis and the knock-on consequences that are beginning to ripple through the global economy, and Australia is not immune from the influences that are emerging from this trend. The government has taken decisive action in response to these developments to push back against those downward pressures on the Australian economy, particularly by injecting a $10 billion Economic Security Strategy stimulus into economic activity but also by guaranteeing bank deposits and guaranteeing wholesale lending to Australian banks and financial institutions in order to ensure that their activity can continue, and these are of course added to the stimulatory impact that is already beginning to flow from interest rate reductions by the Reserve Bank and the decline in the value of the Australian dollar. The impact of these things of course does not flow instantaneously but it does gradually move throughout the economy.It is vital that this strategy does receive broad support from within the community and it is important that people do not talk down the Australian economy. I note with some interest that the opposition appears to be trying to have it both ways on this issue. It wants to have people believe that it supports the government's Economic Security Strategy and it wants to have people believe that it supports the payments that are being made to pensioners, to carers and to families as part of that strategy; yet, at the same time, it wants to unpick that strategy and it wants to convince Australians that that strategy is actually bad economic policy. It wants to walk both sides of the street. It wants to both support the package and attack it at the same time.In the opposition leader's address to the nation, he made the following statements:With the benefit of hindsight, government should have acted a lot earlier.And:_ Mr Rudd's government missed the warning signs at the beginning of the year - about the global financial crisis. This statement stands in stark contrast to earlier statements, only very recent, by the Leader of the Opposition. On 30 September he said:There is nobody -  - On 30 September the opposition leader said:There is nobody that would have predicted these events a year ago or even a few months ago.The following day, on 1 October, he said:_ events of the last few weeks would not have been predicted a few months ago.So the position that the opposition leader is taking with respect to the government's approach to the global financial crisis is that the government could not have known but it should have known. That is the net effect of his position - walking both sides of the street, saying that nobody could have known yet the government should have known. The opposition leader has in effect created a new category of soothsayer. Some people think they can see into the future. Well, he has gone one better: he can see into the past - absolutely sensational!If I were the Leader of the Opposition, I would not focus too heavily on the past because, for example, he might discover that the government of which he was an integral player was advised no fewer than seven times over the course of the past seven years that it should consider enacting some kind of protection, some kind of insurance, for depositors in Australian banks and financial institutions. This advice came from, amongst others, the Financial Stability Forum, APRA, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the International Monetary Fund and the Council of Financial Regulators. So if we were to look into the past, as the opposition leader seems to suggest, we might find that his recent posturing, his recent suggestion that the government was not doing enough to protect deposits in Australian banks, stands in stark contrast to the actions of his own government when confronted on numerous occasions by the key regulators in our economy with the proposal that something should be done on this, when nothing was indeed done by a government that he was an integral part of.In conclusion, the opposition's approach to dealing with the government's economic security strategy is straightforward. It wants to be all things to all people. It wants to walk both sides of the street. It wants to make it up on the spot to support the individual payments, because it knows that they are well received in the community, but to undermine the overall strategy being put forward by of the government. It does not care. The Leader of the Opposition does not care whether what he says today is the direct opposite of what he said yesterday.People in this country want clear, responsible, sound and consistent economic management and if you cannot deliver clear, responsible, sound and consistent economic policy in opposition, they will judge that you are not capable of delivering clear, sound and consistent management in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. I know that he has been interested in the policy area of occupational health and safety for a long time. It has been a long-sought-after policy goal to have uniform occupational health and safety laws in this country - something that people have wanted for a long time. Why? Because it would be better for business; in particular, it would be better for those 39,000 businesses that operate across state boundaries to be able to have all of their workforce under the same occupational health and safety regime. That is just common sense. It would be better for working people if there were uniform high standards around the country, because we know that, tragically, 300 Australians are killed at work each year and over 140,000 Australians are injured at work each year, costing the economy $34 billion and bringing tragedy to the people involved in those injuries and the family members of those who are lost at work.In July this year COAG had a breakthrough. After years - indeed, decades - of this kind of reform being talked about, COAG agreed to an intergovernmental agreement to get on with the job of ensuring occupational health and safety laws are uniform around the country. It had an agreed end point, model laws, model regulations, model codes and an agreed time frame; and, importantly, it had agreement for the creation of a new body, to be known as Safe Work Australia, to guide this process. The legislation to create this new body is before this parliament. Amazingly, the Liberal Party are on a strategy to frustrate this legislation and prevent it passing the parliament. They know that this legislation is the product of an intergovernmental agreement and that we have a best endeavours clause to deliver the legislation so it matches the intergovernmental agreement, and they are on a strategy to frustrate it. In particular, they are moving amendments to increase the number of representatives from the employer organisations and the number of representatives from the unions.When the Liberal Party first moved those amendments it did seem to me that that was a very strange thing for the Liberal Party to do, given they had spent the best part of a decade or more trying to destroy the Australian trade union movement. I thought that that was a very unusual thing for them to do. But I am in a position to advise the House why they are going on this strategy, because I have had come into my possession the shadow cabinet brief that was taken to their shadow cabinet dealing with this legislation. It is marked 'shadow cabinet in confidence'. It makes abundantly clear why they are moving these amendments. It says:The Coalition should propose amendments to the bill to alter the membership of Safe Work Australia, increasing the number of representatives submitted by each social partner to 3 from 2. This may also assist in defeating future policy proposals by State or Federal Labor.That is, they are deliberately moving these amendments to derail the occupational health and safety harmonisation process. They are so desperate for political advantage that a reform that business wants, a reform that working people want, they will stand in the way of because they are about playing politics.Who endorses this reform? The Business Council does. The Australian Mines and Metals Association does. Indeed, it is No. 1 on the Business Council of Australia agenda for deregulation, and here they are with their mind-numbingly petty politics with amendments deliberately calculated and designed to derail this process. The Leader of the Opposition is a man who seeks to present himself to the Australian community as someone who knows about business. He is seeking to present himself to the Australian community as a merchant banker who is therefore an expert in the ways of business. I believe this is a test of the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition. Is he going to allow an objective as important as having harmonised occupational health and safety laws in this country to be derailed by the petty politics of his shadow cabinet and his shadow minister or is he going to instruct his shadow minister to withdraw from this strategy and pass this bill unamended? It is a test of leadership for the Leader of the Opposition. This is a man who walks both sides of the street. One day he is in support of the Economic Security Strategy of the government; the next day he is against it. One day he is for pensioner relief; apparently now he is against it. One day he is working in the interests of Australian families; now he opposes them getting payments. - This is a man walking both sides of the street not only on the major economic package before the nation this week but also on this important reform of occupational health and safety. I am asking the Leader of the Opposition: does he believe in this reform and will he instruct his shadow minister to stop frustrating it for these petty political motivations.</DOC>

 - The government congratulates Bonnie Babes for the significant contribution they provide for families affected by the loss of a baby through miscarriage, through stillbirth or through premature death in the case of kids and related issues such as infertility. They do a very good job. The government also congratulates them for their contribution to providing medical equipment for the care of premature babies and their support for research. The government is strongly committed to improving maternity services to ensure that quality care is provided to mothers and their babies. At the same time, the government recognises that pregnancy and childbirth can result in often tragic outcomes for women and their families. That is why the government is committed to the development of a national maternity services plan, which is being led by the newly-appointed Commonwealth Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer, Ms Rosemary Bryant.The maternity services review will consider a broader range of concerns relating to maternity services, including possible support for maternity related counselling and psychosocial support services and research into all aspects of maternity care. Key stakeholders and the public have been invited to participate in the review by written submission and we intend to make sure that we get the policy in this area absolutely right. In recognition of the importance of peer and social support in this process, the final forum of this particular inquiry will focus on peer and social support in the perinatal period and will be held on 24 October. I am pleased that Bonnie Babes will be represented at that forum.What I would say to the House is that this is a very sensitive area and we are absolutely determined as a government to get it right. That is why the Minister for Health and Ageing has commissioned the maternity services review. That is why we have the Commonwealth Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer actively engaged in this process. We will get it right. And the allocation of government funding will therefore follow the recommendations of her inquiry into this matter to make sure that we get it right for the future.No member of this House regards stillbirth and the problems of premature child death in any way as a matter to be taken lightly. We want to make sure that we get this absolutely right. That is why the health minister and others have commissioned this as an appropriate course of action. Once the recommendations have come to the government we will act, and act comprehensively across the complete delivery of these services for the nation and each community within the nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Canberra for her question. As all members of the House know, the member for Canberra does an outstanding job for carers and, I must say, people with a disability not only in her own electorate but in many parts of the country. Carers and people with a disability got some great news from the government this week - some 470,000 people on carer allowance will get $1,000; 130,000 people on the carer payment and more than 700,000 people on the disability support pension will receive $1,400 if they are single people, and couples will receive $2,100. This is great news for all of those people with a disability or people who are carers. This is a down payment on our long-term pension reform and is part of our economic security package. We know that we need to provide much needed support to those people who are having trouble making ends meet. We also want to sustain economic growth.We have seen some very supportive comments from carer organisations and from organisations representing people with disabilities. The Chief Executive Officer of Carers Australia, Joan Hughes, said earlier in the week:'This is an important victory for all those left out of previous proposals,' _ 'The announcement will provide desperately needed relief for Australia's hardest-working families.'Just recently I was in Adelaide, where I met one of those hardworking families - in fact a woman who typifies the types of people who will benefit from the government's strategy. Dianne is a grandmother. She is a carer for 15-year-old Nick. She is living on the disability support pension and, of course, struggling to pay her bills. I spoke with Dianne on Tuesday to tell her the good news. Of course she already knew that this was the first time that she and more than 700,000 other people on the disability support pension would get a lump sum payment. In the past, under the previous government, these people, who have been finding it very difficult, were completely ignored. Dianne, I am pleased to say, will also receive additional family and carer payments for her and for Nick. Of course that will make the Christmas coming that much easier, both for her and for Nick.I was also asked about other comments that have been made. Earlier this week we saw comments from the Leader of the Opposition, who said in response to the Prime Minister's announcement of these very significant improvements for pensioners and for carers:_ we are not going to argue about the composition of the package or quibble about it.That is what he said on Tuesday. But last night the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on Lateline, put an end to any bipartisan support. Here is what she had to say:_ had we been in Government we may well have done things differently _She went on to say:_ we may well have looked at a different composition _We know what this means, because we know in their recent proposals they ignored the needs of carers, they ignored the needs of people on a disability support pension and they ignored the two million families who are going to be beneficiaries of the package that the government has announced. So if the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had had her way, 700,000 people who are dependent on the disability support pension would have missed out. They would have missed out, according to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Half a million carers would have missed out under the propositions of those opposite.And it seems that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is not alone. I know members on this side will not be surprised to hear that there are some strange remarks coming from the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Joyce. He has called giving support to four million pensioners and two million families 'a dangerous piece of policy'. I have yet to meet a pensioner or a carer who would think that it is dangerous to give them a little bit of extra help just before Christmas. The Leader of the Opposition wants to walk both sides of the street. On Tuesday he said that he wanted to support it without any quibble. By today we have the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying the exact opposite. By contrast, the government intends to give six million Australians - families, pensioners and carers - the support that they need.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. As the member is well aware, the private health insurance funds annually request increases if they think that they are justified. They will do that again, inevitably, at the end of this year, to be assessed and announced in the new year. That is the normal process and that will not change. We have made absolutely clear to the private health insurance funds that we will not regard favourably any requests that are based on the removal or changing of the threshold of the Medicare levy surcharge. - Don't you want to know the answer? - Of course, the other issue in the member's question which it is impossible for me to ignore is this concept that we are forcing the community to do anything. In fact, what we have delivered is some real choice to those people who are doing it tough to make a decision about how they might use an increasingly tight budget - something that those opposite never did when they were in government, leaving the threshold exactly where it was. So I am not going to take a lecture from the member opposite about choice - something they pretend they are about - when this measure is something that has returned choice to those working families and singles who are doing it tough. We are proud of this measure. We will look closely at any requests that come in at the end of the year and we will not look favourably on any that use this as an excuse for an increase in premiums.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Dobell for his question. The member for Dobell represents an area that is very fast growing. There are a lot of young families moving from Sydney up to Dobell, buying house and land packages, and I am sure he will see a lot more of them moving to his electorate as a result of this very important measure. This measure, as I described earlier in the week, is a very important measure in very difficult economic circumstances. It is a $1Â½ billion investment that doubles the first home buyers grant for existing properties and triples it for newly built properties, and it has received very favourable support from a number of sectors. In the finance sector, Craig James, the CommSec Chief Equities Economist, said:We certainly welcome the government's move to boost housing construction. Australia's population is growing at the fastest rate in almost 20 years but construction hasn't been keeping pace. The incentives for first home buyers to build new homes or buy newly erected homes represents a major and much-needed boost for house construction.But it is not just the finance sector that has welcomed this move. The housing industry is already reporting an increase in interest, activity and employment in the housing sector. We have been receiving calls from builders in my office telling us that they are going to start laying slabs and building houses as a result of this measure. Dr Ron Silberberg, the managing director of the HIA, said today:Thanks to the tripling of FHOG for new housing, major builders have told HIA that they will now curtail further job retrenchments _ Building product manufacturers will be looking to re-open plant and move from a 4-day to 5-day operating week.There have been reports from all over the country. Udo Jattke, one of Queensland's largest builders, is reported in the Cairns Post as saying, 'It is bloody great news,' and that, instead of shedding staff, he would be rehiring. Len Blakeney of the Master Builders Association in Newcastle said in the Newcastle Herald that the measure will 'give the region's building industry a much-needed shot in the arm'.The residential construction industry is a very important part of our whole economy and it has a significant multiplier effect. The real estate industry are also reporting increased interest. Colin Lake, the sales manager of the Cornish Group of home builders in Camden, said in the Daily Telegraph:We've had an instant response in just the past two days and the phones have been running hot with younger buyers asking how they can make it work.First home buyers have been coming into our office which is unusual for us as it's usually only second and third home buyers that can afford a new home.My office has had an enormous number of calls and emails about this measure. I want to take the opportunity to reassure members and the Australian public that the Treasurer has written very promptly to the states and territories to make sure that these new benefits are available as quickly as possible. Applicants will have 12 months after settlement or completion of their new home to apply, providing that the contract they signed was signed between 14 October 2008 and 30 June 2009. They will have 12 months after the completion of their home to receive that money.This measure has been enormously well received by potential homebuyers, members of the finance sector, builders and people who are hoping to move into their own homes. It is a very important measure in very difficult economic times.</DOC>

 - The government is concerned about the proper delivery of health services and hospital services across the nation. That is why the government, with the states and the territories, in the middle of November will be determining the future shape of the Australian healthcare agreement. I say to those opposite before they jump in and make a short-term political and opportunistic remark that the reason that is important is as follows: the government of which they were part - and so many of them sat around the cabinet table, including the member for Wentworth - pulled billions of dollars out of the public hospital system in the country. You did it systematically. As a consequence, what you - the previous government - did over time was push responsibility onto the states and territories -  - The previous government simply absented the field, pulled billions of dollars out of the public hospital system in the country, pushed that responsibility onto the states and territories and then played the blame game. That is exactly what they did - year in, year out.This government takes a different approach because Australians want an answer to this problem. They do not want excuses for inaction. That is why the government has sat down these last nine months with the states and territories, through the agency of the Minister for Health and Ageing and with the Treasurer, to go through the future shape of the Australian healthcare agreement for the following five years. That will go to a proper role for Commonwealth funding into the future. That is the responsible course of action. We intend to prosecute it, rather than simply pull money out of the system and say, 'It's all over to you.'The individual management of hospitals within any particular state, including those to which the honourable member has just referred, is of course an operational responsibility for the state health authority concerned. -  - It is. -  - They are very excited this afternoon, Mr Speaker. - The Commonwealth's responsibility is to ensure that proper funding levels are delivered to the states, who run the health system. Secondly, I am not familiar with the details of the individual management practices in the state health authority of New South Wales as they apply to the hospital which the honourable member is concerned about. Of course, there are problems with the administration of certain hospitals across the country, including in New South Wales. We fully accept that, but the bottom line for the Commonwealth is to ensure that there is a proper forward funding stream for the states, who run the hospital system. I suggest the honourable member get behind the government's program of delivering proper funding to the states long term so that these hospitals within state health authorities can have certainty about their funding stream into the future.This is a complex area of public policy. There are 750-plus public hospitals across this country. Each of them is administered separately by state and territory health authorities but, you know something, the bottom line is to make sure that the Commonwealth is in there as part of the solution, not simply perpetuating the blame game, as those opposite under repeated health ministers did for 12 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wills for his question and for his ongoing interest in infrastructure. Indeed, infrastructure is a key part of the Economic Security Strategy of the government's response to the global financial crisis which was outlined by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer just on Tuesday. This is a strategy to have Commonwealth involvement in the delivery of our roads, our railways, our ports, our urban transport systems and our communications networks. Importantly, we established Infrastructure Australia to ensure that proper cost-benefit analysis was brought to the assessment of the nation's infrastructure needs and the merits of individual projects. Indeed, we have announced that the priority list from Infrastructure Australia will be brought forward by more than three months to December this year.But, of course, we have not sat around waiting for this report. In the budget we brought forward some half a billion dollars worth of projects that were not scheduled to start until the following financial year - projects such as the Townsville port access road and projects right around the country including in Bunbury and Perth. And shortly we will be introducing legislation to set up the Building Australia Fund. So the government has a very clear plan when it comes to infrastructure development and nation building as an important component of ensuring that we build in a plan for securing long-term prosperity and dealing with the capacity constraints that were, of course, identified by the Reserve Bank on more than 20 separate occasions.The opposition's approach has been characterised by inconsistencies and partisan political games. Indeed, when the merchant of Venice was hunting down the member for Bradfield to become the Leader of the Opposition - hunting him down, day in, day out - he was saying that the then Leader of the Opposition was doing damage to the Liberal Party brand because he was damaging their economic credentials. Remember the criticism about budget measures and the opposition leader's -  - There are indeed threats to the government's nation-building agenda, and they are personified by those opposite in this chamber and by their colleagues in the Senate. We know that just three weeks ago the shadow minister was threatening to block the Building Australia Fund legislation. But that did not come as a surprise from the shadow minister, given that the now Leader of the Opposition stated, as part of his response to the Rudd government's budget, that the Building Australia Fund and nation building was 'the greatest con of all'. That was what he stated at the time about infrastructure development and nation building.On Tuesday of this week, the shadow minister changed the positioning - if you watch them for long enough, you always get both sides of the street, usually at the same time. But at this stage, on Tuesday this week - it will probably change by next week - the shadow minister said:_ the Coalition has never said, at any time, that we will block any infrastructure legislation.Well, they actually voted against it when the Infrastructure Australia legislation came before the parliament. They said that it was just all a con and that it was not real economic reform. And, of course, we know from their inaction in government that they did nothing about this for 12 long years.When it comes to tackling issues such as urban congestion, which the government has identified as one of the priorities, we know that the opposition also cannot agree with itself on the way forward. The former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bradfield, had the following to say in September:Well we always look favourably on investment in public transport.I thought that was a pretty positive sign from the then opposition leader. Probably one of the reasons why they knocked him over was that he was being positive about nation building. That was a mistake, clearly, by the member for Bradfield. So I went back and had a look at whether there was any form from the merchant of Venice before he became the Leader of the Opposition. - Indeed, there is some form there, because he said in 2006: 'Urban public transport is unequivocally within the state governments' bailiwick. The public know who is responsible.' We on this side of the House actually think there is a role for national leadership when it comes to infrastructure, including on issues of urban infrastructure. Those opposite are a threat to the Australian economy. They constantly change their positions. They have been totally inconsistent since the government's announcement on Tuesday about the Economic Security Strategy, on each and every element of that strategy. Whether it be the payments to pensioners and carers, whether it be the issue of increases in skills or whether it be the nation-building agenda of the government, they try to take both sides of the street.We know that the Leader of the Opposition stands for nothing except himself. That is the only thing on which he is consistent. We on this side of the House stand for nation building. We will continue to pursue the agenda as part of securing our economic future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question and note her special interest as her grandfather, Oliver Hoskin, served at Fromelles, which, as we are aware, was a dreadful battle. You will recall, Mr Speaker, that that was a battle on 19 July 1916 in which 5,533 Australian soldiers were casualties and 2,000 of them were dead within 12 hours of battle. I am pleased to inform the House that we have made significant progress in relation to the exhumation and reburial, with full military honours, of those brave souls who lost their lives in that tragic battle.After advice from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, and discussions with my French counterpart, Jean-Marie Bockel, and then British minister Derek Twigg, we agreed upon a new site and a process for building a new cemetery. This cemetery is about 400 to 500 metres away from the current site at Pheasant Wood. It has been offered up to us by the local community. Whilst in France recently, I met with their representatives, who were particularly concerned to make sure that we understood their commitment to this process. The mayor, Hubert Huchette, was most impressive in his support for the proposal. I met Madame de Massiet. You will recall, Mr Speaker, that Madame de Massiet owns a property at Pheasant Wood where the soldiers currently lie. I thanked her for the donation of that property. Once these exhumations and reburials take place, there will be a memorial at that site.The French minister was very supportive of the proposal, as was Derek Twigg. We agreed upon not only a site for the cemetery but also a timetable for its development. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission have the responsibility on our behalf of issuing tenders for the cemetery. They will concurrently issue a tender process for the exhumations. We will then rebury the soldiers individually in caskets with full military honours.We have had significant support from a range of people who should be acknowledged, apart from those I have already mentioned. One who has been significant has been Lord Faulkner, Chairman of the British All-Party Parliamentary War Graves and Battlefields Heritage Group of the British parliament. He was at Fromelles the day I was there. I have already observed the plans the Commonwealth War Graves Commission officials have for this new cemetery and they are very impressive indeed. I should say, for those who have been to Fromelles or VC Corner - as my colleague the Minister for Veterans' Affairs will be doing in the near future - that this new cemetery will be on high ground very close to the outskirts of the community, opposite the church and overlooking VC Corner. So it is a very good site.The support we have been given goes so far as the French military. General Montford, who is the military commander of the Lille region, has been very supportive and we think and hope that he will be providing us with some assistance in the months ahead. The GUARD archaeologists, the Glasgow University archaeological team, were the ones responsible for doing the initial research for us at Pheasant Wood. Dr Tony Pollard was at Fromelles when I was there and I was able to thank him for the work that he has done, as was Mr Peter Barton, who has been employed by us and the British government to do research in Munich on ways in which we might identify precisely which soldiers are buried at this site.We are anticipating, all going well, that we will commence this work at Fromelles in the next northern summer. We hope that, on the basis we are successful with the exhumations, we will be able to have a ceremony on the site at least by 19 July 2010. That would be a significant event which I am sure would grab the interest of all Australians as we finally bury properly these at least 400 souls, of whom we believe 170 or thereabouts are Australian soldiers.Unfortunately, as is the way with these things, three or four days after I left England, Mr Twigg was no longer the minister. Nevertheless, I am assured of the British government's continuing support. I have written to the new minister, Kevan Jones, and expect to finalise all remaining issues in the coming weeks.</DOC>

 - Honourable members will be aware of the devastation that was caused last year by the outbreak of equine influenza and will be pleased to see the racing industry getting back on its feet and doing well again as we now move into the Spring Racing Carnival season. A couple of weeks ago I referred to a test that had come out as a positive for some horses that were in quarantine. I indicated at the time that it was likely to be a false positive. It is important to advise the House that this did turn out to be a fact. Each of the 74 horses in the quarantine station was tested using 14 different procedures before they were all given a clean bill of health.We still have some horses at the moment in the quarantine facilities. In fact, nine internationals are at Sandown at the moment preparing to compete in the racing carnival. One of them is the Irish champion horse Septimus, trained by Aidan O'Brien. The Spring Racing Carnival is not just held in the capital cities. The member for Page, who asked me the question, not long ago was kind enough to invite me to the Ballina Cup Race Day, which last year was not able to be run on the usual day. Regional members will understand just how important those race days are, both for enthusiasm for the local economy and for the local community. Ballina Cup Race Day is also a half-day holiday for workers in Ballina and provides a major economic boost for the region.As we now move into the period for the Spring Racing Carnival, the preparations behind the scenes continue, even though some of the races have already begun. In particular, we move with great enthusiasm towards the race that stops the nation, the Melbourne Cup. This is a particularly important day for me as someone who was born on Melbourne Cup Day when Rain Lover won the cup. I am certainly looking forward to the opportunity this year when hopefully, once again, we will see Efficient win the cup.</DOC>

 - The government indicated prior to the last election that we would reduce tax as a proportion of GDP. We have honoured that in the budget which has been delivered. That is an important commitment. Secondly, in terms of the maintenance of the surplus for the future, we have said consistently that our commitment is to bring about a budget surplus across the economic cycle, and that remains our commitment - from prior to the election to the future. The government has no intention to bring in other taxes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. The global financial crisis has an impact not just on credit markets around the world but on stock markets and, through stock markets and credit markets, on the real economy. That means growth and that means jobs and therefore that affects communities everywhere.There was more evidence over the weekend that the United States economy is slowing dramatically. A prominent measure of US consumer confidence, the University of Michigan index, fell to 57.5 from 70.3 in October. This was the biggest decline ever recorded in the 30-year history of the index. US housing started to drop by 6.7 per cent in September, which was the lowest level since January 1991, and US building permits fell by 8.3 per cent in September to a new 26-year low. There is also more evidence that we see of some slowing in the Chinese economy. A Bloomberg survey of economists showed that China's economy is expected to grow at a slower pace in almost four years in the third quarter of 2008 - that is, the quarter we are currently in. Of importance, though, for Australians concerned about China's future growth trajectory is a significant statement made on 15 October by the Governor of the People's Bank of China, Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, who said, in referring to his own country, that policymakers needed to do more to boost domestic consumption in the world's fourth biggest economy. The future shape of fiscal policy in China will be as important for us as the future shape of monetary policy building on the recent 27-basis-point reduction and Chinese interest rates, given the significance of China to the global economy but, in particular, to this economy.Recent developments in the global economy point to the importance of early and decisive action in dealing with the challenges which all countries around the world face. Policies act with a lag, and that is why governments around the world need to be ahead of the curve as much as possible. For example, I refer to recent comments by President Bush delivered to the US Chamber of Commerce referring to the impact of the measures recently introduced by the United States government. He said:The actions will take more time to have their full impact. It took a while for the credit system to freeze up; it's going to take a while for the credit system to thaw.The same is true in Australia. Monetary policy acts with a lag, with its full effects felt some time after rate cuts are announced, and it will also take time for credit markets to bounce back. This underlines the importance for the government to have acted recently, decisively and early on the question of fiscal policy, providing additional stimulus to the Australian economy. Of course, we have seen liquidity action already taken by the RBA through its recent 100-basis-point reduction. The government have also implemented a range of measures recommended by the Financial Stability Forum, but our Economic Security Strategy announced less than a week ago goes to the important role to be played by fiscal policy in providing necessary stimulus to the Australian economy at a time of significant global financial crisis. This package is designed not just to boost growth in the national economy but also to provide assistance to Australian households - pensioners, carers, seniors and families - while also making life more manageable for first home buyers as well as increasing training places and accelerating our nation-building agenda. I note comments by the President of the BCA recently, who stated that the government's package was 'well timed, well targeted and temporary', and that is exactly how the government has intended it.We have acted early across a range of policy fronts to help stabilise financial markets, to reassure depositors, to guarantee bank funding, to strengthen households and to strengthen the overall national economy. We have done these things early and decisively and according to a plan so that they take effect before the full force of the global financial crisis hits Australia. The beneficiaries of these actions range across small businesses and, from our recent discussions as ministers and in our collaboration with the business community last Friday in Sydney, it is quite plain that businesses, including small businesses, are facing real problems in terms of being able to access credit, which is why the government moved so early on the question of providing a guarantee to banks for their term funding requirements in order to assist in freeing up credit arrangements. Secondly, the government has also acted in relation to the housing sector. The most recent data on housing is disturbing. Since the end of last year building approvals have fallen by nearly 17 per cent. In the state of New South Wales, house approvals remained at a 44-year low. On top of that, other households have been assisted by this package - pensioners, carers, those on the DSP, widows and veterans.These measures are designed to provide additional assistance to the Australian economy at a time when the full impact of the global financial crisis is yet to be felt across growth, across jobs and across the rest of the activity in our economy - hence the importance of acting early and acting effectively. We have done so by deliberately reducing the surplus which we crafted out of the May budget, we have done so in a manner which is responsible given the challenges that we face in providing necessary stimulus for the Australian economy going forward and we have done so responsibly by ensuring that we can deliver the next budget outcome within the framework of a comfortable budget surplus.On Friday the Treasurer, the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy and I, as indicated before, met in Sydney with representatives of Australian business at an event hosted by the Australian Industry Group. I am pleased to announce that on Friday of this week the government will be hosting a meeting in Brisbane involving small business and representatives of small business organisations as well. - I notice the member for North Sydney finds that funny. The purpose of the government's engagement with business and with the general community is to continue engaging with business and those at the coalface of experiencing what has been a significant slowdown in the delivery of global credit. That is why the government has acted. As I have said before, the government remains determined to act further in the future as is necessary - firstly, to ensure the continued stability of the Australian financial system and, secondly, to ensure that we continue to deliver additional support for growth in this economy and what will be a troubled and difficult time ahead.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. We are experiencing one of the most significant upheavals in financial markets since the Great Depression. The global financial crisis is affecting financial markets right around the world, including in Australia. More than 25 banks around the world have failed or have been bailed out, and global stock markets have seen very significant losses. This crisis is contributing to a serious slowdown in global growth. Obviously these difficulties will impact here. Growth will slow and unemployment will rise. We have been upfront about that from the very beginning.It pays to remind ourselves what the IMF had to say only a week or so ago:The world economy is entering a major downturn in the face of the most dangerous financial shock in mature financial markets since the 1930s _ The major advanced economies are already in or close to recession _This is not my assessment. It is the assessment of the IMF and it is also the assessment of finance ministers of the G7 and the G20, but of course the Leader of the Opposition says they have got it all wrong. Yesterday on Insiders, he said this assessment was 'hyped up'. - That is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition - old motormouth over there - said. In the face of all of this evidence and in the face of the Leader of the Opposition saying that he supported our stimulus package in full, he went on television yesterday saying it was just hyped up. This shows how dangerously out of touch the Leader of the Opposition is with Australian families and, of course, with Australian business. He has no idea about the magnitude of this challenge before us and before the globe. He thinks the crisis is overhyped and, if he thinks it is overhyped, he does not necessarily agree with the solution.This morning he was interviewed by Alan Jones and he said that he did not necessarily support the payments to families. He thought that what would perhaps be better would be some sort of general tax cut spread thinly across a wider range of people. This shows he does not actually understand what we are doing or why we are doing it, because the family payments are directly targeted to be paid in a lump sum before Christmas. That is a very important part of what needs to be done, given the magnitude of the challenge that is before us.The Leader of the Opposition wants to have it both ways. He wants to say he supports the package, then he wants to turn around to say the problem is hyped up and then he wants to disagree with the individual measures. Listening to the Leader of the Opposition, it reminds me of that old saying of Mark Twain's: 'All you need in life is ignorance and confidence.' He has it in spades.</DOC>

 - First and foremost, the government stands behind its Economic Security Strategy as announced last week, as the government stands behind - unequivocally, as opposed to those opposite - the statements made by me on behalf of the government the previous Sunday to provide guarantees to depositors and to provide guarantees for term lending on the part of banks in order to unfreeze credit. We in the government have proposed these as concrete courses of action - decisions taken by the government, unequivocally supported by the government, as opposed to the 'bob each way' approach being adopted by those opposite. That is basically what it is - on the one hand a bit of a shuffle over here from the Leader of the Opposition saying, in a half spirit of small 'b' bipartisanship, yes in extremis; on the other hand, unleashing the various dogs of war on the part of those opposite to have a chip away at the housing policy, to have a chip away at pensioners and to have a chip away at family tax benefit A, and now we have a chip away at the actual underpinnings of the package.I say to the member for Curtin that the underpinnings of this package are clear. Growth, as of when the government determined on the package, was projected ahead to be plus two; therefore the government decided on the basis of the revision downwards in growth in the IMF world forecast, on top of the collapse in consumer confidence in the world, that we needed an extra buffer for growth for the future. That is why we acted in the way in which we have done. We have done so decisively, and I would call on the member for Curtin, rather than having a bob each way - rather than being politically opportunistic one day and trying to be statespersonlike the next day - to get behind the government, because what this nation now needs is real bipartisanship, real consensus and real support, as opposed to walking both sides of the street, which those opposite have elevated from an art form into a science.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Dawson for his question and for his ongoing and very strong support for small businesses. I am delighted to be able to join him on 3 November at a luncheon being hosted by the Mackay Chamber of Commerce and business.Small business is usually the first to feel the effects of an economic downturn. Our Economic Security Strategy will inject $10.4 billion into the Australian economy and that will boost consumer spending, to the benefit of Australian small businesses. The Reserve Bank's decision to cut the official cash rate by one percentage point will both stimulate the economy and help reduce small business borrowing costs. The Rudd government's decision to guarantee bank deposits and term funding arrangements has helped keep credit flowing to small businesses, though we obviously acknowledge that there are some difficulties there in the midst of this crisis.Yesterday's decision by the National Australia Bank to cut its variable rate for small business lending takes the reduction in small business borrowing costs from Australia's largest lender to small businesses to a total of at least 1.2 percentage points. In announcing yesterday's decision by the National Australia Bank, its Executive Director, Ahmed Fahour, said:While our current cost of funds remain at a historical high, policy measures announced by the Australian Government earlier this month have started to have a positive impact on the credit market.We welcome this new development and anticipate that we will see some relief in the significantly higher premium we are currently paying for wholesale funds. Should this be the case, then we hope to be in a position where we can pass on further interest rate cuts to our customers.That would be further good news for small businesses. What the executive director of the National Australia Bank did yesterday was to lodge a vote of confidence in the government's policies announced in response to the financial crisis.I am delighted that the Prime Minister and I will be hosting a small business summit on the global financial crisis in Brisbane on this Friday, 24 October. The summit will also be attended by the Treasurer and by the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, so it will be the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law and me as small business minister. The summit is being organised in collaboration with the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, COSBOA, and with Commerce Queensland. Small business organisations around Australia and individual small businesses will be invited to share with the Prime Minister and economic ministers their experiences during these challenging economic times. We are also inviting the major banks so that they can set out their lending policies for small businesses and engage with the small business community.The Rudd government is committed to supporting Australia's small businesses through this financial crisis. The government greatly appreciates the contribution of Australia's 1.9 million small businesses in creating prosperity for themselves and their families and in generating jobs for nearly four million Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. As he would be aware, I have said to this House before - indeed, I have said it now on a number of occasions - that the unemployment forecast contained in the May budget was for unemployment to reach 4Â¾ per cent by the June quarter 2009, June next year. As I have indicated in this House previously - indeed, as recently as last week - the government have indicated that we expect as a result of the global financial crisis and its feed-through into the real economy that we will see unemployment rates higher than the predicted 4Â¾ per cent. As I have also indicated in this House previously, including as recently as last week, the updated forecasts will be available in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which will be released next month.I also indicate to the member who asked the question that the government has acted proactively on this issue. One of the main parts of the Economic Security Strategy released last week was 56,000 new productivity places. They are there deliberately. We obviously want Australians who are outside the labour force to be able to get the vital skills that they need to get into those parts of the economy where skills are still in demand. People would of course know, looking at the Australian economy today, that there are many sections of the Australian economy where employers find it difficult to get skilled labour. They would hire people if they had people presenting with the skills they need. Our Productivity Places Program throughout has been targeted at areas of skills shortage. It has been successful, with very high demand for the places. Some of the people who have taken those places have already completed their training and gone on to get a job. Making the 56,000 additional productivity places available is a proactive response to the circumstances that we find ourselves in with the global financial crisis and its impact on the real economy and, most particularly, on employment in this nation. I also say to the member that 10,000 of the new productivity places will be used to assist particular industries or regions that are strongly impacted. So we will be there to assist with structural adjustment should that be required.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I am pleased to advise the House that the Future Fund is in good shape. I am particularly pleased to be able to table the Future Fund annual report 2007-08. There has been a degree of speculation about the state of the Future Fund in the course of the last six or eight months, given the extraordinary volatility that we have seen in share markets. I am pleased to be able to advise the House that, notwithstanding these pressures, the Future Fund has been performing well. Notwithstanding the extreme volatility in markets globally, the fund has generated a positive return of 1.5 per cent for the 2007-08 financial year. It is today announcing its interim estimate of returns for the September quarter. Those returns are slightly negative, so the net value of the Future Fund as at the end of September is fractionally lower than it was when it first began its full operations at the beginning of July last year. When I say fractionally, it is in the order of 0.2 per cent.This is a very significant and very positive result in the circumstances that the Future Fund has been dealing with, given the huge drops in share prices not only in Australian markets but also internationally - because a significant proportion of the Future Fund's investments is in international equities, not just Australian equities. There is every hope, of course, that these share price reductions will be corrected in the medium term. Given that the Future Fund is a long-term investment for the Australian people, it is important to note that it has in effect maintained its value in extraordinary circumstances. That value is, as at 30 September 2008, $63.4 billion, which includes approximately $8.2 billion in Telstra shares.The fund's equity exposures to stressed and failed financial institutions through its broad based, index related investments are about 0.1 per cent of its total portfolio. Exposure to failed institutions, such as Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual, total less than $100,000 out of that $63 billion as at the end of September 2008. The fund has no credit or equity derivative exposure to any financial institution, and the fund's investments in debt markets have been focused on debt securities issued by financial institutions and high-quality Australian residential mortgage backed securities. The majority of the Future Fund portfolio remains in cash. It is worth noting that, late last year, the board of the Future Fund made a very sound decision that it would proceed slowly into the equities market, given that in its assessment at the time the equities market was very fully priced. That proved to be a very sound decision. It is worth noting, finally, that Australians generally can draw upon the fact that the details of the Future Fund are broadly bipartisanly supported by both the opposition, the former government, and the government -  - I notice that the opposition are desperate to claim credit for anything that they can manage. After they claimed credit for recent interest rate reductions, I am waiting for them to claim credit for the NAB interest rate reduction that was announced yesterday. No doubt they will get around to that shortly. -  - It is only Monday. You are very touchy. I was about to make the point that, notwithstanding the extraordinary international financial circumstances that are buffeting Australia and causing great difficulty for our economy and notwithstanding the fact that the government and the opposition have many disagreements on many important issues with respect to the state of the economy, it is important to note that one very fundamental part of the government's balance sheet, which was created by the former government with the support of the then opposition, remains in good shape. - We voted for the legislation, Member for Higgins. You may not recall that but we actually voted for the legislation. Notwithstanding the inability of the opposition to maintain bipartisanship on virtually anything that it purports to be bipartisan on, it is a good thing for the Australian people that the Future Fund board and management, whose appointment I might add was welcomed by me as shadow finance minister at the time, has done a good job to date. I welcome the contents of its annual report. I welcome the performance of the Future Fund to date. The fact that it has held its value in extremely difficult circumstances is to the great credit of the people managing the fund and to the board of the fund.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. The member for Cook has in the past been a little equivocal about his support for the boost to the first home owners grant, so I take it that today his question implies that he is not in favour of the doubling of the grant for existing homes and the tripling of the grant for new homes. I would like to remind the member for Cook that one of the largest barriers to entering the first-home market for young Australian families and individuals is the difficulty in saving a deposit for most young people, particularly at the moment, when rents are so very high because of very low vacancy rates. - The member for Cook asks why vacancy rates are very low. They are very low because in your 12 years of government you did not do a single thing to support the construction of new homes in this country. That is why vacancy rates are low.It is very important that when people are making a decision about whether to enter the housing market they give very careful consideration to their ability to service a loan. Of course it is very important that they give consideration not just to their ability to service a loan today but to their ability to service a loan in the future, because circumstances change. Perhaps someone loses some hours at work; perhaps they lose a job; perhaps someone becomes pregnant earlier than they had thought - and even a happy event like that affects the earning capacity of a family. It is a very important when people are making a decision to take out a loan that they give careful consideration to what that loan will mean for them in the future.This is something that the government is also very well aware of. In fact, the government is taking steps to strengthen the regulation of mortgage providers, and earlier this month COAG agreed to transfer all consumer credit regulation to the Commonwealth. This means that by mid-2009 the Commonwealth will assume responsibility for the Uniform Consumer Credit Code and will extend it to include a requirement for lenders to lend responsibly and establish a licensing system that will license all credit providers, brokers and advisers, imposing comprehensive standards on market participants. So, as well as urging both new home buyers and lending institutions to carefully consider people's ability to repay, the measures that we are taking through the COAG process will strengthen the impetus on lenders to be cautious in their lending.The reason that we have increased the first home owners grant - we have doubled it on existing properties and tripled it on new homes - is that we are in very difficult financial and economic circumstance. We are in a once-in-a-lifetime situation in Australia. This measure is one that, frankly, I would not have supported a year ago, but the circumstances that we find ourselves in today, with very low construction rates in an area that is critical to the strength of our economy, are very much changed. Some young homebuyers feel that they have given up on the idea of ever owning their own home. For the sake of those young homebuyers, for the sake of the building and construction sector in Australia - an important sector in our economy and a big employer in our economy - and for the strength of the Australian economy, this is a very important measure in very difficult economic circumstances.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for his question. As he knows, last week there was good news for many, many Australian families. Those families will get a big helping hand as part of the government's $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy. Those families who receive family tax benefit part A will receive $1,000 for each eligible child in their care. In Isaacs, that will mean 10,800 families will receive $1,000 for every single eligible child in their care. Three-quarters of all Australian families with dependent children will receive the payment, totalling $3.9 billion.It is certainly the case that families around Australia have been welcoming the payment. In the Australian last week there was news of one Sydney mother, Jenny McNamara, who was planning to spend her lump sum payment. According to the article, she said:'I'11 spend it on everyday needs - things like clothes, food and maybe some presents,' _ With her husband Andrew earning $52,000 as a courier driver, and monthly mortgage payments of $1300, the couple rely on annual Centrelink family benefit payments of $6000 to make ends meet.Certainly for that family Christmas is going to be that much easier. There will be four million Australian children for whom Christmas is now going to be that much brighter.I was asked about other responses, and I have to say that the response from the other side of the House is just a little bit difficult to pin down. The opposition leader is certainly trying to walk both sides of the street on this issue. Last week, on the day that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced the Economic Security Strategy, the Leader of the Opposition held a press conference within hours of the Prime Minister's announcement. He was trying to demonstrate at that point last week that he was supporting it. He said:We're not going to argue about the composition of the package or quibble about it. It has our support. It will provide a stimulus to the economy _But it did not take very long for this Leader of the Opposition to show his base political opportunism.Yesterday, on the Insiders program, the opposition leader was so out of touch that he was saying that the government was hyping up the financial crisis that has rocked the world, saying that we have somehow hyped it up. He had this to say about the government's Economic Security Strategy:The second part of this $10.4-billion package basically involves giving $1000 for every child whose family are in receipt of family tax benefit A.Well, that bit was right. Then he went on to say:Now this has had a lot of consequences that people are writing in to me and other politicians, complaining about.'A lot of consequences'. What? Like consequences that families are able to buy things that they need for their children; consequences like families are now able to buy decent presents for their children? This morning on 2GB he was at it again, working away, now trying to undermine the government's Economic Security Strategy. I quote him again:Look at the other side, the other half of it. They say: why wasn't there a general tax cut that would have benefited them?So it is hard to say: is he in favour of the $1,000 per child for these families? Is he in favour of it or not? Or does he want a tax cut on top of the thousand dollars? Maybe he does, maybe he does not. Who would know? I do not think even he does. Unlike the opposition, the government is very clear: we want to give this extra support to families. We intend to pay it in December. We know these families need extra help and we know that, as a result of paying this extra help to families, it will benefit the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - The opposition, walking both sides of the street, know no limit. Last week, in an exercise in small 'b' bipartisanship, they supported the package. Ever since then what we have had is the housing spokesman over there, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, and various others, including the honourable member who has just asked the question, trying to unpick it, undermine it, in an attempt to walk both sides of the street. Of course, the ultimate bottom line here is the government's determination to provide support to those families who need assistance out there right now. There is a limit on what the budget can do. What we have done is taken an age-old definition, and that is use the family tax benefit A definition, as the best means of providing that support. It provides 75 per cent of families with this $1,000 one-off payment for each child, just as we have taken action to provide support to pensioners, carers, those on the disability support pension, those who are widows and those who are in receipt of veterans' entitlements.Going to the actual core of this, in terms of walking both sides of the street, the statement by the Liberal Party leader that the government is hyping the global financial crisis means that he does not understand how serious the global financial crisis is and its impact on families, pensioners, carers and those on superannuation payments. Therefore, if the Leader of the Liberal Party is out there saying that the global financial crisis is being hyped, it demonstrates that he does not understand how serious this crisis is and its implications for such basic things as the 10 million Australians on superannuation payments, which he seems to regard as a trivial matter. We do not regard these things as trivial matters. We will support Australian families and the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Flynn for the question. The member for Flynn is well in touch with the farmers in his electorate. Only recently, the Prime Minister and I visited the Burnett family in Emerald, an area which had been affected by the prolonged drought that ended, in the way it so often does in the Australian landscape, with devastating floods over summer. During the period that we have had the drought, there has been an extraordinary increase in farm debt. Indeed, only six years ago the average farm debt was $238,000; last year that figure had risen to $702,000 for the average farm debt. In that way there is an understandable sensitivity to interest rates among Australia's farmers.An emergency meeting was held last Friday which I convened with the four major banks as well as other major lenders such as Rabobank and Landmark. The National Farmers Federation were in attendance, as was Keith Perrett, the head of the National Rural Advisory Council, and representatives from the accounting professions. A presentation was made by ABARE, and the banks were able to give their assessment as well, which accorded with ABARE's assessment, that the mood in the room for the immediate term was one of cautious optimism for the sector, but there was strong optimism in the medium to long term for Australian agriculture.The issue was squarely put on the table of the government's expectation that, just as the cut in the cash rate needed to be passed on to the bank's residential customers, the cut would be passed on to farming customers of banks as well. It is recognised that farmers often have quite different loan products to the products that residential customers will have. Already, prior to the meeting, Westpac had cut their farm based products by 80 basis points, and I am pleased to advise the House that, in the course of today, we have seen significant movement. The NAB yesterday announced it would reduce its business lending rates by 20 basis points, including the agricultural products. Rabobank announced that, effective today, they will cut their rural loans by 80 basis points. The Commonwealth Bank has announced that it has dropped interest rates on a range of products, within the range of 53 to 65 basis points on the products that are tied to the cash rate. I received advice after coming into the chamber that, in the period immediately before question time, ANZ confirmed that they have reduced their business interest rates, including agribusiness rates, by 60 basis points and that will be effective from 27 October. While these are still difficult times, and we should not underestimate the difficulty that many of our primary producers are going through, this news is certainly welcome relief for Australia's farm sector.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The defence of the safety and security of the Australian people is the primary responsibility of government. That is unquestionably the case, and I thank the honourable member for her question. In that context, upon coming to office the Prime Minister engaged Ric Smith, a former Secretary of the Department of Defence, to conduct a review of Australia's national security arrangements. Obviously it is vitally important that we ensure our arrangements enable agencies individually and, most importantly, collectively and across government to be as effective as they possibly can be. Mr Smith has provided his report to government. That has been made public. The government is giving careful consideration to the contents of that report.At the end of the day, the vital thing is to make sure Australia's national security arrangements are as effective as they possibly can be, not only to enable individual agencies to act in accordance with world's best practice but also, more significantly, to enable agencies across the board and cooperatively to act in accordance with world's best practice. The government is clearly giving consideration to the contents of that review. It is a practice of both sides of parliament not to comment on deliberations, but these are important matters and a national security statement regarding these matters will be forthcoming shortly.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hasluck for her question. As a proud Western Australian she understands the importance of the resources and energy sector to Western Australia and also to the Australian economy at large. I am pleased to say that last Saturday I had the honour and pleasure of joining with the new Western Australian Premier, Mr Colin Barnett, to officially open the fifth train of the North West Shelf LNG venture. I might also add that on the Friday I was lucky enough to have discussions, prior to the opening, with the new Western Australian Premier about the importance of us working in a bipartisan way to actually best position the Australian community to weather the current economic storm. I only wish the same approach applied to the federal opposition with respect to the economic security package currently being debated by the Australian community.The North West Shelf Venture is a statement about the success of key international petroleum companies - notably, Shell, BP, Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Chevron - working in a cooperative way to actually put in place a major LNG export opportunity for Australia. It is also a major achievement of our successful home-grown companies, notably Woodside and BHP Petroleum. The $2.6 billion investment effectively means that Australia, the eighth largest energy exporter in the world, will now become the fourth largest exporter of LNG. That is a major achievement.In terms of the project itself, the project represents an investment of $2.6 billion. The North West Shelf overall now represents assets of more than $25 billion. In terms of exports, it now creates an opportunity for us as a nation, just out of the North West Shelf Venture project, to export 270 cargoes a year of LNG to major economies who depend on the Australian community in terms of having a regular, reliable supply of energy to actually drive their own economies. Given the current economic storm that is confronting the world, that is exceptionally important. This is not just about our traditional markets; it is also about our key Chinese market. We have to make sure that we continue to work in a cooperative way as we go through these economic challenges to maximise our export opportunities in the very important market of China.The project employed 1,800 people at the peak of its construction and contributed $1.6 billion to the Australian economy. I might also say that in terms of jobs - this is perhaps something for our non-government organisations to think about - when you think about overseas aid you should not think about just the millennium goals and the percentage of our GDP actually spent on overseas aid. This project alone - of $2.6 billion - employed 4,000 people in Bantam, Indonesia, constructing the necessary ingredients to enable the project to succeed.I am also pleased to report to the House that prior to the opening of LNG train 5 I had the opportunity with representatives of Woodside to visit the adjacent Pluto LNG project, another major export opportunity of outstanding achievement by the Australian community. This represents an investment of $12 billion and further cements our nation as a major exporter of energy products. Perhaps more importantly, given the current economic challenges confronting Australia, more than half of that capital will be spent in Australia between 2007, when site preparation commenced, and the first LNG export in 2010. That is a very important investment in terms of us maximising economic opportunities at this time. At its peak it will employ 300 workers on construction, and in production it will guarantee another 300 workers an opportunity to work in this key Australian export industry.I simply say on behalf of the Australian government that we will continue to work with all state and territory governments and the business sector to deliver key projects such as this. I say that because the Australian government is absolutely committed to providing an internationally competitive investment and regulatory framework which guarantees those LNG projects. Those projects - as is not appreciated by the opposition, who just want to play petty politics at these challenging economic times - are vital for jobs, exports, economic growth, regional development and investment. Unlike the opposition, the Australian community understands the importance of those key aspects of the Australian economy. I might also say that it is important for the sustainable economic growth of Australia and it is also important for the region in which we operate. I commend LNG train 5 to the Australian community and also the importance of the Pluto project.</DOC>

 - I certainly thank the member for his question about our plans for nation building and for mentioning our investment funds, which are so important to nation building and so important at a time such as we find ourselves in at the moment. The Prime Minister has made it very clear that we will do everything we possibly can to accelerate expenditure, particularly from the Building Australia Fund. That is going to be very important to work in tandem with our Economic Security Strategy and also to work in tandem with the easing of monetary policy that has come from the Reserve Bank. So all of those things, working together, will strengthen our economy in the face of circumstances that are external to this country and which are going to slow our growth over time. We will use every lever of policy - fiscal stimulus, monetary policy and our nation building agenda - to strengthen our economy. The member asked me about the nation-building funds. He is correct to identify that there is $26 billion available. Future moneys will come out of future surpluses.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I know that she is a very big supporter of small business in her electorate in Brisbane and beyond, across the country, because she knows - as other members on this side know - how important small businesses are to our economy and to this society. It was a privilege - it gave me great pleasure - last week to present the National NEIS Association business awards. The NEIS business awards, as the Minister for Trade knows, recognise the outstanding success of small businesses established under the Australian government's New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. The NEIS program provides support and help to eligible job seekers to start and run their own small businesses. It was first established in 1985, so it is a program that has changed but it has certainly survived the test of time. It was a Hawke government initiative, but the fact that it was embraced by subsequent governments shows how important it has been in helping job seekers to find a different path to employment.For that reason I was there on award night last week, providing, I guess, support for the program but also to acknowledge the winners of the particular awards. The winners covered a range of businesses and sectors, including those involved in transportation and distribution, traditional trades, the hospitality industry, and graphic arts and design, just to name a few. Melbourne business Verve Portraits was announced as the winner of the new business award. Established by Holly McErvale in 2006, with the support of RMIT NEIS, Verve Portraits has expanded from a sole trader, in just 18 months, to a company now employing more than 30 people across two studios. Indeed, Ms McErvale informed me that she is looking to start up an enterprise in Sydney also. Verve Portraits's success shows what individuals can achieve when their ingenuity and perseverance is combined with the expertise of NEIS providers in providing appropriate mentoring and support.Adelaide based Wise Choice Healthy Foods was named the best growth business in the category for businesses operating for longer than 15 months. It has taken its high-quality milk throughout the Adelaide region. I commend their great efforts. Finally, Melbourne based DNR Logistics won the NEIS change award. These businesses and the individuals who underpin their success show us why NEIS will continue to be an important option for job seekers and an essential element in the government's new employment services. The government will strengthen the NEIS program, with up to 18,900 training places being made available under the Productivity Places Program for job seekers who wish to establish their own small business in an area of skills shortage.Small business, as we know, creates much of the prosperity in communities around the country. Three-quarters of a million businesses employ nearly four million people. Therefore, their importance to our economy can never be overstated. In response to the challenging economic climate, recent measures taken by the government will improve the viability of small businesses and the availability of finance to the small business community. I listened to the answer by the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy. He indicated that there will be a conference this Friday. I think that is another great initiative by this government, which wants to listen to the concerns of small business.Finally, the government will continue to support the future businesses that will be developed under the NEIS program. It is a great program. We have reformed it and provided appropriate training and mentoring. We wish all of the participants in the program from this point on every success.</DOC>

 - I welcome the first ever question on infrastructure from a coalition representative in this House. We have been waiting for the opposition to show some interest in infrastructure. Infrastructure Australia has been established, with its head office in Sydney. Infrastructure Australia is a streamlined organisation - we are making sure that there is no waste.I will take the shadow minister to the offices, if he would like, to meet the many staff working for Infrastructure Australia. Infrastructure Australia - and we have said this to the opposition from the very beginning, but they just do not get it - is a coordinating body of Commonwealth, state and local governments and the private sector. If you go into Infrastructure Australia, you will see many workers seconded from state and territory governments working with expertise. That is why they have been seconded to work on the development of the infrastructure priority list. You will also see in Infrastructure Australia the Major Cities Unit. On Wednesday at a conference in Sydney on global cities I will be announcing the appointment of the head of the Major Cities Unit. A fine appointment is coming up.Infrastructure Australia has made certain that we have had a considered approach to these issues. We have taken up these issues after more than a decade of neglect from those opposite. We have those opposite once again walking both sides of the street. They say now that they support infrastructure, but they do not support Infrastructure Australia. They attempt through this question to undermine the confidence that is out there in the business community, the federal government, the state governments and the local governments.The last time I was at Infrastructure Australia I sat around the table with Infrastructure Australia board members, led by Sir Rod Eddington. People such as Mark Birrell, Heather Ridout and Ross Rolfe are dismissed by those opposite as not being relevant. Those people are making an outstanding contribution. - They have already met four times. They have met in conjunction with the Infrastructure Working Group. Once again, you have both arguments put. They dismiss it by saying, 'What have they done?' but, if on the other hand they had just plucked a list from thin air without any considered work or approach, the opposition would be critical of that as well. They will have a chance in coming weeks because we will have the BAF legislation before this parliament. Once again I predict we will see nitpicking around the sides because they do not really support nation building and they do not really support infrastructure development, and they showed that during their 12 long years of neglect.</DOC>

 - The government came to office last year with a very strong commitment to return Australia to the forefront of arguing in the international community for nuclear nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament - to return Australia to the forefront. Previous Australian Labor governments have had a very proud record in advancing nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament. And I choose my words carefully - 'previous Australian Labor governments' - because we know that those on the other side have displayed no interest in these matters, just as they have displayed no interest in the United Nations, as the previous question from the member for Goldstein made crystal clear.The current government wants to take Australia's rightful place and role arguing for these issues internationally, just as previous Labor governments have done with the Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons and our strong support when last in office for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The current government is continuing in this very fine tradition. Last month, for example, in the margins of the UN General Assembly, I chaired the ministerial meeting on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, once again taking up the cudgels of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which is very much needed to advance the interests of nuclear disarmament and nuclear nonproliferation. The coming into force of the treaty is, in the government's view, absolutely essential to advancing these very important interests. In addition, as members would recall, in June of this year, after his visit to Hiroshima, the Prime Minister announced the government's intention to establish an International Commission on Nuclear Nonproliferation and Disarmament. And I make the point that the Prime Minister's visit to Hiroshima was historic, the first such visit by an Australian Prime Minister. I am very pleased to indicate to the House that today the International Commission on Non-proliferation and Disarmament has its first meeting in Sydney, meeting today and tomorrow.The commission is co-chaired by one of my distinguished predecessors, former foreign minister Gareth Evans, and former Japanese Foreign Minister Kawaguchi. The international commission is of very high quality, with a combination of international disarmament experts, former foreign ministers and leaders of their nations, including the former President of Mexico President Zedillo; the former Prime Minister of Norway Gro Harlem Brundtland; the former US Secretary of Defense William Perry, with whom I had the great pleasure in New York of discussing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; and the former Indonesian foreign minister Mr Ali Alatas. We are very much looking forward to that commission doing very good work in this important area. To indicate the government's very strong support of the commission, I am happy to announce today that the government, in the last month, have determined that we will allocate $3.8 million for the work of the commission in this financial year 2008-09. -  - We highly commend the actions of the international commission in its nuclear disarmament and nuclear nonproliferation work. I can tell from the interjections of those opposite, including those from the alleged shadow minister for the environment, that these are issues of no interest or relevance to the opposition, just as they were of no interest or relevance to them in their 10 long years in office.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for education for his question. I would possibly say to the shadow minister for education that, whilst he might think his job is all about overblown rhetoric, the error comes when you start believing it yourself - and you have made that error today. Perhaps the shadow minister for education might like to tell the 896 secondary schools who succeeded in round 1, with $116 million worth of support, that somehow this program is not working. That program is delivering 116,820 computers to those schools. Some of them are actually in the electorate of the member for Sturt, so he may want to go to those schools and say to them, 'Well, this is of no benefit.' But, interestingly, those schools applied, succeeded and got resources from the program. Of course, that was round 1. Round 2 has recently closed, and we had 1,420 schools across the nation apply for computers: 793 government schools, 342 independent schools and 285 Catholic schools. The shadow minister for education might want to say to those more than 1,400 schools that somehow this program is not working. They were invited to apply and did apply, because they want the resources that are available through the digital education revolution. We will process those applications and make announcements at a later stage about which schools have been successful. So round 1 has been completed -  -  - with $116 million allocated to schools, something the Liberal Party laughs at: imagine giving $116 million to schools to assist them with computers! Doing something of benefit to schools is something that they cannot conceive. Because they did so little that benefited schools over 12 long years, it is beyond their comprehension. - I think we can thank the member for Brisbane for the interjection of the day, possibly the interjection of the year! I say to the shadow minister for education that if he actually stopped talking for a second and started thinking he might want to consider that a program that has already delivered $116 million worth of computers to schools is a success. A program that in its second round has applications from all of 1,420 schools is a success. A program that will deliver $1.2 billion in new resources to bring computers and digital education tools to secondary schools around the country is a success.I can understand why the shadow minister for education is asking questions like these: he knows that the former government left this nation with a legacy when it came to education that the Liberal Party should be ashamed of - falling backwards in international testing, less than 50 per cent of secondary students learning history, no national curriculum, employers and others complaining about the lack of quality in education and in grammar teaching and basic English language skills, no computers in schools program to make sure the children could learn with the learning tools of the 21st century, no Trades Training Centres in Schools Program to lift retention rates and retention rates which are poor by the standards of the OECD and our competitors. Yes, we have inherited an education system full of flaws and bearing the consequence of more than a decade of neglect. We have systematically set about bringing an education revolution to that system, including our digital education revolution, which has been welcomed by schools around the country. If any Liberal member wants to contact my office and say that they want to tell their schools to send the computers back, I will be very interested in their names.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. Yesterday I had the privilege of walking with Andrew Johns on the beginning of his walk from Newcastle to Sydney. He is doing so in support of mental health and the great challenge which it presents to so many families and communities across Australia, but particularly in support of the great work done by the Black Dog Institute. They do a fantastic job in themselves, together with a number of other non-government organisations that work in this area. In fact, recently my wife, Therese, had Black Dog around at Kirribilli to celebrate some of the work that they are doing and to commend various of the businesses that have been supporting Black Dog as well.Together with the member for Newcastle, yesterday we began this walk from the middle of Newcastle heading south. I piked after five kilometres; Andrew Johns is going for the rest of the week. But the important thing is this: it is showing and shining a searchlight on this critical and undisclosed disease in our community, mental health. Here we are in the year 2008 and so many people still feel uncomfortable talking about it. Mental health is as real as any other form of so-called physical health and part of the problem of dealing with mental health challenges is to get people talking about them openly, talking about them candidly and talking about them as they would talk about any other disease which is affecting them, their families and their communities. But so much of the problem up until now has been this culture of silence. The time has come to lift the veil and I really commend the courage of Andrew Johns for being part and parcel - in fact a leader - in this community-led process, for causing us to have a genuine national conversation about mental health and about what to do about it. That goes to what to do about depression, bipolar disorder and so many of the other diseases which afflict so many Australians.On the question of mental health, the government has increased its funding over the four years from 2008-09 to $783 million, compared with the $411 million which had been provided from 2004-05 to 2007-08. As part of that the government has a plan for perinatal depression - $85 million over five years. In addition to that there is a $35 million program to support mental health nurses and psychologists training for those professions, through a particular subsidy. Government action is critical but community awareness is equally critical. Regrettably, so much of the undisclosed nature of mental health problems, mental illness and depression results in people across this country taking their lives because it remains a great disease of silence.The great thing about Andrew Johns's initiative and the great thing about so many other initiatives like it around the country is that we are throwing the doors open on this great scourge across our country. It is when people start talking about it, when you have government programs backing them up and when you have decent community organisations out there supporting them that we can make a difference. So my plea to all men and women of goodwill on all sides of politics - it does not matter which way you vote - is to get behind Andrew Johns's walk all the way from Newcastle to Sydney. He is due to conclude on Friday. He is going to raise some money but on top of that raise community awareness that this is nothing to be embarrassed about. It is just like any other disease. It is important to talk about it and bring it out into the light. I commend his courage and his leadership in being out at the forefront of this national campaign.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition has been out there today hyperventilating like a kid on red cordial. I say to the Leader of the Opposition in very clear cut terms: the government, in taking the decision that it announced on Sunday a week ago, did so on the advice of the Secretary of the Treasury that this was the position of the regulators, including the Reserve Bank. That is why the government acted. The government stands by its position and the decision taken. I would draw the honourable gentleman's attention to this statement, which was made by the Reserve Bank governor today, in which he said that the announcements by the government Sunday a week ago were 'sensible and the RBA supported them'. The Reserve Bank governor has blown the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition right out of the water.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The government is committed to protecting depositors in these uncertain times. The announcement by the Prime Minister the Sunday before last was a very important announcement in terms of not just confidence in banking but also confidence in the wider financial system. That is why we announced a comprehensive guarantee, because you have to move with speed and comprehensively. This was supported by the Treasury and by the RBA, and it was fully supported by APRA. It was fully supported by all of our regulators. At the time of the announcement, we indicated that we would be consulting with industry as well as with our international counterparts on the details of the guarantee. We have been doing that.I would just like to quote from a speech that I gave in the House last Wednesday. It was the second reading speech that I gave on the bill that was introduced. These comments seem to have been missed by the opposition in the debate and discussion that has been going on since then. This is what I said in the second reading speech:The government is consulting on the interaction between this guarantee on eligible wholesale borrowing and the guarantee on deposits.If desirable, the government will proceed with measures to clarify the intersection of these guarantees and facilitate their operation._Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  _The government will ensure that the short-term money market remains viable and that the deposit guarantee does not provide disincentives for market participants from operating in this market.That is what I said to the House last Wednesday. The regulators are consulting with industry, as they should, to ensure that the guarantee of deposits and wholesale borrowings does not adversely affect the efficient operation of the short-term money market.As members will be aware, the deposit guarantee and the term funding guarantee applies to Australian owned banks, Australian ADI subsidiaries of foreign banks, credit unions and building societies. The deposit guarantee applies to deposits in any currency and will extend to an Australian ADI's branch operations in another jurisdiction. We are working with our international counterparts to ensure that appropriate arrangements are in place for foreign bank branches operating in Australia.None of these are new issues, but they are ones that the government has been well aware of and has been addressing in consultation both domestically and abroad. They are important issues, so it is very important to get them right. Treasury expects to have concluded consultations shortly and to have finalised the details of the package shortly.</DOC>

 - In the midst of a cabinet meeting, which was a meeting of the strategic planning and budget committee of the cabinet, and with members of that committee present or online, at the conclusion of a discussion of a range of options before the government, I explicitly put this question to the Secretary of the Treasury: 'Is the position being recommended here that of the regulators?' He answered, 'It was, and that includes the Reserve Bank.'</DOC>

 - The government has acted responsibly both on the question of guarantees to bank depositors in Australia and guarantees for the term funding arrangements of our banks operating internationally to secure lines of credit for the Australian private sector and on what has been necessary to do for the fiscal stimulus of this economy, despite the best efforts of those opposite to talk this economy down throughout the course of this year. -  - I seem to remember that earlier this year the member for North Sydney was doing precisely that, followed by others in their public remarks. I say to those opposite that, at difficult and delicate times like this in the global economy and the Australian economy, confidence is important, dealing effectively with the challenges we face is important and acting responsibly in accordance with the advice the government has received is the right course of action rather than short-term politics.The Federal Reserve chairman in the United States, Chairman Bernanke, referring to the United States economy overnight, said 'We are in a very serious slowdown in the economy which has very serious consequences for the public.' Furthermore, Chairman Bernanke went on to call for a fiscal policy response, saying:With the economy likely to be weak for several quarters, and with some risk of a protracted slowdown, consideration of a fiscal package by the Congress at this juncture seems appropriate.That is what we see in governments around the world at present. Given the challenges which have occurred coming off the back of the global financial crisis and the impact which it has had on credit markets, stock markets and the real economy, growth and jobs, we have seen governments elsewhere around the world now debating what to do in terms of the fiscal policy stimulus - that is, to provide the economy and growth in jobs with a further level of support. Last Tuesday this government acted with its statement on this matter: the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy. Given recent developments not just in the United States but elsewhere in the global economy, and the wash-through effect which this has over time on growth and jobs in this economy, this has been a responsible course of action. I also again emphasise recent statements coming out of the People's Republic of China about growth there slowing somewhat and the need therefore for the government to boost consumption and to support job creation. Again, I refer to the statement of the governor of the Chinese central bank on 15 October to that effect.That is why this government, mindful of what is coming down the railway tracks towards the global economy, of which we are a part, over the 12 months coming, has acted sternly and decisively on the Economic Security Strategy we have put forward to the Australian people and which has received little more than backbiting comment from those opposite as opposed to full-hearted support. In fact, the measures we have taken are of direct support not only to long-term growth and jobs in the economy but also to pensioners, carers and seniors, families, first home buyers and those needing additional trading places. Of course, we look forward in December to the acceleration of our nation-building agenda. The need for this package has been reinforced by observations that we have seen in recent times by the economic commentators and also by decisions by our own central bank. I draw the attention of honourable members to the decision not long ago to reduce interest rates by 100 basis points. All these measures are necessary - fiscal policy and monetary policy moving in the same direction - in order to ensure that this country has the greatest chance possible to continue to maintain positive growth into the future and to continue to generate jobs growth into the future as well.We have been able to act because this government is in a strong budget position. Information overnight demonstrates the strength of our position relative to a number of our peers around the world, where you see various governments in considerable difficulty on the budget front. This is why the government, in its May budget, brought about a significant budget surplus to provide us with a buffer for growth for the future, and the time to use and draw down on that budget surplus has arrived. I also say to the country and to the House how important it is to have made provision for that budget surplus earlier this year. We can deliver this $10.4 billion stimulus package to the economy while continuing to provide a budget outcome for Australia which remains comfortably in surplus. This represents decisive action on the part of the government in dealing with the challenges Australia now faces -  - challenges which do not, may I say to the honourable gentleman who will ask the next question, add up to hype as he says. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that the superannuation policyholders around Australia do not regard the global financial crisis as hype. The pensioners of Australia do not regard the global financial crisis as hype. Those millions of Australians who have investments directly and indirectly on Australian stock markets do not regard the global financial crisis as hype. Those concerned about the impact of the global financial crisis on long-term growth and jobs growth in this country do not regard it as hype. I believe the use of that term by the Leader of the Opposition demonstrates just how far out of touch he has come with the real concerns of Australians facing the uncertainties which come to this country off the back of this global financial crisis.</DOC>

 - I think the Leader of the Opposition needs to acquaint himself with the truth, which for him increasingly has all the characteristics of a foreign country. What I said before was that, when the options were put before the cabinet committee to which I have just referred, I then spoke to the Secretary to the Treasury and asked, 'Is this the recommendation of the regulators?' to which he said yes. It was on that basis that the government acted. I refer the honourable gentleman - in his hyperventilating state, chucking cartwheels around the House, as he has taken far too great an intake of seriously deep red cordial this morning - to a statement made by the Reserve Bank governor less than a couple of hours ago that the decisions announced by the government then 'were sensible and the Reserve Bank of Australia supported them'.What we have here is the classic exercise of the Leader of the Opposition again walking both sides of the street. On one hand he says he supports the measures; on the other hand, he says, 'We're not so sure that we support the measures.' I assume the position of the Liberal Party now is that the bank guarantee that they support is their $100,000 limit which they put out there. I would ask the Leader of the Opposition: how many and what percentage of Australian depositors would that have left high and dry? This government has acted responsibly and has acted in response to the advice provided to us through the Secretary of Treasury from the regulators, including the Reserve Bank. That is a responsible course of action.If the honourable gentleman and his party were at all serious about the question of financial guarantees, why is it that in the five years since the HIH crisis - with which the honourable gentleman may have some passing familiarity, with which the member for North Sydney, as the relevant minister, may have some familiarity, and the relevant minister for financial regulation - no action has ever been taken on a financial claims scheme, not one step of action? It was an event which occurred five years ago, when we saw the intersection of a number of institutions, including HIH, FAI and an institution called Goldman. The council of economic regulators provided you with specific advice in order to act in 2005, and the election was held at the end of 2007. We acted on the basis of that advice early in our term, and that is why this government has taken the right course of action, consistent with the regulators. The bleating on the part of those opposite now, having had five years to act on this measure, is a stark reminder of the hypocrisy which resides on the benches opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fowler for her question. We have seen in recent times unprecedented turmoil on global financial markets and, as a result of that turmoil, the Australian economy faces significant threats. The Australian economy is in good shape. It is strong, but it is not immune from the threats that flow from the unprecedented turmoil on global financial markets. In response, the government has taken decisive action to guarantee bank deposits, to guarantee the wholesale borrowing by Australian banks and to inject $10 billion as a stimulus into the Australian economy. All of these actions aggregated together, along with the fall in the value of the Australian dollar and the decline in interest rates in recent times, will ensure that we keep growth and economic activity ticking along and will help to ensure that we protect Australia as much as possible from the adverse effects of the global financial crisis.It is true that the government strategy has been criticised, sadly. Unfortunately, it has been criticised by people who claim to support it; namely, the opposition. After initially saying they supported fully and absolutely the government's strategy, the opposition have spent the last week walking away from that position, sniping at specific parts of the package and saying they would have done it all differently, without of course specifying how they might have done it differently - just that no, no, they would have done it all differently. Just a few days ago the Leader of the Opposition was alleging that the government was hyping up the international crisis. A few weeks ago he was saying that this was the gravest economic crisis globally in any of our lifetimes. Just a few days ago he was attacking the government for not foreseeing the global financial crisis when, a few weeks ago, he was suggesting that nobody could have foreseen the crisis.The Leader of the Opposition is not short of an opinion on these issues. He is not short of an opinion on most issues. In fact, if you wait for a week on any issue you will get all the available opinions on that issue across the spectrum from him. He will contradict himself several times in an effort to walk both sides of the street and to insert himself into the day's story, whatever 'today's' story might be. But there is one remarkable fact in the opposition's response to the government's strategy on these unprecedented circumstances. There is one part of the government's strategy, one aspect of the position outlined by the Prime Minister, on which the opposition has been remarkably quiet, and that is the government's intention to address the issue of excessive executive salaries, especially in the financial services sector. Apart from the odd platitude on the part of the Leader of the Opposition about leaving it up to shareholders, he has said very little about this aspect of the government's strategy.I wonder why the Leader of the Opposition would have so little to say about the government's intentions to pursue reform of excessive executive salaries. I think I know the answer. He is worried that we might make it retrospective. He might have to sell a few Picassos or something. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition that the government is approaching this, along with other issues, in complete seriousness. Indeed, the Prime Minister has advocated in the international forums that are pertinent to this a change to the international rules covering the capital adequacy ratios that apply to banks and financial institutions to take into account the perverse incentives that currently exist for executives in major institutions to take short-term excessive risk and be rewarded excessively for taking that risk. I look forward with great anticipation to a robust contribution from the opposition, including the Leader of the Opposition, on this issue. With any luck they might adopt a single policy and stick to it.</DOC>

 - I do not propose adding to the earlier questions put to me. I put it in these terms again for the benefit of the honourable member: (1) this country, if we stand back from it all, was faced with being buffeted by a significant global financial storm; (2) the relevant strategic and budget committee of the cabinet met across an entire weekend; (3) the options put before us had been the subject of discussions between the financial regulators; (4) at the time that the options which were then adopted were being considered by that committee of the government, the question was explicitly put to the Secretary to the Treasury, 'Is this the advice of the financial regulators, including the Reserve Bank?' to which the answer was unequivocally, 'Yes.' That is why the government acted.The credibility of the entire position being put forward by the Leader of the Opposition is again blown completely out of the water today by the Reserve Bank governor, who says the actions by the government were sensible and the Reserve Bank of Australia supported them. The only one it seems who does not support them is the Leader of the Opposition. I presume the Leader of the Opposition is therefore wedded to his policy of $100,000 as being the appropriate limit. The Leader of the Opposition should reflect long and hard as to who would be excluded by that particular number, as well as reflecting long and hard on why in the five years after HIH no action was taken on the part of those opposite.I say to the honourable member, as he seeks again to make short-term political capital out of the long-term national economic interests of this country, that it is far better that we have people engaged in this debate in a calm and responsible manner, because the entire country, the stability of the financial system of this country and the appropriate stimulus needed for the long-term growth of this economy is of great importance to working households.I conclude my answer by saying this: none of this is hype; it is reality. We are dealing with reality here. Those opposite seem to think that those holding superannuation regard the global financial crisis as hype. That demonstrates definitively that the Leader of the Opposition has got so far out of touch on these matters, as he was last time when he said that an interest rate rise of 25 basis points, households having suffered seven interest rate rises in a row up until then, was nothing to get worried about. This demonstrates a Leader of the Opposition grossly out of touch with the real concerns out there across Australian households, as he seeks to come in here and make a short-term political point in order to advance his interests in securing a headline in tomorrow's newspapers.I say to the Leader of the Opposition that his responsibility as a political leader in this country should be to put our national economic interests first. Instead, he puts his short-term personal political interests first. It is clear for all to see. This government stands by the action it took Sunday a week ago. It is the responsible course of action. I conclude by saying this to the honourable member: could he reflect also on the impact of the government's decision on the actual interest rates charged by the banks concerned. Since the action taken by the government both on this deposit guarantee and on the guarantee for -  - What households across Australia are concerned about is the availability of credit and the cost of credit. The NAB came out in recent days saying:While our current cost of funds remain at a historical high, policy measures announced by the Australian Government earlier this month have started to have a positive impact on the credit market.We welcome this new development and anticipate that we will see some relief in the significantly higher premium we are currently paying for wholesale funds.There were similar remarks by the ANZ. I say to those opposite that the real concerns out there are (1) the stability of the financial system, (2) making sure that there is sufficient credit to flow by way of loans to businesses and small businesses and (3) to ensure that you provide sufficient support for this financial system in a time of global financial stress to enable our major commercial banks to provide maximum pass-through of official reductions in interest rates onto households.Those are the concerns which galvanise this side of the House - the concerns of superannuants, the concerns of households dealing with mortgages and interest rates and the concerns of pensioners trying to survive in the current climate. Those opposite are interested instead in short-term political points, and I think they stand condemned for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Oxley for his question. I know the keen interest that he takes in the relationship between Australia and China, in particular the trade relationship. China is Australia's largest trading partner, and two-way trade with that country is $58 billion. So far as the relationship is concerned, this government on coming to office reappraised the approach in terms of China and decided it needed a new focus and a new vigour.The previous government had entered into discussions around a free trade agreement, but these talks had been stalled for some three years. The unfreezing of the discussions with China was fortuitous and timely because the fact is that the global financial crisis has impacted on economic growth around the world. China is no exception, but the reality is that, whilst there will be an impact on China's growth rate, China will still have a robust and strongly growing economy.The IMF has said that from 11.9 per cent growth over the last calendar year, it expects China's growth to be 9.7 per cent this year. So it is slowing, but it is still very strong. In fact China will continue to be one of the fastest-growing countries in the world. It is important to also understand the composition of and contributions to China's growth. It is mostly domestically driven. In 2007 only two per cent of that close to 12 per cent was as a result of net exports. In the first nine months of this year, net exports have contributed only 1.2 per cent to China's economic growth.So China still remains terribly important in terms of our trade equation, and that is why following the initiative of the Prime Minister in engaging his counterpart in unfreezing the free trade talks and the discussions that have flowed from that - two more rounds of discussions; another one next month - we are pleased to say that we are well on track to progressing that FTA. Also, we are pleased to be hosting here tomorrow the chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, a very significant body in terms of the economic growth and the future development and infrastructure spend in China. The chairman, Zhang Ping, and I will be conducting more discussions on mutual cooperation, how we can advance the trade relationship and how we can together face the challenge of the global financial crisis that is confronting both economies. I am confident that we can build on this very strong relationship, but it does require engagement at the political level. This is something that Australia has engaged in in great detail, from the Prime Minister down. Many of the ministers have made visits to China. We have received many delegations from China. So I am confident this relationship will stand us in good stead.Whilst I am on my feet I might also indicate that the significance of the continuing growth, albeit slowed, in the Asian region is another significant reason the recently concluded FTA with the ASEAN region will also hold Australia in good stead. We do not know what is around the corner in terms of the impact, but I can say that we have significant cushions. Our trading relationship is an important part of that cushioning effect, and we will do what is necessary to advance the trading interests between us and China and between us and the ASEAN region.</DOC>

 - Once again, the Leader of the Opposition should acquaint himself with an ancient proposition called truth. I know that is something which is increasingly foreign to his vocabulary and foreign to his behaviour. The minister for finance this morning was referring to the absence of advice before the committee that there was anything wrong with this course of action, and it is absolutely clear-cut from his statements that that is the case. Those opposite again are clutching at straws, hyperventilating on this particular matter, when out there in mainstream Australia people are dealing with the challenges of financial stability, dealing with the challenges of what happens with their mortgages, dealing with the challenges of what happens with employment and jobs. All we have from the alternative government here is an exercise in short-term partisan politics. I say to those opposite they should get real with the economic interests of this country, get behind the government's package of support for the economy, not by half measures but by full measures, and get behind the proper measures taken by this government in response to the advice of the regulators on this guarantee and the guarantee for wholesale term funding arrangements for the banks necessary to maintain financial stability in this country. And I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: that is the deepest and most fundamental concern of every household in Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson both for her question and for her ongoing and longstanding interest in the work of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. The last few weeks have brought increasing public discussion and, indeed, debate about the international community's progress, or lack of progress, in our Afghanistan project. In particular, both local and international media seized on the comments of British commander Brigadier Carlton-Smith, who reportedly said that the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan was not winnable. While I certainly share Brigadier Carlton-Smith's frustration, I do not and the government does not share his level of pessimism.It is absolutely true that the progress of the global partners in Afghanistan is at best very, very slow - and it will remain slow while ever we lack properly coordinated and resourced political, civil and military plans. Those who say that the project in Afghanistan will not be successful by military means alone are absolutely right. That is why the government, in addition to calling for more troops, has been pushing for greater coordination and resourcing; more resources for the UN's special envoy; more training and capacity building in the Afghan national security forces; a smarter counternarcotics strategy; more economic aid and more aid workers; a greater focus on governance, including the creation and bedding down of a justice system; and, of course, a much bigger effort in addressing those very large challenges we have in Pakistan and the implications for those challenges in Afghanistan.Meanwhile, our troops in Afghanistan continue to do real and meaningful work in Oruzgan province and, indeed, beyond Oruzgan province. Our special forces are having real, strategic effect - disrupting the insurgents, destroying IED manufacturing facilities and eliminating or capturing key Taliban leaders. Indeed, since August alone our special forces have captured or eliminated four key senior Taliban leaders in Oruzgan province including, importantly, Mullah Bari Ghul, the shadow governor of the province, and Mullah Akhtar Mohammed, the well-known extremist Taliban commander. The removal of these senior Taliban leaders has significant impact on the effectiveness of the insurgents more generally.On the reconstruction side, our Reconstruction Task Force continues to build and rebuild important economic and social infrastructure. Ongoing projects include further improvements to the hospital in Tarin Kowt, the expansion of the Afghan Health Development Service Training Centre, and the rebuilding of the Ministry of Rural and Regional Development headquarters and the high school and primary schools in Tarin Kowt. Completed projects include the Sorkh Morgab Basic Health Centre and the Tarin Kowt women's hospital wing which the governor of the Oruzgan province very recently officially opened. Of course, in the meantime our trades training school is ensuring that we build indigenous capacity so that these reconstruction efforts in the future can be undertaken by local Afghanis.Some of our reconstruction work also has important strategic effects, like the patrol base at Kudus, which has allowed our troops to dominate an area of strategic importance some 20 kilometres from our base in Tarin Kowt, or the replacement of the Highway 1 bridges, a key logistical thoroughfare which has restored the coalition line of supplies and, critically, allowed for the successful construction of the Kajaki dam project. Importantly, it is worth noting that our Combat Team Dagger was the only organisation available to do this work successfully. Why? Because they are the only reconstruction team that comes with their own very effective security - underlining the important work our infantry troops are also doing in Afghanistan.Today I can announce that today we enter a new phase in our work in Afghanistan: replacing Reconstruction Task Force 4 will be Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force 1. Importantly, their work will be in building the capacity of the Afghan National Army. Our troops will embed themselves with Afghani battalions, sharing their skills, knowledge and know-how within the fledgling Afghani army. Building the capacity of the Afghan National Army is critical to better progress in Afghanistan. Too often our special forces and other forces are successful in securing ground only to lose that ground after we withdraw because of the inability of the Afghani security forces to hold that ground, to hold our gains.The 38 international partners in the Afghanistan project continue to face enormous challenges, but if properly resourced and if coordinated political, civil and military plans are embraced, I am absolutely confident that we can achieve relative peace and security for the people of Afghanistan and, importantly, deny extremists a safe haven and a base from which to pursue their global ideological agenda. I am sure all members of the House will join with me in paying tribute to and thanking the men and women of the Australian Defence Force for the wonderful work they are doing in Afghanistan.</DOC>

 - As the Treasurer said when he introduced the relevant legislation in parliament last Wednesday:The government is consulting on the interaction between this guarantee - that is, that on deposits - on eligible wholesale borrowing and the guarantee on deposits.If desirable, the government will proceed with measures to clarify the intersection of these guarantees and facilitate their operation. - I am coming to what the honourable gentleman has asked. This was clearly outlined by the Treasurer in his introduction of the legislation last Wednesday. Therefore, from the government's point of view, the guarantee in terms of deposits remains absolute. The question at issue is whether deposits above $1 million and beyond should have an insurance premium attached to them consistent with the insurance premiums which are relevant to term wholesale deposits, which applied to the term wholesale lending arrangements of the major commercial banks. That is entirely consistent with what the government said, through the Treasurer, in his statement to parliament last Wednesday. I would say this to the honourable gentleman: the guarantee, as it applies to all deposits, is absolute. - The question at issue is when, as the Treasurer foreshadowed last Wednesday, at the intersection of these two regimes, you have competitive neutrality between those two regimes for the most significant depositors - that is, north of $1 million, beyond $1 million. If you are holding a deposit in a bank of less than $1 million, which most people in this country do, that is at 99.5 per cent of depositors.And I say to the honourable gentleman: the government's guarantee for depositors remains absolute. What we are talking about, as the Treasurer foreshadowed last Wednesday, is the intersection of the two regimes at the most upper end, and that is the subject of the discussion occurring between the regulators and the banks as we speak. Despite multiple questions from those opposite over the course of recent days, for the government in parliament to go to the detail of those commercial negotiations is not the responsible course of action until they are resolved. Once they are resolved, that will be put fully and formally and finally into the public domain. That is the right and responsible course of action.What is the alternative course of action for those opposite, who advocated a $100,000 limit? For the benefit of the honourable member, who has not bothered to tell the public this, if Liberal Party policy was implemented, 40 per cent of this nation's total deposits would not be covered. That is Liberal Party policy. This government took a different view that all deposits of all APRA-regulated institutions in banks, building societies and credit unions should be covered. The question at issue for those who have deposits at the extreme upper end of the spectrum - north of $1 million - is whether an insurance premium should be attached to it. That is what is at issue here. But 99.5 per cent of deposits are less than $1 million. What those opposite were saying, with their $100,000 guarantee, is that 40 per cent of this nation's deposits would get zero guarantees. That is Liberal policy; that is what they wanted to do.We have a completely different approach. Our approach was not only advised to us by the Secretary to the Treasury but also advised to us by the Secretary to the Treasury based on the consultation and advice that he had in turn received from the economic regulators. This is a clear-cut course of action for the future. Those opposite simply want to make cheap, short-term political points.I would say to the member for Wentworth, who regards this as an entire hype, to use his own terms, that the interests of working families, the interests of households, lie in responsible action by a government responding to the advice provided to it by the regulators to act appropriately to maintain the stability of our financial system to make it possible for our banks to open up lending again to the small businesses of Australia and to provide our banks with the greatest opportunity to provide maximum pass-through for the interest rate burden being faced by those struggling households out there - an interest rate burden compounded by the 10 interest rate rises in a row brought about under their regime when they were in office and, I have got to say, an interest rate regime which the honourable gentleman opposite regarded as a mere trifling matter when he derided a 25 basis point increase.This demonstrates more broadly how out of touch the member for Wentworth has become: regarding the global financial crisis as hype and regarding all these matters of the stability of the financial system as hype, and regarding the security of depositors - not just 60 per cent of deposits but the entire scheme - as necessary to the future. That is not hype either. We have acted responsibly and we stand behind the actions we have taken.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I know she has a deep commitment to removing discrimination against women. The Rudd government is strongly committed to the protection and promotion of women's rights, both domestically and internationally. In fact, August this year marked the 25th anniversary of Australia's ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, commonly known as CEDAW. In those 25 years much has been done. In particular, CEDAW provided the basis for very significant reforms, including the Sex Discrimination Act, which in 1984, some 24 years ago, made discrimination against women illegal. But it is time to do more and the Rudd government is taking another important step for the rights of Australian women.Last week, in response to a national interest analysis which I tabled, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties recommended that Australia accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women. I, along with the Minister for the Status of Women, have conducted wide-ranging consultations with state and territory governments and non-government organisations on the issue of Australia becoming a party to this important protocol. The responses we have received as a result of the consultations have been uniformly and overwhelmingly positive.It is high time that Australia stood up on our international human rights responsibilities. It is quite hypocritical for us to expect of other nations standards that we are not ourselves prepared to meet. Regrettably, discrimination against women in our region of the world is rife, whether in the areas of employment, educational opportunity, maternity services, social rights or, in the worst-case scenarios, of which we are well aware, the prevalence of sexual trafficking in our region. We cannot call on others to rectify those measures unless we are prepared ourselves to set an example. It is therefore our hope that, before the end of this year, the Rudd government will be able to lodge our instrument of accession to this very important protocol.Regrettably, however, the government has not been supported in this initiative by those opposite. While in government, those opposite ignored this and other important human rights instruments and effectively turned their back on the international community. Now they have submitted a dissenting report to the committee recommendation to sign up to this important protocol. It appears that the opposition still maintains its historical opposition to international human rights and, in particular and most regrettably, the rights of women. I ask those opposite to join with the government in taking this step for Australian women and for the strength of our regional and international human rights obligations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. As I said earlier at the press conference, and I will inform the House, the secretary of my department and the Governor of the Reserve Bank have been in discussions about the comprehensive guarantee and the level above which a fee may be charged - an insurance premium, if you like. They have been in those discussions consistent with the answer that I gave in the House last Wednesday. Of course, the shadow Treasurer did not listen to the answer last Wednesday, so she was unaware that the government then was looking at finetuning the scheme, as we should, and that is what the Treasury and the Reserve Bank are discussing as we speak and it is what the Treasury and the Reserve Bank are discussing with industry. When those consultations have finished, we will make our announcement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. In May this year, Australia joined 111 states at the Dublin Diplomatic Conference on Cluster Munitions to negotiate a legally binding convention to prohibit cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians. Australia joined this process because we very strongly believed that, having seen the devastation caused by landmines throughout the world, the time had come for the international community to address the terrible, indiscriminate effects of cluster munitions.Australia, both in the months leading up to the convention in Dublin and also at the convention itself, worked very hard to achieve a treaty that not only achieved very important humanitarian objectives but also safeguarded Australia's national and national security interests.I think it is well recognised that the new convention on cluster munitions is a significant humanitarian achievement. It prohibits cluster munitions that randomly scatter tens or hundreds of so-called submunitions that have no self-destruct capability or capacity and which pose a long-term threat to innocent civilians for years to come after hostilities have ceased. It does not, for example, apply to modern precision guided weapons with self-destruct capabilities such as the SMArt 155 anti-tank munition, which was recently acquired by the ADF.Importantly, the convention also contains provisions to assist the victims of cluster munitions, their families and also their communities by including provisions which go to the clearance of land to make land free from cluster munitions. The convention ensures that cooperation between nations through peacekeeping and other joint operations with nation-states who do not become a party to the treaty is able to continue. This so-called interoperability is very important to Australia's long-term strategic, security, defence and peacekeeping arrangements.The government has conducted a thorough policy, legal and technical review of the convention, and I am very pleased to advise the House that Australia will sign the convention. Australia will be among the first nations to sign the convention when the treaty opens for signing in Oslo in early December this year. I think that that action by the government and by our nation is consistent with the proud record that Australia has in this area. Australia, for example, was an original signatory to the mine ban convention in 1997.Australia has been a longstanding supporter of mine action, committing $75 million over the period 2005 to 2010 to remove mines and assist victims, and this is built on the $100 million which was made available by Australia in the decade leading up to 2005. In the last financial year, 2007-08, we have provided nearly $19 million for mine action projects in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Iraq.Early today I was very pleased to meet with the former member for Cowan, Graham Edwards, who is in the gallery today, and with other representatives of the Australian Network to Ban Landmines to do a number of things: to advise the network on the government's decision to commit to signing the treaty in December this year, to compliment the network on the good work that they do and also to underline Australia's ongoing commitment to mine action.I am also pleased to indicate to the mine network and to advise the House that Australia today will make a further contribution of half a million dollars to the United Nations Mine Action Service, UNMAS, for humanitarian clearance of cluster munitions in Lebanon. This builds on the $2.5 million which Australia has already contributed to UNMAS doing the United Nations vital humanitarian work in this very important area.</DOC>

 - The council of economic regulators includes the Treasury. On these matters that you have just referred to in your question, the form of communication between the government and the other regulators was through the medium of the Secretary of the Treasury, as is entirely normal. - Furthermore, are those opposite, including the member for North Sydney, saying that they do not trust the word of the Secretary of the Treasury? - No, this is a very important question. Are those opposite saying they do not trust the words of the Secretary of the Treasury? We on this side of the House do. The government has great trust in the Secretary of the Treasury - it is a high public office of the Commonwealth. If I as Prime Minister turn around to the Secretary of the Treasury and say, 'Is this course of action' -  - Oh, one person's voice? - So the member for North Sydney says the Secretary of the Treasury's position on this is only one voice and not to be trusted by the government. That is an extraordinary position on the part of those opposite. Can I say that the attitude of those opposite is also consistent with the previous government's treatment of the Secretary of the Treasury. If those opposite perused the public reporting on this matter, when the current Secretary of the Treasury was serving the previous government and dared to give a public speech which went to the question of whether the Treasury was being properly consulted on such questions as water and climate change, how did the previous government deal with the then and current Secretary of the Treasury? Do you know what happened? His salary bonus was chopped because he dared to speak out. That is what happened. That is the contempt with which that government treated that high office of the Commonwealth.When I as the Prime Minister turn to the Secretary of the Treasury and ask this formal question - 'Is this the advice of the regulators including the Reserve Bank?' - and the answer is yes, I trust that advice. I assume that the member for Wentworth backs up the Manager of Opposition Business when he says, 'That's just one voice' - one voice in the wilderness. It just happens to be the Secretary of the Treasury. Our view is quite the reverse.I say to the member for Wentworth: you have a statement to us by the Secretary of the Treasury about the position of the regulators - that is point 1. But if there is any doubt on this matter it is an open and shut case when you have a statement today by the Governor of the Reserve Bank which says that the government's actions were sensible and the Reserve Bank of Australia supported them. You have a clear-cut statement by the Reserve Bank governor that the bank supported the government's actions consistent with the statement to the ministers in that committee about the attitude of the regulators to the action taken. The government's course of action has been responsible, and again the member for Wentworth, the member for North Sydney, in a most irresponsible injection now about the Secretary of the Treasury, and the member -  - I would have thought the member for North Sydney in particular would be sensible and sensitive to the advice from regulatory institutions given his particular experience of being the regulator when HIH went bust. I seem to remember that the member in question -  -  - Those opposite regard this as not relevant to the current debate. The recommendations which came to the previous government for a financial claims scheme came out of the HIH royal commission. An entire company goes under, the member for North Sydney was the minister for financial regulation at the time, and a certain other member of this parliament seemed to have a material engagement in those matters at the time - I will leave that to one side. But can I say to those others opposite: if we have a clear statement to us by the Secretary of the Treasury that this is the position of the regulators, and if the Governor of the Reserve Bank then confirms that is the case, then this is an open and shut case. Those opposite are simply clutching at straws; again trying to make a cheap political point. The government stands by the Secretary of the Treasury. He is a first-class officer of the Commonwealth. The government stands by the integrity of the Reserve Bank, of APRA, of ASIC and of the council of economic regulators. If those opposite were interested in the nation's long-term economic interests, they would do so as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I recognise his interest in these matters. The government understands that the short- and long-term health of our river systems is a hugely critical issue and, since coming to government, Labor has set about delivering real improvements to the health of our rivers. In particular I point out to the House the $12.9 billion Water for the Future program, including $3.1 billion for environmental water purchases through the Restoring the Balance in the Murray-Darling Basin program. Already a number of substantial decisions have been taken. On 15 September we commenced a tender to purchase water from willing sellers in the Queensland - Opposition members - Page 2. - and northern New South Wales areas of the Murray-Darling Basin, part of a $400 million program to purchase water entitlements in the northern section of the basin. On 20 September the Prime Minister announced an offer to buy the water entitlements of small block irrigators in the Murray-Darling Basin who agree to sell all their water entitlements to that Commonwealth. Up to $150,000 as a special payment along with transitional assistance will be made available to eligible irrigators. People can leave irrigated farming but stay on the farm and stay in their community. This measure is expected to yield up to - Opposition members - Page 3. - Thank you very much for showing your ability to count, those on the opposition side. I will be coming to numbers in a minute. On 7 October the government commenced a tender to purchase water entitlements from willing sellers in the Murray-Darling Basin, providing environmental benefits to RAMSAR listed wetlands along the River Murray such as the Lower Lakes, the Coorong, the Chowilla floodplain near Renmark and the Barmah-Millewa Forest near Echuca. So the government is delivering on bringing improvements to the river systems of the Murray-Darling Basin.The question I must ask now, through you, Mr Speaker, is: what did the coalition achieve in 11 years? Now let us count what happened in 11 years. Not one single drop of water was recovered directly under the Living Murray program. I urge the opposition to count that number - not one single drop of water was recovered directly under the Living Murray program. In fact the coalition woke up late to the issue of water when the former Prime Minister announced the national water plan for security 10 months before he lost office.Opposition members - Page 4. - This plan was developed in secret by Mr Howard and the now Leader of the Opposition. There was no consultation with the cabinet. There was no consultation with Treasury. There was no consultation with the National Water Commission. There was no consultation with state or territory governments. - For those who are used to counting, may I remind the opposition that in 2001 they were in specific receipt of information from the snapshot survey by the Murray-Darling Basin Commission of the impact of environmental degradation on the Murray-Darling Basin. In 2002 they were in receipt of the report from the Australian Greenhouse Office called Living with climate change, which again showed beyond any shadow of a doubt that there were significant risks to the health of the Murray-Darling Basin, yet in all that time the opposition were not able to deliver a single drop of water to the Murray-Darling Basin. The Leader of the Opposition had two years in the water portfolio and he did not deliver any recoverable water for the Murray-Darling Basin system. The opposition had 12 years to take national leadership on water and it failed. This government in four months began to take robust and comprehensive action on bringing health back to the Murray-Darling Basin, and we will continue on that course in the interests of the nation.</DOC>

 - In what has been a pretty interesting debate here in Reps today, can I say that that is the most irresponsible point I have heard made by the Leader of the Opposition. The world currently confronts a global financial crisis. The Secretary of the Treasury is integral to this government's and the preceding government's response to international economic developments. The Secretary of the Treasury and his team have been working huge hours week in and week out, seven days a week, to ensure that Australia's response to this crisis - both in terms of the measures taken on bank guarantees and the measure taken in relation to the fiscal stimulus package - were the right ones for the nation.As Prime Minister, and as leader of the government, I use this occasion to affirm 100 per cent this government's confidence in the Secretary of the Treasury and I would ask the Leader of the Opposition to get to his feet now and do the same. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Port Adelaide for his question. I did have the opportunity with him to visit Seaton High School in his electorate. We were there for the purpose of talking about trades training and talking about upgrading the facilities that those students were learning on. Of course, trades training is important to have as a pathway in secondary schools. It is important because many students want to learn through vocational education and training pathways. It is also vital if this nation is going to lift the percentage of students it retains to year 12 or equivalent.One of the most shameful legacies of the Liberal Party, after its 12 long years in government, was to leave this nation with retention rates that are low by the standards of our competitors across the world and to leave us with a situation where too many young Australians leave school, not to go into work, not to go into further training, but unfortunately to go nowhere - to go nowhere to secure a long-term future. We are determined to change that, and one of the government's programs to change it is our major investment in trades training centres in schools - a program every secondary school in the country will be able to benefit from across the program's 10 years. It is a program which will enable schools to get a grant of between $500,000 and $1Â½ million to engage in upgrading or building trades training facilities.Now, of course this program has already gone through its first round, and in that first round some $90 million was delivered to schools. A feature of that applications process was that many schools in local areas, in regional centres and in suburban areas across the country determined to come together in clusters and make joint applications, either to get a bigger facility or to get compatible facilities so that one school could specialise in one sort of trades training and a different school could specialise in a different sort of trades training, and the students from both schools could have the opportunity to move between the two schools and learn in either stream - a very practical arrangement which gives students more pathways.I am pleased to say that the second phase of our trades training program is working well. Applications closed on Friday, 17 October. This is a big round, with $310 million available for schools through this applications process. When applications closed on 17 October, we had 115 schools submit applications but, as I said, because many schools have chosen to cluster, those applications actually represent benefits to 355 schools in total. The amount that has been bid for through that application process slightly exceeds the amount available - it is $320 million in total. We have indicated to some schools that we will extend the time period for their application to allow them to confirm their bids. That small extension of time has been to 30 October.We think that this is an exciting process for the schools involved. It means that students around the country will go from learning on facilities which would have been best forgotten about in the 1950s, so old are they, and will give students the ability to learn trades skills on the equipment and in facilities which are appropriate for the 21st century. Of course, this was an area that the previous government neglected. It is part of its record of educational failure. Nothing got done to stop students around the country learning on the -  - Of course, I get an interjection from the shadow minister, who knows nothing and does nothing, and he says, 'Why are they clustering together?' - They are clustering together not because the program is not there for every school. The program is there for every school. The allocation is there for every school. - They choose to cluster together because it is a model that they think will be more effective for their students. I know the shadow minister for education thinks he knows more than everybody else, but perhaps he might think to himself that principals in schools who make decisions to work in partnership with adjacent or neighbouring schools are making those decisions for good reasons. I know a flavour of today has been that opposition members seem to think that they know better than everybody else, including the experts, but I would say to the shadow minister for education that I think principals who are making these applications know a fair bit more.On the question, of course, of making sure that we have an education revolution, Mr Speaker, you have drawn the House's attention today to the question of numeracy and whether or not people are numerate and accurate. It is a pretty good question, because my attention has been drawn to a press release by the shadow minister for education, who has put the proposition that the on-costs for 116,000 computers are $3 billion to $4 billion. The shadow minister for education is so numerate that he thinks the on-cost for a computer is $34,482. It just goes to prove the proposition that, when it comes to matters dealing with numbers, when it comes to matters financial and when it comes to matters economic, the last thing you can ever afford to do is trust someone from the Liberal Party.</DOC>

 - It is remarkable that, given the opportunity to defend one of the institutions of the Commonwealth, the alternative Prime Minister of Australia declines that opportunity and leaves on the record his attack on the Secretary of the Treasury yesterday. It follows of course a series of statements by those opposite as they have sought to pick away at the institutions of this country in recent times, including the Reserve Bank.The Leader of the Opposition asks about the bank guarantee. As I indicated to the House yesterday, the government took its decision the weekend before last at a time when there was a complete meltdown in stock markets around the world and where confidence had been assaulted. The government, in taking that decision, did so based on the advice provided to us by the Secretary of the Treasury - an office which we defend and a person whom we defend. He did so having consulted with the Reserve Bank and the other economic regulators. The government stands by the decision. It has helped to restore and maintain confidence in our banking and financial system. It was the early and decisive action which was necessary, and I would have thought that the alternative government of Australia, at a time of global financial crisis, would have supported it as well.</DOC>

 - The acting Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Sturt, says: 'Is this the blueprint for the world?' I would remind the honourable member of this: in terms of restoring confidence to global financial markets, what we do in Australia is important and what is done around the rest of the world is doubly important, because we are in a global economy with a global financial system where everything is related to everything else. That is why the government has been acting domestically and internationally since the onslaught of this crisis.Australia believes strongly that coordinated global action is required to address this crisis. We welcome recent initiatives by the G7 and the G20 to bring countries together to find common solutions. At their recent meeting in Washington, finance ministers from the G7 announced a plan to address the global financial crisis. In that plan there were five core elements: (1) preventing the failure of systemically important financial institutions, (2) improving access to liquidity and funding, (3) re-establishing confidence in financial institutions, (4) guarantees for depositors, and (5) restarting the secondary markets for mortgages and other securitised assets.At a subsequent meeting of the G20, finance ministers committed to use all economic and financial tools available to them to ensure the stability and continued proper functioning of financial markets. Their agenda endorsed the G7 plan and also extended it to the use of macroeconomic policy and other measures necessary to restore stability. G20 leaders went on to say that they were committed to using all the economic and financial tools available to them to ensure stable and well-functioning financial markets.The Treasurer attended these meetings on Australia's behalf. In his remarks he highlighted the importance of the G20 at a time when the global financial crisis is spilling over from developed to developing economies. That is of deep concern and relevance to this economy, Australia, given the critical importance of major developing economies in our own region for our own future growth, most particularly China. The Treasurer also called for the reform of global financial architecture so that we do not repeat the failure to reform post the Asian financial crisis.The G20 meeting was also attended by President Bush, who outlined the need for collective action to deal with the crisis. More recently, the President, together with the President of the French Republic, President Sarkozy, and the President of the European Commission, Mr Barroso, have been providing important leadership in this area by calling for appropriate, coordinated international action. Australia has consistently called for international action to be coordinated in response to the global financial crisis through the agency of the G20. In my own address to the UN General Assembly in September I spoke of the importance of the G20 in addressing this crisis. At that time I also outlined a framework from Australia's part about how the G20 could work together with the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Forum to reform global financial markets. In recent days I have written to all G20 heads of government requesting further coordinated action on their part, given that we are all in this together. Coordination is required in two important areas: one is the reform of global financial regulation, but the second part looms as being equally important and progressively more important - and that is a coordinated global economic stimulus in the face of slowing economic growth.The G20 is a critical forum for the future to deal with the current global financial crisis. First of all, the G20, of course, has a record of achieving real results borne of hard experience. It was born out of the Asian financial crisis. The G20 was the key force in improving IMF governance in 2006-07 by increasing the quota and voice of emerging market economies in the deliberations of the IMF. Second, the G20 of itself represents across its combined membership the following core facts: 85 per cent of the world's financial system, 95 per cent of global stock market capitalisation; 80 per cent of global trade, and two-thirds of the world's population. This is an important institution because of its representative characteristics. On top of that, by bringing together a limited group of countries in a structured way, it has demonstrated an ability to forge consensus across developed and developing economies, and extending the remit for coordinated action on regulatory reform to financial markets and for global economic stimulus into a representative body which brings together critical developed and developing economies.Australia is working hard with Brazil and other G20 members to ensure that the G20 continues to provide leadership and coordinated action to address this crisis. At their meeting in early November the G20 should engage with the Financial Stability Forum to agree a clear timetable for implementing the Financial Stability Forum's recommendations. The Treasurer will again be representing Australia at that important meeting.International cooperation is essential in a time of global crisis. We have argued consistently, as Australia, that an appropriate mechanism, an appropriate institution, for advancing coordinated global action on both the fiscal policy front and on the regulatory reform front is the G20, an institution in which Australia is represented. Further action is necessary domestically; further action is necessary internationally. Unless this is coordinated through a mechanism such as the G20 our concern in Australia is that, once we see our way through this particular storm, if fundamental institutional reform questions are not dealt with, then in turn we face a repeat of this storm in the future. This government will leave no stone unturned through the mechanism of the G20 to ensure that we have a properly coordinated agenda of action for the future. It is a proper mechanism for doing so. It has a major role to play in the future and Australia stands ready to act and act decisively within its framework.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for her question. The government makes no apology whatsoever for putting in place a comprehensive guarantee on deposits and also a comprehensive guarantee for term funding. This comprehensive guarantee is not supported by those opposite. Let us be very clear: those opposite want a scheme which cuts out at $100,000, leaving 40 per cent of all deposits without a guarantee. They want that because they do not understand the magnitude of the challenge that flows from the global financial crisis. They do not understand the reasons why this was put in place. They certainly do not understand why the Reserve Bank supported the putting in place of this guarantee and why the Treasury supported it. They have been repudiated comprehensively in Senate estimates. - The Leader of the Opposition is in a bit of strife today. It started last Sunday when he went on the Insiders program and said that the global financial crisis had been hyped up. - Yesterday he made a monumental gaffe in this parliament where he suggested the Secretary of the Treasury should be sacked. That is what he said. What was that all about? That was all about the Treasury secretary supporting a comprehensive guarantee for bank deposits. But, of course, it does not agree with what the Leader of the Opposition wants to do, so he is out there bagging the Treasury secretary. That is what he is doing - and he has not been man enough to come into the House and to apologise - because the Treasury secretary has supported a comprehensive guarantee which the opposition leader does not support. - Of course, this morning in the Senate Senator Abetz again questioned the honesty of the Treasury secretary. This is just reckless and irresponsible behaviour at a time of a global financial crisis. I will come to the detail of the question. I made it very clear -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I made it very clear in the House last Wednesday in the second reading speech that we would be putting in place arrangements that reflected the fact that there needed to be a threshold above which a fee would be paid. Let me say that this finetuning that I forecast here is what the Treasury officials and the Reserve Bank have been talking about, and it is precisely the question on which the Leader of the Opposition has been repudiated by the Treasury secretary. Why are we doing that? We are doing that because there have been representations made to the government, to the Treasury secretary and to the Reserve Bank of Australia about the impact of this measure. Because the government believes in a comprehensive guarantee for everyone, we are going to put in place a charge above a threshold. That charge or that fee above a threshold will be for deposits above $1 million. Those details are being worked out. They will be published. The pricing will be out there for everybody to see in an open and transparent way.What this is really about is their embarrassment that they have crab-walked away from support for a comprehensive guarantee for all Australians with money in banks. I tell you what: they should be severely embarrassed about that because what has occurred since we put in place this guarantee is that markets have stabilised and interest rates have come down. The banks that have taken those decisions have cited the government's decision. So, in effect, in opposing this comprehensive guarantee they are opposing lower interest rates. That is what they are doing. All of this is about hiding their embarrassment at us putting in place a comprehensive guarantee that has stabilised the Australian financial system.</DOC>

 - The September quarter CPI data were published today, and as expected it hit a high of five per cent. Of course, this reflects very substantial price pressures that Australian households have been bearing for a considerable period of time. As we are aware, inflation hit a new 16-year high in October, November and December last year. In the September quarter it has gone even higher.Underlying inflation is now 4.7 per cent. It reflects the build-up of prices over the last couple of years, and in particular the impact of housing prices and fuel prices. But the good news is that it is expected to abate over the next year. We will be publishing our forecast for the future of inflation in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which will be due within the next month. But this figure in no way reduces the government's commitment to put in place a range of policies which will enhance capacity in the Australian economy and mean that we can grow strongly with low inflation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question. The international financial crisis has already sparked a great deal of debate both in Australia and overseas with respect to the future regulation of the financial sector. The government of course has taken decisive immediate action to deal with the early consequences - the early issues - emerging from the international financial crisis. In particular, of course, I refer to the guarantees provided to the banking and financial institutions in Australia and our $10 billion Economic Security Strategy: the package of stimulus - the package of spending - to flow into economic activity and continue growth and employment at reasonable levels.We are also, at the same time, turning our attention to wider regulatory issues. There has been considerable debate about what lessons can be learnt, particularly internationally but also for Australia specifically, as a result of the international financial crisis. It is worth noting that the Australian regulatory regime, under governments of both persuasions, is strong, has been strong and will be strong in the future. It is robust. In fact, nations overseas have regarded our regime as something of an exemplar that they can look to for inspiration and guidance as they tackle these issues.Although we should never lose vigilance in considering our own options on the domestic front - and there will always be room for reconsideration of regulatory arrangements - the real issues that emerge from the financial crisis are international, particularly in the United States. The Prime Minister has already set out, in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, five principles which we seek to insert into the international debate on these issues with respect to regulatory reform: stronger regulation of non-bank financial institutions, stronger capital adequacy requirements, tackling the culture of institutionalised greed and excessive executive salaries, stricter accounting rules and a greater role for the International Monetary Fund in analysing the global spread of risk.Inevitably, some of these themes are already being debated. I specifically commend to honourable members work by an Australian who works for the OECD, Adrian Blundell-Wignall, who has highlighted the role, at least from his perspective, that the Basel II capital adequacy rules have played in contributing to the emergence of a mortgage based bubble in both the United States and the UK, with the fall of Northern Rock.I look forward to the debate about these regulatory issues broadening and deepening. In particular, I look forward to a contribution from the opposition on these issues. We know that the opposition suggests that the Leader of the Opposition, given that he has a background in some of these things - he is a former investment banker, of course - has something to bring to the table on these questions. There is personal experience and personal expertise involved here, and no doubt he will have a lot to contribute, which makes it even more puzzling that we have heard very little from the opposition or the opposition leader about the third item on the Prime Minister's list of reform issues: the question of excessive salaries for executives in the financial sector. There is no doubt that in this instance the opposition leader does have significant personal experience to draw upon.Perhaps the opposition leader could explain to the Australian people why it is necessary that people leading these organisations need to have salaries in the vicinity of $10 million to incentivise them to work really hard and to put their best into the job. Why is that necessary? And perhaps he might explain to us how he manages to turn up to work as opposition leader on a humble couple of hundred grand. I look forward to the contribution from the Leader of the Opposition on these questions. -  - It is pretty easy to get them agitated on this question, Mr Speaker. It is pretty easy to get them agitated on this. -  - I think in future I will just stand up and say, 'Executive salaries,' and that will be enough. Thus far all we have from the opposition on this issue is silence. Silence! We know who the opposition represent. We know where they stand on these issues, but we have heard nothing but silence. It is long overdue, if they seek to play a major role in the fundamental issues that are in play internationally in the medium term as a result of the international financial crisis, that we hear something about the issue. What do they say about reining in excessive executive salaries?</DOC>

 - As the honourable member would know, the government's guarantee extends to APRA regulated deposit-taking institutions, and that is the responsible course of action. It is also the course of action which was the subject of advice to us by the Secretary of the Treasury, whose advice we take seriously, whereas the Leader of the Opposition chooses to castigate, attack and demean him at any opportunity. We knew that the Leader of the Opposition overstepped yesterday when the member for Higgins, who has been recently engaged in an animated way in the debate in this chamber, suddenly buried his head in his books when the Leader of the Opposition went from being out of touch to being out of control. - The guarantee which was provided by the government in its statement on the weekend before last was taken on the basis of the advice that we received and was necessary to provide and maintain stability in the Australian financial system, which is of relevance to all Australians, includingÂ  those in rural Australia. The second point is this: the consequences of the government's action flow through to the financial system more broadly. If you have continued stability in the Australian financial system, frankly it benefits over time all users of credit in the economy. Obviously those who are immediately covered by the deposit guarantee will obtain that benefit in the immediate term, but more broadly that, together with the critical provisions by the government to provide a guarantee for the wholesale term funding arrangements of the banks, helps to bring and maintain stability for the entire system. My third point in response to the Leader of the Opposition's question is this: if you look at the cost of finance out there for all Australians, look carefully at what has happened in the period since the government made this announcement on Sunday a week ago. - The member for Curtin says, 'Turmoil!' The turmoil was along these lines: the ANZ reduced its interest rates by 25 basis points, the National Australia Bank by 20 basis points, the Commonwealth Bank by 21 basis points and Westpac by 20 basis points - all of that being of no consequence. But I had forgotten that the alternative Prime Minister regards a 25-basis-point move as irrelevant. Remember that he said that after seven interest rate increases on the part of those opposite. - I assume, therefore, that the alternative Prime Minister is now announcing new policy on the run as well. We know what one policy is at present: to have a depositors guarantee that excludes 40 per cent of all deposits around the country. That is where their $100,000 policy goes. If anyone thinks that that is not their policy, Senator Brandis, a member of the shadow cabinet, reconfirmed on national radio today that that is their policy. Those opposite, in answering questions from their constituents, need to answer this question: what of the 40 per cent of depositors which are not covered by their $100,000 cap? That is something which they need to answer - not just to those depositors but also to the roll-on implications for the stability of the entire system.There is a further set of consequences which have flowed of course from the government's decisive action a week or so ago, and that is that over the past days we have seen spreads narrow, especially in Australia, and the cost of borrowing for banks fall. The key measure of liquidity in the Australian dollar interbank market, the spread between the 90-day bank bill and the three-month overnight index swap, the OIS, has fallen from 93 basis points at the close of business on 10 October to 63 basis points at COB on 21 October. We have a long way to go in order to maintain continued stability in the Australian financial system but, because of the action that the government took the weekend before last, we have seen movements in interest rates by banks head in the right direction from the point of view of the general economy. We have also seen spreads narrow in terms of the interbank lending rate. This is good news for the general economy and for those who draw upon these financial institutions for loans which they need to get on with the business of expanding their activities out there in the economy, maintaining their business operations or lending for mortgage purposes.One of the key motivating factors this government had in mind in providing this unprecedented guarantee for wholesale term funding for the APRA regulated banking institutions was this: to ensure that in the future we have our banks in a position to provide loans for businesses and small businesses across Australia. You could have sat there, as those opposite presumably are arguing, twiddled your thumbs and done nothing or you could have acted decisively. This government, acting on the interests of small business across the country, in rural areas and in non-rural areas, took the necessary decisive action. What has flowed in terms of recent moves in spreads and in interest rate actions by the banks is now on the documentary record. That is real action and real results as opposed to short-term politics, in which the alternative Prime Minister of Australia has now become a first-class honours degree holder.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. The member for Ballarat represents one of the premier grain-growing districts in Victoria. I met today with the VFF about the bleak outcomes of this year's winter crops throughout much of Victoria. In response to a question earlier in the week, I mentioned that a meeting took place with the major rural financial institutions on Friday of last week. I add that, at that meeting, confidence was expressed in the government's Economic Security Strategy and in the capacity of all of them to continue to service Australia's farmers. It was expressed not only by the major Australian banks and Rabobank but also by Landmark - Landmark being a non APRA regulated financial institution. We were sitting around the table with the banks, who expressed full confidence in the government's Economic Security Strategy and in their capacity to be able to serve Australia's farmers.Today we have had further announcements, with the Westpac-NFF Commodity Index coming out. It was reported today that global farm prices - that is, the farm-gate prices around the world - have fallen by nine per cent amid the fallout from the global financial crisis. However, in Australian dollar terms, that fall has been limited to 1.7 per cent, as the lower Australian dollar, which was trading at around 69c earlier in the week, took the sting out of much of the decline in the commodity prices. Westpac agribusiness economist Andrew Hanlon said, 'The Australian dollar can play a cushioning role during such volatile times.' It is also the case that the inflation rate information that was released today has been well and truly felt in many ways by Australia's farmers. We have seen the global prices of fertiliser increase in extraordinary ways over the last 12 months, in some cases going as far as tripling and beyond. The Australian prices and increases have increased somewhat less than that, once again cushioned by the Australian dollar.The question also asked why they need strong representation similar to the strong representation that the member for Ballarat has always provided farmers in that part of the country. I should also acknowledge while I am talking about strong representation for regional areas that this afternoon the new member for Lyne will be making his first speech to this place. We all wish him well. Members on both sides understand the importance of strong representation in that part of New South Wales. Indeed, the member for Hume, I understand, has a very good understanding of the need for strong representation for Port Macquarie. Senator Heffernan also has a good understanding of the need for strong representation for Port Macquarie. I notice this is not a view shared by the Leader of the New South Wales Nationals, Andrew Stoner, who today, quite horribly, said of the member for Hume:If I had my way, I'd march him out at dawn, put a blindfold on him and shoot him.At a time when it came to looking for confidence, when it was a clear choice in the region of Port Macquarie between choosing a member of the National Party and choosing a country Independent, the people of Port Macquarie chose a country Independent; indeed, many members of the Liberal Party made that choice too.</DOC>

 - As I have said in response to questions by the honourable member before, the government took decisive action on the weekend in question based on the advice provided to us by the Secretary of the Treasury following his own consultations with the regulatory authorities, including the Reserve Bank. That is the basis of the government's action. The government stands by that action. It was necessary in order to maintain stability in the financial system. If the Leader of the Opposition, the alternative Prime Minister, were out consulting with business at the moment and asking the business communities and the finance communities what their response to the government's guarantee is at both levels, it would not reflect the tonality of his contribution to this debate. They have welcomed a statement of confidence and action by the government, as opposed to those opposite, who are engaging again in short-term politics.Again, I go to the clear contrast between the policy of those opposite and that of the government. On the $100,000 guarantee which those opposite have put forward, let us be very precise: that leaves marooned 40 per cent of total deposits. That leaves marooned, according to Treasury advice, 750,000 deposit accounts in the country. In other words, the Liberal policy, the opposition policy, the alternative government policy, as reiterated again today by Senator Brandis, a member of the shadow cabinet, is to leave out there without any guarantee whatsoever 750,000 - that is, three-quarters of a million - deposit accounts. That is what Mr Turnbull stands for.Our alternative is to provide a guarantee for all deposits. Those deposits which are in excess of $1 million represent 0.5 per cent of deposit accounts. Under government policy, all deposits are covered. For the 0.5 per cent of all deposit accounts with more than $1 million, the regulators are discussing what insurance premium should apply to them. By contrast, the policy being advocated by the alternative government is to leave out there without any protection or any guarantee whatsoever 40 per cent of this nation's deposits - 750,000 deposit accounts. That is the difference between a government which has taken decisive action on behalf of the stability of the entire financial system and which is mindful of the interests of all depositors and those opposite who would cut loose three-quarters of a million depositors across the country. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: there is a difference between providing early, firm and decisive action in support of the financial system and in support of the long-term growth of this economy and the short-term, populist politics in which the Leader of the Opposition now specialises.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know what a strong interest she has in supporting our older Australians. The government are continuing to deliver for our older Australians, because we understand how tough they are doing it. This government has taken very swift and decisive action in its Economic Security Strategy. This is about helping older Australians facing the rising costs of living.Last week our $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy included assistance for four million pensioners, carers and seniors. It is an immediate $4.8 billion down payment on long-term pension reform, with the one-off tax-free payments of a lump sum of $1,400 for a single age pensioner or $2,100 for a couple. People who are receiving carer allowance will also receive $1,000 for each eligible person being cared for. All payments will be made in the fortnight beginning 8 December. This builds on the $7.5 billion in additional support for pensioners and carers that the government provided for in our first budget. The budget provided a whole range of measures for older Australians, including increasing the utilities allowance, the seniors bonus, the telephone allowance and also national transport concessions. We are committed to long-term pension reform through a very thorough, comprehensive review.The decisive action shown in the Economic Security Strategy builds on providing for older Australians in other areas, particularly the $41.5 billion being provided over the next four years to aged and community care. This means an average of $41,500 a resident a year. Indeed, no government in Australian history has provided more when it comes to aged care. When we look at the ageing of our population, we see that we have the world's second longest life expectancy. We have currently got nearly 3,000 Australians aged 100 and over and by the year 2055 we are going to have 78,000 Australians aged 100 and over.We are also supporting older Australians and their carers who want to stay in their homes for as long as possible. On Monday I announced $12 million in national grants to improve respite services for carers. This is part of our $194 million National Respite for Carers Program. Carers are the unsung heroes of our nation, and I pay tribute to them. We are a government meeting the challenges of the 21st century, and we are very proud to be providing for our older Australians. - Yes.</DOC>

 - It is not a deposit tax. It is a fee to reflect a commercial reality, which will reflect the fact that there is a government guarantee - and I did not say necessarily a million dollars; I said a million dollars or above. That is what I said. -  - These commercial arrangements are being worked through by the RBA and by the Treasury. They will be published in good time. We are going through consultation with industry and it will reflect commercial reality. It reflects the fact that the government has a determination to provide a comprehensive guarantee. What those opposite simply do not understand is how the world has changed so much in the last three weeks. When we moved to put in place this comprehensive guarantee, with the full support of the Reserve Bank, with the full support of the Treasury, the opposition said that they were going to give us their full support. Now, today, they have walked away from it altogether. Indeed, they have got another policy. It is a policy by the hour. They are now suggesting in this House that there ought to be a guarantee on non-deposit investments. They want to walk into this House and talk about the potential liability of our guarantee.Our guarantee is responsible. It was put in place because of what was going on internationally. Governments elsewhere in the world were making very substantial guarantees to their banks and if we had not acted there would have been severe consequences for the Australian banking system. But those opposite are so utterly irresponsible, they want to come into this House and trash the guarantee. Well, they can do that, but this government stands for good policy. We stand for protecting the Australian banking system. We stand for ensuring that its stability can mean over time that households and businesses receive lower interest rates, and they are starting to see the benefit. I guess that is what really rubs up against the Leader of the Opposition. He only sees this as a personal opportunity. He does not see this as a chance to strengthen the national interest. This government will defend the national interest all of the time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question. He certainly does understand that these are hard economic times for many Australians, and that particularly includes almost 29,000 pensioners in Bendigo. Those pensioners in Bendigo, like pensioners in other parts of Australia, are finding it difficult to make ends meet, with the costs of groceries and the costs of other bills continuing to go up. As he knows and pensioners know, it certainly has been very difficult to manage the household budget. We have certainly made some modest steps to help our pensioners meet those increased costs of living with the Economic Security Strategy. The $4.8 billion that is going into lump-sum payments for pensioners will certainly help.These payments are certainly needed to help pensioners cope with cost-of-living pressures, especially after the 12 years of neglect by the former government. Last night the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development released a report card on poverty, revealing the former government's shameful record on older Australians. It reveals that Australia had the fourth highest rate in income poverty of the elderly, and during the time of the Liberal government there was an increase of 4.6 percentage points in income poverty of the elderly. Under the Liberals, for singles over 65 the poverty rate in Australia was a staggering 50 per cent. A staggering 50 per cent of people over the age of 65 were in a very serious state of poverty, the third highest level in the OECD. This of course is a searing indictment of the opposition's record in government on older Australians. We know, thanks to Mal Brough, that when they were in the cabinet they ignored the needs of older Australians and rejected a proposal to increase the pension.Even though there is this damning report on the efforts of those opposite for older Australians, just today we learned that the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate is saying - and I am sure the Prime Minister will be interested in this - that he has never agreed with the Economic Security Strategy. In other words, that must mean that he wants to take the lump-sum payments off all pensioners. Unlike the Liberals, of course, we intend to make sure the lump-sum payments happen. We know that the Leader of the Opposition said that he was not going to quibble, he was not going to argue with the government's Economic Security Strategy. Obviously the quibbling is well and truly underway by the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate - well and truly quibbling out there.A correspondent from the Sydney Morning Herald, Annabel Crabb, really nailed it yesterday with a headline: 'They don't call me the Vicar of Quibbly for nothing'. That is certainly the advice from the Sydney Morning Herald. - The Leader of the Opposition seems to think that this is just funny. In case the Leader of the Opposition thinks that people are complimenting him on his quibbling with the government's economic strategy, I would actually refer him to some remarks from individuals who have been corresponding on a news website. This is from Garth, who really seems to understand exactly where the Leader of the Opposition is. This is from Garth, writing on a news website, and I am sure people will agree with this:Maybe Malcolm is having another each-way bet. Make up your mind, Malcolm - Garth says - You're either with the rest of the world in dealing with the financial crisis or you're against it.Another person says:It's hardly surprising that the merchant banker is firing from the lip.And so they go on - all of them recognising that the Leader of the Opposition just quibbles with the government's efforts to make sure that pensioners and others who are doing it tough get the support that they need.</DOC>

 - I am always gladdened when the Leader of the Opposition, the alternative Prime Minister of the country, resorts to his high school debating tactics. There is nothing like pulling out the old dictionary and saying, 'Do you know that the meaning of X in the 17th century OED is Y and the Shorter Oxford says the following and the Macquarie says this and the Collins says that?' This is actually about serious questions of national economic leadership. What I would say to the Leader of the Opposition is: what is required of leadership is that, at a time of global financial crisis, you stand by the Secretary of the Treasury rather than attack him, stand by the Reserve Bank of Australia rather than attack that institution -  - What we have had on display from the alternative Prime Minister in recent days is quite remarkable. He first of all said the global financial crisis is a 'hype'. Despite the concerns of 10 million people with superannuation policies, the response of the Leader of the Opposition is that that is all hype. For people concerned about interest rate increases when there was an interest rate increase of 25 basis points, he said that was overdramatised. How out of touch can you get! - Being out of touch on the global financial crisis and being out of touch on interest rates is one thing, but yesterday in this parliament being right out of control in his attack on the Secretary of the Treasury places the Leader of the Opposition in an entirely new league. This country requires strong economic leadership at a time of global financial crisis and getting behind the institutions of government as is necessary; and, on the measures which the government have enacted in relation to this guarantee, we have done so on the basis of advice from the Treasury and, through them, the regulators. I stand by everything the Treasurer has said.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I know he is deeply interested in the education futures of the people in his electorate. The Rudd Labor government is committed - An incident having occurred in the gallery -  - As I was saying, the Rudd Labor government is committed to nation building. That is why in the May budget we created three nation-building funds, including the Education Investment Fund, and we committed at that time to providing a round of $304 million in funding in 2009 to assist universities with their capital expenditure. This was to be a transitional round from the old Higher Education Endowment Fund to the new $11 billion Education Investment Fund.As the Prime Minister has said, in the face of the global financial crisis and its flow-through into the real economy, the government has taken decisive action and is also looking at fast-tracking infrastructure. In the spirit of fast-tracking, the government has been working with Mr Phillip Clark AM, who leads the Higher Education Endowment Fund advisory board and is leading the transition to the new Education Investment Fund, on processing the current applications from universities for this $304 million which is available.Today I am pleased to announce that Senator Carr and I are inviting 14 universities to bring forward full applications for the 2009 funding, based on the recommendations of the advisory board headed by Phil Clark. This round focuses on strengthening research in Australian universities, and there is a wide variety of proposals that are in the 14 that are to be brought forward for full applications. The 14 proposals being brought forward for further consideration are worth nearly $700 million. The successful expressions of interest, for which universities will be asked to submit a full application, include a proposal from Macquarie University for a hearing hub, a proposal from Murdoch University for a new education facility, a proposal from the University of Ballarat for an innovation and enterprise centre, a proposal from the University of Canberra for an international microsimulation centre, a proposal from the University of Melbourne for an institute for infection and immunity, a proposal from the University of Queensland for a world-class veterinary science facility, a proposal from the University of Sydney for a centre for obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and a proposal from the University of Wollongong for a smart infrastructure facility. Each of the 14 proposals will shortly receive correspondence asking them to bring forward a full application for round 2. This additional investment comes on top of the half a billion dollars already made available to universities through the Better Universities Renewal Fund.I am asked about any barriers or impediments to this new investment in Australian universities, and I regret to advise the House that we still do not know what the view of the opposition really is in relation to the government's nation-building agenda, including the Education Investment Fund. On one day they are opposed to it, on another day they appear to be in support of it, but we have no reliable statements whether or not it is the intention of the Liberal opposition to block legislation setting up the Education Investment Fund, amongst others.When it comes to delivering an education revolution, and that is what the government is committed to delivering, we are calling on the Liberal Party to get out of the way and allow the government to make a difference for Australian universities. We know that they are bearing a legacy of neglect after 12 long years where universities were treated with contempt by the Howard government. We are standing ready to make new investments in our universities. The one question we cannot answer is whether the Liberal Party will continue to treat Australian universities with the kind of contempt it treated them with for more than a decade.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for her question. All deposits over a threshold level would attract the fee - let's be very clear. Why is this the case? Because it just ensures that banks do not get a free kick for the guarantee, and it also addresses the concerns that those opposite said they had about the impact on the short-term money market. This does give very considerable benefit to the banks. The commercial reality is that this fee will reflect funding costs, and it is there to be charged to provide some competitive neutrality out there and ensure that funds have a choice about where they go. But we have a comprehensive guarantee. Those opposite now oppose it. It is clear for all to see. They propose a situation where 40 per cent of deposits would no longer be covered by their support. They deserve to be absolutely condemned, and now they have come up with the extraordinary proposition that the banks get a huge free kick. Not from this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. His community, particularly in Cairns, has been taking very active action in tackling alcohol abuse in the community, including the Just Think campaign. Of course as a national government we are determined to tackle the problems that exist in our community associated with alcohol abuse. Interestingly, figures that were released yesterday by the Salvation Army, based on a Roy Morgan poll which they had organised, found that more than one Australian in every eight have experience of children in their family being frightened or embarrassed by relatives' drinking habits. It goes up to one in five Australians who know of verbal arguments or threats within their family due to alcohol, and sadly for 11 per cent those confrontations have been physical.Members would be aware that there are plenty of other shocking statistics that show trends that we must be worried about in this parliament. On alcohol consumption in any given week, approximately one in 10 12- to 17-year-olds is binge drinking or drinking at a risky level. Binge drinking leads to violence. Last year more than three-quarters of a million Australians were physically abused by persons under the influence of alcohol. Members would be aware that on this side of the House we have acted to close the tax loophole created by those opposite on alcopops. We have also announced that $53 million is being targeted to an immediate binge drinking strategy. As yet we have not had any indication from those opposite about whether they support our binge drinking strategy.Members would also be aware that at the end of June the Rudd government opened applications for community groups to apply for funds to develop effective and sustainable partnerships to combat binge drinking. We believe governments have a role to play and we believe communities have a role to play. We would like the Liberal Party to tell us whether they are going to support these sorts of community level initiatives. A sum of $7.2 million has been made available for these community level initiatives for organisations such as sporting clubs, youth groups, church organisations and others. It is possible to obtain up to $150,000 for individual groups or $250,000 for groups in partnerships, who are able to bid for this money for innovative projects aimed at preventing or reducing binge drinking, particularly for young people. People might be interested to know in this House that 293 organisations have applied for funding at the time that applications closed. - It is clear that yet again the member for Flinders is not interested in community level initiatives to oppose binge drinking in his community - yet again determined not to be part of the solution. - I am pleased to hear that from the member for Flinders, although the rest of the Liberal Party have not yet indicated whether they will support these community level initiatives that are part of the government's binge drinking campaign. Of course those 293 applications still need to be appropriately assessed. But what we would like to know, given that the Liberal Party have been so opposed at every step of the way to any action that we want to take to reduce harmful drinking in our community, is whether the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and member for Curtin will be supporting the six applications that have been received from her electorate. Will the member for Warringah support the five applications that have been submitted from his electorate? Perhaps the new member for Gippsland will be interested to know about and will perhaps advocate for the four applications received from his electorate. We have received five applications from the member for Murray's electorate. In South Australia, the member for Grey will be able to tell the eight organisations in his electorate whether or not he supports these sorts of funding programs from the government. The Liberal and National parties have to indicate to their electorates and to this parliament whether they are going to do anything and take any action to tackle excessive alcohol consumption in our electorates. What role are the opposition going to play in being part of the solution to this community-wide problem? We in the government are determined to tackle this issue. We have a growing list of supporters in the community, in health services, in hospitals and in the police who are backing our action. Are the opposition going to?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question because it comes back to a point we were discussing earlier. The government's guarantee applies to deposits in deposit-taking institutions which are supervised by APRA. What the member is talking about is unlisted managed investment schemes. They are market linked investments. They are not deposits. They are worthy investments, they are worthwhile investments, but they are not deposits. The government has chosen not to put a guarantee on those funds; it is very clear. This in no way reflects on the quality of those institutions. It does not reflect on their investments. But you cannot come in here and argue about more guarantees elsewhere in the system and then say you are going to go out and provide a comprehensive guarantee for every market linked investment in the country. That would be the height of economic irresponsibility.

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. He has a not insignificant Defence Force presence in his electorate and I know, thanks to his representations, he is a great supporter of them and their work. Australia has a longstanding and deep interest in a stable, secure and prosperous East Timor. Like the member for Deakin, and I am sure all members of the House, the government is very pleased with the progress of our near neighbour.East Timor's emergence as a new independent nation has not been a smooth one. Our troop presence there goes back to 1999, when, under the banner of INTERFET, we lead a coalition of nation states in responding to post independence referendum violence. Our current deployment was a response to a re-emergence of that violence back in May 2006. This time as the International Stabilisation Force, Australian troops partnered with New Zealand troops to restore law and order in East Timor. Their very good work of course continues today. The mission of our troops is to provide a security presence as a back-up to the United Nations police force and the police and military forces of East Timor. It has been a very successful mission. The men and women of the Australian Defence Force and the New Zealand Defence Force are entitled to be very, very proud of their efforts and their work.Our mission is by no means complete. The peace in East Timor remains fragile, as was demonstrated just in February this year when an assassination attempt was made against President Horta, and Prime Minister Gusmao's car also came under attack. That is why the government expects to maintain a presence in East Timor for some time to come. That also is the express wish of the democratically elected government of East Timor.While I am pleased to say that the East Timor police and military forces have made great strides in their development as national institutions, they still have some way to go before the full mantle of security can be assumed by them. However, good progress has been made and as a result, and after very careful consideration, the government has decided that the time is right to reduce our total force in East Timor under Operation Astute to approximately 650 personnel from early next year. This constitutes a reduction of about 100 soldiers and reflects the situation on the ground today, our optimism about future stability in East Timor and the development of institutions there.I said the decision to draw down some of our troops was taken after very careful consideration and assessment of the security situation in East Timor. The government was very mindful of the premature decision of the former government to draw down troops in 2005, a decision which by necessity was followed by a decision to restore troops in 2006. This is partly why on this occasion our drawdown at this stage is a very modest one and a very cautious one. Following the drawdown, the International Stabilisation Force will still number 790 Australian and New Zealand personnel. But the reduction in the number of deployed Australian troops recognises the ongoing calm security environment in East Timor and Dili's resolve towards an ability to take care of its own security. Despite the limited drawdown, the mission of the International Stabilisation Force will remain unchanged. Our troops will continue to provide security support to the government of East Timor and to the United Nations mission in East Timor. The force will also focus on community assistance and other development of East Timorese security forces.The Australian government will not leave East Timor in the lurch without adequate institutions to manage their own security. Our Defence Cooperation Program is delivering around $8.2 million worth of assistance to the East Timorese defence force to further build its capacity. Examples include the development of a specialist training wing, which I visited earlier this year, and the ongoing operation of the English language school. We will continue to work with the government of East Timor, the United Nations and our international partners to help East Timor move down the path of stability and prosperity. On behalf of all Australians and all members of the House, I pay tribute to and thank the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who have done and continue to do very good work in East Timor.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for his question. I am aware of the very, very serious issue he raises and can report to the House that the problem facing our special forces soldiers relates to a decision of the independent Defence Remuneration Tribunal of August 2007. I can also report that special forces headquarters has been working on this issue for some time. I can further report that Defence has agreed to stop any recovery of those, what might be deemed to be, overpayments. - I know that all members of the House will agree and, indeed, all members of the Australian community will agree that all of our servicemen and women, but in particular in this case our special forces who are doing such important and dangerous work in Afghanistan, are due every consideration and every reward for the work they do. I can guarantee to the House that this problem will be fixed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and acknowledge that he has a strong relationship with Defence Force personnel in his community. The member for Solomon is a good bloke who coaches the local Defence Force football team and gets on very well with the community. He has been a great advocate for the Defence Force community in Darwin whilst he has been the member.Prior to the last election, the Labor Party made a decision, based on its view that we needed to do more for Defence Force families, that what we should do is provide progressive access to basic medical and dental care to spouses and children of Australian Defence Force personnel. After the election, we reviewed our commitment, took advice from the department and from Defence Force families across Australia and made a decision that we would not proceed in the way we had originally intended. Instead, unlike the members opposite, who do not have a policy in this area, who are not committed to assisting Defence Force families - who are not committed and nor have they committed themselves to supporting a program to provide access to free basic medical and dental care to Defence Force families, even though they are critics of ours - what we have chose to do, as a result of a review of our commitment and understanding the desires of the Defence Force community for choice and flexibility, is to provide capacity for Defence Force families on a trial basis, initially in five locations -  - And he does not know what he is talking about, to wit. - The member for Paterson and the member for Herbert and every other critic on the other side of the chamber would be aware that in the May budget we committed to providing basic medical care services to families at Singleton, Cairns, Katherine and East Sale and in the Karratha and Pilbara regions. - We then made a decision, which I announced last week, to extend the trial to two other communities - Townsville and Darwin. The trial to the initial five will start in May of next year. The trials to Katherine and Darwin will start in the first half of the next financial year. Once these trials have been introduced, they will provide access to free basic medical services and $300 for dental services to 16,000 Defence Force dependants. That is a quarter of the total number of dependants of the Australian Defence Force. As we are informed gradually of the implementation of these trials, we will move subsequently to provide this opportunity to all people across the Defence Force. I make the point that we have made this judgement based on making sure we have proper evidence after our trials and making sure we can - The member for Paterson then left the chamber. - provide this service in the most cost-efficient and effective way and, at the same time, satisfy their desire for choice and flexibility of medical practitioner.</DOC>

 - When the Treasurer introduced the Financial Claims Scheme into the parliament on, I think, Wednesday of last week, the Treasurer made it absolutely clear at that time that the interrelationship between the Financial Claims Scheme on the one hand - that is, the guarantee on bank deposits - and the guarantees for term wholesale funding on the other would be coordinated in the implementation arrangements between both the bank and the Treasury and others, and that is the process which has unfolded over the last week or so, as is normal. The Treasurer indicated that was the process. We have had the regulators at work on this process. That is the normal thing to do because there are complex negotiations on implementation between not only the regulators, on the one hand, including the Treasury, but also the banks themselves and also relevant international jurisdictions. So these matters will be resolved and published in their finality when these deliberations by the regulators with the banks are concluded. That is the proper way to do things, and that is what we indicated when the Treasurer introduced his legislation last week. Can I say this to the Leader of the Opposition, who finds this entire exercise entirely amusing: the basic facts are these. The government acted decisively in the middle of a financial crisis. Secondly, what happened was that we took action to -  - As the honourable member knows, as in my previous answer to his question, I am dealing with the process for the final determination of the arrangements for the premiums to be attached to term wholesale funding arrangements and those which may apply to depositors at the upper range of a million dollars or slightly beyond. In the normal course of events, that will be determined after proper consultation with the regulators. That is the proper way to do business. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition, having answered his question, that we on this side of the House have taken decisive action to ensure that we have soothed financial markets. We have taken decisive action because every mum and dad in the gallery today would like to know that their deposits are guaranteed. Under the actions of this government, that guarantee has been provided. Furthermore, as a consequence of that action, we have also seen, through the other actions taken by the government, downward pressure on interest rates.The Leader of the Opposition does not want to hear this, but what has happened in the period since the government took this action? We have seen confidence increasingly restored, when we had so many mums and dads out there concerned about the banks, having watched all the negative news on their television sets coming from abroad, because we acted with a decisive policy statement on the guarantee. Those opposite, wedded to this position, maintained that they would make a guarantee available only on deposits up to $100,000, leaving therefore unguaranteed, unprotected, according to Liberal Party policy, 40 per cent of all deposit accounts. That is quite extraordinary - 40 per cent of deposits.So what I would say to those opposite is simply this: on this question, those opposite need to reflect long and hard on the consequences of the actions which the government has taken in providing confidence to mums and dads out in the community. Secondly, on the question of the impact which these decisions by the government have had on the banks, look at what has happened with interest rates in the last week or so. We have had all four major banks bring down interest rates by between 20 and 25 basis points. If you look at the statements which have been put forward by the NAB and the ANZ, what have they said? The NAB have said:... policy measures announced by the Australian Government earlier this month have started to have a positive effect ... we hope to be in a position where we can pass on further interest rate cuts to our customers.That is as a direct consequence of what the government has done - unwelcome news on the part of the Leader of the Opposition but I would say a good piece of news when it comes to those out there with mortgages. Listen to what the ANZ Chief Executive Officer has said:We are pleased to deliver on the promise we made in January to pass on reductions in funding costs as we see market conditions easing.Then he goes on to say:... policy measures both here in Australia and around the world have restored some confidence in the global investment community and this is resulting in an easing of high wholesale funding rates.These are the concrete actions which have flowed as a consequence of what the government did Sunday week ago. The Leader of the Opposition is out there with his own policy on guarantees of deposits up to $100,000 but not beyond that, leaving everyone else out there without guarantee. That is his approach. Our approach is strong decisive action which has not only helped in terms of confidence in the general community, with mums and dads concerned about their deposits, but also with the cost of finance for mortgages.Our action has also been supported by the Treasury and by the Reserve Bank. The Leader of the National Party laughs at this. I would suggest that those opposite should not laugh when it comes to further undermining of this country's independent financial institutions. The Reserve Bank said the other day that the decisions taken by the government were sensible and that the RBA supported them. Furthermore, Dr John Laker of APRA said:The government's deposit term and funding guarantee, which APRA fully supports, has calmed what was a growing disquiet on the part of some depositors.Put all these things together and you had the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority backing the government's actions when it took its decision; you had the Reserve Bank of Australia backing the government's actions when it took its decision; you had the Secretary to the Treasury doing the same; you had the mainstream commercial banks saying that because of these actions the actual cost of finance flowing through to consumers has been reduced and they themselves saying so explicitly in their statements. That is what the government has done. We have the support of these independent financial regulators.Those opposite, lead by the Leader of the Opposition, have spent their entire time undermining the integrity and the independence of these independent institutions. Earlier this week, the Leader of the Liberal Party came to the dispatch box and said -  - The Leader of the Opposition is sensitive to the attacks he has come under legitimately because of his attacks on the independent financial regulators. We know that Malcolm believes that Malcolm knows best; we actually believe the Reserve Bank knows better, that the Prudential Regulatory Authority knows better, also that the Secretary to the Treasury knows better. Here we have the alternative Prime Minister of Australia standing up in this place and calling into question whether the Secretary to the Treasury should be dismissed. That is what he said. He refused to come in and repudiate that. He then unleashes the dogs of war in the Senate yesterday through Senator Abetz, in a scripted script from the Leader of the Opposition's office, where Senator Abetz attacked the integrity of the Secretary to the Treasury. And what did the Leader of the Opposition do about that? Nothing whatsoever.Early this week, the member for North Sydney questioned whether the word of the Secretary to the Treasury counted for anything at all. I say to those opposite that that was just phase one. Phase two was the member for Canning this morning attacking the integrity and independence of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. That is what you did and you did so in orchestration, I presume, with the Leader of the Opposition's office. I say to the member for Canning, acting again as one of the dogs of war, unleashed by - Government members - Get it right! - The Leader of the Opposition, of course, has not retracted his comments earlier in the week when he canvassed the possibility of dismissing the Secretary of the Treasury because he disapproves of the Secretary of the Treasury. He then unleashed the dogs of war in the Senate to launch a further attack on the Secretary of the Treasury; finds that entirely amusing. His office today then unleashed the member for Canning to launch an attack on the Reserve Bank of Australia. His remarks said that Glenn Stevens had been caught out: he put up interest rates before the election, during the election, when the rest of the world were bringing down interest rates. In other words, it was an orchestrated attack by the Liberal Party, attacking the independence and the integrity of the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and attacking the Secretary of the Treasury. And earlier we had the attack on ASIC itself on the question of the future of short selling. These are three of the principal arms of Australia's independent financial regulators. What we have is the Leader of the Liberal Party launching a short-term political attack on their independence. I would say this to the Leader of the Liberal Party: if you have any interest in the long-term -  - What we have had from the Leader of the Opposition, the alternative Prime Minister of Australia, is an attack on our independent institutions. The Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull: so arrogant, so out of touch and now so out of control that he cannot even bring himself to support the independent financial institutions of Australia in the midst of a global financial crisis.I conclude with this. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: in the midst of a global financial crisis, leadership requires supporting the independence of our financial and economic regulators; the abandonment of leadership, as you have demonstrated, lies in taking short-term political pot shots at them. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition: get behind our independent regulators, support the confidence that we need in this economy for the future, rather than simply pandering to your own short-term political advantage; arrogant, out of control, out of touch.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. In uncertain global times, confidence in key economic institutions, in key financial institutions and in key regulators is absolutely paramount. That is particularly the case given that we are in the midst of the worst financial market crisis since the Great Depression. Because of that it is indeed surprising, I think, that the opposition have over the past 48 hours gone out of their way to slur some of our finest public servants and to trash some of our finest economic institutions. Just think about that for a moment. Given what is going on around the world, why would the opposition choose this time to attack the head of the Treasury, an independent Public Service department - a man who has worked for both sides of politics and has been with that department all his working life? Why would they do that in the middle of a global financial crisis?The Leader of the Opposition was given the opportunity to come into the House and apologise for that attack, but he simply was not man enough. What is worse is that it was because the Secretary of the Treasury had the temerity to say that regulators supported the government guarantee on deposits that he had to be trashed. So what happened after that? What happened was that Senator Abetz, a senior member of the opposition frontbench in the Senate, attacked the honesty of the Treasury secretary in the middle of a global financial crisis. He certainly did not apologise. And what has happened today? What happened today was something far worse. They sent out the member for Canning to attack the Reserve Bank governor personally. That is what they did - to accuse the Reserve Bank governor of political bias because he put up interest rates prior to the last election. - The member for Canning not only attacked the Reserve Bank governor for political bias, he then accused him of creating chaos in the Australian economy. That is what he did. I am pleased he has had the sense to come into the House and to apologise. But that is not enough. What is required is a complete repudiation of his statements by the Leader of the Opposition. That is what is required. And what is required is an apology from the Leader of the Opposition for the slurs that have been cast on the Treasury secretary and for his personal attack on the Treasury secretary. That is what is required.The Leader of the Opposition said that this financial crisis had just all been hyped up: 'It was not all that serious. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about its impact on the stock market, don't worry about its impact on our financial institutions.' So I guess he would not be worried about the independence of our regulators or the independence of our Reserve Bank. We on this side of the House strongly support the regulators and we strongly support our impartial public servants, and both sides of the House should be doing this at a time of global financial crisis.</DOC>

 - As I indicated in my answer to the Leader of the Opposition in his first question today, the process in which the Reserve Bank and the other regulators, including the Treasury, have been engaged since Sunday a week ago has been, firstly, to resolve the implementation detail of the premium to be attached to the term wholesale funding arrangements for the banks; and, secondly, to resolve the implementation arrangements concerning the deposit guarantee. The interrelationship of those two matters was explicitly canvassed at the time that the Treasurer introduced the financial claims legislation into the House last Wednesday. Since then, as you would normally expect there has been a lot of exchange between the Reserve Bank and the other regulators, including the Secretary to the Treasury, on the detail of that. That is the normal way in which public policy is conducted. Once these matters have been resolved in finality they will be made public, as I have said repeatedly at this dispatch box and as the Treasurer has said repeatedly at this dispatch box.I say this to the Leader of the Opposition: this entire process in the midst of a global financial crisis would be made much easier had we had bipartisan political support for the key financial institutions of Australia. In the space of one week, we have had the Leader of the Opposition launch a political attack on the Secretary to the Treasury, we have had an orchestrated continuation of that attack by his senators in Senate estimates yesterday and on top of that we have had an orchestrated attack on the Governor of the Reserve Bank at the doors this morning and on the independence of the Reserve Bank. Up until now we have had no single statement of repudiation at the dispatch box, let alone an apology, by the alternative Prime Minister of Australia. This is also a pattern of behaviour -  - Mr Speaker, in my answer to the question I said that these matters would be determined when the regulators have concluded their discussions internally and with the banks and with other relevant financial institutions, when they would be placed in the public domain. That goes to the substance of the question which has been asked. Secondly, I have said that the entire process -  - The Leader of the Opposition may be unhappy with the answer. He normally is when it does not suit his short-term political purposes. But what we on this side of the House are on about are the long-term interests of the economy of this nation - and that is the difference. I would say to the alternative Prime Minister of the country, as he would describe himself, that one of the qualifications for office in this country is to support the independence of our financial regulators - a quality and a character element that we have not seen evidenced in his behaviour this last week at all. Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that he was a member of the Howard government and this goes to a question of a pattern of behaviour by the Howard government in relation to public servants who do not toe the political line. Remember the attack on the then Secretary to the Treasury - who is also the Secretary to the Treasury now - when he made an internal speech in the Treasury about why Treasury should be included more in the then government's deliberations on climate change and water. What was the response to that? They unleashed the dogs of war. But much worse - and the member for Higgins knows the detail of this and he should hang his head in shame because it happened under his watch - the bonus which would normally be attracted to the Secretary to the Treasury at that time was then -  - The independence and reputation of our financial regulators is key and critical to each of the matters which the Leader of the Opposition has raised in his question today. Furthermore, the maintenance of the independence of the regulators is doubly important. We had a pattern of behaviour which occurred when the member for Higgins was Treasurer, when the then Secretary to the Treasury had his bonus cut because he had the temerity to deliver a speech which did not meet with the political support of those opposite, and what we see today is a continuation of that pattern of behaviour. This government has a great relationship with the Treasury. -  - So, on the matters raised by the Leader of the Opposition in his question, as I said before in the earlier part of my answer, the final detail of the premiums which would be attached to term wholesale funding and those which are attached to the guarantees for deposits will be released once the regulators have properly concluded their discussions with the banks and other relevant foreign jurisdictions. What I have been seeking to make is simply the associated point: to maintain the integrity of that process, we must maintain and support the integrity of the institutions which are party to that process, one of which is the Treasury. - The government, in our relationship with the Treasury, respect its independence. We respect the independence of the financial regulators. That is very important in dealing with the grave challenges we face in the global financial crisis right now. My simple appeal to those opposite is that they do the same.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question, because the government is committed to protecting all depositors in these uncertain times. Following our announcement on 12 October, we have seen a marked improvement in the operation of financial markets, with spreads falling, resulting in cuts in mortgage rates. This morning, I think, in estimates, Dr John Laker, from APRA said: 'The government's deposit term in funding guarantee, which APRA fully supports, has calmed what was a growing disquiet on the part of depositors.' When the second reading legislation was introduced into the House, I made it very clear to the House that finetuning would take place in the days ahead. That is of course what has been happening. That is what the RBA, APRA and ASIC have been doing. It is what the government have been doing. We have been consulting widely on this question and continuing a series of consultations through today and tomorrow on all of these matters with banks, building societies and credit unions; with financial markets participants; and with those institutions that are not covered by the government guarantee. We do take our responsibilities very seriously, and we are liaising very closely with all of our regulators. We are doing this to ensure deposits are protected and to ensure the ongoing efficient operation of financial markets.As for the details, which have been the subject of some comment - the level above which large deposits will be treated as wholesale funding, how much the fee will be, how a fee will be structured, whether it would be flat, whether it would it be tiered, who would pay and whether it was compulsory or opt in - all those things have been on the agenda, and all of these things which have been on the agenda have been highlighted by me both publicly and in the meetings with regulators and with industry. These are commercially sensitive matters. This is where the opposition really do not get it. This material is commercially sensitive. It has been worked out thoroughly. It has been worked out in accord with the wishes of our regulators. It has been worked out with industry. We will reach a sensible conclusion in a timely manner in the interests of a stable financial system.</DOC>

 - The government is proud of the package that it has announced today. It represents decisive action for the future of the car industry in Australia. Three hundred and thirty-five thousand vehicles are manufactured in this country each year by the Australian auto industry. When you put together the three manufacturing majors, they represent some 60,000-plus employees directly. Putting them together with the rest of the people who are employed in associated industries, it represents some 200,000 people. Overall, the significance of this industry is as follows: about $8 billion worth of gross domestic product, which follows some $5.6 billion in exports. - The global car industry right now, as the honourable member would well know, from Detroit to other car manufacturing centres around the world, is under great stress and pressure. So the alternatives are for any governments around the country to simply turn their backs on that or, as governments past, both Liberal and Labor, have done in this country, to put their shoulders to the wheel in fashioning a new car plan for the future. However, we have done so with a new element, and that is to ensure that we will enable the industry to transform itself over time. What I am concerned about is ensuring that we provide sufficient confidence and underpinnings for the industry going forward at a time when the global financial crisis is bearing down on so many.I realise that this is something which may not attract automatic bipartisan support on the part of those opposite. In fact, I am informed that the member for Curtin has already been on the telephone this morning to various people in the car industry seeking to get up and running some negative comment against the package that we have just launched. The old bush telegraph works fairly quickly - it came back to us fairly quick smart. -  - I notice that the member for Curtin is not disputing what I just said. I say to those opposite: at a time of global financial crisis, at a time of global economic crisis and at a time when we have real challenges in the global economy, it would be good if we had bipartisan support not just in name but in reality for the key challenges we face - not just pretending to be bipartisan but putting our shoulder to the wheel.This government has taken decisive action on guaranteeing bank deposits. We have taken decisive action on a $10.4 billion economic stimulus package. We have taken decisive action again today with a $6.2 billion industry innovation plan for the future of the Australian auto industry - an industry in which we believe.</DOC>

 - As we approach Armistice Day there is a moment for reflection for all members of this House on the extraordinary events of 90 years ago. In the war which was supposed to end all wars and the carnage which ensued in that war we saw so many of Australia's brave young men die. Some 50,000 to 60,000 gave their lives in the service of their country not just at Gallipoli but on the killing fields of France and in trench warfare in Belgium as well.Tomorrow at the 11th hour on the 11th day of the 11th month Australians will stand together in one minute's silence to pay tribute to all those Australian men and women who have fought in the service of our country. We will remember those who gave their lives for the nation. We will remember them not just as brave soldiers, sailors and air men and women but also as wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters. We will honour their courage and we will honour their sacrifice. We will remember that the freedoms that we enjoy today are delivered in part because of the sacrifice which they have made. Their legacy is our inheritance.In honouring the sacrifice of all those who have served our country we will also acknowledge what these extraordinary men and women have taught us. They have endured hardship and adversity with courage and resilience. They have shown us the importance of the bonds of friendship, of perseverance and above all of deep loyalty towards mates. Australians have responded to their country's call to service with pride and dedication and courage in hard-fought battles across a century: the First World War, the Second World War, Korea, Malaya, Vietnam and more recently our operations in East Timor, the Solomons, Iraq and Afghanistan and peacekeeping operations around the world. As we remember the past let us keep in mind all those who wear the uniform of Australia today. As I have said before, there is no higher calling in Australia than to wear this nation's uniform.The events of 1918 may seem now to belong purely in the annals of history because those who fought in that war are no longer with us, but the impact of their sacrifice and the loss of so many of that generation felt in every small country town and every centre in our country still has its effect today. You still run into families who lost fathers and grandfathers. The implications for them personally of the sacrifice delivered by their loved ones in that conflict are still acute and deeply felt. We honour their service, we honour their sacrifice and we as a nation together will commemorate that with the appropriate solemnity tomorrow on the 90th anniversary of the armistice.</DOC>

 - What I find remarkable about the question from the honourable gentleman opposite is his use of the term 'ill-considered' about a package to which he gave unqualified bipartisan support on the first day that it was announced. He can declare bipartisan support one day, but what you need to understand about the member for Wentworth is what he does on the second day. On the day you announce a policy the opposition say they support it and on the next day - whether it is this matter or other elements of policy in recent days - they slowly crab walk away. - It is important to establish, on any particular day, where the Liberal Party happens to stand on any particular policy, because it changes by the day and by the hour. In fact, I noticed that, on ABC Learning Centres, it seems to change by the minute: six positions in four days! - The member for Wentworth rightly points to the fact that finance companies in recent times are experiencing considerable difficulty. The Treasury currently has task forces dealing with a whole category of market linked investments - finance companies, mortgage trusts, property trusts as well as cash management trusts, including finance companies - to deal with the particular dislocations which are flowing to those companies as a consequence of the global financial crisis and the global economic downturn. For the benefit of the honourable gentleman, he should know that motor vehicle finance companies - car finance companies - are experiencing challenges in every Western economy at present. I would suggest to the honourable gentleman that, rather than seeking to make a cheap political point, he should understand that this is a global problem affecting the car industry and affecting finance companies associated with the car industry, not just here but in the United States and Germany as well. The government systematically is working its way through each of the challenges affecting each sector of this economy and we will continue to do so through the task forces we have established with the Treasury and our consultations with the major banks and with the Australian regulators, as we have been doing in recent weeks.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question and congratulate him on the launch of his book, The Twelfth Fish, which I was privileged to play a small part in. And do you know what - it was all his own work! That is unlike the attitude of members opposite, who regard writing as something for staff to do, and even when the staff do it it is not the staffer's work. In some instances they get the father-in-law to do it. That is what the member for Higgins did. So congratulations to the member for Moreton - a new member of the Labor book club. It is good to see.The government has taken decisive action with respect to assisting the Australian vehicle manufacturing industry to meet the challenge of fundamental transformation of that industry. We have put forward a 13-year package of over $6 billion to move the Australian industry to a different configuration to enable the production of fuel-efficient, low-emission vehicles. And this package is a significant element in the government's wider economic strategy - in particular the strategy focusing on the impact of the global financial crisis. Australian industries' challenges are by no means unique. By no means are the challenges facing vehicle manufacturing in Australia unique. In many respects the challenges that are facing the industry here are similar to those facing the United States industry. There is a significant difference, of course, and that is that our industry is of a much smaller scale and therefore much more vulnerable to shifts in consumer demand and wider economic circumstances.It is notable that President-elect Obama is expected to pursue similar strategies to assist a transformation to a more environmentally friendly product in the United States vehicle manufacturing industry. The centrepiece of this strategy is a 10-year, $1.3 billion Green Car Innovation Fund, which leverages on a three to one ratio of private investment to environmentally sound technologies. That is a substantially larger fund than was originally promised by the government at the last election. In addition there is a $3.4 billion Automotive Transformation Scheme to underpin the competitiveness of the motor vehicle manufacturing industry. It is important here to note that this money is to flow on the basis of actions and on the basis of contracts. It is not money upfront; it is money in response to actions and decisions and real investments on the part of the vehicle-manufacturing companies. A third aspect is to continue with the phase-down of tariff protection from 10 per cent to five per cent in January 2010. That, of course, ensures that what is the most inefficient and most regressive way of assisting the industry, through tariff protection, is continuing to be reduced, as previously indicated.Together with the decline in the value of the Australian dollar, cuts in interest rates and, of course, the stimulus from the government's Economic Security Strategy, these initiatives are good news. They are good news for the vehicle-manufacturing industry, they are good news for the 60,000-odd workers directly employed in the industry and they are good news for the much wider range of people whose economic security and opportunity depends on Australia having a strong vehicle manufacturing industry. But it also requires the manufacturers to deliver. This proposal - this plan - requires the manufacturers to invest, to take risk and to demonstrate their commitment to Australia in the long term. They face very substantial challenges and they are, in some respects, dealing with more or less a perfect storm at the moment, given the wider global circumstances and the change in consumer demand. But they have a strong base on which to move forward and the government is committed to assisting them to transform their companies into much more viable activities and operations over the course of the next 10 or 12 years.In conclusion, the government is acting decisively to tackle the economic challenges facing this nation, whether with respect to guaranteeing bank deposits or the Economic Security Strategy that is designed to stimulate economic activity, growth and jobs in the Australian economy or the development of a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in order to deal with that enormous challenge of climate change that was so comprehensively neglected by the previous government and to invest in this instance - via today's announcement - in the structural transformation of one of Australia's most important industries. The global financial crisis is presenting Australia with an enormous challenge, but the businesses of Australia, the working people of Australia and the government of Australia are up to that challenge and together we are going to meet it and defeat it.</DOC>

 - As the honourable member would know, the global financial crisis is impacting on the real economies of all developed and developing economies. In fact, before I go to the heart of the honourable member's question, I draw her attention also to the extraordinary action taken in the last 24 hours by the government of China, an extraordinary fiscal stimulus package which I believe is of significance not just to this economy but also to the economy across wider East Asia and the world. When I last looked at the numbers, the stimulus package was something in the vicinity over two years of seven per cent of GDP, some $586 billion. Obviously that reflects the concern in China about their own domestic growth prospects, but it parallels, I believe, in the degree of effort and intensity on the part of the Chinese, what we saw from the Chinese government in the late nineties following the Asian financial crisis. The Chinese authorities have spoken through Xinhua press today of the importance of taking measures in a new proactive approach to fiscal policy in the same language, I am advised, that they used in 1998-99 in relation to the reflationary policies they adopted then in response to the Asian financial crisis. I regard that as very good news for this economy, very good news for the regional economy and very good news for the global economy. Certainly, it is consistent with the many discussions that the Treasurer and I have had with various Chinese counterparts in recent weeks.On the honourable member's question concerning the growth forecasts for Australia, I would draw the honourable member's attention to the relevant section of MYEFO, page 29, which refers to the assumptions underpinning Treasury's analysis in the MYEFO document. It says:Interest rates are expected to decline broadly in line with market expectations. This is a departure from the usual assumption of unchanged interest rates, reflecting the fact that markets are forecasting a significant easing in the near term, and it would be unrealistic not to take this into account.The reason I quote that to the honourable member is simply to point out that, when Treasury does its forecasts, that is the underlying assumption in its analysis. The Reserve Bank, because of its doctrine of independence and not speculating publicly on future movements on interest rates on its part, does not incorporate that within its analysis. That is why you see a difference in the approach to the calculation of the growth number.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I know that she and other members of the government are concerned about the circumstances facing mums and dads who rely on ABC Learning. We on this side of the House understand that child care is a vital service that mums and dads rely on in order to meet their work commitments and that security of supply of child care is vital to them. Obviously ABC Learning is the nation's largest childcare provider, and as a result the government has closely monitored all year circumstances involving ABC Learning.On 24 September this year I established the childcare industry task force in my department. That task force immediately established contact with ABC Learning directors and their lending syndicate. Until 2 November the ABC Learning directors and their lending syndicate were indicating that ABC Learning was aiming to trade itself out of current financial difficulties. As members would be aware, on 6 November ABC Learning Centres Ltd entered into voluntary administration and shortly thereafter, indeed almost immediately thereafter, a receiver was appointed.On 6 November the receiver, McGrathNicol, wrote to all parents with children at ABC childcare centres, all employees and all centre managers with a message that their local childcare centre would continue on a business as usual basis. McGrathNicol indicated in that correspondence that it was working constructively with ABC's financiers and with the Rudd government on measures to ensure the stability of childcare services for ABC families. The receiver also on that day, 6 November, released a media statement entitled 'ABC childcare centres to remain open'. To ensure anxious parents and employees could get information, the government, by 3 pm on 6 November, ensured that there was a dedicated telephone line on which parents and employees could get information. In addition, we commenced regularly placing updates on the ABC Learning situation on the mychild.gov.au website.On Friday, 7 November, the day after the receiver was appointed, I announced that the Australian government had reached an agreement with the receiver of ABC Learning and their lending syndicate. In order to ensure that all ABC Learning childcare centres remain open and providing care until 31 December, the Australian government has committed up to $22 million of conditional funding. I announced on that day, Friday, that the $22 million commitment represents the possible costs of supporting the continued operation of the unprofitable ABC centres for two months. As members of the House would undoubtedly appreciate, normally a receiver coming into a business that found parts of the business were unprofitable would immediately act either to close or to rationalise those unprofitable parts of the business. Because of the unique situation of ABC Learning, the government is providing up to $22 million to support these centres and to ensure that they continue to provide child care until 31 December this year. In the period between now and 31 December the government will continue to work with the receiver and the financiers of ABC Learning and we will be in a position to make further announcements about the future of ABC Learning Centres as a result of that work.I do not like to criticise anything coming from Queensland, for all of the obvious reasons, but there is a report in today's Courier Mail which contains the following words:A spokesman for McGrathNicol - the receiver - said it was far too early to tell where and how the Federal Government's $22 million bailout payment would be spent.This report is incorrect. I draw the attention of the House to my transcript from 7 November which makes it clear how the $22 million is to be spent. I also draw the attention of the House to a letter, which I am advised has been emailed today by the receiver to the editor of the Courier Mail, which states as follows:To clarify a report in your paper today, up to $22 million was made available by the federal government to assist in the prevention of closures of any ABC childcare centre before the end of December. The amount used will be verified and independently checked to ensure the funds are used effectively. The actual detail of the funding will be worked through between the receivers and the government and the discussions are already underway. The amount of support was based on a preliminary assessment of the centres which were unprofitable under the group's current business model. The receivers are currently conducting a full and proper analysis of the centre data in line with their review of the business.That letter is on the letterhead of McGrathNicol and is signed by Chris Honey, Receiver and Manager, ABC Learning Centres Ltd. The government will continue to work with the receiver and continue to work with the financiers of ABC Learning in order to find a long-term solution. The government has acted quickly and decisively to ensure that parents can rely on ABC centres being available, providing care, to 31 December this year. This is in stark contrast to the position of the opposition which has dithered about every 15 minutes since this first happened.</DOC>

 - As both the President's spokesman and I, together with the US ambassador, have indicated, the conversation with the President of the United States was explicitly about the G20. The fact that the meeting was subsequently convened for the G20, I think, reflects appropriately on the President's leadership. Any suggestion that the President did not understand the significance of the G20 was simply not accurate, because he did. Furthermore -  -  - Let me restate what I was saying, and that is that the conversation with the President of United States was about the significance of the G20, the usefulness of the G20. Any suggestion that the President of the United States was not aware of the significance of the G20 was simply inaccurate. I would ask those opposite, though, on the question of our relationship with the United States: when do we get the apology from the Liberal Party for them describing Barack Obama's victory as a victory for al-Qaeda? We had the Leader of the Liberal Party stand and say he supported Barack Obama -  -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question and for her deep interest in child care. When the Rudd government was elected less than 12 months ago, we inherited a childcare system in which the former government had let the market rip. In 1999 the former government had uncapped the number of childcare places available. Meeting growing demand by uncapping places was not an error. What was an error was doing that without a plan for quality, without a plan for workforce, without a plan to bring child care to areas that needed it and without a plan that regulated or dealt with this market in any way. Indeed, what the former government did was to let the market rip and take their eyes off the road and their hands off the steering wheel, and then, as it all went towards an inevitable crash, they prepared to blame state and territory governments. Whenever asked, Liberal Party ministers would say in relation to child care that this was all about state and territory governments. To take just one example, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in 2006, said:_ State Governments have primary responsibility for regulating and managing pre-school and childcare delivery throughout Australia. -  - 'A statement of fact', one of the Liberal members says. So their attitude remains unchanged: let the market rip and then take absolutely no responsibility for the consequences. This is a typical Liberal Party response - reckless and out of touch. Since we were elected late last year we have, step by step and piece by piece, acted to ensure that this is a system that has a quality plan, that has a workforce plan and that has an expansion of supply. Each and every step of the way, the Rudd Labor government has acted to deal with the problems in this system left by the former government. So, for example, with our plan for quality we are streamlining quality and licensing requirements, and there will be rigorous new national quality standards and a rating system for child care -  -  - something, I presume from the interjections, that the Liberal Party is opposed to. We have entered into a $126 million plan for workforce development. This will include removing TAFE fees for those who want to be childcare workers and creating an additional 1,500 university places for those who want to be early learning educators. And we have a plan for childcare infrastructure, bringing up to 260 new centres around the country, and a plan for an early learning years framework so that, no matter what setting children are cared for in, they have the benefit of an early education program. Each and every day, I and the parliamentary secretary responsible in the area, the member for Bennelong, have worked step by step on these measures, which were desperately needed in this industry and neglected by the Liberal Party when in government. What seems even more amazing to me than the attitude of the Liberal Party when in government is the fact that it has learnt absolutely nothing in opposition. Can I refer the House to an extraordinary transcript this morning from the member for Indi, the shadow minister now responsible for this area - an extraordinary transcript, very interesting reading - where she is asked -  -  - It is certainly relevant to the question and the question of child care, and I thank the member for O'Connor for his interjection - his point of order. I presume the member for Indi is grateful as well, because he is one member of the House who makes her look good. On the question of the transcript this morning, the member for Indi, when asked about the opposition's plans for child care, was asked, 'What should the government do?' She said, 'Firstly, the government should outline its contingency plan.' The journalist said, 'No, what do you suggest the government should do?' to see if she had any plans. Then the member for Indi said, 'Well, that's up to Ms Gillard to tell us how she's going to respond.' Then the journalist said to the member for Indi, 'You would have thought about the issues; what do you think should be done?' and she said 'Well, Ms Gillard needs to come up with a sustainable model,' and the journalist said in frustration, 'No, no, I am not asking about Ms Gillard's opinion,' in yet another desperate attempt to elicit from the member for Indi something that might look like a Liberal policy for child care. Then, extraordinarily, having been pressed and pressed again for a policy on child care, the member for Indi said in respect of me that I should have acted 12 months ago on this. The member for Indi might like to remember the Liberal Party was in government 12 months ago. Maybe they should have acted on it, yes, but she can hardly say that that is something for the current government. - Then, finally, like all Liberal Party members when asked on child care - because they have no policies, no plans and no ideas - what does she actually do? She actually says that this is all about state governments that regulate child care. The Liberal Party learns nothing, stands for nothing -  - and, each and every day since the receiver was appointed, has dithered about its policy response because it does not know anything about child care.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. As indicated before to the member for Wentworth, the White House, the United States ambassador and I have confirmed that the President did not make the remarks that have been attributed to him in the article in question. I also ask the member for Wentworth, he having stood at the dispatch box today and welcomed Senator Obama's election, when he is going to apologise for the attack on Senator Obama -  - As the member for Wentworth just said, it goes to our relationship with the United States. If he is concerned about the attack on Senator Obama last year, Senator Fifield only last month said about Senator Obama, 'It is a very serious matter when you have a presidential candidate who thinks it is okay to hang around -  - On the substance of the matter, I refer again to the statement I made before about the public statements by the White House, the US ambassador and me on this. In furthering the question, the member for Wentworth said that this goes to our relationship with the United States. Calling the President-elect of the United States an 'agent of al-Qaeda' - which is what the Liberals did last year - I think is of some consequence to that relationship.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. Can I start where I have started on this matter in recent days, and that is to express my deepest sympathy for the family members of the victims of both Bali bombings. The last week or so, in particular yesterday, has been a terrible reminder of tragic personal circumstances and loss. I am sure that all members of the House join in the expression of sympathy and condolence to the families in what has been, in my view, a terrible reminder of very tragic family circumstances.For some time, indeed since November 2002 in the aftermath of the first Bali bombing, the effective travel advice for Indonesia, including Bali, has been for Australians to reconsider their need to travel. Whilst until 2005 it was described differently, that has been the effective travel advice, so far as the Australian government is concerned, to Australians contemplating travel to Indonesia, including Bali.On Saturday, 8 November and again on Sunday following the executions of the Bali bombers, the travel advisory was reissued and updated. It remains at the same level, the second-highest level: 'Reconsider your need for travel'. But, to bring it up to date and remain current with ongoing events, it has been reissued and updated following the executions.Can I draw the House's attention to important parts of that travel advisory. Australians should reconsider their need to travel to Indonesia, including Bali, due to the very high threat of terrorist attack. The executions of the Bali bombers could prompt a strong reaction from their supporters, including demonstrations, acts of violence and acts of reprisal. Regrettably, the government continues to receive credible information that terrorists could be planning attacks in Indonesia and, regrettably, we continue to receive credible information that Bali remains an attractive target for terrorist activity.In particular, given that we are at the end of the school year, members would of course be aware that numbers of young Australians may be planning, after their school exams at the end of their school year, to travel to Indonesia, and Bali in particular. I draw the attention of those young school graduates and their parents to the travel advisory, and I urge those young Australians and their parents, if they do decide to travel to Bali and Indonesia, to exercise heightened caution at this time and to avoid those places which we know have been targets for terrorist attack in the past, in particular, bars, beaches, shopping malls and the like.It has of course been drawn to my attention and has been part of the public commentary in the context of the execution of the Bali bombers that, as a consequence of our travel advisory, numbers of young students who have pre-booked or previously planned to travel to Bali may now be contemplating a change of circumstances, a change of plan. Over the weekend I have urged the travel industry to exercise maximum flexibility if young Australians seek to change their travel arrangements so far as Bali or Indonesia are concerned. I welcome the news that Jetstar and Virgin Blue, two of the airlines which have flights to Bali, have waived their fees for travellers wishing to change the date of their travel to Bali in November. I am advised that, so far as Jetstar is concerned, the waiver of this fee applies for changes made in November to as late as September of next year. I again call on all airlines and the travel industry generally - travel agents, airlines - to exercise maximum flexibility.Some members of the House may be aware that for the last few years, indeed since 2004, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has consulted formally with the travel industry through the Smartraveller Consultative Group. This has generally taken the form of annual consultations where the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the travel industry engage in a dialogue to ensure that the travel industry is aware of matters relating to safety so far as travel is concerned.I can advise the House that on Friday of this week in Sydney the department will be convening a special and urgent meeting of the Smartraveller Consultative Group with the travel industry to see whether more can be done to maximise the flexibility so far as changed travel arrangements to Bali or Indonesia are concerned. I again welcome the action already taken by Jetstar and Virgin Blue.I conclude my remarks to the House by making some comments in respect of capital punishment. Australia, through the states, abolished capital punishment, the death penalty, more than 20 years ago. The view of the Commonwealth of Australia, and I choose my words carefully to include the states, the territories and the Commonwealth, has been that the death penalty is not appropriate for Australia. Internationally, Australia supports the abolition of the death penalty as a form of punishment, and Australia and the Australian government have been active in the United Nations, urging this view upon nations who continue to use the death penalty as a sanction.Indeed, in December 2007, one of the first acts of the current government was to co-sponsor a resolution at the General Assembly calling for a moratorium so far as capital punishment, or the death penalty, is concerned. Australia will be repeating this co-sponsorship this year. This of course followed on from when, in 2006, the then Australian government and Australia supported a similar statement presented to the General Assembly by Finland. I have noted the comments made by those opposite which reflect the bipartisan approach on this issue in terms of both of a domestic sanction and Australia's view to the world generally.I conclude by again urging those Australians who are contemplating travel to Indonesia, including Bali, to very carefully consider the travel advisory on the website and to bear that very carefully in mind when making their travel plans.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question. As the member for Indi should be aware, on 7 November - that is, Friday of last week - I announced that the government would provide up to $22 million conditional funding because around 40 per cent of ABC Learning Centres, some 1,040 centres, were viewed by the receivers as unprofitable. The member for Indi, if she had read that transcript, would have also noted that I indicated at the time that that was the receiver's preliminary data, the receiver having been put in place about 24 hours previously. The member for Indi is shaking her head, but obviously the question of profitability or unprofitability of a centre is a judgement the receiver would make - and the receiver understandably, some 24 hours afterwards, was saying that he was working on preliminary data. I suggest to the member for Indi that if she has questions about that she should direct them to the receiver.</DOC>

 - There have of course been a number of assessments recently of the state of the Australian economy and the Reserve Bank has today published its Statement on monetary policy which notes a number of important observations with respect to both global and Australian economic circumstances especially in the wake of the global financial crisis. It does note that there is less dislocation in Australian credit markets than overseas but, nonetheless, that downward revisions of global growth will have an impact on Australia. It does point out that governments and central banks responding to turbulence with various measures have generated some improvement both internationally and of course in Australia but that sentiment remains 'fragile' and there is a 'deteriorating outlook for the global economy'. It notes that the government's Economic Security Strategy will boost consumption and home building and, together with the impact of the fall in the value of the Australian dollar and the recent reduction in interest rates, that these initiatives will very strongly push back against the downward negative impact of the global financial crisis on the Australian economy.It does point out as well that our banks are less affected by the turbulence in international financial markets than those of most other countries, that our banks are well capitalised and that their capital adequacy levels are well above the established minimum levels. It is worth noting too, as the Prime Minister referred to earlier regarding the difference in the Reserve Bank's projected 1Â½ per cent growth in the coming year as compared to the Treasury's assessment of two per cent in MYEFO that was published some days ago, that the difference between the two can largely be explained by the fact that Treasury in its assumptions presumes that there will be some further reduction of interest rates in ensuing months whereas the Reserve Bank obviously cannot make any assumptions about future movements in interest rates, and its assumptions therefore out to June 2011 assume that interest rates remain as they currently are. So that essentially explains the difference in the projections.There have of course been other assessments of the outlook for the Australian economy, most notably from the opposition. Unfortunately, those assessments seem to change on a daily basis and sometimes even on an hourly basis. I note that the Leader of the Opposition believes that consistency is a very important principle. In fact on 8 November he was quoted as saying, 'I place a very high premium on consistency and integrity in politics.' Two months ago the Leader of the Opposition was reaffirming the opposition's commitment to cutting fuel excise. That promise has now been jettisoned. So here we have a reversal of the usual arrangements: we have a government that is honouring its promises and an opposition that is actually betraying its promises before we are anywhere near an election. They are already breaking their promises and they have not even got to the election yet.One month ago the Leader of the Opposition was saying that the global financial crisis is overhyped. What we did not know at the time was that he was quietly moving his own money out of a property fund that has since been frozen. - Mr Speaker, I was referring to the sincerity of assessments of the Australian economy to which the question referred. I am referring here to matters that are on the public record, indeed a quote from the Leader of the Opposition:Well you take advice from your financial planners, you invest in things, you dispose of things.A million here, a million there - what is the difference? The Leader of the Opposition is a clever politician but you have to watch what he does, not what he says, because that changes on a daily basis.And I note that we have still not seen any commentary or any proposals with respect to one key question in the global financial crisis set of issues, and that is: what does the opposition have to say about excessive executive salaries? What does the opposition have to say about this issue? I note in the assessment of the issues associated with global circumstances that this is one thing that the Leader of the Opposition has yet to address.The global financial crisis is not overhyped. It is very serious and it is presenting very substantial challenges to the government. But the government is meeting those challenges with sound economic management and clear positions on the issues and clear initiatives to deal with those challenges. The opposition says that it is supporting the government's initiatives, that it has bipartisan support for those initiatives, and then within minutes walks away from that position and proceeds to start to snipe at all of those propositions. I urge the opposition to rethink its position and to take a serious, clear and consistent position on these issues, because they are too important for the behaviour that we are seeing from the opposition. We do not need an investment banker's approach; we need a sound approach from government to dealing with the challenges that Australia faces, and the government will not be diverted from what is necessary to ensure the security and prosperity of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for her question and I point out what I think are two very simple things. Firstly, Australia is a big country. People look -  -  - All right! The member for Indi has understood that point. I am glad to have that reinforced. People look for child care locally either near where they live or near where they work. It is therefore absolutely possible for ABC Learning - or indeed for any childcare operator in this country - to say in respect of one centre that they do not have as many children in it as they would like and in respect of others that there are crying shortages in other parts of the country where people are looking for child care. Obviously, the government's promise of introducing up to 260 new childcare centres was aimed at the following things: increasing supply in those parts of the country where people are short of centres and short of places; secondly, developing those new childcare centres in locations of convenience to parents. Most particularly we have looked at near or on school grounds so that parents can avoid the dreaded double drop-off and if they have children of childcare age and of school age they can have them dropped off in the one location.Opposition members jeer at that as if that is something extraordinary - that a hardworking mum or a hardworking dad would want to drop their school-age children and their children of childcare age off at the same location. But let me tell you that that just goes to show how out of touch the Liberal Party is because there are mums and dads right around the country that would prefer that convenience. - I say to the member for Indi that in respect of the second part of her question, if she thinks about it for a second the answer will be obvious to her. The Liberal Party is led by a man who says he knows about business and money. What the word 'profit' means is that there is something left over after you have acquitted all costs. You should not assume, as the member for Indi clearly does, that the only thing that goes into the business model of a childcare centre is the question of the number of vacancies. Obviously other costs also pertain to the question of profit, which is why the receiver of ABC, when working through whether a centre is profitable or not, will obviously be looking at all facts that pertain to that - vacancy rates would be one but costs such as the cost of the premises, the cost of the staff and other issues in relation to that centre will obviously pertain. So the member for Indi is taking an overly simplistic view of all of this.I can understand why she would be taking an overly simplistic view of all of it because the Liberal Party has always taken an overly simplistic, neglectful view of child care - let the market rip, never think about anything else, never do anything else, never develop a policy whether in government or in opposition, and as Leader of the Opposition never say the same thing twice. The Leader of the Opposition has never said the same thing twice since ABC moved into voluntary administration on 6 November.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fremantle for her question and for her support of the Middle East peace process. Since the House last met, on 28 October I visited Israel and the Palestinian territories. The objective of the visit to Israel was, firstly, to relay to the Israeli government congratulations on behalf of Australia on the 60th anniversary of the independence of Israel, of the creation of the Israeli state. The second purpose was to underline Australia's very strong support of a two-nation-state solution to the Middle East - a nation-state for Israel within defined and secure boundaries and borders and a nation-state for the Palestinian people.In Jerusalem I had the opportunity of meeting with Prime Minister Olmert, Foreign Minister Livni and Opposition Leader Netanyahu and I had the privilege of laying a wreath at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum. In the Palestinian territories I met with Palestinian Authority Foreign Minister al-Maliki, visited the Kalandia refugee camp in the Palestinian territories and also announced the final allocation of the $45 million announced by Australia at the Paris Donors Conference to support the Palestinian territories and humanitarian assistance in the Palestinian territories. Of the final $10 million allocation, $7.5 million will be ascribed to the Palestinian Authority for capacity and institution building and $2.5 million for further humanitarian assistance.Whilst much of my time in the Palestinian territories and Israel was spent discussing the Middle East peace process, I think it is true to say that the issue uppermost in the minds of the Israeli leadership is Iranian nuclear activity. In this respect, Australia's recent adoption of autonomous sanctions so far as Iran and its nuclear program is concerned was very warmly welcomed by the Israeli government and the Israeli leadership.So far as the Middle East peace process is concerned, I underlined very strongly to both the Israeli leadership and the Palestinian Authority Australia's very strong support for a two-nation-state solution, the Annapolis process, the 2002 road map for peace process and the 2007 Annapolis initiative commenced under the Bush administration in November 2007.In that context, I warmly welcome the statement overnight by the so-called Middle East quartet, comprising the United Nations, the European Union, the Russian Federation and the United States. The quartet have reported that President Abbas and Foreign Minister Livni reaffirmed their commitment to 'vigorous, ongoing and continuous negotiations in order to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, including all core issues without exception'.As the quartet emphasised on the weekend, both sides must abide by their road map obligations to create an atmosphere conducive to negotiations. Over the weekend the quartet also reiterated that both parties must:_ fully implement their obligations under phase one of the Roadmap, including in relation to freezing settlement activity and the dismantlement of the infrastructure of terrorism.The Australian government very strongly shares this sentiment, as we share the sentiment expressed by Secretary of State Rice on more than one occasion in the course of this year that, 'at a time when we need to build confidence between the parties, the continued building and settlement activity has the potential to harm the negotiations going forward'.Both parties need to abide by their obligations under the 2002 road map for peace and not do anything which disturbs or jeopardises the Annapolis peace process: peace and security, non-use of force and terrorist activities insofar as the Palestinian territories are concerned and settlement activity insofar as the Israeli side is concerned.I take this opportunity to update the House on resolutions dealt with before the United Nations General Assembly fourth committee on Friday night and Saturday morning. The General Assembly fourth committee dealt with nine resolutions relating to the Middle East. In respect of these nine resolutions, the Australian government instructed our representative to the United Nations to change Australia's vote from the previous voting habits of the last few years on two occasions. It is important to make the point to the House that, when it comes to General Assembly resolutions, the government adopts the following approach. Firstly, we treat these resolutions on a case-by-case basis and consider them on their merits. Secondly, we consider these resolutions firmly within the context of our very strong adherence to our support for a two-nation-state solution and our support of the peace process. If the resolutions are consistent with that approach then we support them.In 2003 the General Assembly made a reference to the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion on the legality of the construction of the Israeli security barrier. Since that time, the Australian voting practice changed on a number of significant resolutions, including, for example, the resolution on settlements. The Australian government has come to the view that, whilst the reference by the General Assembly to the International Court of Justice was not supported by the Australian government or by the opposition at the time, and whilst we regard - as the previous government did - that advisory opinion as an advisory opinion and not a binding opinion, we will not oppose a resolution in the General Assembly on the Middle East simply because it refers to that advisory opinion. That is the case as far as the resolution on settlements is concerned where, on behalf of the government, I instructed our permanent representative to the United Nations to change Australia's vote to support the resolution as far as settlements were concerned because this was consistent with our approach for a two-nation-state solution, our support for the road map for peace and the Annapolis process.In doing so on that and on the second resolution on which I instructed a change in the Australian voting position, regarding the Geneva convention, Australia joined another 160 nation-states in support of those two resolutions as compared with two-nation-states who abstained and six who opposed. In that context, we joined the overwhelming majority of the international community. It is not necessarily about the quantity; we also need to look at where some of our longstanding, like minded colleagues are. In support of the settlements resolution we find the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand and the European Union. It is not so much the number of nation-states; it is whether these resolutions sit squarely within the Australian government's policy. Australia's longstanding policy on a two-nation-state solution for the Middle East and support for the road map for peace and the Annapolis process was in every respect consistent with the nine resolutions voted on by the General Assembly on Friday night and Saturday morning.This is not just a government view; this is a longstanding Australian position shared by both sides of the House. This government will do nothing to jeopardise our longstanding public policy and foreign policy commitment to a two-nation-state solution for the Middle East and our very strong support of the road map for peace and the Annapolis peace process.</DOC>

 - Prior to 2003, resolutions of a similar type to the two matters referred to were supported by the then Liberal government. That is the first point. The second is, as explained just now by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the dispatch box, what occurred subsequent to that was the request for the advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the question of the security wall. The other point I would draw the honourable member's attention to is that, if we are serious about a long-term Middle East peace process based on a two-state solution, part of that - a huge part of it - lies in dealing with the threat of terrorism to the state of Israel. That remains the position of this government, as it was the position of the previous government. Part of that also lies in what you do about the challenge of the settlements.I draw to the honourable gentleman's attention the statement overnight by the quartet comprising the government of the United States, the Russian Federation, the European Union and the United Nations which explicitly reiterates that both parties - Israel and Palestine - must 'fully implement their obligations under phase 1 of the road map, including in relation to freezing settlement activity and the dismantlement of the infrastructure of terrorism'.As the honourable gentleman would know, this is a very complex matter. The whole Middle East peace process is littered with failed negotiations up until now. But if there is a prospect of delivering peace in the Middle East, part of that hinges on the question of how we deal with settlements in future. A huge part of it hinges on how we provide Israel with an appropriate state of security, given the threat of continued terrorism which Israel has suffered under for many decades now.There is a lot of sensitivity attached to these matters. We on this side of the House are as acutely conscious of this as those on the other side. But, as stated by the foreign minister, it is with the absolute best intentions that we will work constructively towards a two-state solution, mindful of all of these realities. The future of settlements is part and parcel of the road map to peace which was drafted by President Bush several years ago. That has been reiterated by the quartet in the last 24 hours. That informs the position taken by the foreign minister and the instructions that he has provided to former Senator Hill, our representative in New York.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. Her electorate, like those of many in this House, is affected by workforce shortages, particularly of doctors. There would not be a person in this House who would not be familiar with families from their electorates coming to see them about difficulties accessing doctors. We believe that action needs to be taken to ensure that families can get the health care that they need in their community when they need it.The most recent medical workforce survey, released just in the last fortnight, shows that the overall supply of primary care practitioners - so this is mostly GPs - declined under the watch of the Liberal government. It fell from 101 to 97 full-time equivalents per 100,000 of population between 2002 and 2006. As the member for Robertson would be aware, the doctor shortage affects many families. In fact, the latest figures show us that six in 10 Australians feel the impact of this shortage. This was a clear result of a failure of leadership by the previous government. It was a failure to plan for the future and a failure to recognise the long-term impacts of the decisions that they were making.But in case anyone opposite thinks that this is me just being political, I would remind those opposite, who might mistake this as me politicising it, that the member for Warringah said last year: 'We failed to increase medical school places until 2000. Sure, you could say that it was overdue.' The member for Bradfield said earlier this year: 'In hindsight, it was obvious that the restrictions on general practice training positions imposed in 1996-97 were not appropriate and I did express my concerns at the time.' It is quite clear that this was a problem. It was only recognised belatedly by the Liberal government, but they did belatedly recognise the error of their ways.Over the next few years - and this is a good thing - an increasing number of young graduate doctors will be coming on line. Unfortunately, though, these young medical graduates leaving university then have to move into a specialty training place. To do that, they need there to be a training place. For example, this year there was a record number of applicants for GP training places, exceeding the number that were available, leaving young doctors facing a bottleneck which the Liberal Party failed to address. So as a result of the cap that was put in place by the previous Liberal government, promising young doctors with the ambition to become GPs were going to have those ambitions thwarted.That is why last Wednesday in Tasmania the Prime Minister and I announced that the Rudd government is investing $148 million to immediately establish 175 new GP training places. This will allow 175 new doctors to begin training as GPs in the next two years, bringing the total number next year to 675 and in 2010 to 700. This is, I am sure, welcome news to the whole parliament. It will be welcome news to the community that we have young doctors keen to go into general practice being able to take up their ambitions and service the community.This was widely welcomed by health professionals in the community. For example, the President of the AMA, Dr Rosanna Capolingua, described this move as: 'Just what the doctor ordered: a much needed show of support for general practice and our patients which will have an immediate impact.' The Rudd government believes that Australians should be able to access health care when and where they need it, and this is an important step to us achieving that goal and an immediate down payment on future workforce reform. I encourage all graduates and medical students to consider general practice as a good career and a chance to provide valuable services in our community. I know all members of this House would encourage those young medical graduates to do that.</DOC>

 - First and foremost, in terms of the government's commitment to the interests of small business, one of the challenges that we sought to address in the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy was to provide stimulus to the economy, particularly in the household consumption sector where so many small businesses depend on a flow-through of activity. We are very mindful of that.The second concern with regard to small business was the drying up of loan finance to small business in the future. That is why we provided the banks with a guarantee in terms of their term wholesale funding. One of the galvanising arguments put to us at that time was the need to provide that guarantee to ensure that there would be a continuing line of credit to small business.The third point is the cost of that credit. That goes to the interest rates point which the honourable gentleman raised in his question. As I have said before - and as has the Treasurer as well - we would expect the banks to pass through interest rate cuts as rapidly as possible to all their customers. That includes small business customers as well as those taking out home loans.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. I know that some students at Newcastle university whom she represents made very clear to us the urgency that they see in undoing the damage caused by the legislation put forward by the previous government. I also note that we have now heard a number of very divided and differing positions put forward by the coalition on this particular issue. I recognise that we do have some ideological extremists on the other side of the House when it comes to this particular issue, but I would like to assure all that we are advocating a reasonable, balanced and sustainable new way forward to ensure the quality of our universities.Earlier this year I conducted consultations right around the country and heard firsthand of the devastating impact of the VSU legislation and the fact that it was students themselves who were paying the price for this extreme legislation put forward by the previous government. I will inform the House of what I learnt. I learnt that $170 million was ripped from our campuses and that the impacts were both immediate and extreme. We heard how it was students who were paying directly. We heard that childcare centres had been closed, that childcare subsidies had been slashed and that this had led to increases in fees - for example, $68 a week at La Trobe University and $800 a year at UTS in increases in childcare fees alone. We heard that sporting clubs were hit by big drops in participation as a result of them having to massively increase their fees. We heard that parking fees at Monash University, as one more example, rose from $80 a year up to $280 a year for one student. We heard of massive price increases in catering services and the closure of health, welfare, legal, accommodation and counselling services.But it was not just directly that students were paying; students were paying indirectly. We heard that a number of universities were being forced to move resources out of teaching and research budgets into propping up student services. We also heard from a number of universities that they were very concerned about their ability to continue to attract overseas students if they did not have services on campus.So last week we announced a new way forward. Those opposite might choose to keep fighting the same old battles of the past but we are announcing a new way forward. Under this announcement, from 2010, all universities in Australia will be required to meet basic benchmarks on access to information and basic services as a condition of their Commonwealth funding. Additionally, they will be required to meet representation protocols on every campus across Australia regardless of whether or not they choose to introduce the fee. On top of this, we will give universities a choice of introducing a fee which will be capped at $250 and accompanied by a HECS style deferred payment loan system. This fee, if introduced, can then be spent on further amenities within very strict guidelines. These guidelines will not allow for the funds to be spent on broad political campaigns such as we have seen in the past. It is universities who will be held accountable for ensuring that these guidelines are strictly adhered to.Those opposite should note that we have absolutely no intention of returning to compulsory student unionism. In fact, we are moving forward. We will not be amending the section of the legislation which outlaws a university forcing any student to be a member of an organisation. We have outlined a balanced, responsible and new way forward. -  - And decisive - thank you, members opposite! We are pleased to have received many positive responses from the university sector. While the coalition might be divided on this, I would like to share some of the responses that we have heard from others. - As I was saying, we have heard a number of positive responses and I would like to share them. The Group of Eight universities called it a 'sensible compromise'. We heard from Universities Australia, who said:Universities have struggled _ to prop up essential student services through cross-subsidisation from other parts of already stretched university budgets _We heard from Australian University Sport, who stated that sport has been an innocent victim and that participation numbers had been hit hard. And we heard from the very reasonable member for New England, who noted that, under the previous government's legislation, the baby had been thrown out with the bath water, which is absolutely true. But I can assure the member for New England and others that what we are offering is a balanced, responsible and sensible way forward to ensure that our universities remain world-class institutions with services and representation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Firstly, on the question of business confidence, business confidence is bad here as it is in practically every other developed economy in the world. If you look at the surveys of business confidence in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, Germany and Italy, as produced in the relevant indices, you will see they are all heading downwards, and that is because of the global financial crisis. The global financial crisis has impacted on global financial markets, which have in turn affected equity markets, which have in turn affected property markets, which have in turn affected the real economy and jobs. Businesses looking at these developments around the world have become pessimistic about the possibility of investment and growth.The key challenge in responding to that is to ensure that, first of all, we maintain the stability of the Australian financial system. The stability of the Australian financial system was underpinned by the two bank guarantees which we delivered about a month ago - and we did so, I understand, with the complete, bipartisan support of the opposition on that occasion, but I am not so sure that that is the case today. It seems to be a case of their agreeing one day and then disagreeing the next - not looking at what the opposition say but in fact what they then do. They say that they are bipartisan but then, if you look at what they do the next day, they seek to undermine that bipartisanship.These are tough and difficult economic times, but what is required is, firstly and fundamentally, the stability of the Australian financial system; secondly, governments around the world putting their shoulder to the wheel and supporting appropriate fiscal and economic stimulus for the economies; and, thirdly, governments around the world cooperating on a new regulatory arrangement for the financial systems which landed us in this difficulty in the first place. That is very much the charge which this government has taken on. It is a charge which the government will prosecute into the future. There will be difficult times ahead, not just for Australia but for the rest of the world, but we are determined to act and determined to continue to take all necessary action to ensure that we can do everything possible to support positive growth in this economy in the future, when the rest of the world is already experiencing the ravages of global economic recession.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. The key challenge is what governments do around the world in support of fiscal measures and broader economic measures to support growth at a time when the International Monetary Fund tells us that global economic recession is looming across the major economies. If we look across the world at the stimulus packages which have been embraced by various economies, we begin to see evidence of governments rising to this challenge and taking appropriate action.Yesterday I made reference to the stimulus package which has been embraced by the government of China. Upon further examination of the detail of that package, this is a major package indeed, one of relevance not just to us but also to the wider region and to the world economy. I support fully the actions taken by the Chinese government, obviously, mindful of their domestic circumstances but, I believe, equally mindful of the importance of their growth to the wider regional and global economy. This is an important economy for Australia - important given the extent to which our external account and our trade account are dependent on future access to Chinese markets and the sale of Australian goods and services into that market. We will continue to work as closely as possible with our friends in China to ensure that we maintain maximum access to those markets in the future. It is of relevance to Australia, of relevance to jobs in Australia, of relevance also to our future prosperity.Fiscal stimulus action has of course been taken elsewhere in the world as well. You see large fiscal stimulus packages in Germany, EURO23 billion; in the United States, US$170 billion; in Japan, something approaching Â¥40 trillion; and, in Korea, $10.98 billion or KRW14 trillion. You see governments around the world embarking on fiscal stimulus packages, as we have done in Australia.It is important for the government of Australia to embark upon a war against unemployment because if we look at what is happening around the world we see rising jobless data in many of the developed economies. Unemployment in the United States is already running at 6.5 per cent; in the UK, 5.7 per cent; in France, eight per cent; in Germany, 7.5 per cent; and it is rising in other economies as well. That is why we have embraced an Economic Security Strategy, a stimulus package of some $10.4 billion, and that is why we believe it is necessary in our current circumstances to support growth but also to support jobs. That package of $10.4 billion, we are advised, will help to create up to 75,000 additional jobs over the coming year. It is a $10.4 billion package aimed at helping to create up to 75,000 additional jobs over the coming year.On top of that, the government announced yesterday a long-term strategy of $6.2 billion in support for the Australian automobile industry. This industry already directly generates a large number of jobs. If you add the indirect generation of unemployment, there are some 200,000 jobs in Australia dependent on the future success and transformation of that industry. That is the second step that we have embarked upon.The third step, of course, lies in what we will do on infrastructure. Infrastructure investment, both through the Building Australia Fund and more broadly, is very much on this government's agenda and has been from day one. Infrastructure investment, investment in the future of our auto industry and investment through the payment systems we have provided to families and pensioners for the future as well are designed to underpin growth and jobs growth into the future - all part of this government's war on unemployment - and that is something we need to embrace more fully. -  - Those opposite seem to think that this is unimportant. - I regard war on unemployment as the government's highest priority. Those opposite, presumably, would have us stand idly by as the world at large experiences increased unemployment. - This government will not stand idly by. It will take necessary action through an economic stimulus strategy and necessary action through our automobile strategy and infrastructure strategy, and we are doing these measures in addition to what is already equivalent to a two per cent interest rate fall in recent months - a two per cent interest rate fall which, if you have an average mortgage of some $251,000, results in a $314 a month reduction in your mortgage. - Those opposite catcall because they obviously do not believe it is necessary for government to act on supporting the economy and supporting jobs in the face of a global financial crisis and in the face of the global economic downturn which flows from the crisis. This government has a course of action for the future. This is the strategy that we are embarked upon and the government remains determined to take whatever additional action is necessary for the future in order to support the economy, to support growth and to support jobs. It is a responsible course of action for the future and I ask those opposite to join us in a bipartisan spirit. I ask those opposite not simply to say one day that they offer the government bipartisan support and then the next day seek to undermine it. - It would be useful for the first time in recent times for the opposition to actually do what they say, because this nation looks on all of us to provide leadership through what is a period of great economic challenge flowing to our economy off the back of a global economic and financial crisis. - </DOC>

 - This government has embarked upon a course of action which does not simply perpetuate the blame game of the past. This government believes that when it comes to the nation's future challenges you work with state and territory governments, Labor and Liberal. We intend to work as closely with the state government of New South Wales as we will do with the state government of Western Australia. The state government of Western Australia has an interest when it comes to the future - it is in how we partner with them in infrastructure investments - and that is the interest of all responsible state governments.The difference is this: state governments in the past, when they approached the previous Liberal government for assistance on infrastructure, were simply given the cold shoulder. The previous Liberal government was not interested. The previous Liberal government - and the member for Higgins will recall this very well - said that when it came to infrastructure that was exclusively a state responsibility. - The member for North Sydney's question was about the extent to which Commonwealth governments work or do not work with state governments. I have responded to that question by saying we have an approach on infrastructure. We have an approach when it comes to COAG. We have an approach when it comes to the future of health and education expenditure and we will seek to work cooperatively with the states for the future. What is at stake here is the nation's economy and the national interest in which the states and territories also have a significant part.The other part of responsibility, I would say to the member for North Sydney and to the member for Wentworth, is this: it lies also, at times of global financial crisis, in supporting our major economic and financial regulatory institutions. Once again the Liberal Party has been off the leash today, this time in relation to the Secretary of the Treasury. Comments by Mr Don Randall today -  - The member for North Sydney's question goes to the matter of economic responsibility, and economic responsibility in turn depends on whether you are going to support the independence of the economic institutions of this country, including the Reserve Bank and the Secretary of the Treasury, and including the independence and integrity of the regulators. Once again we have the member for Canning out there today hooking into the Secretary of the Treasury. It says here:When asked about the Secretary of the Treasury the member for Canning says that he is an 'activist'. It is unusual for a head of the Treasury to behave in this way. He is probably the first one to show those tendencies.We then go on to the member for O'Connor who goes on to say:What is going on down at the Treasury? John Howard in a conversation going back to the opposition days said to me, 'If in doubt, take Treasury's advice.' That was because in the past they put policy before politics. They really need to take a close look at themselves. They used to be one department that was held in high regard even in opposition.So today, on this day when the debate on the future of the economy is again central to our concerns in this parliament, we have the attack dogs of the Liberal Party out there attacking once again -  - the independence and the integrity of the Secretary of the Treasury. The member for Canning stood up in this place recently - I presume at his own initiative - to recant on his attack on the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Barely a week or two later -  - Again, the member for North Sydney's question goes to the matter of economic responsibility, which again hangs on the independence of our regulators and the integrity of those regulators. Our responsibility as the government is to defend the regulators. Those opposite seem to believe it is their mandate to attack the regulators or, as they have done today again, authorise an attack on the regulators. That is what has occurred not just through the member for Canning and not just through the member for O'Connor but also from the member for Goldstein. - Then we have the member for Goldstein, who is quoted in today's Australian online as saying about Treasury's role in the production of MYEFO documents:It's got the smell of manipulation about it.So we have, therefore, not just the attack dogs from the backbench but the attack dog from the frontbench unleashing on the integrity and the independence of the Secretary of the Treasury. Does the member for Goldstein stand by that attack? - He nods his head. He has accused the Secretary of the Treasury of manipulating MYEFO. This is an extraordinary statement. We had also a report in the Australian newspaper online about what appears to have been an active debate in the Liberal Party party room, because the member for Kooyong told the party room, it is said, to be 'very, very careful about attacking Treasury or their institutional representatives'. - So, on the question of the integrity of the institutions, we have the Leader of the Opposition saying:I've never criticised Dr Henry, and in fact, I spoke about him in such glowing terms yesterday in the house that even his mother would blush. So I have very high regard for Dr Henry.Yet today we have an orchestrated attack by three members of the Liberal Party on the Secretary of the Treasury. Again, with the member -  -  - The question for the Leader of the Opposition is not what he says but what he does on the question of the independence of the regulators. The question from the member for North Sydney was about taking responsibility for the economy. I would say this to the member for North Sydney: as Prime Minister of Australia, I take responsibility for the good news and the bad news, and when the bad news comes I will take responsibility for that as well, because what the nation wants is not some political game plan whereby you flick responsibility to someone else all the time - where you flick responsibility to the states and territories. What the nation wants is national leadership in the national interest. What the nation wants is tough decisions in tough economic times. This government is prepared to take them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. Australia is facing an enormous economic challenge emerging from the flow-on effects of the global financial crisis, and both the government and the Reserve Bank have taken strong and decisive action to strengthen growth and support households. Later on today I will be introducing the government's legislation -  -  - Later on today I will be introducing the government's legislation to deliver an Economic Security Strategy of substantial one-off payments to pensioners, families, carers and, of course, first home buyers. If the member for Pearce does not find that worth listening to, then I suspect she is in a small minority. These initiatives will strengthen jobs and economic growth and they will help the government to push back against the downward pressures on our economy emerging from the international financial crisis.Over its past three meetings the Reserve Bank has cut interest rates by 200 basis points - a full two percentage points reduction in interest rates since September. That means, on average, about $400 per month in relief on interest rates for people with mortgages around $300,000. After years of coping with ever-increasing interest rates under the former government - the government that told Australians they would keep interest rates at record lows - this is welcome relief for homebuyers in Australia.The government guarantee of deposits and wholesale borrowing by banks has also assisted. That has been acknowledged both in the Reserve Bank's statement on monetary policy and by the Australian CEOs of both the ANZ Bank and the NAB. They have acknowledged that has helped to put downward pressure on market interest rates as well. I note also that the Chief Executive of the Business Council of Australia, Greg Gailey, wrote to the Prime Minister a few days ago on both of these matters - the Economic Security Strategy and the government's approach to protecting our banking system - saying: 'The BCA supported the government's economic security initiative as timely, targeted and temporary. We support the amendments to the deposit and wholesale lending guarantees for the same reasons.'Unfortunately, the support for the government's strategies has not been completely universal. It has been very broad, but it has not been entirely universal. The opposition, on both occasions when these initiatives were announced, stated that it would offer them bipartisan support. But in practice the opposition has done nothing other than attack and undermine and snipe against the government's initiatives. We saw a lot of statesmanlike posturing by the Leader of the Opposition at the time about how he would give all this bipartisan support and so forth but, unfortunately, we cannot trust what the Leader of the Opposition says - we have to watch what he does. He is a very clever politician but, unfortunately, the investment banker gene runs very strong: you spin the story, you do the deal, you take your cut and then you move on - that is the Leader of the Opposition. That is why, in a few short months in the job, he has been against cutting the fuel excise, in favour of cutting the fuel excise and then against cutting the fuel excise. He was against increasing pensions; now he is in favour of increasing pensions. He described the global financial crisis as the greatest economic crisis in our lifetimes and then he said that it was being overhyped. That is why we do not take the pious platitudes about bipartisanship all that seriously.Last night the member for Curtin really let the mask slip, because she was on Good News Week - I am not quite sure why but she was on Good News Week: they clearly were a bit light on for talent that week - and she was asked to do a word association test. When the word 'bipartisanship' was put to her, her response on the spot was 'Overrated.' I can understand why the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would have some problem with copying something the government is doing and not giving credit for it. Given her recent experiences, I can understand why she would have some problem with that, but now today we have seen the consequences from the signal that was given on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition by the deputy leader last night. We have seen it in a coordinated, concerted attack on the Secretary of the Treasury - not a one-off, isolated instance but a coordinated, orchestrated attack on the Secretary of the Treasury by no less than three members of the Liberal Party, one of whom is a senior frontbencher - alleging manipulation of the Treasury forecasts in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, alleging that the Secretary of the Treasury is an activist and alleging that the Treasury has lost all of its credibility and that it should take a close look at itself. That last one, of course, was from the member for O'Connor.There is one honourable, decent person on the opposition benches, and that is the member for Kooyong, who is widely respected in the community on both sides of parliament. You can see why: he understands what is going on here - he realises how appalling this is. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to immediately repudiate these attacks by his three members on the Secretary of the Treasury and to stick to his statements of 22 October when he indicated the Secretary of the Treasury was held in his highest regard.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. The purpose of my call to the President of the United States was to discuss the importance of the G20. The President was fully aware that was what the conversation was about. We supported the decision by the President to host that meeting, which I will be attending over the course of this weekend - on Saturday. It is an important meeting, it is important for the country's future, and we will be cooperating closely not just with the government of the United States but with other governments on the key challenges on the global agenda, namely, the global financial crisis, global financial regulation and global economic growth. We will get on with the business of conducting what is an appropriate level of policy coordination with our friends and partners. We will do so in the future. It is the right course of action and we have our sleeves rolled up and intend to get on with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question. As she knows, there are more than 27,000 pensioners and 11,000 families in her electorate who are going to benefit from the government's Economic Security Strategy. Pensioners, carers and disability support pensioners are all going to get a helping hand in the lead-up to Christmas. Four million pensioners, in fact, and 1.9 million families will all get some extra help from the $10.4 billion extra that is going into the economy. This will be $4.8 billion as a down payment on pension reform through lump sum payments to pensioners. That will mean $1,400 each for single pensioners and $2,100 for pensioner couples. It will apply to those on the age pension, disability support pensioners, carer payment recipients, wife and widow pensioners, partners, veterans and self-funded retirees holding a Commonwealth seniors health card. All of these people will receive a payment from 8 December. People who are receiving the carer allowance will also get $1,000 for each eligible person that they are caring for.Unlike those opposite, we will not be pitting pensioner groups against each other. We certainly will not be excluding two million carers, people with disabilities or pensioner couples. We recognise that all of these people are doing it tough. For the first time, disability support pensioners will be getting a lump sum payment. This strategy, which will be introduced into the parliament this afternoon, will bring new spending on pensioners to $12.3 billion since the last election. As I said before, one of the most important things is that this is a down payment on our pension reforms for the future, intended to provide the additional support that pensioners need and that they have been waiting for for a very long time, in the nine months between now and when long-term reforms are introduced from the next financial year.It is also the case that, as a result of this package, Australian families who are under significant pressure will get some extra help. Families who are receiving family tax benefit part A will get a one-off payment of $1,000 for each eligible child in their care. That will mean extra money for around four million children in Australia before Christmas. There are about 190,000 families with dependent children who receive youth allowance, Abstudy or a benefit from the veterans' children scheme, and they also will receive the $1,000 payment.There have certainly been a lot of groups indicating their support for the government's strategy. The Fair Go for Pensioners Coalition has said that this is very welcome news that builds confidence and security amongst pensioners and seniors. Those from disability organisations have recognised that this is much needed assistance at a particularly vulnerable time for pensioners. They have also said that it goes some way towards addressing the neglect of the previous federal government over the past 10 years. Carers Australia have said that they are very pleased to see that the government has listened and is now taking real action. They also said that this is an important victory for those left out of previous proposals and that this extra money will provide desperately needed relief for Australia's hardest working families. That is certainly the case for those who are doing the very tough job of caring.Of course, the responses that we get from these groups representing carers, people with a disability and families is that they all understand what the government is doing. What is not clear is what the opposition believe. We had the Leader of the Opposition on 14 October saying that the opposition were not going to argue or quibble with the government's proposal. It seems to be the case that the Leader of the Opposition cannot hold onto a position for more than a day and some people say he cannot even hold onto one for an even shorter period than that. But, in this case, on 14 October he was in full support with no quibbling. The next day -  - I have no idea what the member for North Sydney thinks either - whether he supports the proposal or not. One day later the Leader of the Opposition said, 'We would no doubt have designed it differently.' All we got from the opposition in the past was that they were going to exclude carers, people on the disability support pension and pensioner couples. They will get the opportunity in the House this week to indicate whether or not they are going to support this package. They can either provide the support that families, people on disability support pensions, carers, coupled pensioners and single pensioners need or continue to do what they have been doing and play politics instead of what the government intends to do and provide the support that these people deserve.</DOC>

 - On the part of the question which refers to my conversation with the President of the United States, I would refer the Leader of the Opposition to my earlier answers. On the question of Australia's engagement with the global negotiations leading up to the G20 meeting in Washington and beyond Washington, the government has been engaged for quite some weeks in high-level coordination with other governments on how we approach the future regulation of the global financial system. We have been doing that at official levels. At present, the Treasurer is in Washington and has just been at a G20 meeting in Sao Paulo in Brazil. The purpose of these meetings -  - The honourable gentleman's question went to the government working with other governments, and that is what I am responding to. It goes to the question of the agenda which is being framed for the G20 meeting in Washington and the intense preparatory work which is underway in relation to that between us and the other governments participating in this meeting. One of the things on the agenda will be the future regulation of the global financial system, and that will also deal with the future, I believe, of executive remuneration and other such considerations. Long term we have to look at appropriate regulation under the Basel arrangements and, beyond that, we also need to look at the capacity for coordinated action on fiscal policy and, where possible, on monetary policy. These are the big agendas for the future. We will be participating in this meeting, as we have been at an officials and a ministerial level in the preparatory meetings. This is important for Australia. We are playing a positive role and will continue to do so.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Longman for his question. The government recognised the importance of a strong and stable housing market and acted very early and decisively to commit $1Â½ billion to the first home owners boost. The homeowners boost was increased to $14,000 for existing homes and $21,000 for newly built homes. The increase in the grant has been very well received by the broader community and by the housing industry. The Reserve Bank, in its statement on monetary policy released recently, said that recent falls in interest rates in the fiscal stimulus package, which includes an increase in the first home owners grant for purchases of existing and new dwellings, are expected to boost conditions in this sector in the coming year.On the visits I have made to a number of members' electorates, we have had very good early indications of increased interest in the residential construction area. Recently I visited the member for Longman's electorate and met builders and developers in Caboolture at a meeting that the member for Longman organised. Those builders, developers and others told me that they had certainly seen a lot of renewed interest from first home buyers, particularly in the smaller, more modest homes that they were able to build in some of those areas. I met also with builders, architects and real estate agents in Launceston recently during the visit that the member for Bass organised. Again, they are seeing very high levels of inquiries and certainly a spark of interest. In Seaford Downs in Kingston and Bianco Constructions in Port Adelaide - all these places - our members of parliament have been engaged very actively with constituents in their electorates. Builders, developers and construction supply companies all report increased activity and interest, and we are very hopeful that, over time, this will translate into increased sales. We have seen on the weekend in Sydney reports that Landcom sold 46 house and land packages in Sydney recently, while in the previous nine months activity had been, as they said, dead. More recently one development in Newbury sold seven out of eight available properties in just one weekend. So we are seeing the beginnings of increased interest returning to the market.Many first home buyers are considering bringing forward purchases that they intended to make. We have seen a lot more traffic through places like HomeWorld in Kellyville, the Home Buyer Show in Sydney and in other places. All of them report a degree of increased traffic. In fact, in HomeWorld in Kellyville I spoke to a very lovely young third-generation builder there, Michael King, who told me that his dad and his grandad said to him that they had never seen a quieter time in the building industry. Yet, in the hours after we made our announcement, they were already receiving increased numbers of phone calls and, certainly in the first weekend after the announcement was made, they were seeing a lot more young couples, a lot more people going through looking at his display homes. They are very hopeful that they will see that translate into increased sales. I am very pleased to report that the legislation to support the Economic Security Strategy is being introduced today into the parliament.</DOC>

As I have made clear and the White House has made clear and the US ambassador has made clear, the reported comment was never made and was inaccurate.

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know that as a representative of a young and growing community she is particularly concerned about the circumstances of childcare provision in her electorate and around the nation. Yesterday I updated the House on the government's response to ABC Learning moving into voluntary administration last week, after which, almost immediately, a receiver was appointed by the creditors of ABC Learning. I take the opportunity to update the House today on some developments that happened yesterday.The government's childcare industry task force yesterday met with the receiver and was updated on the receiver's plans. The receiver of ABC Learning is now undertaking a detailed review of the operational data of each and every ABC Learning Centre. During this period of time the government has been assisted by members of PPB, an insolvency and corporate recovery practitioners firm.Today I can announce, as a consequence of yesterday's discussion between the government's childcare industry task force and the receiver, it has been agreed that government representatives, including members of PPB, the insolvency and corporate recovery practitioners, will be embedded working with the receiver in undertaking this work of a detailed review of the operational data of each and every ABC Learning Centre. Of course, this work is essential and necessary in order to determine the best way forward for all ABC centres. In some cases this may create opportunities for not-for-profit and for-profit entities to operate local childcare centres that were previously operated by ABC but were not viable under the ABC current business model.As members of the parliament would be aware and would have seen media reports in relation to, a number of organisations have already contacted the receiver and others have contacted various arms of government with a view to expressing their interest in potentially buying or otherwise operating individual or a number of ABC Learning Centres. It is important to note that at this stage the receiver expects that most centres will continue to operate into the new year. There is currently no sale process being conducted for ABC assets. However, the receiver will need to be as well informed as possible when making decisions about the future of each centre and the care arrangements for families.Today I can announce that an expression of interest process has commenced to ensure that the receiver has the best available range of options for considering the future operation of ABC Learning Centres. I encourage any parties, be they for profit or not for profit, to register their interest in participating in the future of ABC with the receiver. Once the review process has identified the likely future arrangements for each centre, the receiver, working with the government, will map and sort the registrations of interest against the identified local need.In addition to the registration of interest process, the government and the receiver are continuing to consult with stakeholders with an interest in the provision of early learning and care. The Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Child Care, the member for Bennelong, is also in regular contact with early childhood education and care stakeholders. The member for Bennelong has been involved in discussing and consulting about the government's reform agenda in child care and early learning. Since the election of the government, she has conducted more than 50 stakeholder meetings and visited 25 childcare centres, and quality forums have been conducted in each state and territory. Earlier today, the parliamentary secretary, the member for Bennelong, attended a forum here in Canberra with around a dozen peak national childcare organisations. This forum had been arranged as part of the government's ongoing consultation processes in relation to its reform agenda in child care. Of course, the agenda of the forum included a discussion of the ABC Learning situation. This is a challenging situation for parents, communities, the government and the corporate parties involved. The government will continue to work closely with all stakeholders to maximise certainty and stability in the provision of childcare services because we understand how vital that is for mums and dads around this country.</DOC>

 - On the question of my conversation with the President of the United States, the Leader of the Opposition will be aware of my earlier answers - that is, that the purpose of my call to the President of the United States was to discuss the relevance of the G20 to the global financial crisis. Secondly, the President of the United States was entirely aware of the role of the G20. In fact, I would draw the honourable gentleman's attention to a statement I think I made in this place prior to the publication of the article that he refers to where I said that the G20 meeting was also attended by President Bush, referring to a meeting which the finance minister was attending of G20 finance ministers in Washington. That was attended by the US President at the time. Furthermore, as I have said, and as the White House has said, any suggestion that the reported comment relating to the President of the United States not being familiar with the operation of G20 was never made and was never enacted. - That statement was made by me in the parliament prior to the article in the Australian appearing. That obviously referred to the President himself attending a meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington. What I said in this House prior to that article appearing was that the G20 meeting was also attended by President Bush. I went on to say that the President, together with others, had been providing important leadership in this area by calling for appropriate coordinated international action. That was my view then, it has been my view since then, it was certainly my view following the conversation with President Bush and my view has never changed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for his question and for the opportunity to visit the South East Melbourne Manufacturing Alliance with him in Dandenong, just outside his electorate, before the last federal election, which gave me extra perspectives on the challenges facing small businesses. A high-speed national broadband network will be of particular benefit to small businesses. About 93 per cent of small businesses are connected to the internet. The government's national high-speed broadband network will provide fast broadband services to 98 per cent of Australia. The government broadband rollout will provide real opportunities for small businesses, especially those in the service economy, to expand into new markets while also keeping upfront costs and risks to a minimum. - High-speed broadband also provides opportunities to reduce the cost of doing business by cutting administrative costs and increasing productivity through the adoption of new technologies. I was asked about alternative policy perspectives. A speech delivered to the Sydney Institute in 1999 provides such perspectives. The speech says:The fusion of computing and communications, especially through the internet, have broken the bounds of time, cost and distance.I was fascinated to see that this is a perspective shared in its entirety with the United Nations Human development report published in that same year, which said:The fusion of computing and communications - especially through the internet - has broken the bounds of time, cost and distance _The speech went on to observe:In biotechnology, the ability to identify and move genetic materials across species types has broken the bounds of nature, creating totally new organisms with enormous but unknown implications _Now, the Human development report says:In biotechnology the ability to identify and move genetic materials across species types has broken the bounds of nature, creating totally new organisms with enormous but unknown implications.The speech went on to say:_ both the communications technologies and the biotechnologies are fuelling globalisation, opening new markets and giving rise to new actors.I thought that was familiar, because it says in the UN Human development report:Both technologies are fuelling globalization, opening new markets and giving rise to new actors. - Mr Speaker, it is coming - it is on its way. The final point that was made in this learned speech to the Sydney Institute in 1999, and it is the final point, was:_ but my point is that, compared with most traditional tools for -  - I am indeed, Mr Speaker. The learned speech to the Sydney Institute says:_ but my point is that, compared with most traditional tools for development, information and communication technologies can reach many more people, go geographically deeper, work faster and at lower cost.Well, was it the author's point, Mr Speaker? Was it indeed the author's point, because in the Human development report it says:Compared with most traditional tools for development, information and communications technologies can reach many more people, go geographically deeper, work faster and at lower cost.Who is the author? The shadow Treasurer - the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She has been caught out copying again. She is a serial offender. At that time the now shadow Treasurer was a backbencher, and she delivered that speech at the same forum on the same day with me. We did not have chiefs of staff - we were backbenchers. It was not the fault of a chief of staff this time. The member for Curtin, the shadow Treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, is a serial offender and she has been caught red-handed yet again.</DOC>

 - First and foremost in our assistance to the Australian auto industry, we believe it is necessary to provide that industry with confidence for the long term, because we have in that industry many, many thousands of Australians employed and many further tens and hundreds of thousands of Australians who are employed indirectly as a consequence of the auto industry in this country, in the parts and supply industry. It is because of the significance of the industry to jobs in Australia that the government has taken action. We have taken action both in this area and in our broader economic stimulus package because we are engaged in a war against unemployment. We are engaged, therefore, in taking all necessary actions to ensure that we support positive growth in jobs into the future.On the specific part of the question which was raised by the Leader of the Opposition about the construction of the financial package for the auto companies, the honourable member will be familiar with the fact that the dollars provided in that package are entirely conditional on co-investment from the companies concerned and, as a consequence of that, that investment has to be delivered in order for payments to be paid. There is, therefore, an appropriate guarantee for the Australian taxpayer and appropriate support for Australian jobs going forward.</DOC>

 - Relations between Australia and Indonesia have never been in a better state. Relations between Australia and Indonesia have never been at a higher level. There are, I think, three reasons for that. Firstly, there was the signing and bringing into force of the Lombok-Perth Treaty earlier this year, brought into force by me on behalf of Australia and Minister Wirajuda on behalf of Indonesia. Secondly, there is a realisation that after many years of friendship and partnership, which started with Australia's support of Indonesian independence, we came to appreciate there could be things about which we might have a different view which did not disturb the basis and the nature of the relationship - which did not disturb the respect, the regard and the trust between our two nations. Thirdly, as I have said publicly in the past, and I repeat it today, whilst it is the case that the relationship has never been at a better level, the current government did inherit from the previous government a relationship with Indonesia in very good order. This has not always been the case, but we inherited a relationship in very good order which we have taken to a new level.Today I can indicate to the House that we conducted the 9th Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum, which saw a meeting of over a dozen ministers from both our countries. Can I acknowledge on the floor of the chamber my counterpart, Minister Wirajuda, and the Minister for Law and Human Rights, Minister Mattalata. I warmly welcome them to the House, and I know that sentiment is shared by all members of the House. The coming to Australia of half-a-dozen Indonesian ministers brings to 29 the number of two-way ministerial visits since the government came to office. This includes two visits to Australia by Minister Wirajuda, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and two visits to Indonesia by the Prime Minister and by me. This high-level exchange is very, very important and very, very productive.The 9th Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum was very instructive and very productive. A 47-paragraph communique has been issued reflecting the array of interests between our two nations: from security and counterterrorism cooperation to cooperation against people smuggling and illegal people movements; cooperation in partnership development and assistance; our cooperation so far as addressing the global financial crisis is concerned; and our cooperation on democratic matters, including our very strong support for the Bali Democracy Forum, which the Prime Minister hopes very much to attend in December and co-chair a session of with the Indonesian President. On Australia's support of Indonesian democracy, I can announce to the House a contribution of more than $6 million from Australia to assist the Indonesian Electoral Commission in the running of the Indonesian elections, both parliamentary and presidential, in April and June of next year respectively.We had a long conversation, the foreign minister and I, about not just the good nation-to-nation relationship and not just the good government-to-government relationship but also the need to consolidate this first-class relationship with people-to-people exchanges. Central to that is education. I am very proud that this parliament and this government is in the middle of a program to build 2,000 schools in Indonesia - 2,000 schools for Indonesians built by the Australian people and the Australian parliament. This is a terrific contribution that we make. Those young Indonesians, when they finish their education, will end up becoming ambassadors for Australia because they know that their education has in part been provided by Australia. The same is true of our extensive scholarships program.Can I finish by making this point. Recently we saw the 20th anniversary of the Australia-Indonesia Institute, which has done very good work in building people-to-people exchanges between our two countries. There are three documents every member of the House should have to refer to the modern Australia-Indonesia relationship: the Lombok Perth Treaty, the communique issued today and Minister Wirajuda's speech on the 20th anniversary of the Australia-Indonesia Institute in Jakarta on 4 November. I thank Minister Wirajuda, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Minister Mattalatta, Minister for Law and Human Rights, for coming to Australia and for coming to question time, and I warmly commend our relationship to the House and to the Australian people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The car companies based in Detroit are of course critical to the future of the global car industry, whether we are talking about GM or Ford or, in the case of the United States, Chrysler as well. For Australia, the other big player of course is Toyota and its headquartered operations in Nagoya. On an earlier visit to Japan I spoke with the CEO of Toyota, Mr Watanabe, and also on a subsequent visit to Australia by Mr Watanabe in Melbourne. The industry minister himself has been to Detroit and spoken with the heads of the two car companies in recent times. Of course, discussions have occurred with greater intensity in recent times between the Australian heads of the car companies concerned and they in turn have been in contact with their headquarters.The bottom line is this, and I say to the former minister: this proposal by Australia for the future is to support our car industry, which employs directly and indirectly 200,000 Australians. We take that as a serious responsibility for the future. When the car industry in Australia is under challenge from the global financial crisis and the global economic downturn, when the car industry globally is facing similar challenges, either you can stand idly by and allow problems to simply mount or you can assist. We have chosen a path of active assistance but a path of active assistance which has conditionalities attached. The conditionalities, for the benefit of the information of the honourable member, are those I described before - that is, we are only investing in the future of the car industry based on explicit commitments to invest from the car companies and on a specific co-investment ratio, which was articulated clearly in the statement issued by the industry minister on the day this package was announced.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. I know she is very concerned about the future of child care in this country and the future of ABC Learning. Yesterday I informed the House that the receiver of ABC Learning is undertaking a review of the operational data of ABC Learning Centres. I also informed the House that my department's task force has engaged the insolvency firm PPB to work with the receiver on this matter. I would like to give some further details to the House about the role of PPB in this situation.PPB is one of Australia's foremost insolvency firms. Mr Steve Parbury, a partner of the firm, is working closely with the department's task force. He, of course, has performed work for previous governments on complex insolvency issues. For example, he was engaged by the former government in relation to the Ansett matter. Steve Parbury represented FAI as a special-purpose liquidator when HIH collapsed, so Mr Parbury is no stranger to complex situations. Mr Parbury has previously played a prominent role in the Insolvency Practitioners Association and he is able to provide objective and highly informed advice on how the government can most constructively play a role in dealing with the situation with ABC Learning.The receivers have advised the task force in my department that the quality of ABC Learning data and their information management systems are poor. Therefore, PBB and the receivers, McGrath Nichol, have had in effect to start from scratch and work out what to do with the centres, particularly those that are currently understood to be unprofitable. Obviously, you do not need to be an insolvency practitioner to intuitively work out that this is a difficult, time-consuming and complex task. They have developed a work plan to compile, assess and analyse data and information on ABC Learning Centres that have been identified as unprofitable under the current business model.Firstly, a template will be designed for assessing and compiling key financial and other data from ABC Learning's systems on a centre-by-centre basis. The templates will include costs, revenues, occupancy and trends for each of the centres, and that work has started. The team will need to then take data and financial details and verify those against the records and documents of individual centres. This will be done by tracking back to the original source documents. For example, this could include lease documents, invoices for food, toy delivery invoices and/or, depending on the circumstances, staff pay records. This is clearly a time-consuming task but the work is proceeding and people are working hard on it.Of course, there is a question of: how did we end up here? We ended up here because of the neglect of the former government over more than 10 long years when they let the market rip. It is not often that one would come into this parliament and refer to the Nationals leader in the Senate, Senator Barnaby Joyce, as a man of great and quiet reflection, but today I will refer to him because he is clearly thinking about the circumstances of ABC Learning. He said publicly today:The reason we have got such a fiasco with ABC - and then he diverted a little by saying that he agrees with the Greens - _ is because one organisation dominated too much of the market. That is what you get when you get market centralisation.Senator Barnaby Joyce is thinking about these issues, thinking about the policy and thinking about the consequences of letting the market rip. Over there we have the Liberal Party, which has not reflected at all on its policy failures. The Liberal Party was not just neglectful when it came to ABC Learning; it was complicit and connected with the circumstances of ABC Learning.Let us take one example of that connection - the member for Dickson. He and his family own a building leased to ABC Learning for $100,000 per annum. We know that in the recent election campaign the member for Higgins, the then Treasurer, toured an ABC Learning Centre with the member for Dickson for the publicity that it would generate. And the member for Dickson has referred to Eddy Groves as a friend and supporter. This shows the connection -  - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. If the member wants to learn about the connection between the Liberal Party and ABC Learning, I will refer her to the pages of the newspapers where these things are spelt out day after day. These connections are well known. While the Liberal Party refuses to address the consequences of its more than a decade of neglect in this area, its failure to act and its degree of connection, the Rudd Labor government will get on with the job of ensuring that families that rely on ABC Learning Centres have the stability and security they need in this difficult situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. In recent weeks, many governments have taken steps to provide guarantees and other support to depositors and banks borrowing in global capital markets. A variety of bank guarantees have been implemented by governments across the developed world - in the US, the UK, the euro area and Korea. Emerging economies such as Indonesia have also implemented guarantees for their own banking sectors. While conditions remain fragile across the global economy, there is beginning to emerge evidence that these guarantees have boosted confidence and bank funding costs have begun to come down. Although it is very early days, these guarantees appear to be having an early effect.For the benefit of honourable members, I will draw their attention to what has happened in a number of foreign jurisdictions. On 3 November the United States increased coverage of its deposit insurance scheme from deposits of US$100,000 to US$250,000 per depositor through to 31 December 2009. In the United States indicators are that US bank funding costs have declined since the guarantee was introduced, with the US dollar three-month LIBOR falling from 4.21 per cent at the close of business on 2 October to 2.18 per cent as of 11 November. In the UK on 3 October the government raised the value of deposits it ensures and, following this, the three-month GBP LIBOR has fallen from 6.28 per cent at close of business on 2 October to 4.38 per cent at the close of business on 11 November. The LIBOR is the London interbank rate, by the way. On 7 October the European Commission increased the minimum level of coverage of deposits from EURO20,000 to EURO50,000, and the three-month euro LIBOR has fallen from 5.34 per cent at close of business on 6 October to 4.3 per cent at close of business on 11 November.I draw honourable members' attention to the following, which was contained also in the recent statement by the Reserve Bank of Australia and which says:Following the announcement of these policy actions designed to improve confidence in financial systems, US dollar term spreads began to narrow in mid to late October. There has been increased debt issuance in money markets at terms longer than one week.These are very early tentative beginnings of some form of normalisation in global financial markets. There is still a long way to go but these are welcome, albeit small, developments. In Australia, following the announcement of the government's guarantees on 12 October, spreads have begun to fall. Liquidity as measured by the spread between the 90-day bank bill and three-month overnight index swap in the Australian dollar market has fallen from 93 basis points down to 47 basis points as of yesterday.Australian banks were also experiencing some success with liquidity-raising efforts, and the cost of wholesale funding has begun to come down. Since the Australian guarantees were introduced, the 90-day bank bill - that is the proxy interbank rate for the Australian dollar market - has fallen from 6.03 per cent at close of business on 10 October, which was just prior to the bank guarantees being implemented, to 4.87 per cent at close of business on 11 November. Again I would say these are very early days but we begin to see some small evidence of the beginnings of a return to some level of normalisation in financial markets here. There is still a long, long way to go and the path will not be even.At the upcoming meeting in Washington, governments around the world will be acting together on how to bring about appropriate regulatory changes to deal with the future demands of financial markets as well. A lot has been achieved so far on the national front; much more needs to be done on the international and co-ordinated global front. Therefore, at the Washington meeting on Saturday, there will be intense discussion of new proposals dealing with financial markets and the world economy. The summit will address the financial and economic challenges the world faces from the ongoing global financial crisis which, as honourable members will be aware, has also become a global economic crisis in terms of the impact on growth and jobs.Around the globe more cooperation is needed to deal with these challenges, and that means that we need an appropriate response to regulatory reform based on transparency, market integrity, responsibility for risk management and a proper approach, globally, on the question of remuneration packages for executives within systemically important financial institutions as well as effective cross-border consistency.We are still in the midst of this crisis and there is a long, long way to go. But Australia will work with other leaders to commission a broad program of reform and strengthening of financial markets and institutions. The work will be brought back to leaders for further deliberation and decision. We will be discussing specific proposals, including improving the representativeness of key bodies like the Financial Stability Forum and strengthening the range of lending facilities available from the IMF and the World Bank.These are important matters for the global community, as is the following: how the countries of the world combine in terms of coordinated or cooperative macroeconomic action, fiscal policy stimulus and, where possible, monetary policy stimulus in order to engender greater economic growth, given the shock which has been delivered to real growth rates around the world as a consequence of the global financial crisis.This financial crisis is moving into an economic crisis affecting jobs in the real economy and therefore the need for coordinated or at least cooperative fiscal and monetary policy action across the principal economies of the world has now become necessary. The move by China that we discussed in the parliament briefly the other day is welcome. We need to see more coordinated action across the major economies of the world, given the large amount of activity which is being sucked out of the global economy as a consequence of the crisis, and therefore the role of governments at this critical juncture is to support growth in the difficult period ahead.The Australian government will work cooperatively and collaboratively with our international partners in order to address the challenges on these three fronts: regulatory change now, regulatory change for the future for the financial system and coordinated, where possible, action on fiscal and monetary policy stimulus, with the end point being to support growth and to support jobs. We, the world community, are all in this together.</DOC>

 - The exponents of extreme capitalism opposite should reflect carefully on their remarks and intervention in this debate. I would have thought the member for Goldman Sachs would have thought twice before asking a question of that type. The question relates to the reported comment that appeared in a newspaper on 25 October. The explicit purpose of my call to the President of the United States was to discuss the role of the G20 in responding to the global financial crisis. Any suggestion that the President was not fully aware of the role of the G20 is not accurate. The White House, the United States ambassador and I have confirmed and made it clear that the reported comment was never made by the President of the United States and was therefore inaccurate. That has been my position since the beginning of this matter; that position has not changed. I would note also that the US ambassador in his remarks has made it clear that the matter is now concluded, and that is our view as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. At the heart of the global financial crisis lies a failure of regulation, not just regulation in the United States but also international regulation. It is not a problem of insufficient regulation; it is a problem of inadequate regulation. That is something that the Prime Minister has addressed in his recent speech to the UN General Assembly and that the government will continue to prosecute in international forums.Australia is fortunate to have avoided the excesses of the subprime era in the United States - but that is not an accident; it is because Australia has a strong regulatory framework run by world-class regulators. But we should never be complacent. There is always room for improvement, refinement and reform, and the government is continuing to work with the Australian regulators to pursue any strengthening and improvement that is appropriate. That is why the government has tightened rules regarding credit-rating agencies, for example, requiring them to hold financial service licences and to undergo annual compliance reporting to ASIC. The government will continue to work with the regulators to ensure that we navigate the global financial crisis in the best possible shape and to ensure that we maintain our strong regulatory arrangements.It is particularly disappointing to see the opposition engaging in a persistent pattern of vicious personal attacks on the key regulators in Australia's financial architecture. Several weeks ago we had the member for Canning attack the Reserve Bank governor, clearly suggesting that the Reserve Bank's decisions on interest rates were driven by political bias. A couple of weeks ago we had the Secretary of the Treasury accused, by the Leader of the Opposition, of lying, and then the following day he was accused of lying to the Senate by Senator Abetz. In both cases there was not a skerrick of evidence and not one hint of a suggestion of any substantiation of these accusations, notwithstanding the fact that these are about the most serious accusations you can make against somebody like the Secretary of the Treasury.But yesterday we had the member for Goldstein - a senior frontbencher; not a rogue backbencher like the member for O'Connor or the member for Canning - sent out to allege that the Secretary of the Treasury, and, indeed, the Treasury, had cooked the books. That was the nature of the allegation: that the Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasury had cooked the books. Again, there was not one scintilla of evidence advanced to support this claim. There was not one shred of evidence advanced to support this claim.Then of course, just to add to the general milieu of all of this, we had, predictably, the member for Canning allege that because the Secretary of the Treasury was addressing the National Press Club this made him a political activist. There was no mention of the fact that the former and current head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Michael L'Estrange, addressed the National Press Club in 2006. There was no mention of the fact that the former and current head of the Australian Federal Police, Mick Keelty, addressed the National Press Club in 2004. Then of course you had, right on cue, the member for O'Connor engage in the usual additional barrage of personal vituperation and nonsense. And subsequently we have had Senator Coonan, another senior frontbencher, confirm the accusations by the member for Goldstein, saying that the Treasury figures seemed suspicious.Why is this happening? Why do we suddenly get this pattern - an orchestrated set of attacks on Australia's regulator? Most Australians support our regulators. Most Australians think it is important to have a strict set of rules and fair dinkum, impartial, tough umpires. But there are, sadly, some people in the community who do not. There are some people in the community who do not like regulators and who do not like tough rules. The sharks and the shonks and the spivs that inevitably populate the nether regions of the financial world do not like regulators. Unfortunately they have taken over the Liberal Party. The sharks and the shonks and the spivs have taken over the Liberal Party. There has always been a factional tension in the Liberal Party - not between the wets and the dries but between old money and fast money. And fast money has taken over. - The Leader of the Opposition is showing his true colours. He is a weak leader and he is a front for spivs and shonks and sharks. He has refused to repudiate the attacks on the Secretary of the Treasury by the member for Goldstein. He therefore effectively associates himself with this those -  - I am not sure which remarks he is referring to but I withdraw. - It is time that the Leader of the Opposition took a stand on this matter. It is time that the opposition leader either stands up and substantiates the claims that the Treasury has cooked the books or he withdraws them on behalf of the opposition and apologises to the Secretary of the Treasury. Those are his choices: he either puts up or backs down.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The centrepiece of the Liberal Party's policy on fuel has, of course, been a 5c a litre cut on fuel excise. In fact, it is the only policy that the Liberal Party has announced since the last election. Costed by them at $2 billion a year, this policy would provide relief to motorists of about $2.50 a week if fully passed on to Australian motorists. We know that the -  - We know that the Leader of the Opposition feels that this is bad policy. In fact, he even felt that when he was known as the humble member for Wentworth before he became Leader of the Opposition, because he sent an email to his good friend the member for Bradfield. And he was right - it is bad policy. When he was elected Leader of the Opposition, on his first day as Leader of the Opposition, when asked, 'Will it remain Liberal Party policy?' he said:In terms of the fuel excise policy, we've made that policy commitment and we stick to it, we honour it, that is our commitment. We made it as a party.That is what he said. Strong words - a rolled gold commitment from the Leader of the Opposition. But then, on Friday, the Leader of the Opposition walked away from that commitment. He told the West Australian that it was a promise 'made in the context of a by-election in Gippsland'.So, apparently, if a commitment is made in the context of a by-election it is not a commitment at all. Yesterday, we had the member for North Sydney nuancing the arguments a little further for the reasons for the backflip. He said the reason the opposition has changed its mind is that the government did not adopt the policy. He said that because we, the government, have not adopted the policy:Therefore you've got to move on; otherwise, if you keep fighting yesterday's battles you're never going to move forward with a forward agenda.So there you have it - a commitment from the opposition is only a commitment if we adopt it. That is a new definition of a non-core promise. Of course, it is right and proper that the Liberal Party drop this ridiculous policy, because it is bad policy. But what does it say about the credibility of the honourable gentleman who sits opposite when (a) he said it was bad policy, (b) he then supported it as a firm policy commitment and (c) he is now scrapping the policy - that is more flip-flops than you would see at Bondi Beach on a Sunday in summer. We see this continual backflipping and flip-flopping from the opposition, but that is what we have come to expect from the Leader of the Opposition.I am asked about the importance of policy consistency. We have seen the same inconsistency from the opposition in relation to the government's bank guarantee. When the Prime Minister announced the bank guarantee, the Leader of the Opposition said:We welcome this measure, we support it and we will give the Prime Minister every assistance.On 14 October he even came very close to claiming credit for the bank guarantee. He said:_ the deposit guarantee, we encourage them to take action there. They did, we're supporting that.Now, of course, he says it was a blunder and a failure. Our old friend the shadow Treasurer, in a doorstop interview yesterday morning, said the bank guarantee was causing 'more dislocation in Australia than any other factor' - more dislocation than even the collapse of world financial markets. We know she did not plagiarise that; nobody else would have been silly enough to say that. The Leader of the Opposition told the Australian on Friday:I place a very high premium on consistency and integrity in politics.I do not question the honourable gentleman's integrity, but he has all the consistency of a chameleon. If the Leader of the Opposition wants consistency, he could start by consistently asking and requiring the members for Goldstein, O'Connor and Canning to apologise to some of Australia's finest public servants. It is just another reminder that, when it comes to the Leader of the Opposition, you have to look at what he does and not what he says - because what he says has no credibility.</DOC>

 - The honourable Leader of the Opposition's question goes to the newspaper article of 25 October. Again, I would draw his attention to the answer to the earlier question. I also ask him to reflect on what did happen in the Andrew Wilkie affair, when I seem to recall that an ONA classified document found its way into a Melbourne newspaper in a quite mysterious set of circumstances. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition, or those opposite who were party to that, could inform the House as to what then transpired.An opposition member - Not another Dorothy!</DOC>

 - I just happen to have something that you will be interested in! I thank the member for Fremantle for her question. She has been able to provide me with from Beaconsfield Primary School a commemorative plaque which reads: 'A souvenir of action between HMAS Sydney and Bartolomeo Colleoni resulting in the sinking of the Italian cruiser.' As far as I am aware, this is the only such souvenir, though there may be others. In the context of my discussions over the last few months this is the only item that I have seen actually from the Sydney and we understand it to be a part of the funnel damaged in that battle with the Colleoni off Cape Spada in Crete on 19 July 1940. I want to thank the member for Fremantle and also the member for Brand for bringing this to my attention. The member for Brand, of course, hosts Fleet Base West at Stirling in Western Australia and has a significant interest in this issue.More importantly, on the 11th of the 11th 67 years ago HMAS Sydney II departed Fremantle. She departed Fremantle escorting the troopship Zealandia. On 17 November she transferred that responsibility to the British ship Durban and she was to have returned to Perth on 20 November, and we know that she never arrived. She was sunk by the German raider HSK Kormoran on 19 November, with the loss of 645 crew.You recall that after searching for this vessel earlier this year there was a national commemorative service at St Andrews in Sydney on 24 April. On 16 April a small ceremony off the Anzac had been held over the site of the sinking of the Sydney. Next week on 19 November there will be a series of national events. One of those will be at the Geraldton War Cemetery, where we will lay to rest a sailor believed to have come from the HMAS Sydney II, whose remains were exhumed from Christmas Island. After significant efforts at DNA testing family members of crew members from the Sydney, we have yet to identify this person. However, he is to be buried at the war cemetery in Queens Park on the 19th at Geraldton. Significantly, on that day we will be holding on board HMAS Manoora, over the site of the HMAS Sydney II, a service which will be for family members of the Sydney. Two hundred and eighty family members will be on board for this service. The City of Geraldton-Greenough will also host their annual sunset memorial service at the Dome of Souls at Geraldton on the 19th.On 27 October I advised all members of a series of national events including ones to be held here in Canberra, in Sydney, in Brisbane, in South Australia and in Fremantle. I would encourage members to attend if they possibly can. I would also advise that the member for Brand is very active in this area. He is organising a display at his community stall on the 15th and 16th in addition to the commemorative service and presentation planned for 19November. This is a very important memento of Australian history and I would encourage members when they are contemplating the sinking of the Sydney and the loss of those 645 souls to understand the bravery with which those men served and the honour that they have brought to this nation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for North Sydney for his question, and it goes to how we ended up in a situation where one company had 25 per cent of market share. That is what is at stake here. It is a very big public policy question. How did we end up in a situation where one company with 25 per cent of market share could be responsible -  - I think that the member for Dickson protests too much! When you have a company like that, with 25 per cent of market share for long-day places in Australia, there is a problem for mums and dads right across the nation if something goes wrong for that single provider. That is the problem we face. It is a problem of market concentration. I would therefore suggest to the honourable member for North Sydney when he raises this question that he direct his thoughts and his sentiments to the mums and dads out there now desperately anxious about making sure they have got a place to send their kids at the beginning of next year.The Deputy Prime Minister has acted entirely appropriately in taking decisive action to make sure that we provide for those centres to remain open through December so that kids will not be left in the immediate lurch. That was the danger we faced quite recently. The Deputy Prime Minister acted entirely appropriately. How would you feel if you had to front on Monday with no certainty of where your kids could go to child care? The impact it would have on people's ability to conduct their normal lives, to go to work and earn a living would be enormous. The action taken by the Deputy Prime Minister was entirely appropriate.The policy question which forms the basis of the member for North Sydney's question is one which we will deliberate on in the future. But can I say this about the level of market concentration: it was monstrously irresponsible of the previous government to allow this state of affairs to occur because of the direct consequence of this level of market concentration on such a large number of kids, mums and dads across Australia should something go wrong with a single company. Something has gone wrong with that single company. We are dealing with the mess that we have been left by those opposite. We will deal with the competition policy questions and other market concentration questions once we are through the current mess.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. I know she is interested in occupational health and safety, particularly in having uniform standards around the nation. Obviously there are no quick or easy solutions to the global financial crisis, but the last thing you should do in difficult times is down tools on reform. This government is continuing to deal with necessary reform in this country, and there is no bigger item on the agenda of the business community for regulatory reform than having harmonised occupational health and safety laws around the country so that whether you are running a business in Melbourne or in country New South Wales or in the north-west of this country you know what your obligations are, and those obligations will be the same. In a nation of 21 million people, with more businesses trading across state lines than ever before, obviously having uniform laws is a reform worth striving for. This is something that was not done by the former government. It was talked about, constantly. The Liberal Party talk, but when you examine their actions not much happens - and nothing productive happened on harmonising occupational health and safety laws.This government in the middle of this year entered into a historic agreement through the Council of Australian Governments to deliver occupational health and safety laws around the country that would be the same. We are on track to deliver those model laws, so that people can see what they will look like, in May next year. In order to drive this work, the agreement between states and territories and the Commonwealth included an agreement to a new national body to lead this work - Safe Work Australia. The membership, structure and voting arrangements of Safe Work Australia were specified in the intergovernmental agreement. As is the nature of negotiations, not everybody got everything they wanted and there were diverse views about how this organisation should be structured. But, with the best of goodwill, people sat around a table and worked their way towards a consensus. The Prime Minister and premiers signed the agreement off, and we have been attempting to implement it. The thing that has stopped us implementing it is the Liberal Party, which continues to seek amendments to this legislation in the Senate which are different from the intergovernmental agreement and which would cause the whole process to go off the rails because we would have to go back to COAG and back to the Workplace Relations Ministerial Council and seek to renegotiate, losing many vital months in the meantime.The Leader of the Opposition is someone who likes to style himself as understanding the needs of business. But, of course, when it comes to the Leader of the Opposition you cannot listen to what he says; what you have to watch is what he does. Whilst he says he is interested in the needs of business, he is holding up this vital legislation in the Senate. Can I refer him directly to what business has said about this question. The Chief Executive Officer of the Business Council of Australia issued a media release in which she said:'In the current climate businesses need every help to get on with the job. The amendments sought by the Senate jeopardise moves to make business operations and employment of workers simpler across our jurisdictions _'The amendments sought by the Senate in the last sitting are inconsistent with the agreement by all governments at COAG to deliver a uniform national system of _ (OHS) laws.'The Australian Mines and Metals Association has called on the Liberal Party to get out of the way. And then we had a Workplace Relations Ministerial Council meeting last week. The Liberal Party was trying to pretend to this parliament that the amendments it sought would be acceptable to workplace relations ministers around the country so this was no problem. Well, that claim is not true, and no-one can pretend that it is true after the Workplace Relations Ministerial Council last week. It was attended for the first time by the new Liberal workplace relations minister in Western Australia. Whilst he did not join with his Labor colleagues on every aspect of the communique, he joined with his Labor colleagues on the following aspects of the communique. He and every other minister from around the states said:Ministers highlighted that Senate amendments to the Safe Work Australia Bill 2008 were inconsistent with the historic commitment of all governments to uniform national OHS legislation _And it went on - so the Liberal minister in WA is saying this:_ Ministers noted with much concern that the amendments threatened the harmonisation of national OHS legislation, thereby delaying a significant and long overdue economic reform which would enhance OHS outcomes, reduce red tape for business and strengthen Australia's productive capacity.The Liberal Party needs to make a decision here. We will present this legislation to the Senate again. The business community around this nation is calling on you, the Leader of the Opposition, to instruct your senators to get out of the way. Workplace relations ministers around the country, including the only Liberal workplace relations minister, are calling on the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Liberal Party to show some leadership and to get out of the way so that we can get on with this vital task of national reform. In the midst of an economic crisis, the last thing we need is an economic wrecker. We are calling on the Leader of the Liberal Party to get out of the way so we can deal with this important national reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Lyne for his question because it goes to the whole question of the proper provision of GP services right across the country. We on this side of the House, the members of the government, support a universal healthcare system which does not discriminate against people on the basis of how much money they have and should not discriminate against people on the basis of where they live. That is a fundamental principle of social justice and we believe in it. That is why, on this side of the House, we pioneered universal health insurance with Medibank. That is why after the other mob got rid of Medibank -  - Yes. That is why after they got rid of Medibank we brought in Medicare, and after 19 attempts by those opposite to sink the stake through the heart of Medicare they finally tapped the mat - sort of - and allowed Medicare to continue. The reason I have made those introductory remarks is to say that on the question of universal provision in the healthcare system we have a 20- to 30-year track record of standing behind this deep principle.On the question of differential incentives across Australia - and I obviously do not know the circumstances as they apply to the two Hastings concerned - my discussions with the Minister for Health and Ageing, Minister Roxon, have focused in large part on the proper provision -  -  - No, actually it is not even relevant to this question. My discussions with the health minister have focused not just on the undersupply of GPs and nurses nationwide but the equitable distribution of training places across the nation as well. For example, when we were in Launceston the other day for community cabinet, the minister announced a number of additional GP training places for the country. That is one part of solving the problem, to make sure you have got enough flowthrough from the training institutions of Australia in the first place. - I take the interjection from the member for Hume, who sat there as a member of the government for 12 years. What did that government do about the proper provision of GPs to country areas across Australia? Absolutely nothing! Are you seriously suggesting that the GP distribution across rural Australia was better a year or two ago relative to what it was 12 years ago? We all know that this is a national problem requiring a national solution. Part of the solution lies in increasing the number of training places for GPs in Australian tertiary institutions, and that was the announcement made by the minister for health in Launceston at the community cabinet just recently. Part of it also goes to providing proper incentives and equitable incentives across the country to locate GPs in rural and regional areas. My commitment to the honourable member, because he properly seeks to represent his constituents in Lyne, is that the health minister and I will work with him on dealing with the challenges of proper GP delivery in his area.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for her question and I know that she has an acute interest in this issue, particularly in relation to the development of renewable energy technologies in her electorate. The fact is that the government is committed to a vibrant renewable energy sector to help Australia tackle the challenges of climate change. We do that in the context of modelling from Treasury which shows that we can take action to reduce Australia's carbon pollution whilst continuing to grow our economy. We understand that there are significant opportunities for economic growth and for employment that lie in having a healthy renewable energy sector. The government has made a number of significant commitments to this comprehensive approach. We are committed to a 20 per cent renewable energy target by 2020. In this 2008-09 period, we are committed to the largest ever Commonwealth investment in solar power, with more solar panels going onto more rooftops than any other year in Australia's history, and we are committed to introducing a $300 million low interest green loan to make existing homes more energy and water efficient. We have a comprehensive approach to ensuring that we have a robust energy efficiency and renewable energy sector because we know that the challenge of climate change is the most significant one that we face. The Leader of the Opposition says that he also wanted to take action -  -  - before the last election. We know that he wanted to ratify the Kyoto protocol but he could not convince his cabinet colleagues. The reason he could not convince his cabinet colleagues was an innate sense of scepticism amongst some of his colleagues at that time which lives on in the Liberal Party and in the opposition that sits opposite.I noticed the member for Goldstein - the member that has responsibilities for assisting the opposition's emission trading policy - on radio this morning, when he was accusing the government of trying to silence debate, saying on the government's view, 'If you question climate change, you're a sceptic.' This reminded me of an article in the Australian Financial Review called 'The Player', where the member for Goldstein's views were described as those of someone who saw climate change as a 'leftist fad' that will divert resources away from other more needy areas of the economy. In fact, he was quoted as saying that 'after the fall of communism, it' - global warming - 'has become a cause celebre for the left'. He went on to say that he had studied the data and, as someone with a reasonable grasp of statistics, is yet to be convinced. He said:I found that some of the same scientists who in the 1970s were saying we should prepare for an ice age were leading the charge on global warming.So much for the scientific consensus on climate change, and so much for the advice from our own independent scientific bodies like the CSIRO or the International Panel on Climate Change. Let us put it this way: if it looks like a sceptic, if it talks like a sceptic and if it walks like a sceptic, then it is a sceptic. But let me say to the member for Goldstein: if you do not believe that climate change is real, I think the Leader of the Opposition does; if you do not believe that humans are contributing to it, I believe the Leader of the Opposition does. It follows as a consequence that the view that is held in this House by this government is that we need to act resolutely on this matter and that the sooner we take that action the better prepared we will be. But on the other side of the House they still do not get it; they still do not get the need for a real renewable energy sector in this country, and they still do not get the need for a comprehensive approach to climate change, because scepticism is alive and well in the hearts and minds of the Liberal Party and it is time the Leader of the Opposition took some action to deal with it.</DOC>

 - I notice that at the end of the member for North Sydney's question he spoke about a war on bankers' salaries. I would have thought that that is an interesting observation, given the rolling critique about extreme capitalism coming from those opposite. If you were representing the interests of the merchant banking fraternity of Australia I could understand why you would have some concerns about that, but I will not dwell on that further. The core part of the member for North Sydney's question is about unemployment.Our attitude to dealing with the challenge of unemployment is that you can either simply wait for the global financial crisis to become a global economic crisis with real impacts on jobs and real impacts across communities in Australia and do nothing about it, or you can take action. We believe in taking action. That is why we have introduced a $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy; that is why we have supported a $6.2 billion plan for the future of the Australian auto industry; and that is why we support a nation-building agenda for the future. That is because we believe in supporting growth and supporting jobs. This is a serious business, dealing with a serious problem brought about by a serious global financial crisis. It is a course of action to which the government is wedded. Can I suggest to the honourable member for North Sydney that, rather than simply engaging in petty political point-scoring, the nation would be better served if he joined with the government in a combined effort to deal with the challenges of the national economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for that important question. There is no doubt in my mind that the member for Hindmarsh has spent much of his time fighting for workers, and I know it is therefore very appropriate that he ask this question. Two weeks ago I convened a ministerial roundtable of state and territory ministers to discuss employment services and those matters that affect employers and job seekers in this country. Indeed it was the first meeting of its type in more than a decade. I am happy to advise the House that in attendance were all governments, other than the Western Australian government. They did indicate that they could not make that particular meeting, and I sincerely hope that they are in a position to attend the subsequent meeting. But it was a very fruitful meeting, because we discussed those things we have in common in terms of government responses to job seeker needs and the needs of industry and employers.The facts are that we can do a lot more in coordinating our resources collectively as governments in assisting the unemployed and in assisting employers who are looking for skilled labour. Therefore, it was a fruitful meeting, and we decided to have a subsequent meeting in the new year to further consider what more can be done in relation to the state, federal and territory governments working together in this area of public policy. This joint approach by governments is critical, particularly in confronting the challenges of the most significant global financial crisis since the Great Depression, so it was very important that we took that approach.It is also important to remind the House that the government were reforming employment services well before the global financial crisis hit. That means we are in a very good position to respond to the challenges that lie ahead for job seekers and for employers as the consequences of the economic slowdown take effect. The government's training agenda, furthermore, was also initiated before the global financial crisis, because the government anticipated the needs of the nation and was indeed redressing the deficiencies of the previous government in not addressing skill shortages in this country. We had a training agenda that commenced at the beginning of this year, but of course we have added to that agenda as a result of the global financial crisis. The government's training agenda will provide 309,000 extra places for job seekers over the course of the next five years. In keeping with the government's approach to employment, as the Prime Minister just indicated, we announced this week the New Car Plan for a Greener Future, a $6.2 billion injection into the automotive industry over 13 years, again illustrating the fact that the government will always be about job security, job creation and job training. That is a Labor priority. In the government's heart of hearts, we believe that employment is critical to national growth and we believe that we must concern ourselves with the plight of working people.One of the reasons we have had to redress the skill shortage and reform employment services is that those opposite while in government did not do enough to reform employment services and did not do enough to formally address the training needs of this country. We know the reason why. It is that many of those opposite see workers as units of labour only. They do not see them as workers struggling hard to look after their families and their communities. They do not concern themselves with the interests of working families generally. In stark contrast, the government have acted swiftly and decisively in initiating a $10.4 billion package to protect and create jobs in this country, to stimulate the economy and to protect the interests of vulnerable Australians. As a part of the Economic Security Strategy, we have announced a $187 million allocation for an additional 56,000 training places this financial year. So we are making sure that we respond to the needs of workers and the needs of industry in this country. That is why we will continue to work with state and territory governments, industry and job seekers to ensure that they are better off as a result of our policies.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I will say to him what I said to members of the media who asked me about this this morning. That is, everyone should obey the law. Of course everyone in their workplaces should obey the law. The work site that he refers to is a John Holland work site. There has been an ongoing legal dispute there about the nature of right of entry for occupational health and safety inspections. John Holland made the move into Comcare and there is a legal dispute about how right of entry in relation to occupational health and safety should be resolved in the circumstances where John Holland is covered by Comcare but contractors on the site are not direct employees of John Holland and consequently look to New South Wales for their workers compensation arrangements. That matter is before the Federal Court - from recollection it is the Federal Court, but it is certainly before a court and being argued through now. Obviously, I am not going to make a comment about that legal dispute, but the legal dispute is there and is to be resolved. I restate what I absolutely believe in and what my message would be to people in these circumstances and to people in all circumstances. That is, everyone should abide by the law.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corio for his question. Confidence is a central issue in the current economic circumstances facing Australia and indeed the rest of the world. That is confidence not just in wider business conditions but in particular in the strength and integrity of our regulators. It is also particularly important internationally, and that is reflected in decisions being made by international investors and financial institutions with respect to Australia. Those decisions are in turn reflected in things like the interest rates that they charge Australian financial institutions to borrow money from them - which in turn are reflected in things like interest rates that ordinary working people have to pay on their home loans, their credit cards and other financial products.Confidence in the regulatory structure and confidence in the regulators is critical, particularly in the current circumstances where the government is facing very challenging circumstances as a result of the global financial crisis. Any suggestion that our regulators are not rigorous, are not impartial and that they allow politics to intrude into their decision making undermines confidence in the Australian regulatory arrangements both in this country and overseas. If you want to see examples of that, without naming them, all you need to do is have a look at one or two countries overseas where they have genuinely opaque, genuinely politicised regulatory arrangements and see what that does for confidence amongst international investors and international financial institutions.Undermining confidence in our regulators seriously threatens the integrity of the Australian economy. The suggestion that the Australian Treasury has been involved in cooking the books, in publishing false forecasts and the suggestion that the Australian independent Reserve Bank has taken political decisions with respect to interest rates undermines world confidence and undermines Australian confidence in our economic regulators.I am asked why these attacks are happening, why our regulators are being impugned and traduced, why the Secretary of the Treasury is being accused of lying, why he is being accused of cooking the books and why the Reserve Bank governor is being accused of manipulating interest rates for political purposes. The answer is straightforward: this is an orchestrated assault by the Liberal Party. It is according to a plan. It is according to a pattern. It is not a one-off event. It is according to an orchestrated plan on the part of the Liberal Party under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition, because the Liberal Party now represents the shonks, the spivs and the sharks who have all crawled out from under rocks as a result of the global financial crisis.</DOC>

 - I do sincerely thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. On the question of things that the member for Dawson may have said, I will check. I will not take the word of the Leader of the Opposition on that. On the substance of the Leader of the Opposition's question, it strikes me as remarkable that the Leader of the Liberal Party would be calling on someone to apologise to President-elect Obama other than the former Prime Minister of this nation, John Howard. That is who should be apologising to President-elect Obama.Let us just imagine a parallel universe where in 2007 John Howard had won the last election. Let us imagine a parallel universe where John Howard is in the prime ministership - the member for Higgins has been reassured by him that he will hand it over when he is 94, so the member for Higgins is patiently waiting - and the presidential election is over; we know that President-elect Obama has won. Let us just imagine how that phone call would have gone between Prime Minister Howard and President-elect Obama. I do not think it would have escaped President-elect Obama's notice that Prime Minister Howard said about him:I think that would just encourage those who wanted completely to destabilise and destroy Iraq, and create chaos and victory for the terrorists to hang on and hope for (an) Obama victory.These are the words of former Prime Minister Howard:If I was running al-Qaeda in Iraq, I would put a circle around March 2008, and pray, as many times as possible, for a victory not only for Obama, but also for the Democrats.Just imagine how that telephone conversation would have gone. Just imagine it. - I was asked about the question of apologies to President-elect Obama and I am just asking the House to imagine the first telephone call, had it ever occurred, if we were in that parallel universe between Prime Minister John Howard and the man he had called -  - The question actually did refer to President-elect Obama, but putting that to one side, of course what should be happening here is that we should be noting not what the Leader of the Opposition says but what he does. When the greatest offence was paid to President-elect Obama by the then Prime Minister of this country, when the then Prime Minister of this country described the man who is now going to be President of the United States as a terrorist, did we see the member for Wentworth go out and condemn it publicly? Did we see him disassociate himself from it? No, we did not. - I am very happy to. The opposition day after day has raised this issue when it has been fully dealt with by the Prime Minister. What I am asking for is an explanation of their hypocrisy, given the actions of former Prime Minister Howard.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question, and I know that he is deeply interested in workplace relations and fairness and balance in workplaces and has been working closely with me on the development of the government's new workplace relations legislation. I thank him for his efforts. When the Liberal Party was in office we saw industrial relations extremism in this country in the form of Work Choices. This government is committed to fairness and balance in workplaces and we will, before this parliament rises, deliver into this parliament for debate and determination our substantive bill to bring fairness to Australian workplaces.But, as well as being industrial relations extremists, the Liberal Party in government were the masters of the cover-up, because they did not want working people to know - they did not want Australians to know - just how badly hit and hurt they had been by Work Choices and the industrial relations extremism of the Liberal Party. Indeed, the member for North Sydney, now the Manager of Opposition Business and then the relevant minister, used to make an art form of going round denying that such data existed. I am in a position today to advise members of the House and people more generally that we have worked to compile a sample of Australian workplace agreements which will be available for researchers, including members of the media, to use. The sample is now available on DVD-ROM, and what the sample does is compare pre-Work Choices Australian workplace agreements with Work Choices Australian workplace agreements. This is an interesting comparison because pre-Work Choices Australian workplace agreements were bad enough - there is no place for individual statutory employment agreements in a fair system - but, when you compare them to Work Choices Australian workplace agreements, what strikes you is that they look so much better, which is not a compliment to those old AWAs; it is a revelation about how bad Work Choices AWAs were for Australian workers brought to them by the industrial relations extremists in the Liberal Party.To give you just a snapshot of that information, if we look at this sample, in the retail industry Work Choices AWAs, on average, reduced overtime penalty rates from 54 per cent to 35 per cent - that is, the number of people who got penalty rates in their agreement was reduced from 54 per cent to 35 per cent as a result of Work Choices AWAs. They were rip-offs taking away penalty rates. This also happened in the accommodation, cafe and restaurant industry, where we saw the number of agreements that had penalty rates for overtime reduced from 42 per cent to 20 per cent. -  - The industrial relations extremists chant out, 'How much was their pay?' when ABS data clearly shows, when comparing pay outcomes on Australian workplace agreements to pay outcomes on collective agreements, that they ripped people off. I am pleased with the interjections because they indicate yet again to the Australian people, in case they were in any doubt, that those on the other side are a party of industrial relations extremists that are still supporting Work Choices.There is a test here for the Leader of the Opposition, who voted for Work Choices - voted in favour of it every time it was presented to this parliament. There he was, lined up as a member of the Howard government: 'Workplace relations extremism? Count me in.' Yes, he voted for that on each and every occasion. Now, shortly, he will have to make a choice as to whether he will still support workplace relations extremism or support a fair and balanced system. I would say to the Australian people on this issue: watch not what the Leader of the Opposition says but what he does when the Liberal Party votes on this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The premise of the question is that the absence of legislation underpinning the contracts that the government is going to offer wholesale borrowers of funding, mainly financial institutions and in particular banks, would in some way undermine the integrity of those offers. This is a premise that I do not accept and the government does not accept. Should a government in the future, for example, this government, ever be called upon to fulfil such a guarantee because an organisation has collapsed - a remote eventuality, I hasten to underline, and the government has stated that from day one - the premise behind the Leader of the Opposition's question is that the attempt by the government of the day, perhaps the Rudd government, to get legislation through the Senate to honour that guarantee would fail. I wonder why the opposition might consider that an attempt by a government to fulfil an obligation to the Australian people in management of the Australian economy might fail in the Senate. I wonder why the Leader of the Opposition might consider that to be a serious possibility. I assert that any future government that is required to honour such an obligation would have the support of the parliament in honouring such an obligation. The government in pursuing this guarantee is doing so on the basis of the executive power to enter into contracts, and that is how the government intends to proceed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question and I also thank her for her efforts in working with me on the government's workplace relations legislation, which will be in this parliament shortly. I sincerely thank her for her efforts. The government when in opposition last year made a set of promises to the Australian people. We promised them, if elected, we would sweep Work Choices away. We promised them, if elected, we would implement our Forward with Fairness plans. They were detailed to the Australian community and the Australian community voted for them. Those plans will ensure that we have a system that working people in this country can rely on. Under Labor's system, the days of the rip-offs of the Liberal Party and its industrial extremism will be over.Our system will have at its heart a rock solid foundation, a modern safety net made up of 10 National Employment Standards and modern awards. No-one will be able to sweep that safety net away the way it was swept away under Work Choices. We will have a bargaining system that is fair. We will ensure that if the majority of employees want to bargain in their workplace then their employer will bargain with them. We will ensure that there is bargaining in good faith. Our new industrial umpire, Fair Work Australia, will be empowered to make good faith bargaining orders. Our new industrial umpire will be able to direct parties to meet, to disclose relevant information and to consider proposals and respond to them in bargaining. Our new laws will ensure good faith bargaining includes refraining from unfair or capricious conduct. If bargaining goes off the rails, the industrial umpire will be there to help. It will be able to convene conferences, conciliate and make recommendations on the application of one party. We will have special arrangements for low-paid workers. We believe low-paid workers should be assisted. That is something that the Liberal Party never believed in, because low-paid workers were at the centre of the rip-offs of Work Choices. Members of the opposition shake their heads, but the facts are against them. The facts show crystal clear that it was the industrially weak that bore the brunt of Work Choices, and those opposite defended it. Our industrial umpire will be able to deal with unfair dismissals. Our industrial umpire will be there to help ensure fairness in the system.We want to provide certainty for Australian employees and Australian employers. We have worked hard and collaboratively with employers and employees during the course of this year. With a business advisory group, with a small business working party, with a workers advisory group and through the committee on industrial legislation, we worked through the details of this legislation. It will be in the parliament soon. The great unanswered question here is: what will the Liberal Party do when the legislation comes to the parliament? The Liberal Party is led by a man who voted for the extreme Work Choices laws 23 times, despite Australians around the country urging him not to do so. We are still awaiting an answer. I say to Australians again: do not ever listen to what the Leader of the Opposition says but watch what he does. We will know whether or not he is still entirely in the embrace of industrial relations extremism and wants to have Work Choices still hurting working families in this country before this parliament rises at the end of the year.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It has been the practice of both sides of parliament not to provide details of legal advice. I can confirm, to answer the honourable member's question, that my department has provided advice. I acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the former Attorney-General, the member for Berowra, who has specifically said that on a number of occasions. In terms of the legislative underpinnings, the Acting Treasurer has said that the guarantees will be provided on the basis of contracts entered into under the executive power of the Commonwealth, but the Commonwealth is clearly entitled to rely on all constitutional heads, including banking, corporations, interstate and international trade, insurance and so on. While I will not detail the advice that has been provided to government, I can assure the honourable Leader of the Opposition that the measures that will be implemented will have an appropriate constitutional underpinning.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. One of the key contributing factors to the global financial crisis has been poor regulation. A cavalier attitude to risk, of course, has been relevant to this crisis, and also opaque and complex financial structures that have been allowed to develop in an inadequate regulatory framework internationally, particularly but not only in the United States.That presents a very big reform challenge not just for Australia but also for the entire international community. Australia does have a very robust and strong set of regulatory institutions and a very strong regulatory framework. That is something that I have said on a number of occasions has emerged under both sides of politics. One of the reasons the recent attacks by leading opposition figures on the key regulators were so disappointing is that I believe both sides of politics in this country can take credit for Australia having a strong, robust and world-class regulatory regime.The government is taking strong and decisive action both at home and abroad to pursue regulatory reform. Today, Senator Sherry, the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Governance, and I announced new initiatives with respect to a couple of key issues that arise as a result of the global financial crisis: first, reform of regulation of credit-rating agencies and research houses to require them to hold financial services licences, which they have not previously been required to do, and to provide annual compliance reports to ASIC with respect to their methodologies; and, secondly, the requirement of full disclosure of covered short selling where the participant has a direct legal interest in the share that is being purported to be sold and an outright and indefinite ban on naked short selling, which ASIC will have the power to lift should it so consider that appropriate.The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are both currently en route to the leaders of the G20 summit in Washington that is going to occur this weekend. The purpose of that summit is to analyse the causes of the global financial crisis, to receive reports from the key countries on progress on the responses emerging from those countries to the crisis and, in particular, to agree on a common set of principles for reform of regulation of the global financial sector in order to prevent any kind of recurrence of the crisis that the world has just been through.The Prime Minister made a very early contribution to this debate in his address to the United Nations General Assembly, where he laid out a number of key principles in order to structure an approach on the part of the world's financial system in order to ensure that we get stricter, stronger regulation, including things like clamping down on excessive executive salaries and stricter capital adequacy requirements. Australia is set to play a very significant role in the international efforts to reform our financial regulatory structure. As I said, that is something that both sides of this House should rightly take pride in, that we are in a good position to influence the international outcomes on these issues because we bring to the table in these discussions the strength and the credibility based on having had a strong, robust regulatory regime for some time - good arrangements in Australia that mean our word will be treated with some respect in these discussions.There are big issues to be debated in these discussions that go to the entire role of the financial services sector in our economy. We have seen entire industries built up around moving money from here to there to here in ever increasingly complex arrangements, with ever greater complexity, with ever greater cavalier disregard for underlying risk and ever greater disconnection from the activities in the ordinary, mainstream real world economy. Many have lost sight of the role of financial services, which of course is intermediation of two broad kinds: to direct savings, whether national or global, into investment to maximise returns, productivity and efficiency and to enable day-to-day transactional banking activities to occur at the lowest cost and the maximum efficiency.Those are the functions that the financial services sector are supposed to fulfil in a modern economy, but we have seen it grow and proliferate and mutate to a range of activities that, to any reasonable observer, seem to bear little relationship with its core tasks - as I say, with less and less transparency and attention to risk and with ever greater complexity. We have got to revisit these issues globally to ensure that the financial services sector serves the wider economy, not the other way around. The Rudd government is working hard, with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer pursuing global reform of the financial services sector at the G20. We are pursuing structural reform at home. We will continue these efforts to get better arrangements for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I do not really have much to add to the previous answer that I gave to this question. The same position applies. The position is that the government believes that it has full executive power in order to enter into these contracts and that these will have the desired effect with respect to delivering the guarantees that the financial institutions require in order to ensure that they enjoy the confidence of investors who are lending money to them, particularly international investors. - The member for Banks has actually made a very important interjection, because it illustrates the point that the government of this country, under Liberal or Labor, from time to time enters into a variety of very serious obligations that are not necessarily legislated by the parliament, including decisions to go to war. So when John Howard decided to go to war in Iraq he did not go to the parliament first and get money for that decision. He made a decision and the government made a decision to go to war without parliamentary authority, which he was entitled to do under the executive authority of the Commonwealth. So it is within the executive authority of the government to take these decisions, and they will provide the guarantees under the basis of contract that these institutions require. Should it ever be required that a guarantee of this kind must be delivered upon, then that will need to be appropriated.I conclude on this point: when this was announced by the government, the opposition said it gave bipartisan support to the initiative. - So, in other words, yet again the opposition is trying to slide out of its initial phoney, statesmanlike position, trying to pretend that it is both supporting the government's initiative to stabilise the economy - and in this case help to produce lower interest rates - and, at the same time, sniping relentlessly at those initiatives. If the opposition were fair dinkum about its support for these positions then it would not be asking these questions, because implicit in these questions is the assumption that they would block an appropriation in the Senate for any such guarantee.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question, and I know she is concerned about the circumstances of child care in her own electorate. Indeed, she sent me a note raising some issues with me during the course of question time because she is very concerned to stay across everything that is happening locally. Can I say to members in the House generally that it is exactly one week since ABC Learning announced they were going into voluntary administration. I understand members of the government are following these matters and dealing with local inquiries - the member for Page is. -  - I take it from the interjections that members of the opposition are not concerned and not engaged. But in the past seven days the government has been working hard to help ensure the stability and continuity of child care across this nation for families. Last Thursday ABC Learning moved into voluntary administration and, soon after, a receiver was appointed. From the outset, we have sought to keep mums and dads informed about what is happening with ABC Learning.Within hours of the company's announcement and the appointment of the receiver, the government established a dedicated hotline number. The number is 1802003. To date we have had 700 calls to this number. As well as the hotline, the government provided information through the mychild.gov.au website. So far pages on this site have been viewed over 55,000 times since last Thursday, obviously showing people are looking for information.On Friday I announced a funding package of up to $22 million to provide certainty for affected parents and to ensure that ABC Learning centres continue in operation until 31 December and that everybody has the care that they need for their children and need to rely on. We are of course working to ensure that we can make a further statement to give parents certainty for the period beyond. On Tuesday this week I announced that an expression of interest process had commenced for those who were interested in owning and operating ABC Learning centres. People, whether they are from the profit sector or not-for-profit sector, can register their interest with the receiver. Yesterday, Wednesday, I updated the House on the detailed work plan that the government's insolvency adviser, PPB, and the receiver, McGrathNicol, have embarked on in order to find the way forward.At every stage, the government have acted decisively to deal with this problem in the interests of working families. Indeed, the government have worked all year to clean up the mess that we inherited in child care from the Liberal Party. It strikes me as passing strange that, now they are sitting on the opposition benches, apparently they are styling themselves as policy geniuses, but in government they left us with the kind of mess that we are dealing with in child care. 'Let the market rip!' There was no workforce plan, no quality plan, no early learning years plan and no plan for market design, and here we are, fixing up the mess.Of course, much of that work has been done by the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare, the member for Bennelong, and I want to thank her for it. I would draw the attention of members of the House to the fact that this work has not gone unnoticed by those in the childcare sector and those who care desperately about policy in this area. I would draw the House's attention to the words of Professor Deborah Brennan from the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, who today wrote in the Age:Since Labor came to office, a lot of quiet work has been happening behind the scenes. Early childhood educators, unions, providers and public servants are working on a variety of projects that will strengthen regulations and accreditation in the early childhood sector, introduce a national 'early learning' framework, and improve the qualifications of the early childhood workforce.We are dealing with child care for the future and we will continue to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. The member for Groom has raised a very serious question: the challenge of the Australian government to introduce a balanced Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in association with introducing a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. That is exceptionally important because this government, unlike the previous government, is absolutely committed to a comprehensive response to climate change while maintaining Australian jobs and economic prosperity. The truth of the matter is that, unlike the previous government, we are equal to the task and prepared to take on the hard jobs confronting Australia in the 21st century.It is for that very reason that the Australian government is engaged in a detailed process of consultation not only with the LNG industry but also with all other industries potentially affected by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. In handling these challenges, we are committed to putting in place not only an appropriate Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme but also a portfolio of responses, including the development of a renewable energy source program and improving energy efficiency in Australian industry. The concerns raised by the LNG industry have been listened to by me and by other ministers in response to a genuine green paper process aimed at making sure we put in place a balanced response going to the introduction of a price on carbon, the objective being to reduce Australia's exposure to carbon emissions.I simply say to the LNG industry - perhaps this is a lesson for some on the other side on the issue of consultation and taking the Australian community with them - that the Australian government is absolutely committed to providing the internationally competitive investment and regulatory frameworks necessary for the expansion of the LNG industry in Australia. With respect to the future of the LNG industry in Australia, I was pleased to see the announcement by Inpex about a potential $20 billion investment in Darwin in recent weeks. That announcement is not only important for Australia, it is exceptionally important for the future of Northern Australia. The LNG industry is not only part of Australia's future; it is also part of the global community's response to climate change. It is also vital for jobs, exports, economic growth, regional development and investment. I simply say to the member for Groom: it is about time that the opposition understood that in the 21st century we have to take on the modern challenges. That is about maintaining jobs and prosperity in Australia and also acting in a decisive way on the climate change front.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question, and for hosting the eighth community cabinet that the Rudd government has held. It was held in Launceston just last week. As well as the formal meetings with the community cabinet, cabinet ministers meet with relevant people from their portfolio. Indeed, before the formal proceedings at Launceston City Council, I met with the mayors of Launceston, George Town, Dorset, Flinders Island and Meander Valley. I am also pleased to inform the House that next week the second quarterly instalment from the government's record $1.9 billion financial assistance grants will be distributed to all local councils and shires around Australia. This is a record amount of financial support that was provided by the government in the budget. Importantly, around two-thirds of this support will go to regional and rural councils, thereby providing them with support. Because they are untied grants, the local communities can decide for themselves how this money is spent.But of course our support for local government does not stop there. We want a new partnership between the national government and local government. The cornerstone of that new partnership is the Australian Council of Local Government. Next Tuesday this partnership will be put into practice when up to 400 of the nation's mayors and shire presidents come to Canberra to engage in dialogue with the cabinet and with other members who have chosen to come, including the shadow minister for housing and local government, the member for Cook. They will be discussing building a new cooperative relationship amongst governments, helping to address the particular challenges that the growth regions are experiencing, the implementation of the government's regional and local community infrastructure program that we announced in the budget in May and the path to constitutional recognition.But of course they have also been intimately involved in the lead-up to the conference. They have been engaged in setting the agenda. Indeed, on 22 October, when parliament was sitting a couple of weeks ago, I hosted a meeting here which all of the state local government associations attended, along with other invited senior local government representatives including the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Campbell Newman, who is playing a constructive role in the new organisation, and the Lord Mayor of Adelaide, Michael Harbison. They pledged to make the meeting a success. We met again last week, again making sure that local government are very involved in the process itself in the lead-up to next week's meeting, which will mark a new beginning in cooperative federalism - one that advances the economic interest based upon getting that local input so that everyone benefits regardless of where they live in Australia.</DOC>

 - It is clear the Liberal Party is still unable to make up its mind on whether it thinks climate change is real or not. -  - Only a couple of days ago in one of his lesser moments, while he was busily out there accusing the Treasury secretary of cooking the books, the member for Goldstein was also trailing his well-established 'capitalesque sceptic' credentials on radio and indicating that he does not share the views of the Leader of the Opposition - or at least on what the Leader of the Opposition says will occur. You may recall that the Minister for Resources and Energy responded to a question briefly, and I can only reiterate the point that he made. That is: in contrast to the previous government, which did nothing for 10 years about the climate change challenge, this government is committed to dealing with climate change, both by cooperation in international forums and by establishing a carbon pollution reduction scheme that is designed to ensure that Australia can gradually diminish its emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and, in doing so, structure the scheme in such a way as to take into account the sectoral needs of specific parts of the economy that are particularly exposed, such as emission intensive trade exposed industries.The member for Goldstein would be aware that Professor Garnaut reported on and proposed a particular structure to deal with this specific problem -  - and that the government has established a green paper process, which is part of the way through, involving discussions with people from a variety of industries who do have concerns of this kind. I have been involved in many of these discussions with major companies, including as recently as this morning, about their views as to the structure of the scheme. One of the biggest companies in Australia with particular points of view to put met with me about these issues, and one of the things they said was: 'Don't delay. Yes, there are issues to be debated. Yes, there is a good process through which these matters can be debated in public, courtesy of the green paper process and Professor Garnaut's report. But do not delay; proceed to make decisions and ensure that Australia can get on with tackling climate change and playing a leadership role in the world because we cannot afford to keep ignoring this problem.' We as a nation cannot afford to continue to ignore the problem as the former Howard government did - with the Leader of the Opposition as minister for the environment - for 10 years. Australia can no longer afford to be run by climate change sceptics.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. He and many members on both sides of the House do take a great interest in what we can do to assist those, particularly children, with type 1 diabetes. It is a good day to ask this question because tomorrow is World Diabetes Day. I know that tonight many people will be going to the Diabetes Australia gala dinner to mark this day, particularly the parliamentary support group, the member for Pearce, the member for Moore, the member for Isaacs and the member for Lyons - the executive members amongst this House. I know many people will be attending and I trust that it will be a great celebration.The member for Longman has a particular reason for asking this question. Cabinet ministers would recall that in March we held a community cabinet meeting in the member for Longman's seat in Narangba. A very brave young boy insisted on keeping his hand up for, I think, almost all of the community cabinet to have a chance to ask the Prime Minister a question about what action we could take in helping children with type 1 diabetes. He asked the Prime Minister if the government would consider subsidising insulin pumps for children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. We assured the family at the time that we were considering the matter of subsiding insulin pumps for children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.I am very pleased, as members of this House would know, that we were able to fund a subsidisation program in our first budget. This commitment commenced on 1 November and means that eligible families will receive a subsidy of between $500 and $2Â½ thousand to assist with the cost of insulin pumps. Two weeks ago I was pleased to be joined by the CEO of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Mike Wilson, and the President of Diabetes Australia, Dr Gary Deed, to announce that the program was now open for applications. The program will administered by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.On that morning we also heard from a young youth ambassador, Hannah Frank, of the changes to her life since she has been able to use an insulin pump. I would like to read to the House part of the speech that Hannah gave. I remind you that these are the words of a nine-year-old girl. She said:I know lots of things I hope my friends never need to know. I know how to prick my finger and test my blood sugar levels. I know to eat lollies if my blood sugar level is too low. If I don't I will probably go unconscious and be rushed to hospital. I know it makes me sad when the kids at school wish that they had diabetes so they could eat lollies too. I would be happy to never eat a lolly again if I could just not have type I diabetes. My pump has made a difference to our whole family. Our life doesn't have to be planned around injections and I have more freedom like my friends. I can also sleep at my best friend Meg's house, which is the best part of having a pump.So this is a very real program that will make a very real difference to many hundreds of families across the country. We are pleased that it is being supported by all members of this House. I would like to thank, as I did at the beginning, those opposite who have been so supportive of this measure. The insulin pump does assist in keeping glucose at a more stable level and assists in the reduction of complications later in life. Research indicates that the insulin pump therapy improves the quality of life of people living with type 1 diabetes while, of course, we continue on our search to find a cure. I remind the House that, whilst we need to always redouble our efforts in trying to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes as yet is not preventable and we in this House need to do all we can to assist those with type 1 diabetes, and this measure is an important step.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. The Australian government is very deeply concerned about the recent outbreak of violence and fighting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Regrettably, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a country with a terrible recent history of conflict and suffering. Its people have suffered two civil wars between 1996 and 2003 and it is estimated that those wars have claimed over five million lives as a result of violence and consequent disease and starvation. The Democratic Republic of the Congo in conjunction with the international community, including the United Nations, has made considerable efforts in recent times to restore stability and rebuild national unity. Since 2000 a United Nations peacekeeping organisation has been present in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and over the years Australia has given substantial and strong support to that UN peacekeeping organisation, contributing over $30 million.Very regrettably, as members would be aware, we have recently seen conflict break out again. In October the forces of General Nkunda moved through North Kivu province in the east, defying not just government forces but also those UN peacekeepers. There have been alarming reports of targeted violence against civilians, including lootings and killings and the use of rape as an instrument of war. There have been intense international community efforts to seek to resolve the crisis. I refer to the efforts of Foreign Secretary Miliband and French Foreign Minister Kouchner, who flew to the region to meet with President Kagame of Rwanda and President Kabila of the Republic. In early November the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon held in Nairobi an emergency meeting of African heads of states. The secretary-general has called for an immediate ceasefire, the establishment of aid corridors to allow urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance, reinforcement of the UN peacekeeping mission and implementation of peace agreements previously signed. The government very much welcomes the recent announcement by SADC - the Southern African Development Community - to provide not just support of those sentiments expressed by the secretary-general but also immediate military and humanitarian aid. Australia stands alongside the secretary-general in his efforts to see a resolution to this crisis.Whilst it is appropriate for Australia to make a contribution to peacekeeping through its contribution to the United Nations, it is not, in the government's view, appropriate to make a military or a peacekeeping contribution in terms of boots on the ground. But it is important for Australia to consider the need for urgent humanitarian aid and assistance. Early in November, in response to the crisis, I announced that we would apply $1 million emergency humanitarian assistance, enabling us to give consideration to further humanitarian assistance on the basis of the United Nations assessment. I am able to advise the House today that Australia will make, all up, a contribution of $5 million for humanitarian assistance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It comprises the $4 million that I am announcing today, $3 million of which will go to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to deal with nearly 250,000 displaced people, to UNICEF and to the UN Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. One million dollars will go to Australian NGOs who have a presence in Africa. Of the $1 million previously announced, as I have indicated before, half a million dollars will go to the World Health Organisation and half a million dollars will go to UNICEF. The funding of these agencies will allow for the immediate needs for those adversely affected by the violence - in particular food, health, water and the protection of women.Australia's desire to assist is not just a reflection of our desire to be a good international citizen but also a reflection of the government's view that Australia needs to increase and enhance its commitment to the countries of Africa and to engage with the countries of Africa. Australia needs to forge broader and deeper relations with the countries of Africa and build on the people-to-people and commercial links which have burgeoned in recent years. We welcome the increasingly strong voice of African nation states and we look forward to playing our part in the peace and security of the continent of Africa, including - and in particular - the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</DOC>

 - Can I say to the question from the member for North Sydney, firstly, as I have seen in media reports, as I have been advised, ASIC is investigating the matter he refers to. If there are any allegations of improper conduct in any way then obviously that is something that ought to be properly investigated and dealt with. I will repeat what I said to this parliament yesterday in a different context: everyone should abide by the law; there are no exceptions. Everyone should abide by the law. Having said that, when everyone should abide by the law, the way the system works in this country - perhaps the member for North Sydney might prefer it were different - being a democracy, is that if there is an assertion that someone has not abided by the law, that is not tried in this parliament; that is dealt with by the appropriate investigative authorities, who should then deal with it. So everyone should abide by the law and everyone should let due process go through in relation to the allegations, and as I am advised ASIC is dealing with the matter.More broadly, can I say this: if the member for North Sydney believes he is in possession of information that goes to proper conduct of any member of this parliament then he should immediately move the relevant substantive motion. If he does not do so, people will understand what kind of person he is.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Throsby for her question and her interest in this issue. The Rudd government remain resolutely opposed to commercial whaling in any form, including so-called scientific whaling, and our commitment to whale conservation remains clear in the number of unprecedented actions the government has taken since coming to office. We have advanced a significant reform agenda through the International Whaling Commission, with initiatives for international non-lethal whale research partnerships, starting in the Southern Ocean, and conservation management plans to support the recovery of vulnerable whale species and populations. Many countries, including New Zealand, Chile, the United Kingdom and the United States, strongly supported Australia's proposals and we are now working towards putting these plans into action.I am pleased to inform the House that Australia will host an international workshop in March 2009 to plan the non-lethal whale research partnerships for the Southern Ocean. The partnerships will also be open to all countries and will demonstrate once again that all essential whale research can be performed without killing a single whale. We remain optimistic that through this reform agenda we can help shape the International Whaling Commission into a 21st century, conservation orientated organisation, a body focused on studying living whales, not counting dead ones. - The government is also giving serious and careful consideration to a range of options for possible international legal action against Japan's Antarctic whaling program -  - and we have carefully analysed the information obtained through our monitoring of the Antarctic whaling fleet last summer. This was the first time that monitoring had been undertaken of the whaling fleet. No previous government has had the kind of information available to inform its consideration of legal options that we now have.Our immediate efforts are on finding a diplomatic resolution to this issue and that is why we have increased our diplomatic engagement on whaling, particularly with Japan over its scientific whaling program. We have appointed Mr Sandy Hollway AO as Australia's special envoy for whale conservation to advance the government's objectives of ending Japanese scientific whaling and improving the conservation of whales. We have repeatedly called on Japan - through the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, through me and through the envoy - to suspend its whaling program in the Southern Ocean, particularly as we engage in reform of the International Whaling Commission. We make no pretence that this is an easy task. In fact, this is a complex issue, an issue between friends but one we know the Australian community feels very strongly about, and that is why we have been working so hard and why we will keep working to bring commercial whaling to an end. I note a report overnight from the Asahi newspaper in Japan that the Japanese government's whaling program - The member for Kalgoorlie then left the chamber. - Members opposite clearly had no interest in this answer, because they did nothing for 12 years on this issue. - I will begin again, Mr Speaker. I note a report overnight from the Asahi newspaper in Japan that the Japanese government's whaling program will make its first-ever whaling target reduction - a reduction of 20 per cent in the upcoming season, to 750 whales - while the program's overall target will be reduced by approximately 10 per cent. Whilst this is at present an unconfirmed report, if accurate it would represent the first time since Japan's scientific whaling commenced in 1987 that the actual target has been reduced. In fact, since 1987 the target has only increased, including more than doubling between 2004-05 and 2005-06.I also emphasise that, while any reduction would be welcome - it would be an encouraging sign - given that it has not happened before, the government's objective remains bringing an end to all commercial whaling, including whaling in the name of science. That is the objective we will continue to pursue, intensifying and stepping up our efforts including through the Prime Minister and senior ministers, through the special envoy on whale conservation, through our reform agenda at the International Whaling Commission and through the active consideration of options for international legal action.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. This government has inherited from the former government a public hospital system that has had a billion dollars ripped out of it. It cut back GP training places and other workforce places, leaving us with a crisis in workforce in many parts of the country. It is not a track record to be proud of. What the government has done since it took office is to work with our state and territory counterparts on new Australian healthcare agreements. What the government has said consistently is that it will work with our state and territory colleagues to get new cooperative arrangements to deal with the problems in the health system.What the Prime Minister said before the election, as opposed to what the member for Dickson just summarised him as saying, was that we would work with our state and territory counterparts and seek a new era of reform. My colleague the Minister for Health and Ageing is well into the journey of the reform agenda. We have already put more money into hospitals. She has a reform commission working with her. The Prime Minister always said that we would aim to work through these issues cooperatively, and that is what we are doing. What he said to the Australian people as well was that, if these processes did not work to a satisfactory outcome, the buck would stop with him. We are doing exactly what the Prime Minister promised before the election: working collaboratively through the processes. - We said that we would do that first. We said that we would invest in our hospital system, and we have. - We said that we would invest in GP superclinics and we have. The list goes on. The last thing that I would think that a member of the Liberal Party would do -  - In responding to the question, I say this to the member who asked the question and to members opposite: the last thing that I would have thought that members of the Liberal Party would want to do is to start a debate about honouring election promises, given that they are the political party that gave to this nation the terminology 'core' and 'non-core'. From the very first day they were elected, they wanted to dump their election promises, and they did. I remind members opposite that, when it comes to the question of promises, they promised Australians before the 2004 election that it would be business as usual in workplace relations. - What I can say to the member for Dickson -  - I have answered the question. His screaming is not going to change that. We are a government that honours its promises. We will do that in health. We will do that in all areas in which we made promises to the Australian people. That is a sharp contrast to the non-core promises of the Liberal Party and its failure to tell the Australian people about Work Choices before 2004.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and note his very strong interest in and commitment to Indigenous aged care. Our plan to improve Indigenous aged care involves construction of new infrastructure, emergency maintenance works and staff training. Last week, our newly established Indigenous aged care task force completed a site-by-site audit of Australia's 29 Indigenous flexible aged care services. As a direct result of this, early next year teams of tradespeople will undertake a comprehensive building works program to carry out necessary improvements.In the last few months, I have visited a number of communities, including in Katherine, Mutitjulu and East Arnhem. I have listened firsthand to the concerns of community leaders and also seen the very unique challenges of remote Aboriginal aged care services. It is very clear that these services need to be improved. Staff training and infrastructure are our priorities in these areas. We are committed to tackling these challenges through our $46 million program.At Uluru, the older women of Mutitjulu, speaking in Pitjantjatjara through an interpreter, put the case to me for an overnight nursing home facility. In response, we have acted, and we will build overnight staff accommodation so that staff can be there to look after residents. We will continue to consult with and take the advice of Aboriginal communities as we work through the Indigenous aged care plan. In the coming weeks, subject to appropriate community consultation, we will also be providing more aged care places in Mutitjulu and East Arnhem. In addition, we will tackle the problem of overnight staff accommodation at Docker River. This will help retain staff in that area. Also, 11 Aboriginal aged care services will now receive assistance to help them install appropriate protection for elders around open fire pits. This is about finding a delicate balance between cultural sensitivity and ensuring the health and welfare of older and frail Indigenous people. This Indigenous aged care plan addresses long-term staff training and retention. I look forward to further updating the House on how this government is continuing to improve Indigenous aged care.</DOC>

 - What I can say to the member is that the government did make promises about health before the election. We are honouring them. I have explained that we are working collaboratively on new Australian healthcare agreements, that we are working on reform, that the Prime Minister did say we would work through those processes first and that ultimately the buck did stop with him but that we would be working to improve health care.What has this government done? We put $1 billion into our healthcare system. We put money into elective surgery waiting lists to make sure that people who were on queues for elective surgery would get assisted. All of that is additional resources above and beyond what the former government, the Liberal government - of which the member who asked me the question was a very senior member - provided. Above and beyond what the Liberal government put in, we have put in extra resources. I understand that the member is saying that there is more to be done in health, and I could not agree with him more. There is more to be done in health. We are working on new Australian healthcare agreements because we understand there is more to be done in health. But I would ask the member to reflect: given we have put in additional resources since the 2007 election, how bad was it when you were in government?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Werriwa for that question. As members would be aware, the government today introduced our legislation to establish the three infrastructure funds. This marks the beginning, the next step, in implementing the nation's nation-building agenda. This is an agenda that we remain committed to, and that is one of the reasons why the Prime Minister has asked for the infrastructure priority list to be brought forward to December. Of course, this priority list is being developed by Infrastructure Australia, an independent body, made up of Commonwealth, state and local representatives but also, importantly, representatives of the private sector, which we established to examine the nation's infrastructure needs.This is an entirely new approach when it comes to dealing with infrastructure for the nation. I know that some of those opposite are struggling to adjust to this new concept, because their criticism of our approach has been very confused. On the one hand we have had the Leader of the Opposition and others out there accusing us of establishing a slush fund, but in the next breath they say that we are not spending infrastructure funds soon enough - we should just get on with the job and not have a proper process. You cannot have it both ways. You have got to actually stand for something. But I wondered why they were so obsessed, and maybe it is because of the way that they dealt with, or did not deal with, infrastructure issues.An example of their approach was recently brought to my attention, which is why I particularly welcome the second part of the member for Werriwa's question. In 2006, the former government called for submissions from councils on strategic road priorities. Five councils in Victoria formed the Northern Metro Regional Group of Councils and commissioned a review of their road needs. They produced this detailed report. It thoroughly analysed and it prioritised eight road projects. They sent it off to the federal government and waited to hear the outcome. Nothing happened. Days passed; weeks passed; months passed - nothing happened. But a year later the councils got a letter with an offer to fund one of their projects. But, of course, it was not the No. 1 priority, it was not even the second priority and not even the third. It, in fact, was the project that was ranked sixth. It is a project that one of the councils that has written to me has said is:_ heavily dependent on subdivisional development. With next to no development, at this stage the construction is out of sequence and may be seen as a poor use of funds.What the council is saying is pretty simple: this is a road to nowhere. It is actually a road through an empty paddock - a road that might be needed sometime but that is certainly not needed now and is certainly not a priority, which is why the councils put it as No. 6 on their list.The No. 1 project was only a kilometre or two away, in the middle of a booming residential area. So I was wondering: what wisdom did the former government use to overrule the priority list that had been developed by these local councils and pick out the project at No. 6 over the top of the first five projects? I was looking at a map of the area, trying to understand their thinking. When it came to me, I realised I had the wrong map, because I was looking at a road map. What I needed was an electoral map to understand the way that they decided infrastructure spending should be provided. As you may be aware, Mr Speaker, the No. 1 priority project, which could not be funded, was in fact in the electorate of Scullin - your electorate, Mr Speaker. The No. 2 project was in Calwell, so they could not fund that either. The No. 3 project was in Jagajaga, so they could not fund that either. Of the eight projects, only one was in a marginal Liberal electorate - that of McEwen.It did not have the lowest cost, it did not have the highest benefit, it is not even needed now, but it was on the right side of the electoral map. That was why it received the funding. On this side of the House when we want advice on infrastructure we actually consult Infrastructure Australia, an independent body. When those on the other side want advice about infrastructure they do not look to engineers, they look to the electoral commissioner.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The government's position is to support the creation of Australian jobs. That is why we acted decisively with the economic security statement, which of course is about priming the economy, including an estimated priming of 75,000 jobs. As the Prime Minister has made clear, the government will also be looking at fast-tracking infrastructure, with further statements to be made about that matter in December. On the question of structural adjustments and on work with industry and businesses that find themselves under pressure in these difficult days, the government has acted proactively to support the car industry with a major package of assistance for the car industry. People may have noted after that government decision that Ford in Geelong has made a different decision about the potential closure of its plant there - very good news for people in Geelong and the associated region. We also indicated at the time of the economic security statement that we would be reserving 10,000 of the new productivity places - the training places for skills and jobs - for structural adjustment purposes. We are putting in place those policies and plans. In terms of assessing any ideas from the opposition, if they hold one for more than 24 hours then they may care to forward it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question. Of course today is the one-year anniversary of the election of the Rudd Labor government. This is a government that has spent that year delivering on its promises. We believe that it is very important to rebuild faith in government and to rebuild faith in government in circumstances where that faith had been undermined by the Liberal Party through its invention of core and non-core promises. We wanted to rebuild faith in government to show the Australian people that an elected government in this nation can deliver on what it promised, and that is exactly what we have been doing.We ended a decade of climate change denial and inaction by doing precisely what we promised - ratifying the Kyoto protocol. That was done within days of the government being elected. We delivered what we promised by apologising to the stolen generations of Indigenous Australians, and we are working with Indigenous Australians to close the gap in key areas like health, education and, most importantly, life expectancy.We ended the making of Australian workplace agreements, the most hated part of Work Choices. I note today - I think it is an interesting revelation 12 months from the election of the Rudd Labor government - that whilst the Leader of the Opposition says Work Choices is dead, despite being asked on three occasions whether that meant that the Liberal Party ruled out individual statutory employment agreements for the future, he refused to answer. So what we have learnt, one year after the election of the Rudd Labor government and one year after the defeat of the Liberal Party, is that if the Liberal Party were re-elected with the current Leader of the Opposition as leader then it would be back to statutory individual employment agreements, back to the rip-offs of penalty rates and overtime, back to 16- and 17-year-old kids being ripped off in their first job, because that is what the Leader of the Opposition believes in.On the question of honouring our promises, we honoured our commitment to withdraw all Australian combat troops from Iraq. We have honoured our commitment to help working families with a $55 billion package of support for working families in the May budget, including tax cuts, an increase in the childcare tax rebate and our new education tax rebate. And of course we are continuing to deliver on our education revolution. We have trades training centres, with $90 million made available for trades training centres in high school. We have money in 896 schools for 116,820 computers and, despite claims to the contrary, our digital education revolution is rolling out as promised.We have also achieved historic agreement with the states and territories for a single national school curriculum. We have created new places at universities for early childhood educators. There are new incentives to study maths and science. We are creating over a thousand new training places for nurses and providing incentives for thousands of nurses to return to work as nurses.Twelve months ago no-one could have foreseen the global financial crisis and, in the face of it, the government has moved swiftly to protect the Australian economy and protect Australian jobs. We have guaranteed all depositors and all deposits and term funding in all Australian banks, building societies and credit unions for the next three years. We have injected $10.4 billion into the Australian economy to stimulate activity and to support those who are doing it tough. And, as I indicated, we are bringing forward infrastructure investment, and the government will have more to say about that in December.While the government has achieved many of its objectives in its first year in office we do not underestimate the task ahead. There remains a considerable amount of work to do to keep delivering on our commitments - building long-term reform, strengthening our economy and protecting jobs - and we intend to do it.</DOC>

If a poacher turned gamekeeper now has a policy he believes should be considered and is going to remain the policy of the opposition for more than 24 hours at a time, I am happy to say that we will consider it, because of course we know that what they say today they deny tomorrow and they invent again on the third day and by the fourth day and the fifth day they are on another part of the cycle.

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. It has been a year of hard yards as we deal with the greatest ever crisis experienced in a market economy and we know that Australians are concerned by the daily bombardment of economic news from overseas. I do not think that anybody could have predicted 12 months ago the events of the last 12 months, with the failure of something like 30 banks around the world and the recession in Europe and Japan or the fact that the IMF might be predicting recession in the United Kingdom and in the United States.Our sound economy has not been immune from all these events, but there are strong fundamentals and, of course, government action has helped us withstand the fallout. The government has been diligently and responsibly preparing our economy for the worst that the world can throw at us. That is why at budget time we built a strong surplus as a buffer against international uncertainty. It is a surplus which has given the government the flexibility to respond to changed international conditions and the flexibility to deliver a $10.4 billion economic security strategy. It is a very important strategy which will add between half and one per cent to GDP and create up to 75,000 jobs. It is welcomed on this side of the House; it is opposed by those on that side of the House. They said there would be bipartisan support and then they turned around and opposed every aspect of it. And, of course, not only have we been acting but the Reserve Bank has been acting.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition opposed the payments to families on the radio the other day. She opposed the payments to families. But the Reserve Bank has been active as well, responding with cuts to interest rates of 200 basis points in recent months. This means that fiscal policy and monetary policy are working in tandem. Those opposite do not have any alternative policy solutions - 30 minutes from the Leader of the Opposition at the Press Club today and not one costed positive policy; none at all. We are doing the hard yards to protect Australians. We understand the nature of the problem. Those opposite do not. We will continue to strengthen our economy, to build our strength in the face of these international circumstances, to look after families, to look after pensioners and to look after Australian businesses.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The government obviously is concerned about the impact of the global financial crisis on small businesses. In moving decisively with our economic security statement and injecting $10.4 billion into the economy, one of the things that was on our minds was support for small business. Engaging in that kind of fiscal stimulus, ensuring that there was money in the hands of households, has an effect for small business, and we wanted to make sure that small business benefited from that economic security statement as well. On other matters involving small business, the government has invested in Enterprise Connect centres to assist small business. We believe that that is important. We also believe that it is important to make it easier for small business to engage in their GST tax accounting. This is a matter that my colleague the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy has been working on. So our policies and plans here are clear. We want to support small businesses. We understand that they are a backbone of the Australian economy, and consequently they have been at the forefront of our thinking as we have responded to the global financial crisis.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question and for her very real concern and commitment to make sure that people in her electorate and people in the broader Australian community benefit from the government's approach to fairness. It is the case that over the last year the government has been determined to work very hard to deliver on our promises and to rebuild the trust in government that was so necessary on 24 November last year. We have shown that we are serious about both restoring Australia's belief in fairness and delivering both socially and economically. We know, like many other Australians, there are families, pensioners and carers who are doing it tough. We have been determined to give them a helping hand. We are now spending $12.3 billion more than the previous government on pensioners and carers. In response to the global financial crisis, we are delivering Economic Security Strategy payments, and these will be paid to pensioners and carers from 8 December this year. Single pensioners will receive $1,400 each, and couples will receive $2,100. For the first time, we have increased the utilities allowance and extended it to all pensioners and to carers. We extended the utilities allowance from $107 to $500 a year, earlier in the year. As I said, we have extended all of these payments to all pensioners, to carers, to those on carer payment and to disability support pensioners. They are receiving the utilities allowance for the first time, and they will also receive the Economic Security Strategy payments. I am pleased to say that families, particularly those families who are under financial pressure, will also be receiving the Economic Security Strategy payments. Families with children will receive $1,000 for each eligible child.We have also started the very hard work of preparing Australia for future challenges. We know there is a need for long-term pension reform, and that is exactly what we intend to deliver by next financial year. We have also embarked on a major inquiry to modernise our welfare and transfer system. We are providing Commonwealth leadership for the first time to develop a national child protection framework. For the first time, Centrelink will be part of the national child protection alert system. We are trialling national income management and school attendance measures. In this year's budget we introduced fairer and more responsible baby bonus and family tax benefit arrangements, and we have asked the Productivity Commission to look at options for paid parental leave - another first. These are, of course, just initial measures of reform and improvements that are needed to our welfare system. We are wanting to do the long-term reform while at the same time providing urgent relief for pensioners, carers and families from cost-of-living pressures. We certainly know that there is more to be done. We are making inroads on closing the gap. The Acting Prime Minister made reference to the national apology to Indigenous Australians and in particular to members of the Stolen generations. I can say just how important this has been, particularly to Indigenous people, in terms of the hope that it has given them in their future.We have laid out very ambitious targets to close the gap in life expectancy, health, education and employment. Gradually, we are moving forward. Particularly in Indigenous housing, we are laying the groundwork for major reforms to tackle shocking levels of overcrowding and substandard housing. We are reforming Indigenous employment programs, making sure that we see Indigenous people getting the skills and experience they need to get a job. In doing that, we are harnessing the extraordinary goodwill that is available now in the corporate sector. We are moving forward to a sustainable period of development in the Northern Territory emergency response. These are just some of the steps that we need to take to close the gap, to close the shameful life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. There is a lot more that needs to be done, but we will take an evidence based approach as we move forward. We intend to meet our election commitments to protect Australia as a fair and caring place and prepare our country for the challenges of the future.</DOC>

 - I do not know if it was accurate or inaccurate; I would not know. If I am being quoted accurately, it would have been in reference to all of the actions by the opposition in the Senate to vandalise the surplus, the surplus that we are now using to protect Australian households and Australian businesses from the global financial crisis. Those opposite have not, in the whole year they have been in opposition, produced any coherent framework when it comes to an alternative budget or an alternative financial position. - I get it now - we copied it and they tried to destroy it. Where are they coming from? There is no coherent framework over there, and there was none from the Leader of the Opposition at the Press Club today. There has not been a single position of economic responsibility shown by those opposite. They promise bipartisanship and then oppose everything in the House, including the surplus that the government is using to protect the economy, households and businesses from the impact of the global financial crisis. It is going to get tough. We have had the midyear economic review and we have modest growth and modest surpluses. We worked hard in the budget to build a strong surplus to give the flexibility that we have now used to protect the Australian economy. At every step of the way we were opposed by those opposite, who now claim to believe in surpluses they were trying to destroy. What you will see from this government is responsible economic management, and what we have seen from those opposite is complete irresponsibility day in, day out.</DOC>

 - I certainly welcome the question about the reform of federal-state relations, which are so important to the long-term prosperity of this economy and its capacity to create wealth. This week will be a very important week in terms of modernising our Federation and putting an end over time to the blame game that has bedevilled so much that has gone on in this country when it comes to education, infrastructure and health. On Friday I will meet all state and territory treasurers to negotiate reforms to Commonwealth-state relations across a range of areas - not just health, not just education, but disability, housing and so on. The meeting of treasurers will be followed by a formal meeting of the Council of Australian Governments on Saturday. Over the past few weeks, I, other ministers and the Prime Minister have engaged in quite constructive discussions with all of our colleagues across all of the states, because we recognise that there are great challenges out there which do require the reform of federal-state relations and particularly a 21st century reform to health and education.I am convinced that we are now putting forward a framework to change the structures to make the Federation work more efficiently. Firstly, we have reduced the number of specific purpose payments from the Commonwealth to the states from over 90 to just five, reducing waste and duplication. Secondly, in a significant break with the past we have committed to using incentives to drive reform at the state level. This will be through national partnership payments. These payments will be used to deliver specific economic and social reforms, particularly in health and education. Also, we have agreed to use information to drive better accountability and we will independently measure how the states perform across agreed indicators. This, too, is a first. We have every confidence that these changes will help us build a more productive national economy and deliver better services for all Australians. These reforms will be backed up with a funding package which is appropriate, given the fiscal environment we face. But we will not shirk the hard reforms that those opposite shirked. Access Economics today really pinged all of those over there. There was very colourful language about what they did with the product of the boom, or what they did not do with it, which was to put in place the necessary reforms for the future. The reform of federal-state relations is a very important part of that, and we look forward to that occurring this weekend.</DOC>

 - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has missed the global financial crisis altogether. The Leader of the Opposition said that it was all hype. But he said it was all hype at precisely the same time he was changing his own personal investment strategy away from unguaranteed funds. -  - Go ahead. Bring it on. The balance of risk in the economy has changed dramatically - that is why. There has been a dramatic impact from the global financial crisis around the world. Somehow the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has missed the fact that Europe is in recession and so is Japan. Somehow the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has missed the fact that the IMF is predicting that Britain and the United States are heading the same way. The balance of risk has fundamentally changed, and with that change has come the absolute imperative that we in this country and many other countries around the world act decisively to strengthen our economies, particularly through fiscal stimulus but also through monetary policy and through a whole lot of other actions in the financial system that are absolutely fundamental for the stability of our economy and our society. Those opposite simply do not get it.We on this side of the House do get it. We understand the challenge. We also understand the need to deal with inflationary pressures in the longer term as well. That is what reform of federal-state relations is about. That is what reform of the tax system is about. That is what doing something fundamental in other areas, such as infrastructure, is about. We have our long-term program, but we understand what is going on out there right now. Right now, the balance of risk has changed. We on this side of the House understand the nature of the problem and have acted decisively to deal with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question. I know he is passionately interested in education. The government continues to deliver its education revolution. Already we have delivered investment in trade training centres - $90 million of a $2.5 billion program. This is a program that has already benefited 96 schools who are putting together 34 projects. We are delivering our digital education revolution - a $1.2 billion plan to bring fibre to schools and to bring computers to school children, a plan that is on track to deliver as promised and which has already delivered $116 million to 896 secondary schools around the country, enough funding for more than 116,000 computers. The government is delivering on early childhood education and care. We have delivered an increase in the childcare tax rebate so it now meets 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs. This payment is not income tested and is now paid quarterly. We are delivering on universal preschool and investing in the early years of children's lives because we know that is where we can make the most difference for outcomes later in life. We have invested in our universities, with half a billion dollars already delivered to help them rebuild their campus infrastructure. We have created new places for nurses and early childhood educators. We are commencing the phasing out of full-fee-paying undergraduate places for Australian students. We believe and will ensure that access to university for Australian students is about merit and not capacity to pay because that is the Australian way. We are delivering 700,000 new training places over the next five years. We have been delivering these new training places, our productivity places, all this year. This program has been so popular it has been oversubscribed. And our economic security statement added in 57,000 new places to assist as we meet the economic challenges this nation now confronts. All of these policies are being delivered and next Saturday, by working cooperatively with states and territories, we look forward to delivering an historic deal in the form of a new national education agreement and partnership in the areas of teacher quality, better assistance for disadvantaged schools and literacy and numeracy.It is very fitting that, as we move towards this historic new agreement, this week Australia hosts a visit from the chancellor of New York's education department, Joel Klein. I met with him this morning, and I had the opportunity to meet with him in New York. We spoke together today at a forum entitled 'Leading transformational change in schools'. I am pleased to confirm that, as part of the new COAG arrangements, the Rudd government stands ready with half a billion dollars of new investment in teacher quality because we know, and worldwide research is telling us, that there is nothing more important to a child's outcomes at school than the quality of the teacher standing in the classroom. We are investing in teacher quality.We are also delivering a new era of transparency to Australian schools. We particularly want parents and community members to be able to compare schools with similar student populations - students who have similar challenges when it comes to learning. When we do that comparison and we see different results for similar student populations then we will know that one of three things needs to be addressed: teacher quality, school leadership or a difference in resources. By doing these comparisons, we will be able to analyse the factors that adults should fix to assist those children.One thing that stands in the way of delivering this new era of transparency - and obviously transparency is very controversial; I understand that people have strong views - is the attitude of the Liberal Party to the Schools Assistance Bill, which is making its way through the parliament. This bill is about imposing the same transparency requirements on non-government schools that we will impose on government schools through the National Education Agreement - that is, the same transparency about results and the same transparency about resources. But the Liberal Party, rather than addressing educational disadvantage of schoolchildren and actually using the powerful tool of transparency to help us address that disadvantage, is playing the old politics of the public-private divide. We are moving beyond the public-private divide to lifting quality in every school. Transparency right across the board, including resources, is part of that. I would call on the Liberal Party, after its 12 years of neglect and failure, to get out of the way as we lead transformational change in Australian education for Australian students.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for education for his question, though I note it contained a number of assertions which are simply untrue. I will now describe to the shadow minister for education what is happening with the digital education revolution, and he may choose to listen so that he ceases making publicly a series of claims about this that are untrue. When we came to government, we inherited a situation where the world was moving on on new technology and the Liberal government had neglected that transformation in the way that students learn. We were elected to deliver a digital education revolution. We always said that this program would be delivered over a period of time. We budgeted for it -  -  - Look at the election policy documents! We budgeted for it over a four-year period. Look at the election policy documents. I know that the Liberal Party struggle with the concept of promising things and then delivering them, but they should look at our election policy documents. We are delivering exactly as we promised. What we promised was a program that would bring computers to students in years 9 to 12. What we promised was that that program would start in the first six months of this year. What we have delivered is a program that started in the first six months of this year. We promised that applications would open in the first 100 days of government, and applications did open in the first 100 days of government. We then dealt with those applications, and those applications were called for from schools with the greatest need - that is, schools that had a ratio of students to computers of one to eight or worse. - The shadow minister is hurling abuse about non-government schools. I do not abuse schools in this country. I believe every school should be looked at, and we should be aiming for quality. In the first round of our digital education revolution we said that, whilst we want to bring computers to all students and all schools, we will focus on need. - The shadow minister continues playing the politics of the past while we get on with delivering the learning tools of the future. Round 1 is delivered. Round 2 is in progress. There is money in the budget to deliver further rounds so we will deliver on exactly what we promised. There is money in the budget for curriculum development. There is money in the budget for teacher professional development.In respect of the member's claims that there are schools in Victoria that are being asked to fundraise to support this government's program, that is not true. He knows that the school to which he refers, Lilydale, was fundraising for a different purpose, not to support this government's program. The government have made a difference to 896 schools around the country already. We will continue delivering our education revolution. Can I say to the shadow minister, who plays this petty politics with his false statements wherever he goes: any day he could ring up Glenunga International High School in his electorate and tell them to send back the funding for their 416 computers. He could do that any day. We will see whether or not he does that. His failure to do that would be an indication that he understands this program is delivering good outcomes and it has delivered to a school in his own electorate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his question. He has done a great job in his electorate arguing for the interests of his local constituency. I could not help but notice that it is not just me that thinks he has done a great job; in fact, the Daily Mercury writes: 'You've done a great job, James'. Apparently the general consensus from community leaders in Mackay is that he has done a great job. So I am sure that those community leaders will be pleased to hear that in our intended agreement with the states and territories that is being negotiated, and was already referred to by the Treasurer earlier in question time, we intend to end the blame game. We want to stop the bickering between the states and the Commonwealth over who is responsible for what and show that if we work together we can deliver better outcomes in health to our communities. So I can make it clear that we intend to invest more money in our health system but, at the same time, we will not just be handing the states and territories a blank cheque. What we want to do is reward effort. We want to make sure that targets are being set and that we pay according to outcomes.We have a very good example of how, in the first 12 months in office, we have already seen this sort of approach deliver benefits to thousands of Australians across the country. I am referring here to our early commitment and announcement that we would invest $600 million into elective surgery, and use it to illustrate how Commonwealth money and cooperation of the states and territories can deliver a significant outcome to the community. Members might remember from when we announced the $600 million that the first stage of funding, $150 million, was provided to the states and territories to perform 25,000 extra procedures and that the funding was tied directly to those outcomes. I am pleased to be able to report to the House that at the end of September, only three-quarters of the way through the year that this $150 million relates to, over 27,000 extra procedures had already been delivered - more than 27,000 eye operations, knee operations, hip operations - all having a vital impact for constituents, whether they are in Dawson or any other electorate, because of the leadership that the Commonwealth has shown. What it has meant is that the Commonwealth's extra funding and the states' willingness to pull their weight have delivered dividends for those families that we promised in the election that we would help. We have seen many states able to leverage the investment made by the Commonwealth to increase their own efforts, delivering this fantastic number of 27,000-plus procedures well ahead of time and showing that Commonwealth money used well, tied to outcomes with incentives, can deliver change - something that those opposite never tried to do in elective surgery and in fact did not try to do in health at all.The member has asked what the community might see. You can expect to see more investment in health. You can expect to see investment driven change and incentive driven change and better outcomes for the community. You will see also our understanding that health is not just about hospitals; health is also about what we do outside the hospital system. We need to make sure that we are supporting our hospitals and we are investing more, for example, in preventative health. We know that 670,000-odd procedures in hospitals are preventable, so we have that large number of preventable admissions every year in our hospitals. We know that we have to do more to keep those numbers down, so what you will see is incentives paid for a reduction in preventable admissions, and other similar proposals. This is all about us making sure we use Commonwealth money to drive the change that is needed; it is working with the states and territories to deliver that change. The community can expect to see better health outcomes because we are in office rather than those opposite, who never took this approach.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. He is aware that a superclinic is proposed in his electorate. The consultations were only recently held in Strathpine. Unfortunately, the shadow minister did not attend, but the consultations were very constructive. As many of the members on this side of the House would know, we have now had I think 24 of the 31 consultations. There are two agreements that are already signed. There are, I think, something like 11 tenders that have already been concluded, where negotiations are being undertaken with the preferred -  - I am answering the member's question but he is clearly not interested to know that we on this side of the House are absolutely proud of being prepared to consult with local communities. There is nothing wrong with listening to local communities. Those opposite when they were in government did not want to listen to local communities. We are making sure that we are going to deliver, whether it was the commitment that was made in Geelong, whether it was in Strathpine, whether it was in Redcliffe - all across the country. - As I have made clear, the processes that we promised - consultation with our local communities - are occurring. The processes are well underway. Two contracts have already been signed. I think the number - off the top of my head - is 11 or 12 that have now completed their tender process. There are another four or five where the tenders are nearly closed. Of course, with a new program you will see the consultation phase first and the delivery phase second. We believe in getting that the right way round, and we are determined to stick with it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. APEC of course is the premier regional institution for the Asia-Pacific so far as trade, investment and the economies of the Asia-Pacific are concerned. In a century where we see political, economic, strategic and security influence moving to our region, to the Asia-Pacific, with the rise of China, the rise of India and the rise of the ASEAN economies combined, this premier regional institution for trade, investment and economic matters is even more important today than it was when a previous Labor government was so instrumental in establishing its effectiveness.Last week, the Minister for Trade and I attended the APEC ministerial meeting in Lima, Peru and in the last couple of days the Prime Minister has attended the leaders meeting. Foremost amongst the issues, of course, was the APEC follow-up to the G20 meeting insofar as trade in the context of the global financial crisis was concerned. The ministerial meeting recommended to leaders the complete and full endorsement of an adoption of the Doha Round as an absolute priority. My colleague the Minister for Trade has been speaking in very detailed terms about these matters.I make the point, as I did to various colleagues at the APEC ministerial meeting, that Australia remains of the view that India's omission from APEC is an ever-increasingly important oversight. Most people see the rise of China and not enough people until recently have seen the rise of India. India's addition to APEC at the completion of the moratorium of membership in 2010 is, in Australia's view, very important.In addition to those APEC matters, the meeting provided the opportunity to meet bilaterally with a number of colleagues. I make the point that, given elections recently in Canada and New Zealand, I took the opportunity of meeting for the first occasion with Foreign Minister Cannon from Canada and Foreign Minister McCully from New Zealand. Australia, Canada and New Zealand have very good bilateral relationships but we also, in international institutions, combine together within the so-called CANZ group - Canada, Australia and New Zealand - and I had very productive meetings with the two foreign ministers. In addition, given changes of prime minister in Thailand and Japan recently, I had the opportunity of meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Nakasone and Thai Foreign Minister Sompong.The APEC meeting in South America also provided the Australian government the opportunity of making the point that we very strongly believe that Australia's engagement in South America or Latin America needs to be substantially enhanced. It has become quite clear to the government over the last 12 months that people-to-people exchanges, economic and trade exchanges, interest in educational services, interest in scientific research and technology and interest in some of our important and world-class industries like minerals, petroleum resources and wine have gotten ahead of the government-to-government relations.We saw earlier this year Foreign Minister Amorim from Brazil come to Australia, where we agreed to adopt a plan of action to enhance our relationship with Brazil. We saw the signing earlier this year of the free trade agreement between Australia and Chile with the visit to Australia of Foreign Minister Foxley. On the way to Peru I took the opportunity of visiting Mexico City to have formal bilateral discussions for the first occasion with Mexico, with Foreign Minister Espinosa, and in Peru took the opportunity of bilateral meetings with Peru.It is important for Australia to enhance its engagement and relationship with southern America, and Peru being the venue for APEC provided that opportunity which the government proposes to strongly pursue.</DOC>

On the question of the national broadband network, as members would be aware, the tender that the government has sought closes during the course of this week. Consequently, I will not be making any comments or speculation about what will flow from the closure of that tender round. We will go through that process, which is obviously subject to considerable legal requirements and considerable probity requirements, even if those things are not understood by members opposite. The outcome of the tender round will be available and will be transparent for all members of the House later in the week.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. We know the great interest he takes in international affairs, and trade is no exception in terms of his level of interest.I am pleased to be able to update the House on the importance of the APEC meeting, in particular because of the leaders' communique that emerged overnight that gave very strong impetus again to concluding the Doha Round of trade talks. This of course was the first meeting of ministers since the G20 meeting in Washington and so it was very much a response that they were required to make to give effect to that very strong resolution that came out of Washington. I remind the House also that APEC, which has 21 countries as its members, covers half of the world's GDP and more than half the world's trade. As far as Australia is concerned, it is responsible for two-thirds of our trading partnerships.The G20 did recognise the importance of concluding the Doha Round as a mechanism for adding stimulation to global economic activity. This is because trade is a multiplier of economic activity. I think the significance of the G20 meeting was not just the change in composition of the countries coming together to determine the way forward but the connectedness they made to the significance of trade in stimulating economic activity.The APEC meeting amplified and strengthened that commitment. It amplified it because, in addition to the 20 nations, an additional 12 countries signed up, at leaders' level, to this commitment to conclude the round. Apart from the nine members that share a common membership between the G20 and APEC, it brings to 32 the numbers of countries now committed to the conclusion of this round.It strengthened the call in Washington because for the first time it actually committed ministers to meet next month in Geneva to conclude the modalities aspect of the Doha talks. Whilst this was an important development, the actual calling of that meeting does rest with the Director-General of the WTO, Mr Pascal Lamy, and he has not yet formally determined to call the meeting. But the fact that the leaders of 32 countries are saying 'meet', and giving a very significant indication that we should meet next month, plus the fact that last Sunday, yesterday, there were gathered in Geneva the senior officials from all of the participating nations - and I can report to the House that important preliminary progress has been made in Geneva on those talks - sets the basis upon which the ministerial meeting can be convened next month. The Prime Minister has played a particularly active role in this. He was instrumental in the composition of the G20, the communique of the G20 and now, importantly, the strengthening of that resolve at the APEC meeting. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated, both he and I were able to use our involvement at this APEC meeting to strengthen - and not just in a bilateral sense - importantly, a grouping of ministers recommending to the leaders.Finally, I report to the House that a meeting of Cairns Group members was also convened in Peru whilst we were there, because it is important to build bridges with the other groupings that make up the WTO. So APEC came at a crucial time, and it played an instrumental part in taking the momentum forward. It remains for us to conclude it but it was a significant fillip in that direction.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I point out to the honourable member that the government remains absolutely committed to opposing commercial whaling and so-called scientific whaling in whatever form. I also point out to the member opposite that all of the things that the government has said we would do, we have done. We said we would ramp up the diplomatic engagement on whaling, and we did - in fact, through a formal diplomatic protest in Tokyo of 31 members of the International Whaling Commission, the largest protest of its kind to date. We said we would appoint a special envoy for whaling, and we have done that through the appointment of Sandy Hollway. We said we would advance reforms to the International Whaling Commission to bring the International Whaling Commission into the 21st century through the modernisation agenda that this government -  - I was pleased to inform the House last week that the government has also committed more than $6 million to kick-start non-lethal whale research and other critical conservation programs in 2008-09. We contemplate a groundbreaking partnership in the Southern Ocean open to all countries to demonstrate that the central research into whales can be carried out without killing a single whale.I note that the member for Flinders immediately rushed out once this announcement was made and said, 'Oh, the government's rushed this out as an attempted diversion.' If anyone had been diverted, it was the member for Flinders, given that I announced the proposal for the Southern Ocean research program in a media statement in March of this year. The member opposite had eight months to understand the proposal, so perhaps it seems a little rushed in terms of his response.Let me continue: the clear commitment that the government made was to give careful and serious consideration to the options for potential legal action against Japan's Antarctic whale program. With that in mind, we have carefully analysed the information obtained through our monitoring of the Antarctic fleet last summer. As the House would be aware, the Oceanic Viking has now successfully completed its monitoring activity that it undertook at the request of this government. I am pleased to report to the House that this was a successful mission. The Oceanic Viking is now returning to the ordinary course of duties. It has a critical task patrolling the Southern Ocean for illegal and unauthorised fishing activities. But again, the member for Flinders sprang out of the box last Friday and accused the government this time of having 'waved the white flag and given the green light to Japan to press ahead with the killing season', as if this is the view of the government. As it turned out, the member for Flinders is always out of the box very quickly - whether it is jumping out of aeroplanes despite the record demand for solar panels or whether it is accusing us of giving up on whales because we have collected valuable evidence. I note that the Leader of the Opposition -  - Well, you'll enjoy this next bit, I would say to those opposite, because on the same day the Leader of the Opposition had a completely different view to his shadow minister. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said:The only way we'll persuade the Japanese to stop whaling is if Japanese public opinion changes.And I quote:We're not going to stop them by sending a ship down there _ because the more you attack the Japanese the more they are now inclined to say, 'Who are you to tell us how to lead our lives?'So the member for Flinders is talking about waving white flags and the Leader of the Opposition is saying that monitoring would be counterproductive. Who are we to believe in this House - the former Minister for the Environment and Water Resources or the shadow minister? The fact is the Liberal Party did nothing of substance to end whaling for 12 years and they do not have a policy now. The member for Flinders should spend less time trying to get himself on TV and more time supporting this government's resolute actions on opposing whaling.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - Here in Parliament House last week over 400 of the nation's mayors and shire presidents gathered to meet with the Rudd cabinet. They represented an estimated 96 per cent of Australia's population. They came to Canberra to engage in a new partnership between the national government and local government. This was the delivery of our election pledge to create an Australian Council of Local Government. There was much debate at the meeting about advancing reform and improving efficiencies in local government so that we can move forward in a cooperative way. This built on the $1.9 billion that the Rudd government allocated to financial assistance grants in this year's budget, a record amount, and we also, of course, increased the Roads to Recovery program up to $1.75 billion, an increase of $250 million.At the Council of Local Government meeting, we announced $8 million for a centre of excellence for local government so that we can encourage best practice on the ground in local communities from local government, and, of course, we announced $300 million for the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. This will stimulate local economies, it will create local jobs and it will make a real difference to the quality of life on the ground in local communities - support for building libraries, support for fixing up town halls and community centres, support for sporting grounds and support for local parks and playgrounds. Indeed, local government around the nation has responded extremely positively to this, because we know that local capital works are a very effective way of stimulating the economy.Indeed, $250 million has been allocated across every council and shire, 72 per cent to rural and regional councils. Every single council will receive a grant of at least $100,000, and the remainder of the $250 million is to be divided up according to the formula done by the state and territory grants commissions - the state and territory grants commissions, formula determined in 1996-97 by the former government. So that is the formula. We have a transparent process, I might add, if you compare it with the disgraceful Regional Partnerships program or the Sustainable Regions Program, which plucked out little areas based upon politics and funded them. This is a transparent process. Indeed, it is one in which, according to the formula, just two of the top 10 seats to receive money under this program are held by this side of the House; one independent-held seat, the electorate of Kennedy, is in the top 10; and the others are all held by the coalition. This is a government that believes in transparency and in delivering to local communities based upon need, not based upon political need, which is the way that the former government did its regional development programs, and it is not surprising that this has been universally welcomed by local government.</DOC>

 - I am surprised the question did not come from the shadow minister for agriculture. He is still over there waiting. One day he will get something through tactics. But I am very grateful for the question, because the leader of the Nationals is right. The commitment we gave for $15 million for the climate change research fund will not be kept, because the $15 million was changed to $46.2 million. I know that would bother the National Party, because we did promise that $15 million would be the figure, but instead we changed the figure to $46.2 million to make sure that we could fully meet the R&amp;D needs because of the needs of looking at climate change, which they as the modern sceptics still do not believe needs to be looked at, because it is not happening at all. But we do understand the needs of farmers to be able to have research and development into adaptation, research and development into reducing emissions of nitrous oxide and research and development into reducing methane emissions. That is what the $46.2 million is for, and that is why the $15 million commitment was not only abandoned but significantly increased. If they prefer a $15 million commitment to a $46.2 million commitment, they should go out and argue that, but the farmers of Australia know exactly why the R&amp;D figures were pushed upwards.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bonner for that question. Many members of the public have probably bought or received a pirated DVD at some stage - perhaps some members of this House have done so - and not given too much thought to the criminal aspect of it, because most people think of it as a victimless crime. But it is becoming increasingly clear that that is far from the case. Organised crime is moving into this type of activity because of the enormous profits that can be made. A blank disk and some packaging costs, maybe, 20c, 25c. The average price of a DVD that has been pirated is $10. That is over a 1,000 per cent profit. Australian police intelligence is increasingly finding that the same people who are involved in serious crimes, such as the distribution of child pornography, drug trafficking and money laundering, are now heavily involved in what has become an explosion in the production of pirated DVDs. Interpol is giving similar indications on an international trend in that direction.A report prepared for the recent national police ministers' conference estimated the cost to industry in Australia of pirated DVDs is around $1.7 billion. That report said that piracy would become more prevalent and more attractive to organised crime as criminals increasingly learn that intellectual property crime offers that very high financial return from a low investment and that because, at least in the past, there has also been a rather low risk of law enforcement attention or detection. State police are now doing a lot of good work in this area. Raids this year on pirating operations have uncovered illegal weapons, drugs and child pornography in addition to the DVDs. There was a significant raid of that nature in Sydney only yesterday. The state and territory police will increasingly encounter this type of crime, and if strong action is taken with enforcement then of course its attractiveness will be reduced.I should mention that the Australian Federal Police have appointed an intellectual property officer to build partnerships across the Asia-Pacific region and in June actually hosted a workshop for that purpose in Bangkok. The Australian government is also seeking intellectual property enforcement and cooperation with other countries through international forums such as APEC and in our free trade negotiations. In February the Minister for Trade announced that Australia would participate in negotiations for multilateral anticounterfeiting trade agreements.The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft is an organisation which protects the interests of 50,000 people who work in the film and television industry. They have been working with police to raise awareness of this growing involvement of organised crime. In the 12 months to October this year the Federation Against Copyright Theft assisted police in seizing close to one million DVDs and 741 DVD burners. These are pieces of equipment that you can keep in the backyard, and those 741 burners have the capacity to produce 18 million DVDs in a year. So it is clear that DVD piracy is not at all a victimless crime, and I do urge the public to stop and think where their money might really be going next time they pay 10 bucks for a cheap DVD.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and I would recommend that if he, for whatever reason, was distracted when the Minister for Health and Ageing gave her answer earlier in question time he studies the Hansard. What he will find from that Hansard and what she confirmed to the parliament is that our new investments in elective surgery are ensuring people can get elective surgery: eye surgery, knee surgery and the like. We have seen more procedures undertaken than the minister thought was possible when she announced the funds. She had announced that 25,000 would be done and in fact 27,000 or more have been done and she is running in front of time. Since this government came to office we have invested an additional $1 billion in health for a set of purposes and an additional $600 million for another set of purposes. As the minister indicated, these have been tied to outcomes. Importantly, some of the outcomes that they have been tied to have been these elective surgery procedures. - Can I say to the shadow minister opposite that he may like to reflect how this track record of additional investment, particularly as we move towards the COAG meeting on Saturday, stands in stark contrast to the record of the Liberal Party, where the man sitting next to him used to wander around giving 'rock-solid, ironclad guarantees' only to have to back down on them because the things that were said to the Australian people at election time were never honoured by the Liberal Party in government. This government has taken a different approach. You sent your then minister for health out to give Australians a rock-solid, ironclad guarantee when they were voting and broke that promise. - Can I make the simple point that in health as well as in other areas this is a government that keeps its word. This is a government that delivers on its commitments. This is a government that is putting in place the long-term foundation stones of reform. This is a government that is responding decisively to the global financial crisis.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bendigo for his question and his longstanding interest in matters with respect to the veterans community. I had the honour and privilege of representing the government and the parliament overseas recently at Armistice Day ceremonies in Europe. I was accompanied by the shadow minister, the member for Greenway. We were also there with the Governor-General. I have been gladdened by the reports that I have received from members in the House on both sides about the success of the commemorations here in Australia and reports of attendances of over 3,000 at the Australian War Memorial, and also at other ceremonies throughout the country.In Europe, the focus was very much on the 90th anniversary of the armistice. Although it is a time to remember that almost a million Australians have served overseas and some 102,000-plus have, if you like, suffered the ultimate sacrifice, I think it is also important at this time to remember particularly what occurred at the time of the Great War so long ago.In terms of ceremonies in Europe, the Governor-General led the Australian delegation with respect to the principal French ceremonies at Paris and Verdun. The shadow minister, amongst others, and a delegation of veterans' leaders attended a function at the Australian National Memorial at Villiers-Bretonneux. I had the privilege of being at the Menin Gate on what was a particularly cold Flanders day, a day which I can imagine was not unlike what our troops had to deal with so long ago.It is 90 years since the end of the war that was meant to end all wars - 90 years from when, I think it can be argued, Australia was at its zenith in terms of international influence with respect to the events of that time. In 1918, the circumstances were that the Australian forces led the charge in a number of major battles which were effectively the basis which led to the armistice. They were joined by many others - the British, the Canadians, the Indians and the New Zealanders - but with respect to a number of particular battles in that time, Australians served their country exceptionally well. Villiers-Bretonneux, which I had the privilege of leading a delegation to for Anzac Day earlier this year, was the site of a battle which stemmed the tide of the push towards Amiens by the Germans as part of their spring offensive of 1918. Then battles like Le Hamel, Amiens, Mont St Quentin and Peron stand in the history of our country - a history of great courage and great bravery.I also had the honour to attend the rededication of the Australian Corps Memorial at Le Hamel on 8 November. The Le Hamel memorial, unfortunately, was in some disrepair but it is an impressive memorial. I note the member for Maranoa is present. He was minister at the time it was originally dedicated. The Corps Memorial commemorates the exploits of the Australian Corps right the way through, but its location at Le Hamel in itself is quite significant. Le Hamel was the first battle led by General Sir John Monash as the head of the Australian Corps. It was a battle that was timed to the nth degree. Monash timed it to go for only 90 minutes. He got it wrong. It went 93 minutes. - There is an argument there. What you can say with respect to what occurred on that occasion is that the combination of the use of armour, air and land forces was very much a template for battles later on which led to the wind-back through to the Hindenburg line and eventually, if you like, the terms towards the armistice.It was a very great honour and a privilege, as I said, to be there on this occasion and to share this occasion with my colleagues. It is a very important time to remember those who fought and died not only in World War I but also in conflicts since. It is a time to remember that we have a proud history, but we also have to remember so many who died in the cause of freedom and also those who serve today on our behalf.</DOC>

 - I am reminded by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation that, whilst the Financial Review is important to read every day, it is particularly excellent reading today. I recommend it to members of the House generally. - The member for North Sydney no doubt insults the editor of the Financial Review with that remark. On the question that the Leader of the Opposition raises with me, on 12 October this year the government moved quickly and decisively to ensure confidence in the banking system. We did that in an environment where international competitors were moving. The Leader of the Opposition knows if we had not acted our banking system would have been seen as second class internationally. We made that decision on 12 October. We have acted to implement that decision. Every step of the way we have been dealing and consulting with people in the financial services sector and, of course, with our regulatory authorities. The Leader of the Opposition has had several positions - indeed, dozens of positions - since the day on which we acted. Some days he is in favour of the bank guarantee and the actions we took. Some days, in fact, he is so in favour of it that it is his idea. Other days he seeks to undermine confidence in the actions taken by the government and implies that had he been Prime Minister the action would not have been taken. Well, he cannot have it all ways. The government will continue on the course that it has set.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question and for her contribution in the development of the legislation that is before the House today. Twelve months ago the Australian people spoke out about what type of workplace relations system they wanted. They spoke clearly in favour of the Australian value of fairness and against the divisive, unfair and extreme workplace relations system championed by the Liberal Party - by those opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, who voted in favour of it more than a dozen times.Just a short time ago, the Rudd government introduced its Fair Work Bill into the parliament to give legislative embodiment to the value of fairness in workplace relations in this country. The bill brings into this parliament in the form of legislation the policy we took to the Australian people at the last election. That policy is Labor's Forward with Fairness, and it has been endorsed by the Australian people and brought into the parliament today in the form of the Fair Work Bill.The level of consultation on the bill brought into this parliament today is unprecedented. I particularly take this opportunity to thank those stakeholders who have played a crucial role in the government's consultative process. I particularly mention the members of the National Workplace Relations Consultative Council's committee on industrial legislation, which includes members of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Mines and Metals Association, the National Farmers Federation and the Master Builders. I also mention the work of the Business Advisory Group and the Small Business Working Group, and I thank John Denton of Corrs Chambers Westgarth for his work in chairing the Business Advisory Group. I also thank those members of Labor's caucus who played such an important role in the development of this bill and the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy for his consultation with the small business constituency.At the heart of Forward with Fairness is an enterprise bargaining system and a safety net that working people can rely on that cannot be stripped away. This bill contains a special development in the workplace relations law of this country - that is, a special set of provisions for the low paid. There are around 100,000 adults who are currently earning the federal minimum wage, which is about $543 a week. It is not a lot of money; I think we would all agree with that. Low-paid workers who receive this kind of money work in child care, community work, security and cleaning. We want to facilitate their entry into the world of enterprise bargaining. We want to make sure that there is a special bargaining stream for the low paid. Their bargaining will be able to happen at a multi-employer level, and Fair Work Australia will play a hands-on role in helping the bargaining. In those limited circumstances where despite the best efforts of Fair Work Australia the parties cannot reach agreement, Fair Work Australia will be able to step in and make a workplace determination. This is for special cases and only for low-paid workers, and it occurs where the parties have never had an enterprise agreement and the employers are substantially on the safety net. It is a new step forward in fairness in workplace relations.I have noticed that some have sought to mischaracterise this in the public domain. I say to those involved in that mischaracterisation: are they seriously going to argue to the Australian people that low-paid workers substantially reliant on the safety net do not deserve a helping hand? The Fair Work Bill is good for employees, employers, families and the economy. It is delivering what Labor promised at the last election and what the Australian people voted for right around this nation.</DOC>

 - I certainly thank the shadow Treasurer for her question. I did not say that all people in managed investment funds who were experiencing problems should go to Centrelink. What I said was that those that were experiencing hardship may, if there were a reassessment of their position by Centrelink, be eligible for some support - which, of course, was a question that had been asked in the House that week by a member down there, the member for Moncrieff. I made a very logical point that those who are impacted upon by the current state of the economy in terms of their investments may be experiencing hardships and one avenue that was open to them was, of course, to seek a re-evaluation of their situation from Centrelink. We are actually proud of Centrelink on this side of the House. It does provide a lot of support to a lot of Australians, particularly when they experience difficulty. But that point was not made as a substitute for anything else other than to say that if they had hardship, that was one possibility.The government is attending to the issues when it comes to managed investments. Indeed, we work with the regulators, as we have been working with the regulators all of the way through, and our advisers in the Treasury to ensure that all of those people out there that are the subject of an influence from the global financial crisis in the way in which it impacts on their assets are looked after. What we have done through the Treasury and through David Murray is that we have a series of task forces in the Treasury working with the various industry associations. Whether it comes to car finance, whether it comes to mortgage trusts or whether it comes to cash management trusts, these are very serious issues. Of course, what the opposition will not admit and cannot admit - because they do not understand the magnitude of the global financial crisis - is that, when we introduced the deposit guarantee to protect 13 million depositors in this country, they should have supported it. On the day, they promised bipartisan support, and it took about 24 hours before they were junking it in public - 24 hours - because they do not understand the seriousness of the situation; they simply do not get the seriousness of the global financial crisis.We on this side of the House are proud that we acted decisively and swiftly to put in place the deposit guarantee and the wholesale term funding guarantee, because it is absolutely essential to the financial stability of this economy - and it remains so. That is why it is so regrettable that we have seen so much short-term point-scoring and politicking from those on the other side of the House, who do not understand the importance of financial stability. We do, and we are working with our regulators in terms of the deposit guarantee and the wholesale funding guarantee to ensure that it produces the maximum results for the Australian people. We will not be diverted by the political point-scoring from those on the other side, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, who does not seem to understand the importance of the deposit guarantee. His policy is to put a cap on the deposit guarantee of $100,000. I could not think of anything more destructive than that proposal because that would leave 40 per cent of deposits out of the guarantee - the most liquid deposits in the banking system. He cannot really support our measure because he does not understand the magnitude of the crisis that we are facing and the measures that are required to put stability in the system.Leave not granted.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and for his assistance with the development of the Fair Work Bill, introduced into the parliament today. Labor acted at the start of this year to end the making of Australian workplace agreements. Our new Fair Work Bill has no place for Australian workplace agreements or individual statutory employment agreements of any kind. In fact, when you look at the objects of the act, you will see one of the objects is to have a system without individual statutory employment agreements, and the object indicates that such agreements are not consistent with having a fair and decent workplace relations system.We know that, under Work Choices, Australian workplace agreements were the heart of the rip-offs - the heart of the rip-offs of penalty rates; the heart of the rip-offs of overtime - and the statistics clearly showed it and were available to members of the Liberal Party who now sit on the opposition benches, including the opposition front bench, and the Leader of the Opposition sitting in the leader's chair. He would have known, as he supported Work Choices as a member of the Howard government, that 64 per cent of Australian workplace agreements cut annual leave loading, 63 per cent cut penalty rates, 52 per cent cut shift loadings, 51 per cent cut overtime and 46 per cent cut public holiday pay - statistics known to him but, despite that, he supported Work Choices.Now decision day is coming for the Liberal Party. One of the most startling things yesterday about the address to the National Press Club by the Leader of the Opposition is that he declared boldly that if he were Prime Minister of this country he would answer questions - only to find that in the office of Leader of the Opposition he was unable to do so. A very significant question was put to him three times by three different journalists, and that was: what is his position on individual statutory employment agreements? He did not answer it - three times, questions without answers. Well, decision day is coming for the Leader of the Opposition. He will have to decide what he believes on individual statutory employment agreements. Of course, we know if we judge him - as one should - on what he has done that he has come into this parliament day after day as a member of the Howard government and voted for the rip-offs - voted for the individual statutory employment agreements. And we know that across the Liberal Party support for this kind of extremism is strong. On 8 February this year a senior frontbench member of the Liberal Party was quoted in the West Australian newspaper as saying:We are prepared to die in the ditch over individual statutory workplace agreements.And not many weeks ago the deputy Liberal leader said statutory individual contracts 'must form part of a modern workplace relations system'. - 'Of course,' she is saying. She is verifying that individual statutory employment agreements are still Liberal policy. Well, that may be the policy of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but the person we want to answer the question is the Leader of the Opposition. Will he verify that statutory employment agreements are still part of the Liberal Party's policy or will he keep ducking the question? I have got news for him: when it comes to voting on this bill, which we will do in this House of Representatives before parliament rises at the end of the year, he has got a decision to make. And that decision will include making a policy decision on individual statutory employment agreements, because the objects of this act state that such agreements are not compatible with a fair and decent workplace relations system. For a man who says that he wants to answer questions, so far we have heard deafening silence. We are waiting for the answer. But, of course, we know, if he is truthful to what he believes in and what he has voted for before, he will say that he endorses industrial relations extremism - he endorses rip-offs - because in this parliament he already has.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank -  - I thank the member for Mayo for his question. There is certainly a difficult situation for many out there who have investments in the non-deposit-taking institutions. Those are investments that were made by people looking for a higher return and they are investments in funds which are certainly very worthy funds - very worthy investments - but to attribute all of the impact on the non-ADI sector to the bank guarantee is simply wrong and inaccurate. It has certainly been a factor and it has had an influence, but to attribute problems to do with mortgage trusts and all the rest of it solely to the bank guarantee is just wrong and inaccurate. I do not know what the member is arguing but, if he is arguing that we should extend the guarantee to all of those non-deposit-taking institutions, that is not something the government can responsibly do. - What we are doing about it is that we are working with the various industry organisations to find solutions. There are no instantaneous solutions to investments in the market linked sector. They are not banks. They are not subject to the guarantee. People have made those investments and there are now adverse market outcomes, which we recognise. If you want to attribute all the blame for that to the government, go ahead. But the truth is there is a bigger problem out there which needs to be solved, and this government is working with our regulators - whether it is car finance, cash management trusts or mortgage trusts - on a sectoral basis to find solutions. There have been some practical solutions so far and I hope to see further progress as we go through. But, if those on that side of the House want to pretend there is some magic wand a government can wave and suddenly the whole impact of the global financial crisis is simply washed away in terms of these market linked investments, they are living in cloud-cuckoo-land.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The upheaval in global financial markets is, of course, now impacting not only on developed countries but on developing countries. We have seen this most dramatically in the IMF regional outlook that was produced overnight. As we are aware, the global crisis has already delivered a recession in Europe and Japan, and the IMF is now predicting recessions in the US and the UK. The IMF regional economic outlook released overnight has this to say:With the crisis intensifying in industrial countries, strains have spread to emerging markets. These markets, which for a while had seemed relatively insulated from the crisis, are now reeling as investors fly to safety in a context of deep uncertainty about global growth prospects.So the IMF has downgraded growth in our region to 4.9 per cent over 2009, which is well below the 7.6 per cent growth experienced last year. This is why there is now a growing international consensus that coordinated, decisive and strong action to strengthen growth is absolutely critical in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.The IMF said this overnight:_ policymakers in Asia need to be ready to react decisively to maintain financial stability and support growth.This is what the Rudd government has done. It has done it with its $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy, it has done it with its guarantees on deposits and it has done it with its wholesale term funding guarantees. Our strategy is expected to boost growth by one-half to one per cent and help to create up to 75,000 additional jobs.Other governments around the world are also moving. Overnight, the UK government announced a fiscal stimulus package of about one per cent of GDP. We certainly welcome the UK government's efforts to support growth. Other governments are moving as well. It is very important that governments around the world move on a coordinated basis. - But, as the member for North Sydney indicates again, those opposite simply have not got a clue about the magnitude of this crisis, its consequences for this economy or what solutions need to be put in place to deal with it. They simply have no idea of the magnitude of the challenge. But, whatever short-term politics they want to play, we on this side of the House will defend the national interest to strengthen our economy, to assist households and to assist businesses, because we are in the middle of an unprecedented global event and we must do everything within our power, using all the tools of policy, to strengthen our economy, and that is what we are doing.</DOC>

 - It is a pleasure to have the member for North Sydney in the House. It was only yesterday that we had the report from Access Economics reflecting upon the stewardship of the member for North Sydney and the member for Higgins. What it said was that they, in a colourful way, wasted the good years from the commodity boom and they did not do enough to strengthen the economy for when the economy turned down. That was the conclusion of Access Economics. They wasted the fruits of the commodity boom and did not make the necessary investments in infrastructure and education. What they did was to go on a spending spree at the top of the cycle. What the cycle is about is that, in the good times, you save and, when the times turn down, you spend and invest. That is what it is about, and that is what our Economic Security Strategy is about.The world has changed and, because we put in place a strong surplus in the last budget, we had the flexibility to respond to the change in global conditions - and respond we did, with a $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy. Now we have for the first time, unlike under the coalition, fiscal policy and monetary policy working in tandem. What was happening under the coalition was that they were working in opposite directions. So this government is responding to the global challenges. We are using the surplus that we built in the last budget to strengthen our economy. What the Minister for Finance and Deregulation said when he was talking about a cycle was precisely what we are doing.</DOC>

 - They are all fired up, Mr Speaker. - If I could thank the member for Robertson for her question and for the good work that she does with the Gosford Chamber of Commerce, where I attended a meeting about a year ago. It was a very good meeting, and she works very well and strongly in representing the interests of small business in her electorate.In Forward with Fairness, the government committed to tearing up Work Choices and introducing a fair, simple and flexible industrial relations system. For small business owners, Work Choices was anything but simple and flexible. For example, the so-called fairness test was a red-tape nightmare for small businesses. In fact, there was a backlog about this time a year ago of more than 150,000 agreements awaiting final assessment. Under the government's changes, awards and agreements will have special flexibility clauses enabling small businesses and their employees to tailor working conditions to their personal circumstances, subject of course to a proper, decent and effective safety net.The Rudd government is keeping its election commitment to provide basic protection for good employees from being dismissed unfairly while allowing business owners to manage their workforce according to their commercial needs. To enable small business owners to dismiss staff fairly, the government has developed a simple, six-paragraph fair dismissal code. If the employer follows the code then the dismissal will be deemed fair. Of course, genuine redundancies are excluded from the unfair dismissal laws.A number of small business organisations have provided comment on the fair dismissal code and the system that we have put in place. COSBOA, a peak small business organisation, in a press release headed 'Fair dismissal code acceptance' said:Small business can be pleased with the outcome _The Australian Industry Group said:The Fair Dismissal Code for small businesses will be short and easily applied.So there is a good endorsement. The National Farmers Federation indicated their support with the media release entitled 'Farmers sign off on Govt's 'Fair Dismissal Code''. It stated:The National Farmers' Federation _ endorsed the Australian Government's Fair Dismissal Code _ as 'striking a sensible, practical balance for employers and employees'.Here are a couple of others. In a letter to me, the Master Builders said:Master Builders is supportive of the Fair Dismissal provisions because it recognises the particular circumstances that small business faces in the engagement of staff. Your Government's commitment in recognising the needs of small business in relation to employment is very much appreciated.The Pharmacy Guild of Australia said:On behalf of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia I wish to congratulate you and the Government on the sensible approach taken in finalising the Fair Dismissal Code.They are pretty solid endorsements, but we do not have any such endorsements from the coalition. In fact, the shadow Treasurer, as recently as September, said in a speech - which is very difficult to find; in fact, impossible to find -  
A government member - Who wrote it? - I am not sure who wrote because we cannot find it. The shadow Treasurer and the deputy Liberal leader said on unfair dismissals that the opposition would resist any move to turn back the clock. It would be very interesting to see if we can get an answer. Maybe it will come from the fourth question from the Leader of the Opposition on what his view is. An article by SmartCompany said of the shadow small business minister:Opposing Labor's plan to remove the unfair dismissal exemption for SMEs will be the first priority for new opposition small business spokesman Steven Ciobo.The article went on to say:Ciobo says any attempt by Labor to cut down the 100 employee threshold for exemption from unfair dismissal laws will receive his 'absolute and confirmed opposition'.So the truth is that as far as the coalition is concerned Work Choices is not dead; it is just resting, pining for the fjords. The Liberal Party was, is and always will be the party of Work Choices. The Rudd Labor government is the party of a fair, flexible and decent industrial relations system in this country.</DOC>

 - I certainly welcome the question because we are proud of our nation building investment funds, to which we have allocated thus far $26 billion. We are proud of them. The legislation, I think, is in the House, is it not? The legislation is in the House and, when it passes, the funds will be deposited and we can engage in a conversation with the Australian people about how we are going to build the nation and invest in infrastructure, unlike those opposite who did not invest in critical economic infrastructure. They left it all to the states and they did nothing.This weekend, we have a COAG meeting where we are getting together with the state governments for a fundamental reform of federal-state relations. Front and centre of that is infrastructure, which is absolutely critical to this country as we build our wealth creation capacity and make up for the wasted years under Howard and Costello - the wasted years that Access Economics was talking about -  - 1 January.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. She certainly has a very real concern for and gives great support to, particularly, the pensioners in her electorate. Last night was a very good night for two million families and four million pensioners, carers, people with a disability and veterans. The Economic Security Strategy bill passed the parliament. From 8 December, in just a very short period of time, single pensioners will receive $1,400 each, pensioner couples will receive $2,100 and families will receive $1,000 for each eligible child. Of course, it is the case that these Australians who have been doing it tough are counting on these payments.I have had some recent calls and letters from pensioners, who have said the following things to me. One, an age pensioner, has written, 'I can now meet all of my bills and have Christmas dinner for my family for the first time in years.' A disability pensioner rang me the other day in tears. He can now fly to see his son for Christmas and buy him a decent Christmas present. These pensioners and so many other Australians have been doing it tough and we know that they deserve a helping hand. Unfortunately, it seems that not everybody on the other side of the House agrees with this, even though they promised that there would not be any quibbling about these important payments. Despite promising to support them, some of them just cannot manage it. We know that, as usual, Australians should judge the Leader of the Opposition by what he does, not by what he says. But I think he should go and have a look at what the Leader of the National Party in the Senate had to say about this legislation last night. This is what Senator Joyce said in the Senate:_ I think I have been consistent - and I speak on behalf of some of my colleagues - in saying that I do not agree with this package.Which colleagues? Which colleagues is he speaking about? Who else on that side of the House does not want these payments to go to pensioners, carers and families? You would have thought that at this point we would have had either the Leader of the Opposition jumping up to speak or even maybe the member for Warringah. He, of course, might have jumped up to defend families and pensioners. - Of course, the Leader of the Opposition says that he has not had any opportunity to make any public statement anywhere in the media -  
Government members - The Press Club! - That's right! He was at the Press Club yesterday. He obviously has no idea what his coalition colleagues are doing in the Senate. We understand that there are a few other colleagues who do not agree with these payments. So it is some leadership that he is showing - getting out there and demonstrating what on earth it is that the opposition actually thinks about these payments.They do have a shadow minister over there who, you might have thought, might have defended the interests of pensioners and families. Unfortunately, the member for Warringah thinks that the job he has got is beneath him. When the latest Leader of the Opposition was actually elected by those opposite, the member for Warringah went out into the media and said that he wanted a change of portfolio because he did not think that this portfolio was the main game. That is what he is saying to pensioners and to families. Last night, in yet another insult to Australian families and pensioners, the member for Warringah told Laurie Oakes on Channel 9 that he had 'nothing better to do than turn up for media interviews'. Nothing better to do! He cannot get out there and talk to pensioners and families and stand up for their interests. The member for Warringah has no interest in developing policy, as the Acting Prime Minister -  - I say this to the member for Warringah: if you are not prepared to stand up for the interests of pensioners and families maybe it is time to get another job.</DOC>

 - I was hopeful I might get a question in my portfolio of regional development, but of course the National Party are not interested - they have vacated that particular field. I am asked about the government's commitment to the national broadband network, and I am happy to answer. The fact is that we are moving on delivering our commitment during the election campaign where we promised to allocate some $4.7 billion to roll out the national broadband network. The shadow minister knows that proposals are due tomorrow, 26 November, and therefore it certainly would not be appropriate to speculate on that process, as the Deputy Prime Minister did not yesterday.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and thank him also for his tireless work on behalf of his community and for keeping in touch during the course of last week. While I am at it could I also recognise in particular the work of the member for Brisbane, the member for Flynn and also the member for Ryan, who joined me on a site visit last week. All of them and indeed other members have done tremendous work in support of their local communities.Last week the Prime Minister and I, and indeed Senator Ludwig - who spent the best part of last week assisting, in his endeavours, the community operations - had the opportunity to visit and see firsthand the devastation caused by the severe storms in South-East Queensland. I am pleased to say that the federal government has been able to assist in a number of respects. We are working very closely with the Bligh government. I commend the work of Premier Bligh, which has been outstanding, along with the work of one of those unsung heroes, Neil Roberts, the Queensland Minister for Emergency Services; he has also done an outstanding job.Under the Commonwealth Government Disaster Response Plan through Emergency Management Australia, I was able to authorise the Queensland government's request to provide 700 defence personnel. They did an outstanding job. I had the opportunity to meet with a number of those personnel. They were instrumental in clearing debris from powerlines, restoring power to infrastructure and to local homes and doing a lot of work securing roofs. I am very pleased to say that, along with the volunteers generally, the ADF in particular were clearly local heroes. They were blessed with donations of cakes, sandwiches and the odd can of beer after their duties. We were also in that context able to provide some 2,800 tarpaulins, and I would like to recognise AusAID for their contribution to that effort.Under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, we have recognised 13 local government areas for the purposes of personal hardship and distress grants. Those grants can be accessed through the Queensland Department of Communities. For the record, the telephone number is 1800173349. Under the Australian government disaster recovery payment, administered through my colleague the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, we are providing one-off payments to individuals affected: $1,000 for adults and $400 for children. The hotline for that grant is 1802266. Today I am pleased to be able to announce that the federal government is providing an additional $500,000 to match the contribution of the Queensland government to the Premier's Disaster Relief Appeal. That will significantly supplement a number of generous contributions from individuals and also corporations.While this has obviously been tremendously devastating and traumatic for the local communities, it has been an excellent example of governments and indeed the community working together. At the place that I visited with the members for Ryan and Brisbane, we saw a community centre where all government agencies had been brought together. The Red Cross was also there, along with insurance companies assisting to process claims. While, in summary, the storms have been devastating, this really is an example of an ability to bounce back, to have resilient communities, and I would certainly commend and congratulate all those involved.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I know that his concern on behalf of local banana growers in his electorate and his part of Queensland is a very sincere one. I absolutely appreciate it is a sincere concern and that is why he has raised the matter in the House today. I can advise the member for Kennedy and the House that Biosecurity Australia has issued a final import risk analysis report on bananas from the Philippines and that is open to appeal until 12 December - that is, open to appeal for 30 days from the day of the decision. I think it is very important to note that the import risk analysis process is transparent, a scientific assessment and independent of government. - Well, it is independent of government. It is reviewed through public consultation and through the scrutiny of an Eminent Scientists Group. We do take in this country a conservative approach to quarantine, as we should, and the import risk analysis proposes that bananas only enter Australia under strict quarantine measures relating to seven groups of pests of quarantine concern. These measures include sourcing bananas from demonstrated low-pest areas, field inspections and auditing by AQIS, disinfection treatments and mandatory pre-clearance of fruit by AQIS inspectors in the Philippines. In particular, AQIS officers will be involved in inspecting, verifying and auditing systems and processes in the Philippines both before and during the exporting of bananas.There will be a mandatory pre-clearance arrangement, with the presence and involvement of AQIS inspectors in the Philippines, in applying quarantine conditions in the field, including in packing houses. There will also be audit and verification by AQIS of systems and processes used by the Philippines to certify any exports, and Philippines exporters will be responsible for reimbursing the full cost of AQIS inspections. In addition, there will need to be a combination of laboratory and field experiments prior to exports occurring.I understand that this is a matter that deeply concerns the member for Kennedy and I understand he is representing the concerns of his constituents. This is a process independent of government - a transparent process, a process of scientific assessment and a process that involves the scrutiny of the Eminent Scientists Group. The matter is open for appeal until 12 December.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The bilateral relationship between Australia and the United Kingdom is one of our most significant. It is at the front line of our international relationships. It is of course a relationship built on history, but in the modern era it is built on people-to-people contact; a couple of centuries of trade and diplomacy; and importantly, and this is underappreciated, very significant links so far as security, strategic and defence interests are concerned.One of the attributes of the relationship which reflects that security, strategic and defence relationship is the Australia-United Kingdom ministerial meeting, or AUKMIN as it is called. Tomorrow I will travel to the United Kingdom to attend the second AUKMIN meeting, together with Minister Fitzgibbon, the Minister for Defence, who will be arriving in the United Kingdom following the meeting of defence ministers at the southern regional command in Afghanistan. The meeting will be attended by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Mr Miliband, and the Secretary of State for Defence, Mr Hutton. We will examine the array of mutual interests that we have in our significant international interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the significant interest we have so far as nonproliferation is concerned, particularly in the nuclear area, with Iran and North Korea.One of the bilateral matters that I will be taking up with my counterpart, Foreign Secretary Miliband, is of course Australia and the United Kingdom's shared interest in Zimbabwe. The governments of Australia and the United Kingdom have both been at the forefront of international efforts to seek to bring about democracy, the rule of law, and better economic and social circumstances in Zimbabwe. We are increasingly concerned that, a month or so after a compact between Mr Tsvangirai and Mr Mugabe, a government of national unity has not yet been effected. We are very concerned that the so-called elders group of Jimmy Carter, the former President of the United States; Kofi Annan, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations, and others was effectively excluded from Zimbabwe in recent days.The humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe is now very acute. Today I have announced that Australia will provide an additional $8 million of immediate humanitarian assistance to the people of Zimbabwe. Six million dollars of this will be for emergency food assistance through the World Food Program and $2 million will be for non-government organisations for food and sanitation purposes, particularly given the outbreak of cholera that we have seen in recent days.So the relationship that we have with the United Kingdom is one of those relationships that we have at the front line of our international relationships, and that is reflected by not just our interest in the humanitarian and political situation in Zimbabwe but also our security, strategic and defence arrangements internationally.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, but can I reassure the member - and anybody else who may be under such a misapprehension - that our defence forces work 365 days a year, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. Anybody who has contact with people who work for any arm of our Defence Force, whether it be Army, Navy or Air Force, knows that they are there working hard, working continuously and dedicating their lives to it.On the question of border security, this government obviously believes in strong protection of Australia's borders from whatever threats we may face. Whether that is illegal fishing, whether that is running of drugs or guns or other forms of contraband, or whether that is in relation to illegal movement of people across our borders, of course we take an approach that says, 'The borders of Australia are to be protected,' and we will always take all reasonable steps to ensure that that occurs.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question and thank him and the other members of parliament who spoke from both sides last night on a private member's motion in this place that related to White Ribbon Day. The member for Hindmarsh is a White Ribbon Ambassador, as are a number of members of parliament on both sides of the House, including the Prime Minister, who is a very strong advocate on behalf of White Ribbon Day, as are many other members of parliament.One in three Australian women experience domestic or family violence in their lifetime and one in five experience sexual assault in their lifetime. Nearly half a million Australian women suffer violence each year. It is the greatest human rights violation in this country and the greatest human rights violation on the planet in terms of the number of people who are affected.White Ribbon Day is a particularly important day because it is an opportunity for men to show their attitudes towards violence against women. It is an opportunity for Australian men and men around the world to say that they will not be violent but they will also not be silent - they will not condone violence. It is very important to have high-profile supporters of White Ribbon Day. Not only do we have the Prime Minister, state attorneys general led by our Commonwealth Attorney-General and members of parliament on both sides of the House, we have media personalities, footballers and other prominent Australians - all of them standing up and saying: 'This is not a role model for masculinity that we want to show our sons and our grandsons. We want to show a role for men in the Australian community and in the world community of reducing violence against women.' As Andrew O'Keefe, our White Ribbon Ambassador No. 1, said today, there is a difference between masculinity and machismo - that is, it is possible to be a strong man and a tough man without being a violent man or an aggressive man. I want to congratulate all those men who have stood up and said, 'Not only will I not be violent but I will not be silent about violence against women.'This government is determined to respond to domestic and family violence and sexual assault and we have moved substantially in this area. We appointed in May an expert council, bringing together some of the best brains in the country when it comes to reducing violence against women. They will be presenting me with a draft national plan in the coming weeks. The government will then respond to the draft national plan and that will be our national plan of action to reduce violence against women.It is worth saying that an Amnesty International petition that was handed to me today included 30,000 signatures calling for a national action plan on violence against women. We have committed to that national action plan. The signatures were of course collected before we had started work on our national action plan. We are delivering on that national action plan.The National Council to Reduce Violence against Women has engaged all across the country with people who have experienced violence; with men who have perpetrated violence; and with experts, judges, police officers and people who work in the refuge system. They have had contact with over 2,000 people and had three expert roundtables. They have done an enormous amount of work. The national plan will support the community to better support victims of violence, to improve our legal system to make sure it is effective in tackling violence and to reduce violence for future generations.We have delivered since coming to office $1 million to the White Ribbon Foundation to support and expand their activities in rural Australia; $2 million to benchmark community attitudes to violence against women so that we can change those attitudes; $500,000 to the Australian Institute of Criminology to undertake more detailed research into domestic homicides so that we can find out where we let down too many Australian women - more than one every week is murdered by an intimate partner; and $500,000 to 22 national and local projects to support victims of domestic or family violence. These projects include Victoria's Domestic Violence Resource Centre's mentoring project for women with a disability, to promote their capacity to lead and facilitate activities that focus on violence prevention for women with disabilities, and the Huon Domestic Violence Service in Tasmania, for radio programs that will particularly target young people and urge them to consider their behaviour.In conclusion, I would like to report to the House that the Attorney-General and I formally moved yesterday for Australia to become a party to the Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
Honourable members - Hear, hear! - The ratifying of the optional protocol to CEDAW was an election commitment, and, as with a number of the other measures that I have mentioned today, they are election commitments delivered so that we can work together - men and women, parliamentarians and people outside the parliament - to end violence against women.</DOC>

 - Once again, I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I do know that he is very seriously concerned and is representing the concern of his constituents. I indicate though that I do not agree with him on the question of the professionalism and dedication of our AQIS officers. I believe they go about the tasks that we ask them to do with all good skills and with professionalism. I also say to the member for Kennedy: while I do understand how deep his concern is, this import risk analysis has been in development now for a long period of time. The first request from the Philippines came in May 1999. An issues paper was issued on 2 May 2001. A technical information paper followed on 6 May 2002. A draft import risk analysis report was delivered on 1 July 2002. There was a revised draft on 19 February 2004. There was an addendum to the revised draft on 16 June 2004. There was a revised draft again on 1 March 2007.I indicate to members in this House that this has been a long-running process, a process that has been in train under both sides of politics over a number of terms of this parliament. It has resulted in the independently generated scientific assessment that has been reviewed by the Eminent Scientists Group. It is a process used by both sides of parliament to deal with these issues, which I freely admit are difficult issues and are particularly difficult for the growers in the industry sector. What I can say to the member for Kennedy, and what I did indicate to him in my last answer, is that the final import risk analysis report issued by Biosecurity Australia is open to appeal until 12 December and it may be - I am certainly not indicating to the member for Kennedy what particular course of action he should take - that he or people that he is in contact with might want to use that appeal facility. -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. Receiving regular updates about ABC Learning has been something that members on both sides of the House have been anxious to do because they want to keep their constituents informed as to what is happening. I have updated the House on a number of occasions about the situation with ABC Learning, and I seek to provide some additional advice today.As members of parliament are aware, on Thursday, 6 November ABC Learning moved into voluntary administration, and within a matter of hours a receiver was appointed. I announced very quickly a $22 million funding package to provide certainty for affected parents to ensure that childcare centres remained open till 31 December 2008 to give both the receiver and insolvency practitioners, which we now have embedded and working with the receiver, time to work through this difficult situation so that mums and dads know that their childcare centre would be open and providing care for them.We also immediately moved to create a dedicated information hotline and to ensure that up-to-date information was available on the pages of the mychild.gov.au website. I can inform the House that we have had 800 calls to the dedicated hotline - the number is 1802003 - and there have been 92,000 page views on the mychild.gov.au website.Since I last had the opportunity to speak to the House about these matters, regrettably another company with commercial links to ABC Learning, CFK Childcare Centres Ltd, has moved into voluntary administration, and a receiver has now also been appointed to that company. The receiver is Ferrier Hodgson, and my department is in close contact with them. CFK centres continue to operate, providing care as usual for the mums and dads who rely on CFK to provide that care. CFK, of course, is predominantly a New South Wales based company. CFK's receiver has not approached the Australian government for financial assistance - I stress that: it has not approached the Australian government for financial assistance - and I think it should be noted that obviously ABC Learning was in a unique situation given its size, its share of the market, its national coverage and the potential social and economic costs that would be created if many centres closed suddenly.Also, since the time I have had an opportunity to update the House in relation to these matters, people may have seen reported in the media that another company associated with ABC Learning - in this case, 123 Careers, a labour hire company - has also gone into voluntary administration.I want to stress to members of the House and members of the public generally that, whilst we have faced this situation with ABC Learning, and now with companies with commercial ties to ABC Learning, it is important to note that the childcare sector as a whole has been both stable and viable. That is, there are childcare centres around this country - some of them on a for-profit basis, some of them on a not-for-profit basis - that are perfectly stable, viable childcare centres that are here today and will be here in five or 10 years time providing care to children.Obviously our highest priority in relation to the ABC Learning situation continues to be to provide continuity of care for the children of mums and dads so that they know that child care is available for them. We will provide as much information as possible to mums and dads as soon as it is available and can be given to them. The government will continue work in that regard. We know the receiver is working very hard indeed. We have expert staff working alongside the receiver. Everybody's aim is to get further information to mums and dads as soon as possible.</DOC>

 - My response to the honourable member's question is that what I said was that current circumstances do not require any such course of action. I referred to the deterioration of the global economic environment and the fact that global leaders have a view of these circumstances which suggests that the situation is going to get worse rather than better.I also note a statement from the honourable member's old bank, Goldman Sachs, which says the government should:_ pick up the baton of stimulating economic growth in 2009. If conditions deteriorate the government should advocate the need for a deficit and build a catalyst for economic recovery. The combination of aggressive central bank easing and judicious fiscal stimulus will leave Australia better placed than its global peers in avoiding a deep and prolonged recession.I suppose, though, if you have already made your motza out of Goldman then you do not have to listen to what they say anymore. The key thing is this. I said clearly in my statement to the House just before that the current circumstances which prevail in Australia do not require any such course of action. I have simply reported to the House the consensus emerging from global leaders both at the Washington G20 meeting and at the APEC leaders meeting that the global economic conditions are deteriorating further. I reported further that a large number of economies - in fact, all of those of the G7, bar Canada - have entered into deficit financing. I have indicated that for the future Australia must remain vigilant and, I say this again, take whatever action is necessary to support growth and jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The OECD's Economic Outlook released overnight is sobering reading. It is a sobering assessment of very difficult global conditions. The OECD says:Many OECD economies are in, or are on the verge of, a protracted recession _The US, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, France, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong have all recorded at least one quarter of negative growth, and the OECD expects more countries will follow. All up, the OECD expects that 19 of the 30 OECD member countries will contract over the calendar year 2009. That is pretty sobering news to contemplate and, as the Prime Minister pointed out in his remarks before, there has been a marked change over the past month. The OECD does expect modest growth for the Australian economy, modest growth similar to that predicted three weeks ago in MYEFO. But as we said then, if global growth continues to deteriorate in the period ahead, we will see slower growth, and this of course is where the OECD report comes in again. The OECD has identified a further deterioration in the global economy, a further decline in our terms of trade and weaker growth in China as significant risks to growth in this country, and of course the OECD has joined the IMF in calling on governments to deploy all arms of policy, including fiscal policy, to strengthen growth.Of course, we on this side of the House understand the importance of fiscal policy, and that is why we put forward our Economic Security Strategy. Those on the other side of the House deny the enormity of the international financial crisis. The Leader of the Opposition said it has all been overhyped. Well, what the OECD has identified, what the IMF has identified and what all international organisations have identified is the need for very strong action when it comes to fiscal policy. This government has reacted with the Economic Security Strategy, and of course we now have fiscal policy and monetary policy working in tandem, unlike what occurred under the member for Higgins. He was out there spending like a drunken sailor, forcing the Reserve Bank to put interest rates up. That is what was going on. We on this side of the House understand that when conditions change, when global growth turns down, governments must act. This government is acting and will continue to act in a responsible way. Those opposite can stick their heads in the sand and deny the enormity of the global financial crisis, but we on this side of the House will act and act decisively.</DOC>

 - Did you write that yourself? -  - MYEFO forecast modest growth and modest surpluses. What we said at the time of MYEFO and what the Treasury observed in MYEFO was that all the risks were on the downside and that if global conditions did deteriorate further then that would have an impact in the future. Of course, things have changed again dramatically in the last few weeks, and that is what the Prime Minister has reported upon today. But those opposite cannot accept the enormity of the global financial crisis, do not understand its magnitude and therefore cannot be part of the solution. We had the Leader of the Opposition here before talking about the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which was on 15 September. Around that time he was saying the magnitude of the crisis was all hype. Now he accepts it. Do not listen to what he says; listen to what he does. He comes into the House and calls for bipartisanship, and then he opposes the Economic Security Strategy. - You have been opposing it. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition the other day opposed the payments for children. - You did so. -  - MYEFO showed that the global financial crisis has reduced government revenues over the forward estimates by about $40 billion, and of course events in the global economy since then will have had a further impact on those estimates. That is obvious to everybody in the House, and of course the outlook for trade and the outlook for commodity prices have both taken a turn for the worse again in recent weeks, so that will have an impact on the budget bottom line. There is no doubt about that. The point that the Prime Minister made is that we must take every action we possibly can to strengthen our economy in the face of these global events to protect jobs. This government will do everything it can responsibly do to strengthen our economy - as we have done through the Economic Security Strategy - and to have monetary policy supporting fiscal policy, and we will take further actions if necessary to support Australian jobs and Australian growth.</DOC>

 - I noticed that the question was greeted by scoffing from the member for North Sydney. I thought those opposite said that Work Choices was dead. It seems to be undergoing a slight case of resurrection on the part of certain members opposite, led courageously by the member for Bradfield. The member for Bradfield, the former Leader of the Opposition, is a principled man who stands by the principles to which he and his party have been historically committed, unlike those who have taken, it seems, a more opportunistic course of action in recent times. Furthermore, I notice that the Leader of the Opposition has voted on 12 occasions in support of extreme Howard government industrial relations laws, but that seems to have changed yesterday - or at least we think it has changed. I am still quite interested in the distinction between not supporting legislation on the one hand and not opposing it on the other. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition could give us a dictionary definition of the difference.For those opposite, I am sure the consideration of this in recent days has been a unifying factor in the joint party room, but again I commend the member for Bradfield for at least sticking by the principles for which that side of politics have stood for the better part of a decade and now pretend that they have walked away from. We know one fact for certain: when it comes to the interests of working families, given half a chance, Work Choices will be back, inflicted upon working families across Australia because that side stand for those principles on industrial relations, just as we on this side of the House stand opposed to those principles.The first thing I would do is to commend the work of the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. The Deputy Prime Minister has shepherded through an extensive consultation process with unions and with business leaders across Australia a very complex piece of legislation to produce a fair, balanced and flexible industrial relations system for the future. When you have both business and unions coming out in support of this piece of IR reform, I say you have it about right, and the House should record its thanks to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations for the excellent job that she has done.The bill establishes a stronger, enduring safety net through the National Employment Standards and modern awards for all Australian workers. Furthermore, the bill ensures that any workplace agreement must make all employees better off against the relevant award minimums. Furthermore, the bill also ensures that all employees, including in the three million workplaces with fewer than 100 employees, are protected from unfair dismissal. The safety net that we are building also protects employees' entitlement to redundancy pay in the very difficult experience of losing their job. The Fair Work Bill also underpins ongoing business investment. It is a much simpler piece of legislation than Work Choices. Work Choices delivered, as the member for North Sydney will well remember, 600 pages of legislation. - We have 600 pages against their 1,500-page Work Choices legislation. If you want to make the difference between 1,500 pages on the one hand and 600 on the other, I would say that most people could understand the difference. Small businesses will have the confidence to employ new staff with the balanced fair dismissal laws and, by encouraging productivity based enterprise bargaining, the fair work legislation will over time foster both productivity growth and wages growth, to the benefit of both employers and employees and to the long-run benefit of economic growth and job creation.Beyond the detail of the legislation, what this is about is a question of principle. For a long time, we on this side of politics have stood for fairness in the workplace. For a long time - a very long time - those opposite have stood for a set of industrial relations laws which would rip away basic conditions from working families. That is why, when they got half a chance with control of the Senate, they did it; they ripped those conditions away. Each one of those sitting opposite who were in the parliament at the time stood up here and voted for the passage of Work Choices. The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth, did exactly the same, and now he pretends he does not believe in those principles. As the Treasurer said before, with the member for Wentworth, the Leader of the Opposition, watch not what he says but what he does. What he did on 12 occasions was to vote for this extreme industrial relations legislation. What he said yesterday is that he will not do it again, and I think the people of Australia would understand the difference between those two sets of principles. The difference is clear on this, and working families across Australia know this very well. At last we have the prospect of fairness and balance in the workplaces of Australia, which gets the balance right between working families and workers, and their employers on the one hand against the Work Choices regime that it has replaced. But, if those opposite ever chance to be back on this side of the House and in government again, we know for certain, given the debate that goes on internally, that this political posturing which they have engaged in, which says that they will not bring in Work Choices again, is purely that - political posturing. Any return to the treasury bench would guarantee a return of Work Choices, however they may posture on the way through.I would say to the House, and through the House to the nation at large: working families under the legislation which has been introduced by the Deputy Prime Minister will have a fair and balanced set of laws for the first time in a long, long time. The only way to ensure that those laws are properly passed is for them to gain speedy passage through the Senate and for those opposite not to engage in the normal double-timing tactics that they have engaged in in the past, pretending to be supporters one day but in their heart of hearts resolving to oppose it when next they get the chance to do so.</DOC>

 - Firstly, I would remind the honourable member for North Sydney that this government replaced the highest taxing government in Australia's history. I would remind the honourable member for North Sydney that tax as a proportion of GDP has been reduced as a consequence of the first budget introduced by the honourable the Treasurer. And I would remind the honourable member for North Sydney that when it comes to high taxing governments those opposite have rendered a gold medal performance.The second point I would make to the honourable member for North Sydney is this: the current circumstances which pertain in this economy do not require the course of action to which he has just referred. What I would say to the honourable member for North Sydney is that every responsible government in the world is currently looking at the real challenge of what you do if this global financial crisis deteriorates further through the real economy and jobs. The prescription being put forward by those opposite is: do nothing. The prescription being put forward by those opposite is: if people join the ranks of the unemployed, do nothing to stimulate the economy. The prescription of those opposite is not to invest in infrastructure - in fact, a course of action for which they have an ample historical track record. The prescription being put forward by those opposite is that the global financial crisis through the global economy drives down Australian economic growth. The course of action that you recommend is to do nothing. The course of action recommended by this side of politics is to take whatever action is necessary to continue to support positive economic growth and to support jobs in this economy. This government has so resolved to do. I would suggest that those opposite get with the project to support the interests of working families, as this financial crisis threatens their future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hasluck for her question, for her work assisting me with the production of the Fair Work Bill 2008 and for her abiding interest in women's employment and pay equity. Of course, she would know that there were no group of workers who suffered more in this country under Work Choices than women workers, and the statistics clearly showed that. Yesterday it was my pleasure to introduce into this parliament the Fair Work Bill, which guarantees for Australian workers - each and every one of them - a safety net that cannot be stripped away, national employment standards they can always rely on and, for employees who earn $100,000 or less a year, simple, modern awards that they can rely on. Compared with Work Choices, this is a safety net that will always be with them, because there are no individual statutory employment agreements, no Australian workplace agreements, which allow the safety net to be stripped away. Of course, it was Work Choices AWAs that did so much damage, costing people their penalty rates and their overtime without a cent of compensation.Shortly after I introduced the bill into the parliament, the Leader of the Opposition went out and said, 'Work Choices is dead.' I thought to myself, 'Gee; that's a really familiar form of words; I've heard that before.' I know there is a sort of a fever of plagiarism over there on the Liberal Party benches, so I thought I would check that Work Choices is dead. Of course, it was the then Leader of the Opposition who, on 19 December 2007, first used those words. He first said, 'Work Choices is dead.' Let us just remind ourselves what has happened since Work Choices was dead, according to the Liberal Party. We know that the person who is now the Liberal Defence spokesperson went out and said, 'We are prepared to die in a ditch over individual statutory employment agreements.' That happened since the then Leader of the Opposition said, 'Work Choices is dead.' Then, of course, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the then spokesperson for workplace relations in this parliament, in the course of dealing with the transition bill, defended individual statutory employment agreements. If that was not enough, every member of the Liberal Party came in here and voted against a government motion that said individual statutory employment agreements could not be part of a fair system - that is, they voted in defence of individual statutory employment agreements. Then, as recently as September this year, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party told an audience in Melbourne that statutory individual contracts must form part of a modern workplace. All of this has happened since the first time a Leader of the Opposition for the Liberal Party said, 'Work Choices is dead.'What has happened since this current Leader of the Liberal Party has said that Work Choices is dead? Well, we know that they spent yesterday brawling in their party room over support for Work Choices. Helpfully aided by the Australian newspaper, we know that the former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Bradfield, is out there defending individual statutory employment agreements, the thing that was at the heart of Work Choices - and he is nodding his head to verify that that is right; he is defending individual statutory employment agreements. And he is not alone. He is aided by the member for Mackellar. He is aided by the member for Menzies, who of course was the minister who was involved - and he is nodding too, another Work Choices supporter right there on the bench. He is aided by Alby Schultz - yes, Alby is giving the thumbs up to Work Choices; there he goes. And of course there are a group of senators who I cannot, in this chamber, call on to indicate their support for Work Choices but they did in the party room. So do not watch what the Leader of the Opposition says; watch what he does. Called on to vote for Work Choices, he voted for it a dozen times in this parliament. He now leads a political party full of Work Choices supporters who think that, just for the moment, it would be better if they pretended they were not. But this is pretence, and we know it. We know that if the Liberal Party were ever the government again in this country it would be back to Work Choices, back to AWAs and back to the rip-offs, because that is what they believe in and they always will.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question as it goes to the question of responsible economic management. Responsible economic management is about how we support this economy and jobs and families during the greatest financial crisis that we have seen in three-quarters of a century. That is the practical question on people's minds right across our nation today. What can government do to fill the gap which is left by private companies currently in retreat? What has happened with the unfolding of this crisis is as follows: the global financial crisis going through stock markets, going through property markets, going through credit markets, hitting the real economy and, as a consequence, hitting businesses and their ability to provide employment opportunities and therefore hitting jobs and, through that, hitting families. Responsible economic management says families are facing increasing difficulties for the future. Responsible economic management lies in a $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy: a security strategy which makes one-off payments to pensioners; a security strategy which makes one-off payments to families; a security strategy which says to first home buyers, 'Here's some help on the way through to help you get your first home,' as well as providing support for the construction industry in the residential sector which is under such duress at present. That is what responsible economic management is about.Responsible economic management is also about taking that $10.4 billion, equivalent to one per cent of GDP, and injecting that into the economy as quickly as you can - going hard, going households, going early - in order to ensure that we can try and fill the gap when it comes to growth and activity in the economy. Can I say to those opposite who find the Economic Security Strategy amusing that if you sucked out one per cent of economic activity from the economy right now, the consequences for jobs would be devastating. And let me say this to the member for Curtin: when it comes to the future, responsible economic management means putting an absolute premium on anything governments can do to support jobs into the future. If you read the OECD report on the impact of unemployment across the developed economies in the period ahead, the further revision down of growth, projecting - I believe, from my reading of the report - significant negative growth across those OECD economies across the year 2009, the impact on employment is something like eight million people losing their jobs. That is the impact which has registered. So the strategy which is available to any government and any legislature across the OECD is this: to stand back and let it all happen, let the damage be inflicted upon households, families, individuals trying to hold onto a job or to get their first job, or to do something about it. Our approach is to do something about it. - I would suggest to those opposite that they reflect long and hard about the course of action which they are currently advocating which is, in effect, to do nothing. And I would suggest to the member for Higgins that he could have begun this process some time ago, taking the advice from Access Economics, by investing in the nation's infrastructure in the past, because now we are confronted with a double challenge. We have to overcome the infrastructure deficit left by those opposite over a 10-year period when the member for Higgins was rolling in the cash, as it came in the door off the back of the resources boom, but not investing a single dollar in the nation's infrastructure. What we must do now as a responsible government is this: invest in the nation's infrastructure - in our ports, in our roads, in our urban transit systems, in our rail, in our high-speed broadband, in our hospitals, in our schools, in our universities, in our TAFE colleges; support investment in the nation's infrastructure and, through doing that, support growth and jobs and help families on the way through. That is a strategy for responsible economic management. And I suggest to those opposite they get with the project.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for her question on this important topic in which I am sure all members of the House are interested. Can I inform members of the House that this afternoon the receiver of ABC Learning Ltd, Mr Chris Honey, of McGrathNicol, wrote to ABC parents and staff confirming that a majority of the group's childcare centres will continue operating in 2009. This is obviously a welcome development for thousands of parents and ABC Learning staff who have been waiting for news.In a statement made to the media just a short time ago the receiver has identified that 656 ABC Learning centres will continue to be open and trade as normal in 2009. This represents almost two-thirds of all ABC centres, which provide care for around 80,000 Australian children, or more than 70 per cent of children in ABC Learning centres. The receiver says he sees a positive future for ABC Learning, and I am sure that news is a relief to parents and to staff - particularly those employed in these centres.It is a big step forward that the receiver has been able to provide certainty for so many parents and employees less than a month after ABC Learning went into receivership. The receiver has said that this afternoon a full list of ABC Learning centres and their status will be available on ABC Learning's website, which is www.childcare.com.au. When posted the list will also be accessible from the Australian government's website, which is www.mychild.gov.au. That is the website that we have been using to inform people of ABC Learning developments, each and every step of the way. So parents and employees who have used it can go back to the website to find these further details.The Rudd government understands how important it is for families and ABC Learning employees to be kept informed of developments in these uncertain times. That is why we will continue to be as open as possible about the information regarding this situation. Can I confirm that our childcare industry taskforce has been there every step of the way, working through this complex process, and will continue to work closely with the receiver to ensure continuity of care at ABC Learning centres. Can I also say that ABC Learning's receiver McGrathNicol has notified that 656 will remain open in 2009 and of the other centres he expects a proportion will also stay open. But the receiver needs more time to examine the centres in detail so that a correct decision can be made on their future.The receiver has written to parents and staff at those centres to emphasise that this does not mean that their centre will necessarily be closed. It simply means that more time is needed to look at possible improvement initiatives at these centres. The government and the receiver are conscious that for staff and parents using those centres this will cause a further period of uncertainty. Can I say to those staff and the parents who use those centres that the receiver has indicated that he expects to make a further announcement in respect of these centres in a week's time. This will mean that in a week's time parents at all ABC Learning centres will know what is happening in 2009, and people who use 656 of the centres will have the assurance today that their centre is going to continue.I reaffirm that for all centres the government's arrangement with the receiver continues to be in place, and all centres will remain open until 31 December this year.</DOC>

 - For the benefit of the member for North Sydney I return to an answer I gave to an earlier question from him, which is how tax as a proportion of GDP changed between the member for Higgins's last budget and the first budget for the member for Lilley, the current Treasurer. The answer is this: tax as a proportion of GDP went down under this Labor government. Can I say something? We are proud of that fact. We are proud of that fact because it provided greater incentive out there in the economy. On top of that I would say that the government also, consistent with its pre-election commitments, has gone about implementing a $44 billion tax reduction program across the forward estimates.As a consequence of that the first tranche has been delivered in the budget in May. The second tranche will occur on 1 July next year. That is a responsible course of action because it actually adds to the overall ability of working families to deal with the challenges which lie ahead. I would also draw the honourable member of North Sydney's attention to this, as he is so interested - at least temporarily - in tax matters. For the first time in the history of the federation, we are introducing an education tax refund, which will enable working families to claim, at the end of this financial year - as of 1 July next - an amount back for primary and secondary school kids for their basic education outlays. That is what I call acting on tax reform - helping working families to deal with the cost of education and helping the family pay packet through introducing stage 1 of a $44 billion tax reduction strategy. On top of that we are providing additional assistance to families and to pensioners through the $10.4 billion, one per cent of GDP, Economic Security Strategy released only last month. That, I would say to the honourable member for North Sydney, is properly supporting working families under the current circumstances. That is what I call acting responsibly in terms of the tax inheritance we received from those opposite - quite apart from the spending frolic in which they were engaged, which this government had to engage in, through its own expenditure review process, upon taking office.The member for Higgins smiles benignly as if all was well with the state of Denmark, forgetting the fact that tax as a proportion of GDP reached the highest level in the history of the federation under his stewardship. Investment in national infrastructure reached the lowest level in the history of the federation. Two great report cards for the member for Higgins; two great report cards for the Liberal government! This government is getting on with the business of providing support for working families and will continue to do so into the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and for her concern in relation to the events in Bangkok. Anti-government protests in Bangkok have disrupted flights in and out of Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi airport. As at 11.45 today, the international airport was closed by Airports of Thailand. The duration of the closure is not known at this stage. There have also been demonstrations at the Don Muang domestic airport. Some Australians, including those in transit, have been affected by flight disruptions. The Australian embassy is maintaining close contact with local authorities, and consular officers have been stationed in Bangkok International Airport to assist Australians and liaise with the airlines.The travel advice for Thailand was reissued this morning and continues to advise Australians to exercise a high degree of caution because of the uncertain political situation and the ongoing political unrest. Australians are advised to avoid demonstrations, to avoid political rallies and concentrations of military personnel and to continue to regularly monitor local media and travel advice. The situation in Thailand, and in particular at Bangkok International Airport, is being continually monitored by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Any changes in the situation or increased threat to Australians in Thailand will be reflected in the travel advice. Australians in Thailand or planning to travel to Thailand should remain in close contact with their airlines and travel providers, follow any instructions issued by local authorities and monitor DFAT's travel advice at www.smartraveller.gov.au for any updates. Australians in Thailand who require consular assistance can contact DFAT's 24-hour consular emergency centre on (61)(2)62613305. Here is another number for you: any family in Australia with serious concerns may call 1300555135.

 - I thank the member for his question. I think the member would be aware that a global financial crisis has occurred and it is having, as the Prime Minister outlined comprehensively in his statement to the House, implications for economies all around the world, including implications for our own economy. As a result of the fact that this nation is not immune, when we published the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook we did publish a new prediction for unemployment. I know that the OECD prediction that the member points to is slightly higher, though I would ask him to note that it is for the calendar year and not for the financial year. So it is a prediction made on a slightly different basis.In the face of the global financial crisis and its implications for the Australian economy, this government's first and foremost priority has been to protect the jobs of working Australians. That is why we acted decisively with the economic security statement - to stimulate the economy, to make sure that we were doing what we could to be in front of the curve, keeping the economy moving and growing. The estimates of the jobs impact of that fiscal stimulus is around 75,000. In that package, we committed to 56,000 new productivity places - new training places for jobs. This was against a backdrop where our new training places for jobs had been oversubscribed because there were so many Australians who wanted access to those training places. So we invested in 56,000 more. That was coming off the Liberal government's track record of failure to invest in training, leaving this nation with a skills crisis and leaving us underprepared to meet the needs of the future, including the training of Australians.The member may be aware that the government has moved the employment services model so that it will be a more responsive model that will provide people with services when they need that assistance. As the Prime Minister outlined in his statement today, our foremost priorities are protecting jobs and keeping our economy growing. That is what the Prime Minister's statement was about. That is what we are aiming to do. That is why we are investing in places such as our productivity places to assist those Australians who need that assistance. I would also say to the member that he ought to be aware that those productivity places are aimed at giving people the skills that they need to get into those sections of the labour market where employers are still crying out for skilled labour. It is consequently a very important assistance for those Australians.</DOC>

 - Indeed, last week's Australian Council of Local Government meeting has been well received by local government, including by ALGA, Council of Capital City Lord Mayors, Local Government Managers Association and local mayors around the nation, who came to Canberra for what was an extremely successful dawn of a new partnership between the Commonwealth and local government. Regional mayors welcomed the event. Sandra McCarthy, the Kiama mayor, told the Illawarra Mercury:For the first time I feel we are a genuine part of the overall demographic of government in Australia and it's long overdue.The opposition did what it usually does: it came out and welcomed the event and the funding, and then it went to work undermining it; then it went to work walking both sides of the street.Perhaps the best example of that was the member for Cook, one of their shadow ministers for local government - they have two - saying that the community of Wollongong, because they are under administration, should not have received any local government funding. He argued that the ratepayers of Wollongong should be punished for the actions of some rogue councillors from Wollongong. The good people of Wollongong did not react kindly to that. The paper ran an article headed 'Shadow minister for silly statements' and the subheading said:Â Scott Morrison says he's appalled at a $2.15 million grant for Wollongong council. (Yeah, we've never heard of him either)But it was not just the full page splash - there was more. The Illawarra Mercury had a bit to say about it in their editorial on behalf of the people of Illawarra. They said:The corrupt actions of one of our developers and some councillors were enough to bring a slur on the _ good name of Wollongong - we didn't need a numskull .. MP to compound the situation _ -  - Some objections to the administration of the Wollongong council have been raised in interjections from those opposite. It pays to have a sense of history and a bit of memory going back more than a day; more than 24 hours. The night before the Australian Council of Local Government meeting, we had the National Local Government Awards, at which were presented awards to local government for best practice during the last year. - In fact, DAs at Wollongong were rewarded - by the previous government. The then Minister for Local Government, Jim Lloyd, issued a press release on 23 July 2007. The award from the Howard government for asset management for foreshore development went to Wollongong council. So it pays to have a bit of memory. But the member for Cook did not remember that and nor did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when they opposed the good people of Wollongong receiving any funding for local capital works.It gets even worse, because you do not have to go back a year; you can go back a month. There is another council in New South Wales that is under administration: the Port Macquarie Shire Council. We know about Port Macquarie because there has been a bit of focus on it. We had a by-election just a month ago which returned an outstanding representative in Rob Oakeshott to this parliament. They did not object to Port Macquarie council getting funding of over a million dollars as part of the $300 million Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. I wonder why? I wonder why they are having a go at Wollongong even though last year it was the award-winning council from throughout the nation but for Port Macquarie they are hands off? How inconsistent are they? I thought back. I visited the electorate of Lyne during that by-election and I remember that the mayor who was dismissed for corruption, Rob Drew, was the National Party candidate just one month ago. - The fact is that Port Macquarie council was dismissed and is in administration. Because of its maladministration it was dismissed. The opposition are very sensitive about these issues. They are very quick to go out there and say that the people of Wollongong should not receive any funding on that basis, which is what the member did.A Member's conduct shall be considered disorderly if the Member has _(b) used objectionable words _To accuse someone of corruption when there is no substantive case against them is surely objectionable to the Speaker and I would ask you to ask the minister to withdraw it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It is a very important question. It is the case that the Indonesians have approached a number of international organisations, including the World Bank, and also have approached the Australian government for some assistance at a time which is very testing for many emerging economies. This is part of what we have been talking about in this parliament over the last month or so - the spread of the global financial crisis around the world from developed countries to developing countries. As has been the case in the past - I think back in 1998 - the Indonesians have sought some assistance from Australia in conjunction with multilateral organisations. That request is currently before the Australian government. It is receiving our thorough consideration, and if a decision is taken it will be reported in a transparent way to the Australian parliament.</DOC>

Seventeen-year-old Sam, Ballarat region's Young Citizen of the Year, is here at Parliament House for the Young Carers Forum. Sam is completing year 11, working part-time, looking after his mum, who has MS, and supporting his two younger brothers - I think, as every single member of this House would say, a truly remarkable young man.Honourable members - Hear, hear! - There are 32 young carers who have come to Canberra today - and will be here tomorrow - and some of them are up in the gallery and we welcome them here. They have come to the 'Bring It!' 2008 forum. There are four from each state and territory and there are young people from the country and from our cities.There are 170,000 young carers under the age of 17 around Australia - thousands of young people growing up with at least two jobs: going to school, sometimes working as well and being carers. This forum that they are participating in is helping to shape the policy of the future, to make sure that all of us provide better support to young carers. This year, the government has provided $7.6 million to the Young Carers Respite and Information Services Program, and today I announced an extra $15.7 million for a further two years.In my meeting with some of the young carers earlier today, I was told by them how this program really gives them somebody to talk to, someone to call at a time of crisis when they need advice or sometimes just when they need somebody to talk to. It certainly helps them stay at school or at university while also balancing their caring responsibilities, which are so important to their families. The young carers I met today also emphasised the need to identify carers, to make sure that those youngsters that do not even know they are carers get to understand that they have these responsibilities and that there are many supports out there available to them.As well as the challenge of staying at school or university, we know that it can be very tough to make ends meet. That is why the government will be paying all recipients of carer payment a lump-sum payment from 8 December of $1,400 for each single carer. Those young carers who are receiving the carer allowance will also receive an extra $1,000 for each eligible person in their care. I am sure that every single member of the House is delighted that these young carers could come to Canberra. We all congratulate them for the outstanding work that they do.Honourable members - Hear, hear!</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. There was a similar question yesterday and it is the case that there is a substantial issue to do with car financing and that is an issue which predates the bank guarantee and the guarantee for wholesale funding. Indeed, one of the major providers of finance announced they were pulling out well before the bank guarantee was put in place, so we should have very clearly in our mind that there are many areas out there in the finance sector, whether it is car finance, whether it is mortgage trusts or whether it is cash management trusts, that are all impacted upon by the global financial crisis and the impact on the cost of borrowing.What the government has been doing in this case, when it comes to car finance through David Murray and the Treasury, is working very closely with financial institutions and industry to see whether we can get an arrangement in place which provides finance from institutions which are liquid. Those are discussions which are happening at this moment. I cannot predict the outcome of those discussions, but we understand the importance of the car industry and the importance of car finance, and the government is doing everything it possibly can, working with the private sector and working with the industry to get a positive result. That is an ongoing process and I will report back to the House on that process at a later stage.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. He is a member who not only understands the nature of his regional seat but also understands the importance of the tourism industry to tropical North Queensland. As we appreciate, the seat of Leichhardt is one of Australia's iconic tourism destinations. It has the Great Barrier Reef and the wet tropical rainforests. Tourism is exceptionally important to the economy of Northern Queensland, representing in the year to June 2008 more than $2 billion spent by visitors to the region. This spend is exceptionally important not only to the tourism industry generally but especially to small- and medium-sized operators.It is for that reason that the government in association with the Queensland government was concerned about the decision for commercial reasons by Qantas to cut its services from Japan to Cairns, a traditionally important market to tropical North Queensland,. That represented a major blow to the tourism industry in tropical North Queensland. It effectively represented the withdrawal of many thousands of seats for an industry that has historically relied on the Japanese market for prosperity. For those reasons, the Australian government allocated a transition package of $4 million in association with financial support from the Queensland government to try and assist the transition from tropical North Queensland's heavy historical reliance on Japan to not only look at new opportunities out of Japan but also look at markets which should be part of its future.I am also pleased to say that Tourism Australia is able to redirect an additional $2 million to assist in advertising in Japan to try and assist Cairns through this period of transition. To date we have been able to allocate $640,000 as a first tranche to assist with charters. That has translated into 6Â½ thousand seats, which will come during the next couple of months following the cuts of December with respect to Qantas's traditional servicing of Cairns. I am also pleased to say that last Friday I was able to announce an additional amount of $1.25 million, an amount well received by the industry in tropical North Queensland for the purposes of further consumer support and trade marketing in Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, New Zealand and southern China. - I note that the member for Moncrieff is questioning the government's commitment to assist these small- and medium-sized operators. I simply say that the shadow minister for tourism has clearly shown to the tourism industry in recent times that so far as he is concerned as the shadow minister for tourism there is no care or responsibility for the future prosperity of the tourism industry during this very difficult period.I am also pleased to say that we are trying to assist the industry to make the transition into future market opportunities rather than maintaining an ongoing reliance on Japan. That is about the industry having a serious look at new markets such as India and China, and also trying to assist them in having a look at the quality of the product and the need for accreditation to lift standards to guarantee that they can compete in a tough global community.I say in conclusion to the Australian community at large that the tourism industry at the moment is doing it exceptionally tough. The global financial crisis is not only having an impact on tropical North Queensland; it is also having a serious impact on the tourism industry Australia wide, as the member for North Sydney appreciates as the former minister for tourism. I therefore remind Australians at large that, with the holiday season fast approaching and the Australian government's economic security package kicking in on 8 December, we as a community, if we are going to have a holiday, should seriously think about having a holiday here at home.In that context I also remind Australian employers that it is their responsibility to actually assist in managing their workforce. I do not think it is acceptable that Australian workers presently have 129 million days of accrued leave, representing an estimated wage value of $29 billion. Tourism Australia is currently working with the business sector to try and encourage employers to support workers to actually take their accumulated annual leave and long service leave, to have a break here at home in Australia and assist all those hard-working small and medium sized tourism operators to survive the impact of the global financial crisis.</DOC>

 - The member for Ryan, of course, has extensive familiarity with various countries in the region, particularly in and around Hong Kong, but we will leave that to one side given the notorious history of his branch structure in Brisbane. Going on to the broader question of the future of the region, I say as follows -  - In fact, it was both Hong Kong and Taiwan that I should have referred to in the earlier answer. The Asia-Pacific Community is a proposal of the Australian government which looks at the question of where we want to be in 2020 in the Asia-Pacific region. It simply asks this: do we want to shape our region's future or simply respond to events; do we want to repeat in this region the mistakes made by Europe in an earlier century; do we want to allow conflicts to arise or do we want to form the structures necessary which will support cooperation and the habits of cooperation to bring about a common sense of security in the period ahead?When I launched this proposal in an address to the Asia Society earlier this year, I said that there would be a long process of discussion with the region. We have dispatched Dick Woolcott, an eminent Australian diplomat of great standing and who is, I believe, respected by both sides of the parliament - I would have hoped by the member for Ryan as well - to various capitals across the region to solicit their views on how such an Asia-Pacific Community could be shaped into the future. That process of consultation continues. Furthermore, it has been the subject of considerable discussion between myself and various heads of government, both in capitals and most recently in Lima at the APEC summit.The bottom line is this: either you can be reactive in your foreign policy, as those opposite have been for so long, or you can have an activist approach which says, 'Here is the region we would like to see in 2020; here are the building blocks to get there; here is how we preserve peace into the future; here is how we preserve stability in the future; here is how we actually support economic growth into the future; and here are some structures and suggestions about how that might be done.' Similarly, this government has done the same on the question of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation: either you can stand back and allow the forces that have been at work for some time to simply have their play and have no results produced or you can put your best foot forward and have a go. We have done that with a joint commission, chaired by ourselves and the Japanese, which is currently co-chaired by a former foreign minister of Australia, Gareth Evans, and a former foreign minister of Japan. That work will have its report by the time we get to the NPT review conference next year.I simply make the point: you can either play a passive-reactive game in terms of Australia's voice in the world or engage in an activist foreign policy which seeks to shape our region and the global order to maximise not only the interests of Australia but also the interests of peace and security in the 21st century. That is what we are on about when it comes to foreign policy and we are proud of it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I know that as a health professional and as a young woman that she has been particularly interested in our campaign to tackle binge drinking. I would like to announce to the House and draw their attention to the fact that our new binge drinking campaign was launched last Friday in Melbourne with a team of paramedics who pick up the pieces and consequences of binge drinking every day of their working lives. The campaign is called Don't Turn a Night Out Into a Nightmare. As was promised by the Prime Minister when this was announced, the campaign is hard-hitting and in your face. We have had a number of young women contact us to say that it is a very confronting campaign, and we make no apologies for that. When we are dealing with young people, many of whom think they are bulletproof, we do need to take this very strong tactic to tackle this problem.If there is anybody in the House who still doubts the importance of tackling binge drinking - I know that some opposite have had their doubts - I invite them to consider some of the images that have been on our televisions in the past few days as schoolies week is occurring across the country, or perhaps they might contemplate the figures that are being used in the campaign. Four Australians under 25 die due to alcohol related injuries in an average week. That is four young people we are losing every week. On average, one in four hospitalisations of people aged 15 to 24 happen because of alcohol and 70 Australians under 25 will be hospitalised due to alcohol caused assault every week. These terrible figures translate into harm and enormous hurt, and for some the grief and pain that they cause will last a lifetime. It is our dedicated police, doctors and ambulance workers who see the worst of it day in and day out and I think that we should acknowledge and thank them for the work that they are doing.This campaign does not tell people not to drink. It does not tell them not to have a good time. It tells them to take care. It tells them to have a good time in moderation and not to turn their night out into a nightmare. We hope that it will have some impact and that everyone in this House can support it.</DOC>

 - As I indicated to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday following my return from both the G20 summit in Washington and the APEC summit in Lima, the conversations with heads of government at both those meetings indicated that the situation in their respective economies was dire and becoming direr. Furthermore, the data released during the course of the month of November revealed a further significant deterioration in the overall state of the global economy. Therefore, I reiterate what I said to the House yesterday. In the current circumstances it is not necessary for the government to contemplate that course of action. However, if the global financial crisis gets worse and puts the Australian economy more at risk, the government will take decisive action in the national interest including a temporary deficit to stimulate the economy, build infrastructure and support jobs and families. That is the responsible course of action for the future, should it become necessary.The alternative is to sit around and simply allow jobs to be sacrificed as the global financial crisis unfolds. I would say to the House: our policy on this is clear. We have engaged in a process of fiscal stimulus, beginning with the Economic Stimulus Strategy of October releasing $10.4 billion, some one per cent of GDP. Secondly, we have added to that with further statements designed to provide support for aspects of the Australian economy, including a long-term plan to support the automobile industry in this country to the tune of $6.2 billion. Thirdly, we have indicated our support also for early local government activity in spending and investing in local government areas through the $300 million grant program which was announced by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government at the first meeting of the Australian Council of Local Government here in Canberra last week. The government remains prepared to take whatever further action is necessary to support growth, to support jobs and to support families.That is our policy and it is clear: to support the economy, to support growth and to support jobs through the mechanisms I have just outlined and those which we stand ready to take into the future. The question which the House would like to have an answer to is: what is the alternative strategy? I have yet to hear any detail on that whatsoever.</DOC>

 - We have in this parliament and, more broadly, in the nation been discussing the impact of the global financial crisis on jobs, on growth and on families. We have indicated in my answer to the Leader of the Opposition's earlier question one of the measures we have taken so far in the Economic Security Strategy, which was an economic stimulus package of some $10.4 billion, equivalent to about one per cent of GDP. As a rule of thumb, a $10 billion injection by government in the economy is capable of generating up to 75,000 jobs. That is one of the reasons why we have provided that injection now, and the reason we are doing it now is that the unemployment data across the developed and developing economies around the world is becoming gloomier and gloomier.A second core element is the figure that I outlined in my statement to the parliament yesterday on the global financial crisis, and that is that we are prepared to put to the states a proposal of some $11 billion or more in terms of the reform proposals contained in the areas of health, education and elsewhere for the long-term better working of the federation. The employment stimulus of that is also of significance because, if you combine that with the other actions that we have taken, these again represent concrete, direct investments by government in the real economy to support jobs growth at a time when the global financial crisis, the global economic crisis, is turning on us.As I have outlined in earlier remarks, it is important that, in addition to providing stimulus to the economy now, stimulus to growth now and stimulus to jobs now, the government continue to prosecute our long-term economic reform agenda and our broader agenda of reform of the federation. First and foremost, that hinges on what we do with long-term productivity growth. Long-term productivity growth is built on the basis of investing in education, skills and training, investing in infrastructure and ensuring that we have got the best possible settings when it comes to business regulation in the future - and in fact we are taking as much of the regulatory burden off business as possible. This long-term reform agenda will continue to be prosecuted in the proposals we put to the states, most particularly on education but also on business deregulation, in the days which lie ahead. That is because we believe that we have to get on with the business of long-term reform, to make sure that we are building long-term economic growth.At the same time, the government is also prepared to advance the whole area of reforming the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states in health and hospitals. There has been a gross and grave history of underinvestment by the Commonwealth in the public hospital infrastructure of Australia, and that is what this government in its first 12 months in office has sought to get down to and tackle in detail with the states and territories in the negotiations leading up to the Council of Australian Governments meeting which is scheduled to be held on Saturday. Therefore, these long-term reform agendas - aimed at upskilling the Australian workforce for the long term, aimed at investing in our nation's infrastructure for the long term, aimed at taking the regulators off small business's back for the long term - are important agendas which we intend to prosecute with the states and territories to advance the long-term economic interests of Australia and, furthermore, to prosecute reform across the wider fabric of the federation to deal with health and hospitals as well.So, as the Council of Australian Governments gathers in Canberra on Saturday, what will be close to the government's heart and mind is this: (1) what we do in terms of providing further stimulus to the economy and jobs growth through the investment we are proposing, (2) continuing to prosecute the education revolution which underpins so importantly long-term productivity growth for the Australian economy and (3) actually tackling the substantial underinvestment in public hospitals and health that we saw over such a long period of time while those opposite occupied the treasury bench.The government, therefore, in its strategy seeks to deal with the immediate challenges presented to us by the global financial crisis by investing in and stimulating the economy, growth and jobs and at the same time, through those investments, prosecuting our long-term agenda of reform. For Australia this represents not just a strategy which deals with the immediate problems which confront us but also, critically, a strategy for the long term. We are on about the business of reforming the federation, we are on about the business of ending the blame game and we are on about the business of using the instruments of policy available to us to invest in long-term jobs growth and support for families in Australia. To those opposite: this is a necessary course of action and I would suggest, as I respectfully suggested yesterday, that they might join the national project on this rather than simply engage in the rank political opportunism for which they have become so renowned.</DOC>

 - When it comes to the challenges presented by the global financial crisis, you have got to ask yourself two or three basic questions: (1) what can the private econ-omy do in the current environment, (2) what can be done through monetary policy and (3) what can be done through fiscal policy? If we go to the private economy first - what is happening in terms of the global credit crunch and the credit rationing we see across the global financial community flowing through the real economy - the answer is that the year ahead is going to be very difficult and very tough indeed, which therefore leads us to the conclusion reached by heads of government representing 20 large economies from around the world in Washington, reinforced by those of 21 other economies meeting in Lima at the APEC summit, which is that governments must act through fiscal policy and monetary policy to bring about appropriate support for growth and jobs in the critical year that lies ahead.Secondly, when it comes to monetary policy, right around the world at the moment there are differing degrees to which monetary policy can be activated. Some economies currently are running interest rates at around one per cent; therefore, the capacity for monetary policy to bring about real increases in economic activity is not great. What the honourable member for Wentworth fails to draw attention to is that we have already had 200 basis points worth of reductions in interest rates, noting carefully that the Leader of the Opposition said not all that long ago that a 25 basis point reduction actually did not add up to much at all. Do we all remember that? The honourable member who asked the question about interest rates said quite recently 'a 25 basis point addition to interest rates is not worth much at all'. So at that stage he seemed to place not much significance at all on shifts in interest rate policy and monetary policy. I would suggest to those opposite that having endured so many interest rate rises in a row while they occupied the treasury bench - 10 interest rate rises in a row - the fact that in the last several months we have had a 200 basis points reduction in interest rates should be of some consequence -  - and concern for the conclusions of the Leader of the Opposition. Thirdly, on fiscal policy, I would draw the Leader of the Opposition's attention to, most recently, a statement by the Governor of the Reserve Bank -  - who indicated that appropriate fiscal policy stimulus in worthwhile projects was entirely appropriate under these circumstances. What we need is fiscal policy and monetary policy working in the same direction to stimulate the economy, support jobs and support growth. It is important that the Leader of the Opposition gets with the national project on this. Our strategy is very clear. - If the financial crisis gets worse and puts the Australian economy more at risk then the government will take decisive action in the national interest, including, if necessary, a temporary deficit to stimulate the economy, to build infrastructure and to support jobs and families. That is our policy. It is clear cut. We have demonstrated that policy through the stimulus packages we have foreshadowed and those that we have already implemented.Again I go back to the basic differential: our policy is clear; what is the opposition's policy? All I have heard from those opposite is one essay after another in rank political opportunism. The Leader of the Opposition every day seems to change his tune - whether it is on the fuel excise, Work Choices or the Economic Security Strategy. On one policy instrument after another he says one thing and does another. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that at times like these the nation requires strong economic leadership. They are getting it from this government. I suggest the Leader of the Opposition get with the national project.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. It becomes readily apparent day after day in this House that the opposition do not think that the government should act at all to deal with the global financial crisis. They think that nothing should be done to protect jobs, to protect families and to protect households. They think nothing should be done. This government will act, and it will act in a coordinated way and it will act with international governments that absolutely understand the need to act.The Leader of the Opposition was asking before about forecasts from the IMF and other organisations. This is what the OECD said this week:Against the backdrop of a deep economic downturn, additional macroeconomic stimulus is needed.Fiscal policy stimulus over and above the support provided through automatic stabilisers has an important role to play. Governments around the world recognise that. They recognise that it is important that fiscal policy, fiscal stimulus, works in tandem with monetary policy or monetary stimulus in the economy. That could not be more important than at a time like now when there is a dramatic slowdown occurring in the international economy. The US and the UK are about to enter recession, the Euro zone and Japan are in recession and countries we trade with are now moving into recession. All of that is the case for substantial government action - substantial government action which must be taken.The government's position is supported widely by respected economists. Indeed, I do not think there is a respected economist in the country who agrees with the federal opposition at the moment - not one. Those over there think the global financial crisis is simply overhyped. That is what the Leader of the Opposition said. That is an excuse for the Liberal Party to fail to stand up for jobs, families and business. Let us just go through some of the comments from respected economists. Westpac chief economist, Bill Evans, said:We've already seen a very laudable $10 billion stimulus coming from the government, but we need to see more of that, and we need to certainly accept that there's nothing wrong, in fact it's responsible to have a deficit in this environment.The Prime Minister before referred to the Governor of the Reserve Bank, who said some weeks ago:If we see governments at state level or federal level pull back from worthwhile things because of the budget balance deteriorating, which it's going to do in this environment, that's not stabilising, that's potentially destabilising.That is the environment that we are in. Jobs are threatened and growth is threatened by what is going on internationally, but the Liberal Party will never put jobs first. Whether it is Work Choices or the global financial crisis, Mr Turnbull's solution is to do nothing - absolutely nothing - to protect jobs and nothing to protect families. -  - They say one thing in the parliament and another thing entirely in their electorates. This is what the member for Cowper had to say about the stimulus package that the opposition do not believe is needed:The Rudd Government's $10.4bn crisis package would put money where it was most needed - in the pockets of pensioners, carers and families.Too right it will, and it will do it in a timely and temporary way, which is the recommendation to the Australian government by all of the international organisations that understand the depth of this global financial crisis. This government is acting decisively to stimulate the economy and to protect families and the jobs that are at risk from the global financial crisis. If that means going to a temporary deficit, we will do that to invest in the future of the economy, to protect jobs and to protect households. Those opposite have no plans for the future and will do nothing to protect households or businesses and they should be condemned for their attitude.</DOC>

 - I thank very much the honourable member for Curtin for her original question. -  - The honourable member asked a question about the credentials of an economic conservative. That is a badge I own with pride. It means this. It means adhering to the orthodoxy outlined by the member for Higgins: to support a budget surplus across the economic cycle. That is our orthodoxy. That, at least as articulated by the member for Higgins - the increasingly smirking member for Higgins - was his orthodoxy. We face at present the challenges of the global financial crisis and the challenges of the part of the cycle that we are in. That is the bottom line. I would also draw the attention of the member for Curtin to action taken most recently by the European Commission. Overnight it released a stimulus package of EURO200 billion. The President of the European Commission, President Barroso, said:Exceptional times call for exceptional measures. The jobs and well-being of our citizens are at stake _The Recovery Plan can keep millions in work in the short-term _The timely, targeted and temporary fiscal stimulus will help put our economy back on track _The EU goes on to say:If we do not act now, we risk a vicious recessionary cycle of falling purchasing power and tax revenues, rising unemployment and ever wider budget deficits.That is from the EU. The United Kingdom has just introduced a Â£20 billion stimulus package aimed at a concerted and comprehensive plan. In the United States, under the current Bush administration, fiscal stimulus of US$168 billion will lead to a projected budget deficit of 4.6 per cent of GDP in 2009. In Japan a fiscal stimulus package of Â¥7 trillion in August and October will result in a projected forecast deficit of 3.8 per cent of GDP. - Mr Speaker, the honourable member for Curtin spoke at length about the credentials of being an appropriate economic conservative. I am responding entirely within that framework. Therefore, I would draw her attention to the conservative government of Germany, the conservative government of Japan and the conservative government of the United States - running fiscal deficits of minus 4.6 per cent of GDP and minus 3.8 per cent of GDP. Germany, on the back of its most recent stimulus package, is running a deficit of 0.8 per cent of GDP. I would also draw the attention of the honourable member for Curtin to the good old bank that the Leader of the Opposition used to work for. The former merchant bank Goldman Sachs said as follows:The combination of aggressive central bank easing and judicious fiscal stimulus will leave Australia better placed than its global peers in avoiding a deep and prolonged recession.Can I say to the member for Curtin, who is renowned for her originality in this place, that the challenge for responsible leadership -  -  - The challenge in implementing the government's orthodoxy, which is to maintain a budget surplus across the economic cycle - something we said before the election campaign, during the election campaign, subsequent to the election campaign - applies to the immediate challenges we face in the current state of the economic cycle. That is something that the member for Higgins, in his more honest of private reflections, would agree with. Therefore, we have a strategy for dealing with the challenges presented by the global financial crisis. It is called economic stimulus to support families and jobs. I would reiterate what the Treasurer said just a moment ago: when it comes to the challenge of supporting families and jobs in the global financial crisis, at the end of the day the Liberal Party never put jobs first. They did not put jobs first with Work Choices. When it comes to the choices we face in dealing with the global financial crisis, they put jobs last as well. We stand by an economic stimulus strategy. It is the right thing for the nation, the right thing for the economy and the right thing for jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question and his interest in education. As members of the House are aware - and a number of members of the House actually availed themselves of the opportunity of meeting with him - Joel Klein, New York's Chancellor of Schools, was in Australia this week, and in Canberra, speaking on education reform. He addressed a major event on the transformation of school education in Melbourne on Monday. He spoke at the National Press Club on Tuesday, and it was my pleasure to join him in Sydney last night at a dinner hosted by UBS with a number of leading business identities and education leaders to talk further about education reform. I take this opportunity to thank UBS for sponsoring not only last night's event but also Joel Klein's visit to this country.I was able to speak last night at the event with Joel Klein and whilst there I announced that the Australian government will introduce a national program recruiting and training high-achieving graduates to teach in challenging schools around Australia. I called on business at that dinner to support this initiative and I am pleased to be able to say that our business community has already responded. Organisations like UBS, Microsoft and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation have already said that they would be involved. BCA, the Business Council of Australia, have already confirmed that they will play a coordinating role. I would like to thank them for their interest and these early indications of support.This is also a scheme where the Victorian government has shown leadership and enthusiasm. It is already moving to implement a program, and the Rudd Labor government is committed to working with Victoria and states and territories around the nation to deliver this program. This scheme will work to recruit committed graduates, provide them with intensive training and mentoring, and then have them teach in some of the most challenging school environments in this country. This is a program about bringing the best and the brightest to the schools where they will make the most difference.Beyond this initiative on teacher quality, which forms part of the government's half a billion dollar plan for teacher quality - a plan that will be discussed and pursued by the Prime Minister at COAG this Saturday - the government is also determined to deliver a new era of transparency in school information. Joel Klein's principal message to this nation is: if you are going to deliver excellence and equity - The member for Sturt then left the chamber. - I think we have just seen an indication that not only did the Liberal Party fail to deliver on excellence and equity in education in government but in opposition it could not care less about anything other than cheap political point-scoring. I actually thought that members opposite showed interest in Joel Klein and his reform message, but I was wrong. They care nothing for the future of Australian students and Australian children - and the fact that that member serves as their shadow minister for education says it all. They care nothing about this reform agenda. Despite the active disinterest of those opposite in education excellence and equity for Australian children, the Rudd Labor government will pursue its education revolution.Amongst the things they are completely disinterested in is our plans for a new era of transparency in Australian schooling. We believe that parents and members of the public should have available to them full information about what is happening in Australian schools - information about academic results, information about who is teaching in schools and information about the resources in schools. Who is opposed to these measures? Of course the Liberal Party is demonstrating its opposition through the way in which it is treating the Schools Assistance Bill 2008.We are determined that across this nation a new era of transparency, coupled with new investments in teacher quality, will make a difference for children in every school. Our aim is excellence in every school across the country, irrespective of which school sector it is in. Our aim is to make a difference, particularly to disadvantaged students. And should the members opposite ever choose to think about education policy - and I think that that is unlikely - and about the prospects for reform in education, they might like to reflect on why at the end of 12 years of the Liberal Party in government this nation on international testing still had a long tail of disadvantaged students from poor families not achieving minimum benchmarks and students who were high achievers being let down by the system. This is a track record of failure at the top of the achievement band and a track record of failure for children at the lower end of the achievement band. We will make a difference on quality. We believe that every child, whether from a poor family or from a rich family, deserves a good education. It is a pity that the Liberal Party cares absolutely nothing about it.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question because I think it is time that the parliament was presented with a few basic facts about what the opposition stand for. And it is about time that we had a little bit of intellectual honesty on the part of those opposite. -  - Those opposite laugh and jeer because they are led by Captain Smirk, the member for Higgins. - I withdraw. -  - As I was saying in my response before - and it was interesting to see the member for Wentworth jump so quickly to the defence of the member for Higgins. I have not seen that for some time, nor have I seen it in reverse. -  - Let us be frank about the division in the Liberal Party. They are out there; they are staring us in the face. -  - In response to the honourable member's question, the economic circumstances which prevailed from 2001 on, as the member for Higgins will well recall, were those of an unrestrained boom in global commodity prices. I said to those opposite that we should inject some intellectual honesty into the debate, but of course those opposite are not interested in intellectual honesty. They are not interested in the facts of this debate, because their single objective is to find an opportunity for political point-scoring. That is what their agenda is all about. On the one hand -  - In the economic circumstances which have prevailed since 2001, as any objective economic -  -  - Those opposite interject during my answer to a question concerning the economic record of the previous government. What I am seeking to do is refer those members opposite, if they are interested in facts rather than simple political point-scoring, to this: as a consequence of the global commodities boom -  -  - In the context of that unprecedented boom in commodities prices, the estimates are that something in the order of $400 billion flowed into the Treasury coffers beyond normal budget parameters. The question which people have asked themselves in recent times is: what did the previous government use that money for? Did they invest it in infrastructure? No. As a consequence, the inflationary pressures which then emerged in the Australian economy were significant. As a consequence, the member for Higgins presided over 10 interest rate rises in a row. I did not hear anything about that in the question that was asked just before - 10 interest rate rises in a row. Anyone sitting in the gallery or listening to the broadcast today who has a mortgage would know what suffering 10 interest rate rises in a row meant for the family back pocket. These were the circumstances which the government inherited.Secondly, we now confront, as any honest analyst of current economic conditions would conclude, the worst financial crisis we have seen in three-quarters of a century. Those opposite find this an inconvenient truth. It is the truth and it is therefore becoming a crisis in the real economy. So I would say to those opposite: we can either have a real debate about real policy options to deal with the real economy challenges presented to Australia because of this crisis which originated in the United States or we can continue with this sort of bogus interjection on the part of those opposite, pretending that these underlying realities have somehow not changed. The member for Higgins in his most honest of moments knows all this to be true and factual. We are responding to the practical challenges with which we are confronted. I reiterate what I have said already: if the global financial crisis gets worse and puts the Australian economy more at risk then the government will take decisive action in the national interest, including temporarily going into deficit to stimulate the economy, build infrastructure and protect jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for his question. Tomorrow, I will meet with state and territory treasurers here in Canberra to negotiate a historic set of reforms to federal-state financial relations - reforms that are long overdue. On Saturday, the Prime Minister, the premiers and the treasurers will meet to finalise these reforms. These reforms are very important and go to the long-term economic health of the country, our capacity to lift our productivity, and our productive capacity, in the long term - something that was put in the too hard basket for 10 or 11 long years by those opposite.I am confident that by Saturday afternoon we will sign an agreement which delivers for our communities and also an agreement which recognises appropriately our new fiscal and economic environment that has come through courtesy of the global financial crisis. Our priorities are to stimulate the economy and create jobs in the short term and the long term, to put in place the long-term structures that can make our economy more efficient and the long-term federal-state structures that can lead to better service delivery. Most importantly, we need to put in place a process which can put an end to the blame game.The Commonwealth is committed to genuine reform across a range of policy fronts but especially in health and education, which those opposite were simply incapable of addressing during their time in government. Like the states, we are determined to fix the health system. We recognise that under previous governments there was an erosion of Commonwealth funding for our nation's hospitals. It is critical that we deal with that over the long term. That is why we will offer the states a better deal on health funding. On education, we will put forward significant reforms to teacher quality, as the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out earlier this week.What we are looking for is a new and modern federalism. This will be reflected in the financial arrangements. We will put in place new incentive arrangements with the states through national partnership payments to drive reform and better service delivery, particularly in health and education. In the next two days, the Prime Minister and I will use these new payments to deliver specific economic and social reforms that the Australian people have been waiting for for a long time. We are confident that we can agree on investments to stimulate the economy, to create jobs and to reform the Federation in the interests of all Australians.</DOC>

 - The honourable member's question underlines the fact that I outlined in my response to an earlier question. Their interest - in fact, their relish - is in the prospect of rising unemployment in Australia. That underpins the political strategy of those opposite. They spot the global financial crisis coming, see it becoming a real crisis for the global economy, look at the projected wash-on effects for the Australian economy in 2009, including pressures on employment, and, rather than engage in a debate about solutions, spot the opportunity to make the most politically out of the prospect of rising unemployment. That, as the honourable member knows, underpins the political strategy of the question that he just asked. He knows that. That is why he asked it. That is what underpins the question he has just asked. This is about politics, not about a real economic solution.We face the worst global financial crisis in three-quarters of a century. We have a strategy for dealing with it which is based on fiscal stimulus. We have announced a $10.4 billion fiscal stimulus strategy. We have announced a long-term $6.2 billion investment in the automobile industry. We have announced, as the Leader of the National Party may be interested to hear, a modest stimulus package to assist local governments across the country - a $300 million package. We will presently put a proposal to the states for in excess of $11 billion to support services in health and education for the future. These are the elements of our strategy; these are the elements of our stimulus approach; this is what we are doing about the reality which the global financial crisis has created and the threat which therefore bears down for families, for growth and for jobs. That is our strategy.The question for those opposite is: what is theirs? Their strategy is this: rank political opportunism. Their strategy never gets past political first base. It is all about politics, politics and politics and how to score political points out of other people's pain. The government has a strategy for the future. I again say to those opposite that it is time that they join the national project of finding solutions rather than simply playing politics every step of the way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson. I know that at least everybody on this side of the House is interested in the investments that we will be making this weekend in health. On our side of the House, we are determined to help fix health, unlike those on the other side of the House, particularly the member for Warringah, who oversaw the pulling of a billion dollars out of our hospital systems. He was responsible in large part for a decade of neglect in health, symbolised by the pulling of money out of our public hospital system. We acknowledge that rebuilding our health and hospital system is going to take time. We have been making advances step by step during the last 12 months.But we expect to take an even bigger step this weekend. First of all, you are going to see a very large investment in our hospitals. In doing this, we acknowledge - as the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have both done already today - that Australians are demanding that we stop the bickering between the Commonwealth and the states and start working to deliver some real solutions. What you will see in the health package that will be put on the table this weekend is work that has been developed cooperatively with the states that looks at investing in all sorts of areas: hospitals, prevention, Indigenous health - improving health outcomes in areas where we know we have to do better and, very importantly, improving in areas where there are bottlenecks that were created by the previous government.One of the most devastating 'neglects', if that is the right term - the most neglectful activity of the previous government - was starving our health system of doctors and nurses. We know the previous government is on the record as having acknowledged its mistakes in terms of the shortage of doctors in particular. The member for Warringah, the member for Bradfield and even the new opposition spokesperson for health are on the record as admitting that they failed to invest early in university places for doctors. They cut funding to training hospitals and they capped GP training places and, as a result, far too many Australians cannot get the health care they need. In fact, over 60 per cent of the country cannot get access to doctors. There is a shortage of doctors in that big a chunk of our country.So there are a litany of problems that we have inherited and we are determined to fix them. We have started investing, and this weekend you are going to see not just some repair work but some major renovations. We want to make sure that these changes and investments will be tied to outcomes, and I am pleased to see that it looks like the opposition might actually be supporting this package. The member for Dickson went out today and said: 'Any new money does have to come with strings attached to it. We can't be tipping buckets of money, billions of dollars of Commonwealth taxpayers' money, into what has been a failed system.' That sounds to me like he is going to support what we want to do. We want to put more money into the system and we want to tie it to outcomes. I would like to invite the opposition to now indicate a change of heart. It seems they are prepared to join with us in this battle instead of constantly blaming the states and territories.This weekend is going to demonstrate the difference in having a Commonwealth government prepared to work with the states and territories to achieve what the community needs us to - more doctors, more nurses, more investment in our hospitals and more investment in keeping people out of our hospitals. We will be focused on those outcomes, and that will be very clear when we get to COAG this weekend.</DOC>

 - I would refer the honourable member, in answer to his question, to the statement that I made yesterday. The statement that I made yesterday said that, under current circumstances, it is not necessary for the government to contemplate a temporary deficit to support jobs, growth and families. What I went on to say, in response to the honourable member's question, was that, if the global financial crisis continues to worsen and puts the Australian economy more at risk, then the government will take the decisive action that is necessary, including the possibility of a temporary deficit, in order to support the economy, invest in infrastructure and support families and jobs. That is the government's strategy. It is clear cut. Those are the circumstances which surround it.The honourable member asks what the changing circumstances are, and again I would draw his attention to the statement I made yesterday and the stream of data which has emerged from the United States and around the world during the course of November. Secondly, I would draw the honourable member's attention to my statement and its reference to the comments made to me by heads of government at both the G20 meeting and the APEC summit meeting. I say again to the honourable member: our strategy is clear - it is called fiscal stimulus to try and support jobs, growth and families. The alternative strategy is simply missing in action.</DOC>

 - They are going wild again, Mr Speaker. - I thank the member for Wills for his question. Earlier this year the Council of Australian Governments agreed to a program of regulatory reform covering no fewer than 27 areas of business regulation - an unprecedented commitment. Never before, in fact, in Australia's history has a government attempted such an ambitious program of reducing unnecessary business regulation, including the red tape that has been strangling small businesses. But I will point out that the Rudd government is doing this in the tradition of reforming Labor governments, such as the Hawke and Keating governments, which were committed to transforming Australia into an open, competitive economy.My colleague the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and I have been co-chairing the Business Regulation and Competition Working Group that was established by the Prime Minister, the premiers and the chief ministers late last year. This program of cutting business red tape is designed to move Australia to what both the Business Council of Australia and the 2020 Summit have described as a seamless national economy. That is where we want to take Australia.Do you know, Mr Speaker, that in many areas of business regulation there are fewer impediments within the European Union, with its 467 million people, than there are within Australia, with its 21 million people? So we are moving Australia from being nine markets to being one market, a seamless national economy. In doing that, we are putting an end to what we call 'rail gauge economics'. Rail gauge economics has plagued the business community for more than a century now.Australia can no longer justify having eight different systems for licensing tradespeople. Australia cannot justify any longer having eight different systems for small businesses just to register their business names. Australia can no longer justify having eight different systems of weights and measures. I remember that the member for Forde, in particular, spoke eloquently of the need to have a single system for weights and measures. I can announce to the House that just before question time the Senate passed the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008, which means that we will now move to a single national system of weights and measures.The significance of that is doubled by the fact that this is one of the regulatory hot spots that was identified by the Council of Australian Governments in 2006, when the coalition was in power. And what has happened to those 10 regulatory hot spots? What has happened to the reforms? Ms Katie Lahey, the head of the Business Council of Australia, said that she does not know what happened to those hot spots under the previous government. She said they were so hot they must have burnt a hole in the paper and fallen to the floor. Nothing was done - and that is the problem.The Rudd government is vigorously pursuing the reform of Australia's tangle of business regulations. Why? Because it will help lift productivity growth off the floor and reverse what the Business Council of Australia, in this document, has described in these terms:The creeping re-regulation of business and the introduction of policies that are inconsistent and overlapping across jurisdictions are additional examples of how the benefits of past reform can be quietly eroded over time.Hear, hear! That was an indictment on a decade of squandered opportunity by the previous government, which re-regulated the Australian economy. While the government is managing the impacts of the global financial crisis and navigating with the business community and the Australian people at large through the turbulence created by the global financial crisis, we will never give up. We will never give up on fundamental economic reform that will boost productivity growth and the competitiveness of Australian industry. On that point, the OECD, in its policy brief just recently said:It is also important to reduce product market segmentation caused by the regulatory differences between the states _ The government - that is, the Rudd government - is putting a wide-ranging reform programme in place.The report went on:It is promising, for example, that there are now financial incentives for the states to move this process forward.Those are the very financial incentives that the coalition has described as the creation of slush funds. This comes after 10 years of policy sloth, neglect and nothing being done in the business regulation area - nothing at all, other than the creeping re-regulation of Australian business. I want to thank the states and territories for their cooperation in pursuing these reforms and lifting productivity growth so vital to Australia's future.</DOC>

 - As I said in response to an earlier question, the government's policy, like that of those opposite, is to have a budget surplus across the economic cycle. Therefore it is a question of the length of the economic cycle. We are in unprecedented territory at the moment because of the global financial crisis. Therefore, under those circumstances, while I have said to the House that under current circumstances the government does not see the need to embark upon that course of action, if the global financial crisis worsens and if we need, therefore, to defend jobs, families and the economy in the national interest, then a temporary budget deficit would be acceptable under those circumstances.I would say to those opposite, as they seek again to extract political mileage out of this because they are not concerned about defending jobs - they are not, because they are not interested in answers on this - that we have a strategy to see Australia through this crisis. Those opposite simply have a series of political cliches. As a jobs impact flows to Australian families, I would strongly suggest to those opposite that they pay close attention to the real answers that mums and dads of families across Australia will want. Mums and dads of families wanted decisive action on the question of their bank guarantees. This government delivered it. - I draw the honourable member's attention to the orthodoxy of the government which preceded us, which was to have a budget surplus across the economic cycle, as is the orthodoxy of this government. The challenge we face is the unprecedented global economic terrain we now face - the worst crisis in 75 years - and therefore the necessity to embrace measures to support growth, families and jobs in what will be a very difficult 2009. Those opposite are interested in simple political cliches; we are interested in real policy responses to help families, to help jobs and to help the real economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question. I know that she has been following this matter and is very keen to provide her affected constituents with information. Members of this House obviously would recall that a receiver was appointed to ABC Learning in the first week of this month. I would want to remind the House that the receiver found the financial and operational accounts of ABC Learning in such a poor state that he effectively had to start from scratch, centre by centre, to work through the future of ABC Learning. As the receiver has gone about this work, experts engaged by the government have been embedded with the receiver, working with him side by side.Yesterday, as a result of these efforts, the receiver was able to provide the next update to the anxious mums and dads and employees about the future of ABC Learning childcare centres. Of course, this update from the receiver comes against the background of the government having worked with the receiver and having made up to $22 million available to ensure continuity of care for children until 31 December this year. Having that continuity of care assisted mums and dads and employees with working their way through this situation, but obviously people are anxious to know the situation for 2009. Yesterday, the receiver, Mr Honey, was able to confirm that 656 ABC Learning centres would continue to operate in 2009 and the details of the centres which will continue to operate are available from both the government's information hotline - 1802003 - and on the pages of our mychild.gov.au website.Knowing that the 656 centres are going to continue to operate obviously would provide some relief and reassurance to the parents who have their children cared for there. That is more than 70 per cent of the children attending ABC Learning. I think that is to be noted and is significant for those parents and those employees. Clearly there is more work to do on the remaining 386 ABC Learning centres in order to get information to parents and employees about the circumstances next year. The receiver is still engaged in a detailed analysis of the future of these centres. The receiver has said that a further statement will be made available for parents and employees in a week's time. I think it is very important to stress that if a childcare centre is on the list of 386 that does not mean that it is marked for closure. Being on the list of 386 means the receiver is continuing to work on the situation and more information will be available in a week's time - a very important message for mums and dads and employees anxious about all of this.Obviously mums and dads and employees of ABC Learning - and I would suggest the broader community - across the nation are asking themselves the question: how did this happen? We know that the circumstances for ABC Learning came about because the former Liberal government uncapped the number of childcare places and then just let the market rip. No quality plan, no workforce plan, no plan to bring childcare centres to areas where they were needed, no action on the question of creeping acquisitions - just let the market rip. The Liberal Party were not only neglectful in this matter; they were complicit in this matter as ABC Learning - a bloated company, full of debt - gained such a share of the private childcare market, leaving us open to the risks and uncertainties that parents and employees face today. It is something that, if the Liberal Party had any decency, it would apologise to the Australian people for and make a full statement about its degree of complicity. The Rudd government will continue to manage this situation, working alongside the receiver, getting certainty to parents as soon as we can provide it. Our highest priority in all of this has been continuity of care. We will continue with this important work and I will continue to update the House as future information becomes available.</DOC>

 - I say to the honourable member who has just asked the question that again we are faced with some serious economic challenges in our country - for jobs and for families - and his interests, following the direction of his political masters, is simply again to engage in political point scoring. I think the people of Australia would want something more from their representatives than that sort of intervention.This government, when it comes to the reform of the federation, believes that the responsible course of action is to invest in education, to invest in schools, to invest in TAFE and to invest in universities - to make sure that we have an education system designed for the 21st century. I would say, firstly, to those opposite that, had they bothered to deploy the proceeds of the mining boom over the previous half decade and more, they could have invested in the future productive capacity of the economy. -  - I would the draw the attention of honourable members who howl their interjections to a report recently released by Access Economics, which said exactly the same thing. Secondly, they could have done something about the nation's infrastructure. They could have done something about water infrastructure. They could have done something about broadband. They could have done something about the other needs in ports -  - So rather than invest in the needs of communities across the country - for the future of education, for the future of infrastructure and, as the minister for small business just indicated, taking action to create a seamless national economy for the benefit of small business - they instead did nothing. They sat there and played politics in government, as they play politics in opposition.The other part of the honourable member's question goes to the question of a temporary deficit. I draw the honourable member's attention to what actually constitutes the elements of a budget. Firstly, on the revenue side, the honourable member's attention should be drawn to the fact that, because of the global financial crisis, $40 billion has been sliced off the government's revenues - as has happened across much of the OECD. I would draw the honourable member's attention, for example, to what is happening in other economies. The conservative government of the United States is running a 4.6 per cent of GDP deficit, the conservative government of France is running a 3.9 per cent of GDP deficit, the conservative government of Germany is running a 0.8 per cent of GDP deficit, the conservative government of Italy is running a 2.9 per cent of GDP deficit, the conservative government of Japan - An opposition member - We live in New South Wales. - The conservative government of Japan is running a deficit of 3.9 per cent of GDP. These are the facts about what is happening around the world as individual governments seek to respond to a global financial crisis - facts which those opposite find personally confronting because they are politically inconvenient. These are the inconvenient truths.Secondly, when it comes to revenues those opposite need to accept the reality that $40 billion has been sliced off the government's revenues across the forward estimates because of the global financial crisis. That has happened right across the developed world. Thirdly, on the question of outlays, what did this government do in its preparation for the last budget? Through the activity of the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and through the Expenditure Review Committee, it sliced $5 billion worth of excessive expenditures by way of a savings program which the Treasurer delivered in the context of the budget and which he announced in May of this year - $5 billion. On top of that, that has given us the capacity to bring in the stimulus package that we announced in October of $10.4 billion and, in addition to that, to make forward provision for the auto plan of $6.2 billion and to make forward provision for various other stimulus packages which I have already announced.I would say this to those opposite, as they seek to provide a lecture on the question of fiscal probity: have those opposite bothered to cost those promises which they have stuck out there in the public domain - on ready-to-mix drinks, luxury car tax, crude oil excise condensate? Whatever the position may now be -  - And, in responding to the question, the honourable member asked a question about the matter of deficits and I am going to the question of how you construct a budget on the revenue side and on the expenditure side and, therefore, the proposals also being put opposite. Those opposite have said they support the Economic Security Strategy. - Therefore, when it comes to looking at the way in which you put together outlays, we have a capacity, as we have indicated, through the budget to provide stimulus. Those opposite in providing a lesson on fiscal probity need to answer these questions. Do they support the Economic Security Strategy? Their formal position is yes, I believe. Does anyone oppose the Economic Security Strategy over there? Therefore, let us give that a big tick because that is what they have said. The car plan I think they support. Does anyone oppose the car plan over there? -  - I refer again to the honourable member's question as it related to the statement I made yesterday and its reference to the management of budgets. If those opposite support the three measures that I have just referred to - the third one, of course, is the local government infrastructure package - does anyone over there oppose the $300 million for local infrastructure? I do not think so. Therefore, they support those three sets of measures -  - That is right, I am sorry, the member for Cook is an exception. So we support those three measures. If you put them all together, that is a reasonable amount of money. Then you go to their promises which they have been putting out all year - on ready-to-mix drinks, luxury car tax, crude oil excise condensate, Medicare levy surcharge, heavy vehicle road user charge, dental treatment offset, Commonwealth seniors health card, family trusts, and this is the inter-esting one: the 5c reduction in petrol excise. What status does that have these days? Not sure. There is also Investing in our Sch-ools, Lower Lakes and the increased rate of the single pension. Putting all those toge-ther, is it five, 10, 15, 20 billion - could be more?Can I say to those opposite, if they are seriously putting forward an argument about fiscal rectitude, first of all put together what you have supported by way of government measures to stimulate the economy in terms of your formal press releases and the three that I have just mentioned you formally have. Secondly, put together the five, 10, 15, 20 billion dollars worth of outlays contained in the promises you have made to the Australian people and you end up with a very interesting set of fiscal circumstances indeed. I would say to the honourable member for Mitchell, as he put this question to the House on how budgets are put together, that he should have a long look at the fiscal probity which is contained in the promises being put out by the Liberal Party in opposition. - They played politics and spent like drunken sailors in government. They are playing politics and spending like drunken sailors in opposition as well.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question. The opposition seem interested today in debating their economic management record in government. I am delighted to oblige, because, when we took over, we had government spending running at five per cent real growth. We had growth of approximately 35,000 additional public servants within about five or six years and astonishing scandals like $457 million being spent on government advertising within the last 16 months of the Howard government. In addition to this, we inherited a structure of government that was totally, absolutely decentralised, where government departments and agencies were essentially left to their own devices to do whatever they liked in managing their resources and their activities. They were virtually without any overarching scrutiny or coordination from central government. But this government is committed to tackling the inevitable waste and inefficiency that flows from that ultra-decentralised structure and is ready to address these problems. This government has put in place over $5 billion worth of spending cuts, savings in the budget for this year, a major clampdown on abuse of government advertising, new rules with respect to discretionary grants and a process of reforming procurement in order to ensure that aggregated buying, collective buying, can get better value for money for the taxpayer.But the area that has had some of the most appalling problems has been ICT - information and communications technology - where the government spends somewhere between $5 billion and $6 billion per year. In the past, we have seen problems such as the rollout of the new Customs systems, the integrated cargo system, which we and countless small businesses remember with some degree of horror. We have seen FaHCSIA and the Department of Defence waste $50 million, $60 million, $65 million on projects that were ultimately abandoned, and we have seen a general problem with the lack of coordination of spending and the lack of aggregation of government buying power.In order to tackle these problems, the government commissioned Sir Peter Gershon, a world-renowned expert, to advise the government on putting in place a new strategy. His findings about the current deficiencies in the way the federal government deals with IT were very interesting, and they were released recently by the government. The first was that there is virtually no across-the-government strategy to deal with purchasing or management of information technology; that there has been minimal scrutiny of business-as-usual spending by agencies and departments; that the purchase of desktop computers and associated elements ranged from $1,500 per desktop to $3,500; that costs per transaction with respect to members of the public from different systems ranged between 10c and $30 per transaction; that costs of human resources systems in various government agencies ranged from $10 per employee to $500 per employee; that, if the current fragmented arrangement with respect to data centres that prevails in the Commonwealth were left in place, this would cost the Commonwealth an additional billion dollars over 15 years more than it should; and that there should be an aggregated arrangement, a coordinated arrangement, with respect to data centres. But, most amazingly of all, the report from Sir Peter Gershon indicated that the ratio of public servants to desktop computers in the Australian government is one to about 1.6. - In other words, for every employee in the Commonwealth, including military employees, including some who have no particular need to have their own computer, there are over 1Â½ computers. Indeed, there are some agencies that have more than two computers per employee. I note that the member for North Sydney says, 'Give them to the schools.' Now we know why we have to invest in computers for schools. Now we know why the Howard government did not do anything about computers for schools - because they gave them all to the public servants.The government is putting in place a new framework to deal with these issues. There will be a ministerial committee, as part of the ERC, to deal with overarching government decisions, and business-as-usual spending that was allowed to grow like Topsy under the member for Higgins will be cut by almost $400 million in a full year, and half of that will be returned in investment in new projects to upgrade IT systems and to enable the legacy systems, the mess that we have inherited, to be improved. A whole-of-government data centre strategy will be developed. There will be a reduction in the proportion of expensive contractors being used in place of full-time employees at, in some cases, double the cost, and there will be a whole-of-government IT sustainability strategy developed.I am delighted to be able to indicate, as I announced this week, that the government has adopted all of Sir Peter Gershon's recommendations and will be implementing the report in full. We will continue to work hard to have every possible efficiency to eliminate all the waste that we can from the budget we inherited from our predecessors, because the Liberal Party were asleep at the wheel. We are committed to maximising value for money for the Australian taxpayer. For those on the opposition benches who have suddenly got very excited about the prospect that the global financial crisis could conceivably push the budget into deficit, I ask this question: given all of the uncosted promises you have made - given all of the uncosted promises about fuel excise, about pensions and about capital gains tax for small business - where would they leave the budget position if you were in government? The Rudd government are committed to delivering efficiencies and savings and to eliminating the waste and mismanagement that we inherited from the previous government.</DOC>

 - I would say in response to the honourable member for Riverina's question the following: if you look at the global financial crisis which began in credit markets in the United States, which flowed through to equity markets in the United States, which flowed through to property markets in the United States, which then flowed through to the financial institutions throughout the world through the agency of credit default swaps and securitisation of the various loans made with highly liquid money against bad assets in the real estate sector, that is the cancer that has spread across the entire global financial system. That is the real cause of what has happened. Why you are therefore seeing a consequential impact on confidence, both consumer confidence and business confidence, is because that has worked out to the real economy. When consumers are confronted by the nonavailability of credit or the other challenges which now present themselves in terms of employment, it has an effect on consumer confidence, as night follows day. Similarly, with business confidence, if there is a crunch in terms of the availability of credit for business and its normal lending arrangements, business as a consequence begins to evidence a lack of confidence. That also follows through a contraction of demand in the overall economy.These are the facts. They might be uncomfortable facts; they might be politically inconvenient facts for those opposite, but that is actually what is occurring. It is what is occurring in this country. It is what is occurring in the United Kingdom. It is what is occurring in the United States, in France, in Germany, in every other economy around the world. The question is - and I say this to the honourable member for the Riverina, whom I regard to be a decent person - what are we as a nation going to do about this?We have a course of action for dealing with this and it hangs off the whole proposition of providing economic stimulus through the fiscal policy measures that we have outlined so far, acting in tandem with monetary policy. Our course of action is clear: together with the range of task forces we currently have at work with elements of the financial sector that are dealing with the rollout consequences of the global financial crisis, we are doing detailed work, practical work, sector by sector, subsector by subsector, then across what we do in one stage after the other. We have a fiscal policy in coordination with what the Reserve Bank is doing with monetary policy. This is a strategy, a plan of action for the future. I would say to those opposite that the alternative which they offer the people and the economy and the nation is as follows: do nothing and take political advantage of the crisis. That is your strategy in a nutshell and, frankly, the Australian people condemn you for it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for the question. In answering the question I acknowledge from the outset that both sides of this House have worked hard for a very long period of time to ensure that Australia is at the forefront of the battle against doping in sport. I think that we as a nation can be very proud of where we stand in this regard. We know that it is important that sport is fair and that it is clean and drug free, and of course we need sport to be a healthy activity, one that makes a positive contribution in our community, one that we want to encourage our children to take part in, not one that becomes a race between those who can get the best access and who can best disguise performance-enhancing drugs. As a very passionate sporting country we need to ensure that the integrity of sport is maintained. Whether through ASDA, or now ASADA, Australia has worked to pursue this at home, and I particularly know that one of the former ministers for sport, Rod Kemp, was very passionate about this issue.We have also provided leadership at an international level, most notably of course with the election of the President of the World Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, John Fahey, someone that I know that many members opposite are very proud of. Indeed all Australians should be very proud of the fine job that he is doing in that role.Earlier this week I attended meetings of WADA in Montreal and I can advise the House on developments in terms of both Australia's representation on this global body and, indeed, new steps which have been adopted in order to tighten the net on drug cheats. Mr Speaker, whilst you would know that I am certainly not one for shameless self-promotion, I can inform the House that Australia will now have a seat on the WADA executive committee from 1 January 2009.Honourable members - Hear, hear! - Thank you. I think it is significant to note that, along with President Fahey, Australians will now hold two out of just six government positions worldwide on this executive committee, the highest international antidoping body. I would also like to acknowledge the role of the former New Zealand Minister for Sport, the Hon. Clayton Cosgrove, from whom we will take over the role in representing Oceania.It is also significant to note that a memorandum of understanding has now been finalised between WADA and Interpol in order to provide a framework for cooperation between these two bodies to gather evidence and share information. Because we know the pursuit of drug cheats has to be broadened from just testing and detection, drug cheats will now be actively investigated with the assistance of these new arrangements. This is a model which we have had in place in Australia and ASADA has been working on but which will now be strengthened by the international movement. Our government here is committed to upholding our strong reputation when it comes to being ahead of the game and fighting drugs in sport and I am happy to inform the House of these new developments.If I can just take another 20 seconds of the parliament's time whilst I am here, I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute Peter Bartels, who has just ended his term as the chair of the Australian Sports Commission. Peter has served for a long period of time and he is passionate about Australian sport. He has been very professional and I have enjoyed working with him. I wish him the best of luck in the future.</DOC>

 - I know the member for Hinkler's heart was not in that question, because I know him to be a decent man who actually deals with the facts. I could actually hear the wince in his voice as he was required by the party whip to ask it! The great thing about our friend the member for Hinkler is that he is not a bad bloke; you can actually hear when he is uncomfortable with the question. To go to the facts of it, from the most recent set of government annual reports of 2005-06, the total number of committees launched by the previous, Howard government is 493, from memory. My response to those opposite would be these words: physician, heal thyself.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question - and it is true that he has a sunny disposition which we on this side of the House appreciate! The support provided by the Rudd Labor government for solar power and for renewable energy across the board is unprecedented. Yesterday in Sydney I opened the Asia-Pacific Regional International Solar Energy Society Conference and had the pleasure of announcing that the government will fund half of a $6.6 million solar power station to be built in Alice Springs as part of the Australian government's Alice Solar City project. The Alice Springs Ilparpa solar power station will become a significant landmark in the region, with 26 fourteen-metre-high solar concentration dishes built to the south of Alice Springs. It has got Australian designed technology using dishes to track the movement of the sun throughout the day, concentrating the sunlight onto highly efficient photovoltaic cells and contributing around 1,800 megawatt hours of clean power to the Alice Springs grid each year. I know the member for Lingiari will agree with me that this project will further enhance Alice Springs's contribution and its position as a showcase town for renewable power generation in Australia.This commitment further underlines the additional $18.8 million the government have committed to create new solar cities in Coburg, in Victoria, and in Perth. That commitment comes at a time when the identification of green job potential, the time for being serious about renewable energy, is increasingly something which is being noticed, being written about and coming to our attention. We have seen the CSIRO and Allen Consulting Group report of June this year, Growing the green collar economy, which shows the significant potential for employment growth in sustainable trades and the clean technology workforce as we set about tackling dangerous climate change. That report identifies an increase of more than 10 per cent over 10 years in sectors with high potential environmental impacts - the potential for stable, green jobs if you have robust policy support for sustainable industries and renewable energy. The government believe that we need to produce significant opportunities for this renewable energy industry to grow and we need well-designed policies of substance that attach to that.I have to say for the benefit of the member of Flinders, who has responsibility for this issue but is actually not in the House at this point in time - so serious is the opposition's contemplation of the issues that their shadow minister cannot even stay in question time for the full duration of question time; he is bobbing in and out. This is the member for Flinders, the one that we know as the stunt master of the parliament, who jumped out of a plane with a parachute on to say that Australia's solar industry was in free fall when in fact applications were at an all-time high. It is actually that absent member for Flinders - someone is scurrying out to bring him back into the House - who said, about the solar industry on 18 May, that we have seen the collapse of that industry 'and that is not overstating it'. I would hate to see what happens when the member for Flinders does actually overstate something! This was at a time when applications for solar panel rebates were at an all-time high. But then he went on to say: 'Few people, if any' -  - I think it is a little bit late for the honourable member to come to the rescue of the member for Flinders -  -  - The absent shadow minister for climate change and the environment said, 'Few people, if any, are signing on to new solar power contracts.' Let me put it on the record in the House that under the Rudd Labor government we will be providing more solar rebates in a single month than were committed to in a single year previously, but according to the absent member for Flinders few people are signing contracts. In his absence, I will not go on to say that the Evel Knievel approach to politics just will not do in the parliament any longer. Stunts will not suffice; what we need is substance. Those opposite had 12 years and they refused to increase the renewable energy target. They had 12 years and they refused to put a price on carbon. They had 12 years of denial and delay on climate change. The Australian public want substance on the matter of delivering solar power and solar energy, and that is what this government is providing.</DOC>

 - Our commitment on this has not changed. Our commitment as part of the digital education revolution is to ensure that our kids are equipped for the challenges of the 21st century. That is why we put $1.2 billion out there for this program. That is why in discussions with the states and territories on Saturday we committed a further $800 million to this program. Do you know why? We want to get it done. We want every kid in the country to have proper access to computers. -  - I would say to those opposite as they engage in partisan short-term politics on this: put up your hand those of you who do not want computers delivered to the classrooms in your electorate. -  - I see Mr Ciobo puts his hand up, so I would say, 'Mr Ciobo -  - This government is proud of the computer revolution in Australian schools and this government is proud of the education revolution in Australian schools. This government wants to make sure that our kids are equipped with the skills necessary for the 21st century. Already the practical work is being done. In round 1, 946 schools from across Australia have been invited to submit an application - these were schools with a student-to-computer ratio of one to eight or worse, identified through the national audit. Round 1 provided funding of $116 million to 896 schools. Would those opposite who have benefited from round 1 put up their hands if they would not like this funding to be delivered? No, they are not so keen on that. That is $116 million in funding for schools. That is actually a pretty good start and 16,000 computers are expected to be delivered by 31 December to 186 schools across Australia.Round 2 of the fund has recently closed and a total of 1,420 schools across Australia applied - 793 government schools, 342 independent schools and 285 Catholic schools. This government is proud of this program. It is equipping Australia and our kids for the future. It is an education revolution in the classroom to make sure they can compete in the world economy of the 21st century.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn very much for his question because decisions taken here in Canberra affect hospitals and schools right across Australia, including in his electorate. For Gladstone and all those cities, towns and rural communities around Gladstone, the important thing is to get it right. On Saturday we took, head-on, the whole challenge of consigning to history the blame game, which has so plagued Australian federal-state relations for so many decades.In the Council of Australian Governments meeting on Saturday we sought to do two things. Mindful of the global financial crisis, the first was to inject stimulus into the Australian economy - $15.1 billion of additional funding, capable of creating a further 133,000 jobs. That is what I call an addition to stimulus. We have done that on the back of the $10.4 billion package we announced in October which was capable of creating some 75,000 jobs; the $6.2 billion package to support the auto industry, an industry which itself critically supports some 200,000 jobs; and, of course, the $3.3 million grant to local governments through the local government infrastructure fund, most recently conducted here through the first meeting of the Australian Council of Local Government. That was our first objective: to ensure that we provided necessary stimulus to support growth and jobs in the midst of the global financial crisis - part and parcel of our economic stimulus strategy for the future.The second part of what we sought to do was to prosecute the long-term reform agenda that Australia so desperately needs - a reform agenda which was allowed to swing in the breeze for the better part of a decade on the part of the government which preceded us. Firstly, in terms of education in this package, we have boosted our national investment in education by more than $3.5 billion in order to bring about an education revolution. There is a $42 billion national education agreement, representing something like a 23 or 24 per cent increase on the previous education agreement between Canberra and the states. What are its parts? Firstly, $550 million to upgrade the skills of our teachers and our principals; and, secondly, $1.1 billion for our 1,500 most disadvantaged schools to enable them to employ additional high-quality staff, including teacher aids.These are important measures of long-term reform. They affect classrooms across the country. We have also reached agreement on more than $2 billion worth of reforms to teaching transparency and basic skills such as literacy and numeracy and provide the funding so to do. This is an education revolution in the quantity of our investment and it is an education revolution in the quality of our investment, because underpinning this new agreement between Canberra and the states - effectively negotiated by the Deputy Prime Minister - is this: we will have a quality education reform agenda for the future based on proper, full transparency of school reporting to families, communities and the wider national public. We can actually measure how schools are going. We will know where to boost our support to teachers, where to boost our support for principals and where to boost our support for the resources which they need. Overall, we will lift the year-12 equivalent education retention rate from its current doldrums of some 75 per cent to 90 per cent, which would put us at the right end of the OECD rather than being wooden-spooners, which is where we are at present. The education revolution and reform agenda were prosecuted through this meeting of the Council of Australian Governments on Saturday.Secondly, on health, what we have also done through this important agenda of reform is to ensure that we provide proper support for health reform long term as well. The health agreement is of itself significant. Between 2003 and 2008, the Australian Health Care Agreement effectively ripped about $1 billion off the bottom line of the states in terms of their effective capacity to fund public hospitals across the country. It is easy to run around the country and attack state and territory governments for what is going wrong in public hospitals. But if you pull $1 billion out of their effective funding delivery that is part of what happens as a result. If you went back to the previous Australian Health Care Agreement, in the period prior to 2003, the indexation factor delivered was 6.3 per cent per annum - still not great. Post 2003, to satisfy their own interests in boasting of a better surplus and in the midst of revenue awash as a consequence of the resources boom, they reduced that escalator to only 5.3 per cent per annum. The result was to effectively pull $1 billion out of it.Had we continued the Howard government indexation clause for the future, for the next Australian healthcare agreement, the states and territories would have been $5 billion worse off than they are as a result of the agreement which we forged on Saturday between the Commonwealth and the states. This is necessary to deal with the real performance of our public hospital system in the future. In addition to dealing with the fundamentals of the Australian healthcare agreement we also invested $1.1 billion in investment and reforms to build the skills and capacities of our health workforce: more trained doctors, more trained GPs, more trained specialists, more trained medical supervisors and more trained nursing supervisors. On top of that, there is a $750 million investment in a new national partnership with the states to boost the throughput of our emergency departments and, looking to the long term, an $872 million investment in preventative health care.This is the first time - and I say this in this parliament today - that we have had a substantial long-term investment in preventative healthcare strategy for the future. We can apply bandaids to the hospital system and watch as the statistics grow, as the number of presentations at hospitals coming off the back of an explosion in chronic diseases is left unattended, or we can start to invest for the medium to long term. What we have done through the preventative healthcare strategy and the funding for it, delivered through the negotiating efforts of the Minister for Health and Ageing, was to deliver $872 million over six years. This is an important step forward for the Commonwealth and for the nation if we are at all serious about reducing the burden of our public hospital system in the future.There are reforms in education to bring about an education revolution, reforms in the long-term funding of the public hospital funding base for the nation and reforms in other critical areas, such as dealing with preventative health care as well. But beyond those areas of reform, there are also agreements with the states and territories on closing the gap for Indigenous Australians and in the critical areas of disability and housing and on how we underpin and encourage long-term national microeconomic reform by rolling back this huge burden of regulatory overhang on small businesses across Australia through a business deregulation agenda.We are not talking about it but actually doing it, as the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy have been so effectively engaged with their state and territory counterparts these recent months. In order to make sure that happens, there is a $550 million fund to incentivise states and territories to deliver on the 27 areas of regulatory reform that we have agreed upon to create one objective - that is, a seamless national economy. It was called for by the business community at the 2020 Summit. It has been activated through the COAG process and it will now be funded through the incentive pool that we have created.On Saturday COAG represented a significant outcome for the national economy: a stimulus of $15 billion worth of additional investment to the national economy capable of creating 133,000 additional jobs. But, most critically, it represented rolling back the blame game, getting on with the business of reforming the Federation, implementing the education revolution, implementing long-term reform for our public hospital system and creating the Australia for the future which the working people of this country have aspired to for so long. We have taken decisive action to bring it about.</DOC>

 - I do sincerely thank the shadow minister for education for his question. It gives me the opportunity to clarify some of his wildly inaccurate claims which have been made publicly. The fact is that the shadow minister for education is not someone known for accuracy. Interestingly, on ABC radio in South Australia this morning, the radio journalist said to him:Christopher Pyne, previously on two - inaudible - your staff have sanitised our questions from the transcripts that you issued to the federal press gallery and others. Are you going to do that with this interview?The shadow minister responded:Not if you don't want me to.The modern Liberal Party: an amalgam of plagiarisers and sanitisers. But when it comes to claims about computers in schools from this bunch of plagiarisers and sanitisers, let me deal with the subject of the member's question.The subject of the member's question is: how is the government's program working to deliver computers to students in schools? Let me explain to him. We promised to bring computers to students in years 9 to 12. And we will deliver an effective one-to-one ratio for those students. What was the first thing that we did? - I know 'ratio' is probably a confusing concept for the shadow Treasurer; she might get someone to explain it to her. The first step we took when we came to government was that we audited to see what the situation was in Australian schools. We counted students and computers that were four years old or less. What did we find when we did that count? We found that there were 280 schools - that is, more than 10 per cent of secondary schools - that had a computer to student ratio of one to 20 or worse. That is, 20 or more children were trying to get access to the one computer. Out of that 280, 110 schools had no computers at all aged less than four years - no computers at all. The record of the Liberal Party in this nation after almost 12 years of government was that Australian students did not have access to the learning tools of the 21st century.We have started resolving that. We have allocated $1.2 billion to the direct provision of computers. We have rolled out round 1, benefiting more than 800 schools. Whereas the shadow minister has distorted all of this, the approach the government took in round 1 particularly was to move the schools most in need from their woeful computer to student ratios -  - The core distortion that the shadow minister for education has engaged in concerns round 1, which was for the schools most in need, the schools with the worst student-to-computer ratios. The government said that round was to bring them up to an effective ratio of one to two. We always said that was the first part of the benefit for those schools in a program that was going to bring all schools up to an effective ratio of one to one for students in years 9 to 12 - promised and going to be delivered under the government's program - and then it comes to the time frame that the government outlined in its policy documents and its statement since. Then, of course, in the policy document that we published at the last election, we said:A Rudd Labor Government will work co-operatively with State and Territory Governments and the Catholic and Independent schools systems to partner this program by ensuring schools have sophisticated ICT strategies - including training, client support, maintenance costs and integration with the school curriculum.So we engaged COAG in the delivery of this program just as we consulted independent schools and Catholic schools.At the first COAG meeting late last year the audit was agreed to. That is the audit which showed the shameful legacy of neglect of the Liberal Party opposite - an absolute disgrace, leaving students without any effective access to computers. At the second COAG meeting this year in March we agreed with the states and territories that we would work with them, particularly with the working group of COAG, to assess the legitimate and additional financial implications. That was when the Grimes review was commissioned. The Grimes review was obviously fed into the COAG discussions which resulted, on Saturday, in an additional investment to ensure that the on-costs and deployment of computers, on which we said we would work with the states and territories and the Catholic and independent schools systems, would be delivered; hence the agreement for $807 million. Of course, the Grimes review was made public after it had been worked through in the COAG processes. It was part of the confidential COAG documents up until that point. It is available now.I say to the shadow minister opposite that, if he wants to go to government schools and say that out of this $807 million they should not benefit from $521 million of it, then he can have that discussion, government school by government school. If he wants to go to independent schools and say to them that they should not have the benefit of nearly $121 million more, then he can have that discussion, independent school by independent school. If he wants to go to Catholic schools and say to them that they should not have the benefit of almost $165 million more of investment then he can have that discussion, Catholic school by Catholic school. But what this government is going to get on with doing is what we promised: getting rid of the Liberal Party's shameful track record of neglect in this area and making sure that students in our schools have computers. That is what the digital education revolution is about, that is what we promised and that is what we are going to deliver.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blaxland for his question. The meeting on the weekend was historic. It was a very important meeting, and there was an agreement which caused a substantial fiscal stimulus to the economy. It will create something like 133,000 jobs, and it is an additional $15.1 billion over five years. That is all important, but what was most important about the agreement on the weekend was not the fact that there was no bickering, although that was welcome, but the long-term reform that was contained in the agreement that was signed and the breadth of that reform across a range of critical policy areas that go to the extent of growth and opportunity in our economy. Whether it was in education, in health, in business, in families or in housing, we had ministers who had been working for well over 12 months with their state counterparts to put in place fundamental reforms for the future which will drive productivity and underscore future prosperity in this economy.What this agreement has done is to build the foundations of future prosperity by putting in place a central microeconomic reform. Whether it is teacher quality, is improving outcomes in disadvantaged schools, preventative health or progressing our movement towards a seamless national economy, this government made very substantial progress. Sometimes we hear those opposite claim that we have done nothing in 12 months, that we have done nothing across a range of areas. Through 12 months all of those ministers have worked hard with state counterparts to put in place the foundations for reform that those opposite could not do in 11 long years. That is the significance of the weekend and that is why it is so important.Last year the Productivity Commission undertook a detailed study of what could be gained through cooperative federalism, and the commission found that joined-up efforts on human capital reform alone could result in increases in GDP of around nine per cent after 25 years. That is why this reform is so important. It adds to the productive capacity of the economy in the long term, but so many of the initiatives, particularly in housing and education, generate additional opportunity so that people's talents are not wasted. So it was a historic reform from that point of view, but it was also a historic reform from the point of view of federal-state relations. The number of specific purpose payments was reduced from over 90 to five - a very significant break with the past - and, of course, the introduction of incentives to drive reform at the state level was also important, and also new measures of transparency so the impact of policy can be measured over time. All of these things were important. So this new federal structure which has been put in place will create jobs, it will drive reform and it will stimulate our economy.</DOC>

 - The answer to the member's question is no. Non-government schools are full participants in the government's digital education revolution. Every non-government school in this country will benefit through the digital education revolution program. Can I say to the shadow minister opposite that, actually, the only threat to the funding of non-government schools in this parliament is the members of the Liberal Party who are proposing to block the Schools Assistance Bill 2008 and prevent it delivering money to independent and non-government schools from the start of next year. Can I refer the shadow minister in that regard to the media release today of the Association of Independent Schools of New South Wales - I know you do not want to hear it -  - In the media release from the Association of Independent Schools, Dr Newcombe said:What we don't want is a situation where proposed amendments delay the bill until next year. This would be disastrous for many independent schools.The political party in this parliament that is threatening the funding of independent schools is the Liberal Party. Under the Rudd Labor government's digital education revolution, every independent school, every non-government school, every government school in this country will benefit through the program. The shadow minister should know that. What the shadow minister should do is stop playing politics and threatening funding for non-government schools from 1 January 2009.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kingston for her question. As we know, she maintains a keen interest in all things related to health, and so she might after such an important agreement being reached over the weekend. The Prime Minister and the premiers and chief ministers, as the Treasurer has already mentioned, negotiated a healthcare agreement investing enormous amounts of extra funding into our health system. This importantly started the task of rebuilding after years and years of neglect under the previous government and, as well as investing much needed money into the health system, has resulted in a range of very important reforms - the building blocks that are needed to bring the health system into the 21st century, the building blocks that are needed to invest in the workforce, to invest in prevention and to invest in Indigenous health, where we know that health outcomes are falling so far behind the rest of the country.The Prime Minister has mentioned that we are investing $64.4 billion over the next five years. This is an increase of more than $20 billion or, in other terms, 50 per cent over the last agreement, a very important change when you consider the money that was pulled out of the health system by the previous government when the last agreement was negotiated. But the funding is not in the form of a blank cheque either. It is directly targeted at key pressure points in our system: for example, $750 million going directly into emergency departments across the country. I do not think there would be a member in this House who would say that emergency departments in their hospitals in their electorates will not be able to use that money effectively. It will fund nearly two million extra emergency department services and is very welcome, I know. It includes $1.1 billion to train more doctors, nurses and other health professionals.I want to take the time to explain to the House what, even in 2009, this massive new investment will mean. It means for the first time the Commonwealth will be providing a direct subsidy towards training for 63,000 students just in 2009: 33,000 nursing students, 13,000 medical students and 17,500 allied health students. That is just in 2009. So the magnitude of this investment into our workforce is critical and will build capacity for the future.But this is not just about more money, as much as more money is needed. This agreement is also historic because of significant reforms that we are investing in. For the first time, this agreement is going to include very stringent reporting indicators. The states and territories will report hospital by hospital on key problem areas, such as infection rates, which will help drive improvements in quality. For the first time, this agreement focuses not only on hospitals but also, as the Prime Minister has mentioned, on preventative care, because we know we need to act now, invest now and plan for the future, something those opposite never did in health in their 11 or 12 years in government.Importantly - and I know the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs is particularly pleased about this, as are we all on this side of the House - this agreement invests a $1.6 billion combined contribution from the Commonwealth and the states into Indigenous health, an area that has been neglected for too long and that desperately needs this money. It is going to make sure that we can change long-term health outcomes for Indigenous people.I did notice that the member for Dickson was out yesterday trying to get his name in the newspaper claiming that we were simply throwing good money after bad. So it seems that the coalition's approach to hospitals, which is to cut money and keep cutting it, has not changed. The member for Dickson seems to be arguing for that again. He did seem a little confused and distracted and I wondered if that is just what happens when you are after someone else's job and are not interested in the one that you are meant to be doing. COAG was a significant step forward in repairing the damage that was caused by those opposite and in preparing the health system for the challenges of the future.</DOC>

 - The government's commitment has not changed. Consistent with the discussion of sorts we have just had in this place about the state of digital education in Australian schools - the government was left with a mess on that score by our predecessors which we are now seeking to fix - when it comes to the state of high-speed broadband in the country, we are left with exactly the same challenge. According to the OECD comparative tables, we are lurking right down towards the bottom somewhere between the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. I would have thought that a modern economy seeking to build itself into a 21st century economy could do a lot better than that. But that is where the former government sat, and they flipped and flopped year in and year out without actually delivering any substantive outcome on that score. Broadband is critical in laying out the infrastructure of the 21st century. High-speed broadband is very much the railroad of the 21st century, the arteries of the new economy, and will be a critical piece of infrastructure for the future.The government last week received proposals for the national broadband network. The government, as the honourable member will be aware, received six proposals. It is important to have an open process. The government's independent expert panel will now have eight weeks to assess these proposals and provide advice to government. We intend to get on with the business of investing in the future. -  - I am particularly taken by those opposite who are interjecting who literally sat on their hands about this piece of infrastructure that is so necessary for small businesses, families, and kids wanting to do their homework properly and connect with their teachers. We are making sure that the system is working properly; we are making sure that you can run a home based business. This government has got on with the business of rolling out a national broadband network. We are proud of what we intend to do. We have allocated funding for that purpose. We are getting on with the business of nation building for Australia's future, which those opposite did not know the meaning of when they occupied these benches.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question and for her interest in education in her local community. Last week, prior to the COAG meeting on Saturday, we had in this country Joel Klein, the chancellor of New York schools, speaking about education and transparency. Joel Klein has a remarkable turn of phrase when talking about the need to lift standards in education. He talks about the 'soft bigotry of low expectations', the belief that somehow poorer children cannot get a great education. The Rudd Labor government agrees with Joel Klein and we believe that we should be lifting standards in every school in this country. We are determined to deliver excellence and to deliver an education revolution in every school. That requires a set of interlocking reforms. That is why the COAG meeting on Saturday was so important, because it will deliver a set of reforms that lock into each other and work powerfully together.The first is a new era of transparency, ensuring that we have publicly available information about school quality, the needs and characteristics of student populations within schools, student results, who is doing the teaching and the resources available to that school. Why do we want that information? So we can compare schools with similar student populations. If you see one doing a lot better than the other then you can ask yourself: what is the difference? The difference might be a teacher quality. The difference might be the quality of the principal. The difference might be the community engagement. It might be the resources in the school. Whatever factor we highlight is the difference between the underperforming school and the school that is doing well, we as adults, on behalf of the children in that school, can actually make a difference and fix it. That is why transparency is so powerful and so important. Secondly, we committed ourselves yet again to a national quality curriculum to lift standards in this country. Thirdly, we entered a new national education agreement - $42.4 billion going into schools around the nation.Then we also said that we would invest in a $550 million new national partnership on teacher quality and lifting the quality and support for principals around the country. Then we announced an additional $1.1 billion investment in disadvantaged schools around the nation and an investment of $540 million in literacy and numeracy. We also corrected a historic inequity between the treatment of government primary schools and government secondary schools under the national education agreement, and we will be investing $635 million in government primary schools - an additional investment - to end this longstanding inequity.You would think that members in this House would be able to endorse this kind of agenda. Members in the House should appreciate that there is a member in this House who in 2006, on behalf of the then Liberal government, said:We - meaning the then federal Liberal government - should not have to be investing in state run primary schools.That was a statement to this parliament. It is very interesting to find out who made that statement to this House. It was none other than the member for Sturt, the current shadow minister for education, who does not believe that federal governments should be investing in government primary schools - a most remarkable statement.Presumably that means the member for Sturt and the Liberal Party are opposed to this new investment of $635 million for government primary schools. Presumably that means the member for Sturt and the Liberal Party are opposed to any government dollars going into government primary schools. If that is the position of the Liberal Party then each and every local Liberal Party member in this place should go to every government primary school in their electorates and be honest enough to say, 'The position of my political party, led by the member for Sturt on this question, is that you should not get a cent.' That is what members of the Liberal Party would be obligated to do if they are going to follow the member for Sturt down this disastrous path of saying that a federal government should not be investing in primary schools.We believe in investing in government primary schools and we are proud to be delivering an extra $635 million to them. We are also proud to be presenting to the parliament the Schools Assistance Bill. I make the point yet again that non-government schools in this country are now calling upon the Liberal Party to pass the Schools Assistance Bill, stop playing their cheap and silly politics with schools and with children's education, stop the threat that these schools will not be funded from 1 January 2009, endorse national transparency and endorse national curriculum - something the member for Sturt called today on radio 'offensive'. We do not think transparency is offensive. We do not think national curriculum is offensive. We think it is part of an education revolution to lift standards around this nation. The Liberal Party should withdraw its threat to the funding of non-government schools and the Leader of the Liberal Party should make it clear whether he endorses his shadow minister and believes that federal governments should not put a dollar into primary schools, because it is clearly what his shadow education spokesperson believes.An incident having occurred in the gallery - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and for his very real commitment to closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Australia has taken a very important step in the national effort to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The Council of Australian Governments has now signed up to a $4.6 billion program of Indigenous reforms over the next 10 years. This is a landmark agreement and a major step forward for Indigenous Australians. Indigenous housing is fundamental to these reforms. The Australian government is now going to provide $1.94 billion in new funding for major Indigenous housing reforms.In some remote communities, we have more than a dozen people living in a single home. Conditions are worse than basic: kitchens where you cannot cook a meal; bathrooms where you cannot bathe a child. Decent housing is critical to give Indigenous children a fair start in life. The reforms that were agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments on Saturday will mean that 4,200 new homes can be built and that there will be 4,800 major upgrades to homes. Some 9,000 Indigenous families will benefit. Australian governments have agreed to clear, new responsibilities to drive this change. The states and territories will take responsibility for tenancy management and repairs and maintenance. The Commonwealth funds will see new houses built, major upgrades done and housing assets made good.The reforms will also see the rebuilding of positive community values and behaviour. There will be proper tenancy management arrangements put in place. Tenants will be expected to pay their rent and pay it on time. They will be expected to cover the cost of any damage and be good neighbours. The reforms will also boost economic development as we see construction contractors required to employee Indigenous people.The Council of Australian Governments also agreed to other important closing the gap measures. As the minister for health has already indicated, there will be $1.6 billion over four years to reduce chronic disease, $291 million over six years to improve the delivery of remote services, and $228 million over five years for jobs and economic development. All of these commitments made on Saturday build on the $564 million that was agreed in October for Indigenous early childhood development.As well, the Council of Australian Governments reached social housing and homelessness agreements that the Minister for Housing has worked very hard on. These will help Indigenous people in urban and regional Australia meet their housing needs. The Prime Minister's national apology created a new climate of hope and commitment in this country for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. COAG's $4.6 billion investment reflects this and is a very important step forward in closing the gap.</DOC>

 - The shadow minister has asked me about the deficit or a possible deficit. It is interesting that the Leader of the Opposition has not raised this issue at all today given the dilemmas that he got into on ABC radio this morning. We have said that a deficit is not necessary now but that it is irresponsible to rule it out. That is the case because of the global financial crisis. We have said that we will take whatever action is necessary and responsible in the circumstances to strengthen our economy and to protect jobs. Those opposite have said the opposite. They have clearly said that they will not act to protect jobs - they have clearly said that. But we have said that we will act. We have never ruled a deficit out. We have also said that if there was a temporary deficit then it should be for the shortest time possible consistent with strengthening growth and jobs.Australians can take heart that there is a federal government and a Reserve Bank doing everything they possibly can to strengthen our economy, given the threat to our economy from the global financial crisis. We expect in all of this for the banks to play their role in being part of the effort to strengthen the economy and should there be a cut in official interest rates to pass it on as responsibly and fully as possible. We have said all of those things to strengthen the economy.But where is the opposition in the middle of that? They will not act to protect jobs. On the radio this morning, the Leader of the Opposition boxed himself into a corner on the issue of deficits. He only has two options now: to repudiate his position of last week and admit he was wrong or continue in the fantasy land that he was in this morning. This morning, he was asked four times on the radio whether he would run a deficit. Four times, he dodged that question - four times. When he finally got pinned down, he said, 'Look, it's the quality of the spending.' Which spending have we announced that does not meet that benchmark? Perhaps he can answer that question. Is it the payments to pensioners and families? Is it the money that was spent in COAG? Is it money to be spent on infrastructure? What does not meet that standard? - We now know that they are not in favour of additional spending on education - we know that. Those opposite can either be part of the solution or part of the problem. - The member for Sturt has confirmed they are opposed to that expenditure. Things are getting so confused over there that they are running around stabbing each other in the chest! You have the member for Sturt, the member for Dickson and the member for North Sydney all running around jockeying. What the community expects at the moment is leadership from political leaders, and what they want and what they are getting from the Rudd government is leadership to tackle the global financial crisis, to put in place decisive action - and it would help if those opposite got on board, because it is very important. What could be more irresponsible at a time of global financial crisis, for example, than to have the opposition attacking our regulators? What could be more irresponsible than that? Those over there are simply at sea when it comes to the whole question of the budget bottom line and what needs to be done to strengthen this economy and to protect jobs. Their attitude is: do nothing. Our attitude is to act decisively and put in place a range of policies which protect households and protect jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question and his ongoing interest in infrastructure, particularly on the Central Coast. On Saturday, COAG endorsed the national public-private partnership policy and guidelines that have been developed through the COAG Infrastructure Working Group and through Infrastructure Australia. Best practice nationally consistent PPP guidelines can save governments and industry more time and money and make the Australian infrastructure market more attractive to foreign investors. This is what the peak industry body, Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, chaired by Mark Birrell, had to say about these guidelines:COAG's adoption today of the new PPP guidelines will be welcomed by industry and means that, for the first time, Australia has a consistent method to assess the best option to deliver major infrastructure projects _The adoption of these new national guidelines therefore marks an important step in the ongoing reform of Australia's infrastructure marketplace.This action is good for competition, good for the economy and, at the end of the day, good for taxpayers. There is no doubt that we had to take action after 12 years of infrastructure neglect from those opposite. It took them some five years to amend section 51AD and division 16D of the Income Tax Assessment Act, even after they were advised that this was actually a disincentive to private investment in infrastructure.The Rudd government has acknowledged from day one that, whilst we are prepared to lift public investment in infrastructure, we also want to mobilise capital from the private sector. In particular, we have looked towards the superannuation industry, where there are good long-term returns. Using super as infrastructure investment capital makes sense, but up until recently this was opposed by those opposite. Indeed, the former shadow minister for infrastructure, the member for Wide Bay, was cautioning against this when we made announcements in February. This is what he had to say:There is $1 trillion in those funds at the present, but it is there for a particular purpose. Now we can't ask those funds to spend money on projects - roads, dams, whatever it might be.I was surprised to hear the shadow minister for infrastructure - the new one - yesterday discover the idea of superannuation going into infrastructure. They did nothing about it for 12 years, made no policy changes and were hostile to any reform, but yesterday the shadow minister for infrastructure said that he wanted to look at 'removing the roadblocks to superannuation funds in Australia investing here'. I note that it appears in the Age today. It is a pity it was on the front page of the Age a month ago, when the government had meetings with the superannuation industry about this very issue.But it seems that plagiarism is contagious on that side of the House. They are catching it along their front bench. They are adopting Labor's policy then seeking to undermine it. Our reform agenda on infrastructure speaks for itself. We are the first government to engage not just the Commonwealth and state governments through the COAG process but also the private sector directly through Infrastructure Australia - a reform opposed by those opposite, a reform opposed month after month. We will see how they vote this afternoon on the government's Nation-building Funds Bill. We will see how they vote and whether they support the reform agenda that is being put forward by this government, which is committed to nation building.</DOC>

 - If that was intended as a job app-lication from the member for Goldstein, he should try again. Maybe the member for Curtin will survive another week because 'Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look' and a very activist briefing strategy, as we have seen in recent days. On the question of the reform of federalism: firstly, prior to this COAG there was something in the order of 96 specific purpose payments; and, secondly, as a result of the meeting and the agreement rea-ched by all premiers and chief ministers, in-cluding the Liberal Premier of Western Aust-ralia - I note in passing - that number has been reduced to five. The core element of the reform, as it goes to both the specific purpose payments and the national partnership agreements, is this: rather than have an exclusive focus on input measures for the fut-ure, let us have a commonly agreed system of measurement to work out what exactly is produced as a consequence of funding arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states. In other words, how many people are being treated within a given time frame in emergency departments? How many elective surgery procedures are being undertaken as a consequence of agreements between the Commonwealth and the states? What are we achieving in terms of transparency outcomes from schools? What are we achieving in terms of the proper training of principals to become change managers within their schools? What outcomes should be delivered when it comes to the future provision of public housing? Each of these reforms, gone over painstakingly by Commonwealth and state ministers and officials for 12 months, has been about a fundamental transformation of the way in which Commonwealth-state relations work.In the past what the Commonwealth did was walk up and say: 'Here's a bucket of money - less than last time. Take it. Goodbye. So long. We don't care about it.' Why? The political agenda of the member for Goldstein - if the member could be bothered to focus on the answer which is being delivered to the question he just asked - is politics first, second, third and last in every single equa-tion and the political agenda of those opposite was as follows: they wanted simply to preserve a political agenda to blame the states on every occasion possible, a tired political script of which every family and every com-munity group in the country has, frankly, had a gutful. They want some change, they want transparency and they want to know what is actually being delivered by virtue of the taxpayer dollars which are being invested.Therefore, the reform of the Federation is consistent with the principles that we articulated in opposition to begin ending the blame game, to produce outcomes measures for this $15.1 billion investment with the states and territories into the future so that we genuinely produce better hospitals, better emergency departments, better arrangements for elective surgery, better schools, better public housing, better services for the homeless and better arrangements for closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. That is the reform agenda. I would suggest that those opposite became interested in reform because this government is committed to the national interest in the long term. Those opposite, led by the Leader of the Opposition, are interested in one thing - that is, their political self-interest. The stark difference between these two agendas screams out today in terms of the pattern of questions embraced by those opposite as being opposed to the policy and project of reform action that we have articulated.I finish with this: the member for Sturt let the cat out of the bag before on computers in schools. In response to the presentation by the Treasurer about what quality funding and what quality spending those opposite would support or not support, the member for Sturt, the shadow minister for education, said, 'Fund-ing for computers in schools did not fit that criteria'. Unless the member for Sturt and the Leader of the Opposition stand at the dispatch box and repudiate that position, let it so be declared on 1 December 2008 that the federal Liberal Party stood opposed to the delivery of funding for computers in schools. That is what the member for Sturt said before. If it is not your policy, stand up and confirm that it is not your policy. This government has a program of reform; you have a program of politics, pure and simple.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. He has raised with me his concern in this area. He has had a number of families in his constituency asking about the circumstances of getting their families home. The government has become very frustrated with the consequences of the events that have occurred in Thailand but no more frustrated than those that are stranded there in Thailand and seeking to get home. Over the weekend, the Minister for Infrastruc-ture, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government contacted Qantas to see what could be done to ease the situation. I am pleased to advise that they are putting on a flight, which will leave very early tomor-row morning, through Phuket that has the capacity to bring 300 Australians back home.At the embassy level, we have been very active in engaging. We have taken 3,000 calls from people wanting further information as well as canvassing the hotels in Bangkok seeking to establish the particular circumstances of Australians, and some 400 Australians have been contacted in this context. Of course, one flight is not going to be enough. We have had further discussions with Qantas and with Jetstar, and I am pleased to be able to also inform the House that just this afternoon Qantas has indicated it has scheduled a second emergency flight to leave early Wednesday morning, again through Phuket. Jetstar is also rescheduling its Melbourne-Bangkok flight through Bangkok. So between the three of these aircraft there will be something like 900 seats out of Thailand. I would like to place on record our appreciation to both Qantas and Jetstar for the effective and constructive way in which they have responded to the concerns of these families that have been expressed not only through the government but through the members of this House. I should also indicate that the two airports - the international airport, Suvarnabhumi, and the domestic airport, Don Muang - remain closed. This is disrupting many opportunities for people to get home.We are concerned about the circumstances in Thailand and today we have reviewed and reissued the travel advice. Whilst the overall level of advice on Thailand as a whole has not changed, the level of advice for Bangkok has and we are recommending now that people reconsider their need to travel to Bangkok at this time due to the continued closure of the main airports and the limited availability of flights.A final point I would make is that these demonstrations and protests are causing enormous damage to the economy of Thailand. It relies very heavily on the tourism market, but it is also a significant trading facility within the region. Our very strong urging, through the frustration that we are experiencing, is for the parties involved in this to resolve their differences and get the country back to normal. Its resolution is not only in the interests of allaying the concerns and frustrations of Australian families in terms of their loved ones but also, in this current global financial crisis, in bringing order, stability and confidence back where it is most sorely needed.</DOC>

 - The government takes seriously the future pressures and stresses which will be placed on employment in Australia. That is why we have embraced and implemented an Economic Security Strategy of $10.4 billion, which is capable of generating some 75,000 jobs. That is why, as the second part of our Economic Security Strategy, we have also embraced a car plan for the future of $6.2 billion to support an industry which currently employs some 200,000 Australians. Thirdly, that is why we have embraced our local government infrastructure program in our arrangements with local authorities when we convened recently here in Canberra. Fourthly, there is the outcome of the Council of Australian Governments of $15.1 billion in additional funding capable of generating employment, again, of some 133,000 jobs over the period covered by the agreements.When it comes to the future of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme the government in the development of its strategy has been entirely mindful of, firstly, dealing with the challenges we all face with the future of greenhouse gas emissions and, secondly, doing so in an economically responsible fashion. I contrast that with the government that we replaced which, after 12 years in office, did absolutely nothing, including failing to ratify Kyoto, failing to take any concrete action in terms of the finalisation of an emissions trading scheme and failing to act at any real level of policy. Internally throughout that period the Liberal Party and the National Party were split right down the middle on the question of climate change, replete with climate change sceptics across their joint party room, and that remains the case today, particularly led by my good friend the member for Groom, who is kind of the climate change sceptic from Central Casting. If you want a climate change sceptic, go to the member for Groom - I know this bloke very well. He has never believed in climate change from day one and that remains his position today.In designing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme the government has produced a green paper. We have outlined there our approach in obtaining the right balance between protecting the environment through proper attention to bringing down greenhouse gas emissions in the future for Australia and internationally and, at the same time, bringing about appropriate structural adjustments for Australian industry. We are entirely mindful of getting that balance right. In 12 months we have travelled further than the previous government travelled in 12 years on this not just through the ratification of the Kyoto protocol -  -  - It is wonderful to hear the climate change sceptics from Central Casting howling. - We have a clear-cut strategy for the future. We will get the balance right.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, 2008 has been a big year for Australia when it comes to climate change with a number of important actions from the government to enable the transition to a low-pollution economy. After 11 years of inaction, we still have a lot of ground to make up, but we have made significant and important progress on the way. As the Prime Minister has just remarked, we ratified immediately the Kyoto protocol. We received the reports of Professor Ross Garnaut. We released an extensive green paper on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and consulted widely on the propositions set out in that paper. We have completed the most comprehensive economic modelling exercise undertaken by the Australian Treasury on the costs of climate change action. Last week the government announced that it would round out the year by releasing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme white paper and medium-term target range on Monday, 15 December.The government understands that the current global economic circumstances make the task of governments around the world that much more difficult. But transitioning to a low-pollution economy is vital for Australia's long-term prosperity and the global financial crisis makes it more, not less, important that we tackle the big economic challenges. This is an economic reform that the gov-ernment knows we must undertake. We know the economic costs and the environmental consequences of failing to act on dan-gerous climate change are great. We will have rising sea levels, more coastal inundation, more frequent and intense droughts, impacts on tourism and, of course, impacts on jobs as well. We understand that growing the green-collar economy and having a forward energy efficiency strategy mean there are significant opportunities for skilled employ-ment and that jobs will be a focus for the government in that respect. So we cannot simply delay the challenges of the future because the economic circumstances are difficult today.The Leader of the Opposition says that he supports action on climate change, but we are yet to see any evidence of that from the coalition. We have seen evidence that the Leader of the Opposition could not convince his former cabinet colleagues to take serious action on climate change. We read about that in the newspapers when he could not convince them to ratify Kyoto. We have seen evidence that the member for Goldstein, who is assisting with the coalition's emissions trading policy, thinks that climate change is a leftist fad, that it is the new communism. And, of course, we know and we have seen evidence that the member for Groom cannot wait to roll out nuclear reactors around our coastline.The question here is: where is the evidence of the Leader of the Opposition's ability to unite the coalition on climate change action? We will not find any evidence of that today because we now have the National Party refusing to support carbon sinks legislation - legislation that was introduced by the previous government when the Leader of the Opposition was environment minister. That is right: the coalition are divided on legis-lation their own leader described as 'a key element in addressing climate change'. This is the second example in two weeks of the opposition failing to support legislation that the Leader of the Opposition championed when he was environment minister. We hope that the opposition leader will be more responsible when it comes to passing the water bill this week.Next year, the government will introduce landmark legislation on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and we expect a critical and robust debate in this House because this is a substantial economic reform. But the Leader of the Opposition's handling of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme debate depends on there being some unity on the other side of the House on this issue. Given that they are divided on carbon sinks legislation, given that there is a cabal of climate change sceptics, given that the member for Goldstein is out there talking about communist plots, given that the opposition leader will not stand up to the member for Groom who talks about nuclear issues, when will the opposition leader show us exactly what the coalition stands for on climate change?</DOC>

 - There they go again! And a highly principled question from the member for Murray. - The member for Murray referred to 'a surge' in boat people. In 2008 there have been four boats with 48 passengers. In 2007 there were five boats with 148 passengers. If this year we have had a surge, that was a deluge. I would suggest that the honourable member for Murray in asking her principled question begin by framing her question on the facts in terms of where boat arrivals and passengers on board have stood this year against where they stood last year and during the full duration of her government's period in office. Fact 1. - The contention by those opposite, and this has been the general commentary as well, that people smugglers are somehow back in business assumes that people smugglers have somehow been out of business in the past. I would suggest to those opposite, particularly those engaged in the foreign policy debate, that they acquaint them-selves, in a conversation with our friends in Indonesia and elsewhere, with the fact that the people-smuggling industry has con-tinued over the years. The critical question is how we cooperate with our friends in the international community, most particularly in the Republic of Indonesia, in dealing with this challenge. This government, like the government which preceded us, seeks actively to work with our friends in Indonesia to do so. We will continue to do so at every level. Furthermore, in terms of the matters which the honourable member refer-red to about the deployment of Australian naval resources, can I say again: her facts are inaccurate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question. The House is well aware that this year's budget contained a number of measures to protect government revenue and ensure the integrity of the tax base going into the future. It is fair to say that some of these measures have been controversial, with the Liberal and National parties opposing these measures in this House and in the other house.These are the same people who over the last week have been doing their best to outdo Herbert Hoover as they argue that surpluses must always be protected at all costs. The irony of the Liberal and National parties opposing revenue and savings measures while ramping up their rhetoric about budget surpluses appears to have escaped them. But on this side of the House we know that the $40 billion hit which has been carried out on the federal budget as a result of the global financial situation has made these measures even more important.Not only does the opposition not understand this, but their irresponsibility has reached new levels. I have to report to the House that the Liberal Party is planning to gut another revenue measure by this government. The opposition has indicated that they will tonight in the other house vote to emasculate the government's measure to require the superannuation of temporary residents to be paid to the Commonwealth after that resident has left Australia and their visa has expired. This is a sensible measure and emasculating it will have no benefit for any Australian or for the Australian economy. Gutting this measure will not stimulate the Australian economy and it will not add to the savings of any Australian. The only thing that this measure by the opposition will do is potentially blow another $860 million hole in this budget.This measure has been uncontroversial up until now. Of all the revenue measures that the government announced, this is one that the opposition have not opposed up until now. Apart from it being good policy, there is another reason this has been uncontroversial. This government is always keen to give credit where it is due, and this policy was not all our idea. In fact it was announced on 15 October last year by the previous Treasurer. The member for Higgins said on 15 October:I am announcing today that, effective from 1 July 2008, all future superannuation contributions and balances for temporary residents will be required to be paid to the Australian Government which will hold them on behalf of those who are entitled to them.It is a good policy, Mr Speaker, one that we are happy to implement. I table the former Treasurer's press release announcing the measure and, through you, say to the shadow Treasurer: why don't you plagiarise this one? This is more material for the member for Dickson, who has been out all weekend undermining the member for Curtin, backgrounding newspapers that she has got to go. And now there is more material for the member for Dickson to use in his campaign to become shadow Treasurer. - This brings coalition recklessness to a new level. We know that they oppose our sensible measures but now they are opposing their own. Mr Speaker, on the one hand they lecture us on fiscal rectitude, but on the other hand they oppose sensible ideas to protect government revenue. It is just another reminder that when it comes to the Leader of the Opposition you have got to look at what he does and not at what he says.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Yes, this is a government that has acted decisively to keep this nation in front as we confront the global financial crisis and its effects on our real economy. I know that, day to day, members of the Liberal Party equivocate about whether or not they support our $10.4 billion economic security statement. The Leader of the Opposition was equivocating on radio this morning. We put that money into the economic security statement because we wanted to ensure that we were doing everything we could to pro-tect Australian jobs. The estimates are that that statement and the economic activity that it is obviously going to prime are worth 75,000 jobs. What sectors are they in? We have obviously put money into the hands of families and pensioners so the economic activity will be reflected in the things that they buy and use, and we have directly put money into the residential construction sector through the first home owners grant and its ex-ten-sion to $21,000 for people who enter a contract for a newly-constructed home. On the COAG announcements on the weekend, once again it is more money into the economy, more money where it will make a difference in health services and in education. - I was talking about jobs: jobs in our economy, jobs flowing from the economic security statement, jobs in the construction sector - I know this is complicated for the member, but if he just sticks with it he might learn something - and then more money out of COAG on the weekend into vital services - education, health, disability and social housing. Obviously, for the provision of those services, the construction of social housing is associated with jobs. That is, people work to get those things done. That is why the Prime Minister, when he spoke about these matters on Saturday surrounded by the premiers - including the Liberal Premier of Western Australia - indicated that the COAG deal was there to provide all those vital services and also to deal with some of the circumstances we find ourselves in after the global financial crisis with its impacts on the Australian economy. We are doing everything we can to ensure that we protect and create jobs in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bass for her question. I know about her interest in university education, having met with various university education people in Tasmania as a result of her recommendations that I do.This is a government that is proudly committed to phasing out full-fee-paying places for undergraduate students in Australian universities. That is because we believe that access to university should be based on merit, not capacity to pay. Of course, we are now in the last sitting week before this policy will start to be implemented. It will be implemented in the next academic year: in the 2009 academic year, the phase-out will begin. In terms of the phase-out, we have provided transition funds to universities. We have also provided extra Commonwealth supported places. We obviously want to enable Australian students to be undergraduates. We want the Commonwealth supported places to be there but we do want to make sure that all of this is done on the basis of merit, not capacity to pay. This is a great Australian value.I have been asked whether or not there are alternative approaches on the question of paying for education. We know, of course, that the former Liberal government, after promising that there would not be $100,000 university degrees in this country, implemented just that. They introduced into this country the concept of Australian students paying for their undergraduate places. We are getting rid of that. When we look at the contributions of past education ministers on this question, the contribution of the member for Bradfield and the contribution of the current shadow Treasurer, they were people who supported Australian students paying for their undergraduate places.My attention has been drawn to a series of statements by the shadow Treasurer on the question of education and the question of paid-for courses. My attention has been drawn to a statement she made in April 2006 where she talked about her own studies and said that she was privileged to be an international student at Harvard. Then in July 2006 she went on to describe that she was an international student at Harvard Business School in the mid-1990s, living amongst and studying with 180 senior business people from over 35 countries. She is nodding - that is right.An opposition member - It's Christmas! - On the subject of paying for education, my point is simply this: the shadow Treasurer has obviously tried to create an impression that she was at Harvard for an extended period of time in the mid-1990s. The truth is she was there for a summer program, for a course that now costs $60,000. That is $10,000 per week, $2,000 per day - An opposition member - In Australia. - Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Can I say to members of the House generally and particularly to the shadow Treasurer that you do not buy credibility; you earn it - something she has got to learn.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I have noted from the newspapers in recent weeks how convivial the relationship is between the Leader of the Opposition and the Australian banking industry. I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that at a time of global financial crisis the stability of the banking system is of first and fundamental importance. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that of what Treasury advised me to be 13 AA rated banks around the world today four are in Australia. Some six or seven are in Canada. That goes to the effectiveness of Australia's prudential regulatory authorities. It also goes to the way in which the banks have conducted their own financial arrangements.On the question of interest rate reductions, I also find it remarkable that the party represented by those opposite, which presided over 10 interest rate rises in a row, would provide anyone on this side of the House with a lecture about how interest rate policy should be conducted in this country. I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition should reflect on his own statements in recent times, in which he said that a 25 basis point rise was nothing to get terribly excited about. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that the government's position today is as it has always been, and that is that any official interest rate reduction should be passed through by the banks as rapidly as possible.</DOC>

 - Honourable members may be aware of statements from the United States overnight from the US National Bureau of Economic Research. This is the body that officially records recessions in the US and it announced overnight that the economy of the United States entered into recession in December 2007. The NBER dates recessions based on their analysis of economic activity, and the NBER committee noted that declines in major indicators like employment, manufacturing activity, retail sales and industrial production met the standard of a recession. A large factor is employment, and the United States has lost 1.2 million jobs so far this year.Although the committee noted that the recession started in December, they went on further to note that events were getting worse. I quote from their statement of 1 December US time:Many of these indicators, including monthly data on the largest component of GDP, consumption, have declined sharply in recent months.This bad data from the United States has also been reflected in developments in equity markets in the last 24 hours. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 680 points or 7.7 per cent. We have seen European stocks similarly affected. Overnight, they were lower, with the FTSE 200 down 5.2 per cent.What we see here is an unfolding series of events: negative developments in global financial markets impacting on the real economy, in turn impacting back on financial markets - in this case, the equities markets. That is why action by governments nationally and through international coordination is necessary to turn back this tide.In addition to the United States having officially entered into recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, we have a large number of other economies around the world which have also entered recession. In the Euro area, that has been confirmed. Japan, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Singapore, Hong Kong and New Zealand, among others, are in recession. We see not only these economies entering into recession but also a large number of economies entering into budget deficits, with some 23 of the 30 OECD countries forecast to be in deficit in 2009, including the world's three largest economies, the United States, Japan and Germany. On top of that, we see their unemployment data rising. In fact, unemployment is forecast to rise by eight million across the OECD in the course of 2009.Australia is not immune from the global financial crisis, nor are we immune from the impact on our real economy. That is why in MYEFO we forecast downwards revisions as far as growth is concerned. We forecast that unemployment would rise in Australia. If recession deepens around the rest of the world, there is a grave risk that these figures could become worse. In responding to these adverse global and economic developments it is quite important to be clear cut about the fact that there are no easy solutions and no quick fixes. This will be a long and drawn out crisis.But this government's policy is clear. It is about two things: firstly, stabilising Australian financial markets and, secondly, taking whatever action is necessary to continue to support economic growth and jobs into the future in order to protect Australia to the greatest extent possible from the impact of the global financial crisis. On the question of the stabilisation of financial markets, those measures undertaken by the government include the bank guarantees that we have provided, including bank guarantees for more than 15 million deposit accounts as well as the term funding guarantees for our banks, building societies and credit unions - a necessary action in order to stabilise the Australian financial system.Of course, the second objective of government policy in these difficult global economic circumstances has been to continue to support growth and jobs. That has underpinned the government's Economic Security Strategy. That is why in October we released a $10.4 billion stimulus package capable of supporting additional employment of some 75,000 jobs in the economy. Part 2 of the government's Economic Security Strategy has been the support that we have offered to the car industry of some $6.2 billion, also necessary to support long term the 200,000 jobs in the Australian automotive sector which depend on the continued vitality of that sector, which is under grave stress.Part 3 of the Economic Security Strategy was what the government did in concert with local government with our $300 million package of injection into local economic activity and jobs creation through the first meeting of the Australian Council of Local Government held in Canberra. Part 4 was the agreement reached with premiers and chief ministers in the Council of Australian Governments meeting held most recently in Canberra last weekend, injecting $15.1 billion - again an injection necessary for long-term reform but also an injection necessary to continue to support growth and jobs, an injection itself capable of generating a further 133,000 jobs. Part 5 of our Economic Security Strategy will be our nation-building agenda which we will proceed to announce over the coming months.The government's course of action in responding to these adverse international economic circumstances is clear cut. We have seen the impact of recession in the United States. We have seen the impact of recession across the OECD, including in the world's three largest economies. We see the impact that has on their own budget circumstances. We see the impact that has, in turn, on employment. The year 2009 will be a tough year ahead. The government's economic strategy is clear. The global financial crisis will affect Australia's growth and jobs. We are concerned that the global economic recession will further impact negatively on Australia's projections in both these areas, but the government strategy is clear cut and the government is resolute in implementing that strategy for the future.</DOC>

 - The honourable Leader of the Opposition asked me about inflation. I would draw his attention to repeated statements by the Reserve Bank of Australia over a long period of time about the inflationary challenges which existed in the Australian economy and the capacity constraints which underpinned those inflationary pressures - a failure on the part of the previous government to invest in infrastructure and in skills at a critical time of need. The consequence of that was successive interest rate rises, and the consequence of that was felt by Australian mortgage payers right across the country with 10 interest rate rises in a row. I would suggest the honourable Leader of the Opposition pay very close attention to the economic record of those opposite on the inflation question and on the interest rate question. This government has a clear economic strategy for the period ahead. We intend to get on with the business of running the economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for her question. Of course, she is very interested in education reform and making sure that every school in her electorate is a great school. The Rudd government's priorities are to ensure that every Australian child receives a world-class education and that every school in this country, no matter what school system it is from - whether it is a government school, an independent school or a Catholic school - is a great school.At the COAG meeting on Saturday we took some very big steps forward for this new era of education reform for this education revolution. Those steps included a new era of transparency, school by school, including making sure that the needs and characteristics of the student population are apparent, as are its academic results and the teaching and financial resources at its command. We took a step forward on a quality national curriculum. We ensured that there would be more than $42 billion invested through the new national education agreement. We committed more than $500 million - indeed, $550 million - to raising the quality of teaching and of school leadership in this country. There is a new investment of $1.1 billion in disadvantaged schools, a $540 million investment in literacy and numeracy and a new $635 million investment in government primary schools to end a longstanding funding inequity.We have the Schools Assistance Bill 2008 in the Senate, and its agenda is complementary to the agenda agreed at COAG on Saturday. I want to make it absolutely clear that there is not one requirement or expectation for government schools that the government is not also putting onto non-government schools. We want complete equity - all requirements and all expectations on schools, government and non-government, to be the same. The Schools Assistance Bill that is in the Senate deals with a new transparency and accountability framework - that is, it deals with exactly the transparency and accountability measures that we have agreed through COAG will be there for government schools. Within that framework we will be asking schools to report on information about resources available to schools, and there will be a financial questionnaire to the department - and there is a financial questionnaire to the department now. I have indicated, in making publicly available information about school resources, that it is not now and has never been the intention of the government to require publication that would identify individual donors or payers. It is not now, and it has never been, the intention of the government to do that.The government is committed to a national curriculum. We went to the last election promising a national curriculum and we have had 12 months of development of a national curriculum. That work is going very well and there is cooperation. The non-government system has been involved in that work every step of the way, with the Catholic and independent schools systems serving with representatives on the national curriculum board.Of course, the shadow minister for education stands in the way of these reforms. He has described transparency and national curriculum as offensive. He said that they are things that should be opposed. I would like to inform the House that, in dealing with education reform and the future for Australian children, I have had some constructive discussions today with Senator Xenophon, who is committed to ensuring that Australian students get good quality education. He is taking a constructive approach to the bill. He has raised with the government some technical amendments that he would like to see made to the bill. But he is committed to ensuring that non-government schools open their doors next year with the benefit of government resources. He is also committed to ensuring that there is a national curriculum and that there are transparency arrangements.We have discussed with Senator Xenophon, who is taking a constructive approach, some amendments relating to the minister's power to refuse to authorise payment or to delay payment if the audit of a school or school authority is expressed to be qualified. Obviously, the government recognises it is a big thing to act in such a matter and potentially to delay or withhold funds. Senator Xenophon has raised the suggestion about this being a disallowable instrument. That is a constructive suggestion and one the government is prepared to work on. And, of course, the government is prepared to clarify that we have never intended the publication or declaration of individual funding sources. Anybody who has followed this debate would have heard me make that statement on a number of occasions.While Senator Xenophon is dealing with this constructively in order to get funds into the hands of non-government schools, we have the shadow minister for education playing his petty politics, as he is playing right now. He is committing the Liberal Party to stand in the way of delivering $24 billion of resources into the hands of non-government schools. I know the shadow minister for education is irresponsible and committed to playing politics, but I do call on the Leader of the Opposition to try and instil in his political party some modicum of responsibility, particularly enough responsibility to ensure non-government schools have the government funding that we have promised them from the start of the next school year.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. The government continues to say, as we have always said, that just as we expect interest rate cuts to be passed on as soon as possible to residential customers, so too do we have that expectation for Australia's farmers and Australia's small businesses.The comments quoted were made by me at a summit held on a Friday when I had a high expectation that we would begin to see those cuts coming through. Most of the banks then went ahead with cuts on the Monday following that Friday, but the 75 basis points cut, which happened subsequently, has largely not been passed on at all to Australia's farmers. When I addressed the Farm Writers Association, only last Friday, I again pressed the expectation, and I continue to make the expectation of the government clear to the banks, that just as we expect residential customers to receive the benefits of cash based products - obviously if it is a market based product then it is not based on the Reserve Bank cash rate - so too do we expect the same for Australia's farmers.</DOC>

 - I would like to particularly thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question because he is a great advocate for people with disabilities. As he said, tomorrow is a very significant day for people with disabilities. Last Saturday, at the Council of Australian Governments meeting, a major agreement was reached that will certainly help to see the lives of people with disabilities, their families and their carers improved. At that meeting it was agreed that the Commonwealth will inject more than $400 million in new funds for more services and important reform in a new National Disability Agreement.It is very important to acknowledge that this is on top of the $1.9 billion agreed to by disability ministers in May this year. At that meeting in May of all the state and territory disability ministers along with my Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, the member for Maribyrnong, it was agreed that this money would be spent to provide more than 24,000 additional places in much needed supported accommodation, respite and in-home care. All of these additional services have now been rolled into the National Disability Agreement.The $1.9 billion included $100 million which the Prime Minister announced in May. He announced that additional $100 million to go specifically to meet the needs of those carers who are getting older and are finding it more and more difficult to care for the people they love. The Prime Minister and my cabinet colleagues will recall that at our community cabinet in Penrith earlier this year a mother told an extraordinary story of her life caring for her son, who is now 26 years old, and of just how difficult it has been for her and the burden that she has carried for all of his life as she has cared for him. She of course has done that out of love for him, as all members would acknowledge. But, more than anything, she is concerned about what is going to happen to him as she ages. So that was the purpose of the additional $100 million in funding that was announced following that very important meeting in Penrith.The Commonwealth is now providing the highest level of indexation - more than six per cent - ever provided under a disability agreement. The new National Disability Agreement will see Commonwealth investment into state run disability services reach $5.3 billion over the next five years. This will bring the Commonwealth's contribution to these disability services to more than $1.25 billion a year by the time the agreement ends in 2013. This is a very significant increase on the $620 million that was provided by the previous government in the 2007 funding year.We now have common agreement across the states and territories for reform in this important area. Our funding commitment includes a $70 million sign-on bonus to promote our reform agenda, and that will cover population service benchmarking, single access points, improved access to aids and equipment, and better quality assurance. This has, I am pleased to say, as recently as yesterday been recognised by Carers Australia. They said:The National Disability Agreement reached on the weekend shows that the Rudd government is not only listening to the concerns of people with disability, carers and their families, but is also prepared to act.We are acting to improve the lives of hundreds of thousands of people with a disability. We want them to be able to live as independently as possible; to participate in the community, free from the barriers of access, discrimination or exclusion; and to get the services and support that they need.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for his question. The fact is that there is a divide in this House. There is a divide between those people who support world-class broadband and those who failed to act for 12 long years. I find it particularly interesting that it is not the shadow minister for this portfolio but the Leader of the National Party who asks a question relating to regional services, because what we know is that under the former government's plan for broadband they had two systems: one for the city - one for my electorate, in which you could get world-class broadband services - and another for his own. The one for his own, of course, was a second-class system.What we saw from those opposite over 12 long years was a different plan every month but no action. There were different plans for regional communities, different plans for the nation, but no actual progress. What this government is committed to as part of our commitment to lifting world-class infrastructure and nation building is $4.7 billion as our contribution to building the national broadband network. We know this is critical for Australia's economic growth. We know that when it comes to national broadband we rate below Slovenia when it comes to world-class broadband. - Of course we also have for schools the hundred million dollar program done by the Deputy Prime Minister for fibre to the schools, which will work in with our computers in schools program. When it comes to a national broadband network and modern communications we stand for progress. They stand with the world of dinosaurs. They are not only opposed to our national broadband network, they are not only opposed to national infrastructure and they are not only opposed to nation building; they are actually opposed to the computers themselves. - Absolutely, Mr Speaker, because we on this side know that to get broadband in schools you actually need a computer, something that is not understood by those opposite. When it comes to infrastructure, whether it be communications, whether it be rail, whether it be roads, whether it be water, whether it be ports, those opposite stand opposed to every single initiative of the Rudd government. But we will not be deterred from our nation-building agenda.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I can inform the House that the Reserve Bank has just announced that it will be reducing the official cash rate by 100 basis points to 4.25 per cent. We join with the families and the businesses of the nation in welcoming this very substantial relief. This is a vital rate cut from the Reserve Bank, delivered at a time when all our joint efforts are directed towards strengthening the economy and protecting Australian jobs. For these reasons the government does expect the banks to pass this on in full. Decisions taken by the RBA since September can give savings of up to something like $600 a month for families with a $300,000 mortgage.I am pleased to say that I have just been informed that the Commonwealth Bank has just announced that it will be passing on the RBA rate cut in full. This means that someone with a $300,000 mortgage at the Commonwealth Bank will receive a monthly saving on their mortgage of $193 per month. This is certainly welcome news for all of those who have a mortgage with the Commonwealth Bank.With this cut in official interest rates and the Economic Security Strategy that we have put in place and those payments coming on stream this month, monetary and fiscal policy are working together to give relief to families and to protect jobs. I would just like to quote from the Reserve Bank's statement, which said:Together with the spending measures announced by the government, and a large fall in the Australian dollar exchange rate, significant policy stimulus will be supporting demand over the year ahead.So what we have is fiscal policy and monetary policy working in tandem to strengthen the Australian economy. That is why the government took early action. That is why the government took decisive action to support Australian families and businesses in the context of the global financial crisis. This means that all arms of policy are directed at buffering this country from the worst that the world can throw at us. That is why strong action and early action are so vital and the government will not hesitate to take further action should that be necessary.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member's question, it is important that the banks act to pass on interest rate cuts to the maximum number of customers using the maximum range of credit instruments. That is absolutely the case. The honourable member should reflect on the historical record of the credit card rates during the period his own party was in office. But, then again, the facts can be very discomforting.This government, as the Treasurer has just indicated, welcomes the statement by the Reserve Bank. It represents a significant further easing in monetary policy. As the Treasurer has just indicated to the House, what we have now is monetary policy and fiscal policy acting in order to stimulate the economy. The government's policy and the nation's policy is clear: we are confronting a global financial crisis that is becoming a global economic crisis and this government is determined to act ahead of the curve and to act in partnership with monetary policy to do everything within our power to support growth, families and jobs into the future. That is our policy; what is yours?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for his ongoing interest in health issues and particularly for his interest in prevention. On the weekend we saw huge new investments in our hospital system. We have mentioned these in the House already, but there will be $4.8 billion going into our hospitals. There will be a sustainable indexation rate, money going into emergency departments, money going into elective surgery, money going into workforce reform and a significant investment in closing the gap for Indigenous people.What has not received so much attention yet is our commitment to prevention and our determination, as we indicated before the election, to engage in serious discussions with the states and territories to deliver a partnership on dealing with prevention to tackle the long-term pressures on our health system and our workforce. The Prime Minister mentioned yesterday the importance of making sure we take these decisions early because of the long-term trends that we need to turn around, whether they are the growing rates of chronic disease or the staggering 676,000 preventable admissions which end up in our hospitals each and every year. This could be prevented if we invested more in prevention - a deal that we did over the weekend with the states and territories.$872 million over six years is going into prevention. This is the single largest investment in preventative health that has ever been made by an Australian government. Much of that funding is going to go directly to programs. The sorts of programs include healthy children initiatives to provide health programs targeted at kids and schools, preschools and childcare centres, including healthy-eating and physical activity programs, and healthy workers initiatives to provide programs which reach into our workplaces, including smoking cessation programs, information about the health risks caused by excessive alcohol consumption and support for employers to provide programs which improve the healthy weight of their workforce. These initiatives will aim to reach 35 per cent of the Australian workforce - that is 3.8 million workers - over the next six years.Also, as well as these initiatives targeting kids and workers, there are initiatives targeted at communities to support improved physical activity and nutrition in around 115 local government areas, especially those that are socioeconomically disadvantaged, over the next six years. The partnership will also extend the successful Measure Up campaign that I launched recently in Canberra. I understand that a number of my colleagues have been using a tape measure around their waistlines. - I was not looking at you, Prime Minister! We want to make sure that the Measure Up campaign is targeted to particularly include at-risk groups in the community. Those of us who live more sedentary lives than others are certainly at risk. These are concrete initiatives that are going to make a real difference to communities around Australia, with active and practical assistance to provide people with incentives to improve their health. This is another historic reform.A proportion of funding has also been reserved for reward payments which are going to go to the states and territories who meet agreed targets. For example, some short-term targets include increasing the proportion of the population who meet those healthy weight guidelines, while longer term targets include reducing the hazardous consumption of alcohol and reducing the daily smoking rates from 16.6 per cent to 10 per cent within 10 years. This is a fundamental change in the way that we conduct the business of health, investing now in our hospitals and acute services but also investing for the long term to ensure that we create incentives to become the healthiest country that we can be. I am sure that in years to come we will thank both the Prime Minister and the premiers for having the determination to sign up to these initiatives in workplaces, primary schools, childcare centres and communities across the country and this important change in investing in preventative health.</DOC>

 - I am glad the member for Dickson has time to examine my website given his other activities in recent days directed at his friend and colleague the member for Curtin. -  - They are such a happy, united company, the HMAS Liberal Party - divided on the deputy leadership, divided on the treasurership, divided it now seems on forest carbon sinks, divided on the national water policy, divided on most things. But I thank the member for Dickson for his question.The government's position on this has not changed one bit. I would strongly suggest that the member for Dickson reflect on statements I have made most recently in response to a question, I think, from the Australian at a press conference after COAG when I was asked the very same question. Our policy has not changed. We believe first and foremost that it is necessary to partner with the states and territories in exercising cooperative federalism. Secondly, we will make a judgement during the course of 2009 in terms of whether the overall allocation of roles and responsibilities and the general reform program are being effectively implemented. If there is a failure of that, as I have indicated in the past, our position we took to the people prior to the last election remains valid. It has not changed one bit. Could I say to those opposite, as they scramble around for something to say in question time today: you had better go and chase something else, because this one remains a fundamental part of government policy.I find it remarkable, though, that those opposite would have the temerity to raise any questions about health funding in this chamber. Those opposite should hang their heads in shame about their disinvestment in the nation's public hospitals over so many years. Let me repeat the figures that I drew to the House's attention yesterday. In the period to the last Australian health care agreement the indexation which you provided to the state hospital system was some 5.3 per cent. That came nowhere near meeting the cost escalation factors experienced by state and territory hospital systems, taking into account the cost of employing health professionals as well as the technology factors now being deployed in hospitals. You knew that at the time. You simply short-changed the states and territories. I would draw to the attention of those opposite the fact that the previous five-year health care agreement was actually 6.3 per cent. So even against your own historical standard you were consciously and deliberately -  - For the previous government to give a lesson on high morality to the current government about adequate levels of funding and reform in relation to the hospital system frankly is breathtaking. They sucked out a billion dollars from the system as a consequence of the last health care agreement, and the former minister for health knows that to be a fact. They failed even to meet the standards they set for themselves in the previous five-year health care agreement. This government delivered an indexation factor of 7.3 per cent under the prospect of -  - The government, through the current Australian health care agreement, has agreed to a 7.3 per cent annual indexation factor with the states and territories, resulting in an Australian health care agreement of in excess of $60 billion for the coming five-year period. But beyond that - and I say this to the member for Dickson, if he is interested in the facts as opposed to he and the Leader of the Opposition only being interested in politics - the facts are these: in terms of the national policy partnerships that we also agreed to with the states and territories on preventative healthcare, on emergency departments and on Australian health workforce needs for the future, putting those factors together, you are looking at an overall increase in the Commonwealth's allocation to the states in excess of 10 per cent.That constitutes the basis for real investment in the nation's desire to have a decent health and hospital system for the future. We have put our money where our mouth is, we have embarked upon a reform program and we have said that it must be delivered on the ground through the measures that we have agreed with the states and territories in the various instruments that we have signed with them. That remains our commitment to the future. I would suggest to those opposite, if they were to have any skerrick of credibility on this question, why did they pull money - billions of dollars - out of the hospital system and then turn around opportunistically to accuse the states and territories of failing to run a first-class hospital system in the country? It is easy to do. It is easy to produce your budget bottom line that way - pull the money out of hospitals, pull the money out of the emergency departments, pull the money out of elective surgery. That is what you did year in, year out. The government has a policy of funding reform and functional reform for the future of the hospital system, and this government is proud of its achievements.</DOC>

 - I want to start by thanking the member for Corangamite for the question. He is a member who is very concerned and very interested in housing affordability in his electorate. Probably not a week goes by without him contacting me personally or my staff to ask about the National Rental Affordability Scheme or the Housing Affordability Fund and how he can encourage applications for these new programs from people or organisations in his electorate.The Council of Australian Governments meeting last weekend was one of the most important meetings in the history of the Commonwealth and Commonwealth-state relations, particularly as it relates to housing. Overall the COAG agreement provided $15.1 billion of additional funding. That is expected to lead to an extra 133,000 jobs.When it comes to housing and homelessness, COAG was important because it signed off on a National Affordable Housing Agreement, for the first time bringing together funding from all the areas of involvement of the Commonwealth government in housing into one program that will help deliver a single strategy to deliver more affordable homes for more Australians. The National Affordable Housing Agreement will see the Commonwealth and the states and territories work together on issues of housing and homelessness. It will end the blame game between the Commonwealth and the states. For the first time the governments have agreed to act on and publicly report on a number of very important indicators: the rate of homelessness, for example; the level of rental stress; the number of affordable homes that are available for purchase; the efficiency of the housing market itself, including the supply of residential lots - making sure that there is enough land out there to build on; and housing outcomes for Indigenous Australians.COAG signed off on a $10 billion deal on housing and homelessness over the weekend, including $6 billion from the Commonwealth into the National Affordable Housing Agreement to fund public and community housing and core homelessness services. Importantly, there is an extra $800 million in there of new money for homelessness services - $400 million from the Commonwealth and $400 million from the states.There is $1.94 billion over 10 years for Indigenous housing, building 4,200 new homes and providing major upgrades for 4,800 homes. There is an additional $400 million in capital funding for new public and community housing, including specialist models for people who have been homeless. That money is to be spent over the coming two years - 2008-09 and 2009-10. So it is great not just to have those new homes on the ground urgently for the people who need them but for it to play an important role as part of the economic stimulus aims of the government.This builds on the $2.2 billion housing package in the May budget that has already seen new affordable rental properties. It has already seen new homes that homeless Australians have moved into, and new projects, like common ground facilities and facilities for young homeless people, underway, and it has seen thousands of young Australians taking out first home saver accounts. Those measures, of course, are complemented by the $1Â½ billion first home owner grant boost.The decisions made at the COAG meeting on the weekend were welcomed by the housing and homelessness sector. Tony Nicholson said, of our homelessness response:It should be something that all Australians can have a sense of pride about, that we are leading the way.When it comes to rental accommodation, Noel Dyett of the Real Estate Institute of Australia said:This funding is important; our research shows that there is a great deal of financial stress for those in rental accommodation _ We need to look at solutions that will reduce the gap between supply and demand for rental accommodation in a tight market.The COAG agreement on housing does that. It does a number of other things. I am very proud of it. This House should be proud of it too.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for the question, and acknowledge the strong interest in soil carbon that he has had ever since he arrived in this place, particularly the advocacy of no-till and minimum-till farming and the outcome for soil carbon there. I am very happy to investigate the issues that the member for New England has asked about. The government is quite determined to see what can be done in this space of soil carbon. At the ABARE outlook conference earlier this year - which was opened, for the first time ever, by the Prime Minister - I was tasked with commissioning new research and looking at what could be done in furthering the Commonwealth's involvement with respect to soil carbon.The climate change research fund, which I had the opportunity to speak about last week - the $46.2 million fund - is one of the mechanisms by which we are doing that, but to the extent that at Glen Innes there is extra information and a depth of knowledge going back to 1934 that would not exist in many places in the world, I am very happy to see if there are ways in which we might be able to work together. Certainly I will be conducting an investigation along the lines requested.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Franklin for her question. I know she is deeply interested in ensuring that workers in her electorate are treated fairly at work. Last week the Leader of the Opposition said to the Australian people that Work Choices was dead. Clearly, his political strategy at that time was to pretend Work Choices was dead and, if he was ever in a position to, to bring Work Choices back. But unfortunately the Leader of the Opposition's political strategy is now lying in tatters at his feet, because despite his staking his leadership on saying Work Choices is dead, last night in this House members of the Liberal Party and members of the Opposition came out loud and proud as Work Choices supporters, one after another, as they spoke in this House.I refer to just one contribution, a contribution by the member for Hume, who does not appear to be in the chamber at the moment. Last night he said:Quite obviously, if there are no amendments which address my concerns regarding the rights, privacy and economic freedom of small business as outlined by me in my contribution tonight to this debate, I will not be supporting this bill.One after another, they came out as Work Choices supporters, loud and proud, last night. They went to their party room meeting this morning and rolled their leader. They want to be Work Choices supporters to a man and a woman, because the Liberal Party is the party of Work Choices. Of course, what they need to do now, and what they are in the course of doing, is to find a misrepresentation of the Fair Work Bill so big that it would justify them publicly moving away from the rhetoric of 'Work Choices is dead' to not supporting the Fair Work Bill. So they are prepared to make any misrepresentation that comes to their minds in order to try and extricate themselves from this political position and to vote against the Fair Work Bill. The campaign of misrepresentation has already started.Talk about slow learners. They are doing exactly what they did in 2006 and 2007. What they tried to do with Work Choices before the election is say to the Australian people: 'Don't look at the unfairness, don't look at how people are losing their penalty rates and overtime, don't look at the fact that there are no unfair dismissal rights or that the industrial umpire is dying, don't look at that; look over here at the union bogeyman.' That was their political trick in the lead-up to the 2007 election. Of course, the Australian people said to them, 'Don't treat us as if we are two-year-olds. We can see right through this and we can see that you are trying to distract our attention from the fundamental unfairness of Work Choices.' Well, they are at it again, because they are now lashing out, in their twisting and turning to get away from Work Choices' dead rhetoric, by raising what the bill provides for union right of entry and what it provides in relation to access to records to investigate breaches.The myth they are trying to make is that, somehow, never before in this country have there been these kinds of abilities in the industrial relations system. No-one should fall for this myth, because the provisions in the Fair Work Bill about right of entry and access to employee records are basically the provisions that applied in this country from 1988 to 2005. If anybody actually wants to do the comparison they should get out their workplace relations law for the time period between and compare it. In making this myth, they do not want the Australian public to know that. They are pretending to the Australian public that somehow this is something different. We are not going to allow them to get away with these distortions. All they are trying to do is cover up the fact that they are and always will be the party of Work Choices. If they vote against the government's Fair Work Bill, all that is about is ensuring that Work Choices stays for longer. What they want, what they have always wanted and what they supported in government was a Work Choices policy of rip-offs. That is what they support now and that is what they have come out with today, loud and proud: Work Choices supporters, one and all. No-one should look at what the Leader of the Opposition says; they should watch what he does to support Work Choices.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for education for his question. In interjections yesterday he said to this parliament that he thought money spent on computers in schools was not worth doing. He does not want Australian students to have the learning tool of the 21st century. If he believed Australian students should have the learning tool of the 21st century then presumably when he was a member of the government he would have ensured that the government did something comprehensive to get computers into schools. But of course it fell to this government, when we came into office, to audit and see that some of the students in the schools were without computers that were less than four years old. Many of them were in schools where the computer to student ratio was eight to one or worse - eight kids, nine kids, a dozen kids or 15 kids fighting to get access to one computer, left with completely outmoded technology or not having access to computers at all.This government is acting, as part of its digital education revolution, to make sure that students have access to the learning tools of the 21st century. The shadow minister can go around with his hysterical misrepresentations all he likes, but the facts are these: the government is delivering its program; it has delivered round 1; it is in the middle of delivering round 2. This is working to get computers to kids in schools. - The program will deliver an effective one to one ratio. We worked with our state and territory colleagues to deal with questions about on-costs, and they were resolved at COAG on Saturday. I know that the shadow minister is going to keep carrying on about this because he does not want to see Australian students -  - with the learning tools of the 21st century, he does not want to see transparency -  - he does not want to see a quality national curriculum in schools, he presumably does not want to see our one billion-dollar national partnership for disadvantaged schools, he presumably does not want to see $550 million spent on teacher quality and he presumably does not want to see hundreds of millions of extra dollars for primary schools, because he sits there with no policies and no plans but a shameful legacy to cover up.</DOC>

 - Today I was pleased to launch the national aviation policy green statement at the National Press Club just prior to question time. This is the first time that Australia will develop a national aviation strategy and I look forward to receiving input. Submissions close on 27 February next year and we will be releasing the white paper in the second half of 2009.Mr Speaker, aviation is essential to Australia's economic prosperity. Last year a record 23 million international and 49 million domestic passengers passed through the nation's airports. The aviation sector indirectly employs some half a million Australians and contributes $6.4 billion to the Australian economy. But if we are going to continue to benefit from the economic and social advantages of aviation, we do need to plan ahead. The green paper outlines a number of proposals and initiatives by the government. Primarily, it reaffirms the government's first priority is safety and the government's commitment to establish a small, independent board. CASA - Australia's aviation safety regulator - is central to that. The government will also enhance the independence of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau by establishing it as a statutory agency.The green paper also proposes a range of measures which strike a balance between the needs of the airports and the communities in which they operate. Up until now, it is fair to say that airport planning has not been handled properly. Too often airport development has not taken into account the development around the airport or the interests of the community around those airports. The green paper proposes a number of ways to facilitate community consultation with the operators of airports in the interests of expanding the industry, but not at the expense of the communities in which airports exist. After the birth of aviation almost 100 years ago, it has been a long time coming, but I look forward to constructive input from the industry and from the community into this white paper process.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, and I am very happy to explain it to him. Forward with Fairness provided that we would keep existing arrangements in relation to right of entry, and let me describe to him what we have kept. We have kept the need to have a permit. We have kept the need to be a fit and proper person to have a permit. We have kept the need to give 24 hours notice of entering premises. We have kept the need for proper conduct, for people to behave properly when they are on premises. All of those rules are the same in the Fair Work Bill as they have been under current law and, indeed, as they were under former law. What the shadow minister may not realise is that Work Choices in particular changed the nature of the relationship between industrial instruments to try to lock people out. What we are saying is that unions must abide by strict criteria: being a fit and proper person, getting a permit, giving 24 hours notice, conducting themselves properly - all of the right of entry rules that were in existence are still in existence in our policy Forward with Fairness. We said we would have those rules; we do have those rules.The great misrepresentation happening here amongst the Liberal Party is that they are twisting and turning to try to find some excuse to defeat the Fair Work Bill. Why? Not because they are concerned about -  - The member for Mackellar might not like the answer, but right of entry rules, permits, fit and proper people, 24 hours notice, conducting yourself properly when you are on the premises - those rules are there in the Fair Work Bill. I know the member for Mackellar is one of the loud and proud Work Choices supporters, and she was dismayed the day that the Leader of the Opposition walked out and said that Work Choices is dead. Of course, the Liberal Party members ever since have been saying, 'How can we work out how to oppose the Fair Work Bill, to hold faith with Work Choices, without overly humiliating the Leader of the Opposition?' That is the political problem that confronts them. So to answer that political problem, what they are going to do is misrepresent every provision of this bill, play exactly the same kinds of tricks they played in the lead-up to the last election, pretend to the Australian people that there is some union bogey here, meanwhile asking people to avert their eyes from the fact that Work Choices was about ripping off the least powerful and lowest paid people in our workplaces. It was the 16-year-old kids who suffered under Work Choices. It was the workers with the least bargaining power that suffered under Work Choices. - And the person yelling at me now - the member for North Sydney - had at his disposal every piece of information to know that people were getting ripped off. The legacy of Work Choices, as the Liberal Party knows, is that people were ripped off. And you know what? That is what they support and that is what this twisting and turning is about.Now if they are going to be Work Choices supporters loud and proud, well, Mr Speaker, we will have the debate again about Work Choices. We will have it again in every corner of this country, in every community hall, in every street, in every town, in every factory, in every shop. We will have the debate with the Liberal Party and they can walk into those places and say, 'We are Work Choices supporters,' loud and proud. And do you know what is going to happen? They will be repudiated by the Australian community again, which is disgusted by their extremism in workplace relations.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The issue of identity crime is one of increasing and international significance. Identity crime can involve the illegal use of a person's credit card details to make purchases over the internet or the telephone, and the assumption of another person's entire identity to open a bank account and take out loans and to conduct other business illegally in that name. The true extent of identity crime is unknown, but several years ago we know that it was costing more than $1 billion to citizens in this country, and no doubt that figure is growing. In the United States last year eight million people were victims of identity fraud at a cost of $49 billion. In the United Kingdom the impersonation of deceased persons is the fastest growing identity crime and it is estimated to cost GBP250 million a year.The notion of identity is central to our lives. It affects our reputation and livelihood and our relationships and it is why, when identity crime occurs, people feel violated and vulnerable. Corporations can be victims, but when individuals are victims, their identity stolen and misused, that can have a major psychological and financial impact. Victims often are not even aware that identity crime has occurred until they are called by creditors about a defaulted loan payment. I am advised that an individual victim will on average take two or more years to restore their credit rating when an event like this has occurred. One widespread method of obtaining personal details is known as 'phishing'. That is when fake emails are sent pretending to be from trusted organisations directing a person to a fake website which is designed to look like the real website - say, of a bank. The person is asked to verify their login details, which are then captured and used to withdraw funds fraudulently. Identities are also stolen by key-logging devices on computers and the infiltration of organisations that store large amounts of personal information.Social interaction on the internet also makes people vulnerable to identity theft. If you place personal information on a site like Facebook, then you can provide enough information for perpetrators to steal an identity and open accounts for an individual. - For the election, I did, yes. It is not only individuals that commit these crimes. Organised groups are becoming increasingly involved. The 9-11 hijackers used fake social security numbers and false identities for their pilot training, and other terrorist networks have done the same to get employment overseas to finance their activities and ultimately to avoid detection.The problem, then, is evidently widespread in the world and our laws need to be updated to reflect emerging problems, much like laws governing internet crime have been adapted. This week, therefore, model laws will be introduced which will include new offences for misusing identification to commit an offence or having equipment capable of creating false information. Those charges will help police in all jurisdictions to more effectively investigate and prosecute offences, because a specific offence will exist. All jurisdictions will be empowered to issue certificates to victims of identity crime to help them re-establish their credit histories. Victims will be able to get a court order to reclaim their identity after a prosecution for identity crime or even after they become aware that their identity has been stolen. That will help victims to recover their identities and again use facilities in banks and other financial institutions which had been denied to them by the crime committed against them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook to his question, well-known friend that he is of local governments around the country, particularly those in the Illawarra. In response to the honourable gentleman's question, he will be aware of the fact that under Australia's constitutional arrangements local authorities answer ultimately to state governments for their financial arrangements, because local governments are constituted under the various instruments of state government - that is just a fact. - The member for North Sydney interjects: 'Why did we extend $300 million worth of funding to local government?' I presume you are opposed to that? - Oh, I see. It is like everything else in the Liberal Party today: 'We sort of support it, but we don't. We are not exactly supporting, but we're not opposing.' It is flip, flop, flap on every issue known to man including local government grants, which I thought most local authorities represented by those opposite were willing to receive assistance from - unless I see any hands raised that they would like their money for their local authorities removed, other than the member for Cook, who has had a notable engagement on this with local authorities down in the Illawarra, which has been well canvassed in the Illawarra newspaper.I say to the honourable member: constitutional arrangements are clear. Local authorities answer to state governments on the question of any -  - I am referring to a constitutional fact. Secondly, in terms of any of the external borrowings undertaken by local authorities, it will be the normal procedure for those to be reported to the relevant state treasuries. I would imagine that those procedures are underway. If there are any further matters which I would draw further to the honourable member's attention, then I will do so in response to any representations to me or through the Treasurer by state governments.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for his question. The government are working to help secure water supplies and restore the Murray-Darling Basin to a sustainable footing under the $12.9 billion Water for the Future plan, and we are confronting the problem of historic overallocation of water entitlements -  -  - As I was saying, the government is confronting the problem of historic overallocation of water entitlements and decades of inaction by those opposite on this important issue. This is compounded by more than 10 years of drought and record low flows into river systems. Regrettably, there will be even less water in the future, as a result of climate change. Earlier this year, the Council of Australian Governments secured a historic agreement to undertake critical reform in the Murray-Darling Basin and to establish an independent national authority to manage the Murray-Darling in the national interest. The authority will deliver a basin-wide plan in 2011, with sustainable limits on the amount of water that can be taken from our rivers and groundwater systems. The basin plan, including the new sustainable diversion limit, will become binding on jurisdictions as their existing catchment level water plans expire. The agreement enabled the referral of powers to the Commonwealth, so that the new Murray-Darling Basin Authority could manage the basin as a whole, through a whole-of-basin plan. This is what Mr Turnbull said he wanted last year when he was Minister for Environment and Water Resources, but he did not deliver. In July, he said:The principal problem with the Murray-Darling Basin has been that it's never had a basin-wide plan. It's never been run as one.That is why we have introduced new legislation into the parliament to help secure the long-term future of the Murray-Darling Basin. The Water Amendment Bill 2008 introduces significant reforms to the governance arrangements of the basin, gives effect to the intergovernmental Agreement on Murray-Darling Basin reform and gives the Leader of the Opposition another chance to deliver on what he said he wanted - that is, a basin-wide plan.The shadow minister for climate change, environment and urban water, the member for Flinders, said on 14 November, 'We will not stand in the way of the water act.' Even today, on Adelaide radio, the Leader of the Opposition said:We are not going to throw the baby out with the bath water. I mean, the Water Amendment Bill will pass through the Senate.That should be the end of the matter. Why, then, are coalition senators still planning to move amendments when the bill returns to the Senate tonight? It is just like carbon sinks of yesterday. The Leader of the Opposition seems unable to bring his troops into line - in this case, to bring his senators into line. The fact is that, if coalition senators persist with this approach, these crucial reforms will not proceed and we will have to go back to the drawing board to fix up the Murray. It is time for the opposition leader to take responsibility for passing the water bill tonight. If the opposition leader could not deliver on carbon sinks, with the future of the Murray at stake, it is time for him to pull his troops into line and deliver and see that this bill is passed.While the opposition has been in chaos on water issues, the government has been getting on with the job of addressing our long-term water challenges. In the budget, we brought forward $400 million of funding from 2011-12 to accelerate action on the Murray-Darling. We are investing $3.1 billion to buy back water entitlements from willing sellers -  - so, when it does rain, the river gets a greater share of water. - We are the first-ever federal government to purchase water - The member for McEwen then left the chamber. - I say to members opposite - so loud in their objections - that in 2001 the Murray-Darling Basin Commission did a snapshot of the health of rivers in the Murray-Darling Basin and found 95 per cent environmental degradation in the Murray-Darling Basin in 2001. And what did they do about it? Absolutely nothing. In fact, when it came to dealing with the issue of water in the Murray-Darling Basin, they had a $10 billion plan, dreamt up on the back of an envelope, which did not even go through Treasury. So do not let opposition members start to give us any curry about how we deal with water in this House. This government is investing $5.8 billion to make irrigation infrastructure more efficient. We have a major focus on the Murray-Darling Basin, using less water to grow food and fibre, making the nation's food bowl more resilient to climate change. And we are opening up the water market to trade water where it provides the most benefit. The government is committed to reform of the Murray-Darling Basin to keep the rivers healthy while continuing to provide water for households and for food production. This bill, which is in the Senate now, delivers on those reforms - the very reforms that the opposition leader said that he wanted. Now it is time for him to show some leadership and deliver them. - Yes, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - The challenges that the government faced upon its election in relation to inflation were the subject of some remarks by me in the chamber yesterday. Those inflationary pressures existed as a consequence of capacity constraints in the economy. These were detailed in successive Reserve Bank warnings to the previous government and not acted on. Secondly, when it comes to the challenge of the global financial crisis, all governments around the world have been acting as effectively as they can to respond to the difficulties presented by the crisis - firstly, in terms of the stabilisation of global financial markets and, secondly, by addressing the realities now confronting the global economy to embrace appropriate stimulus packages for the future. That is the government's policy. That is what we have been doing. There is a large challenge which lies ahead. I would say in response to the Leader of the Opposition that our policy on these matters is clear: stability for the financial system and, through fiscal stimulus, a continuation of support for growth in the Australian economy into the future and for families and jobs. In doing this, we will act in concert with the monetary policy actions of the Reserve Bank of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Flynn for his question. The September quarter national accounts released today show that GDP increased by 0.1 per cent in the September quarter, to be 1.9 per cent higher over the year. This is a positive outcome for Australia, particularly in the context of a global recession. I will put these figures into perspective for a moment. The US, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong have all recorded negative growth in the three months to September. Two-thirds of OECD economies are expected to contract in 2009. So, while other countries are contracting, our economy continues to grow. Australian households are pulling back on their spending, in the face of the global financial crisis. Household consumption increased by just 0.1 per cent in the September quarter, as households continue to rebuild their savings. Businesses are continuing to invest in our economy. New business investment rose by a solid 1.8 per cent in the quarter and is 12.5 per cent higher over the year. This continued momentum in major infrastructure projects will help build economic capacity for the future.Today's figures show that we cannot resist the pull of international economic forces but that our economy is better placed than other nations to face this global financial crisis. All arms of policy are directed towards buffering our nation and its people from the worst that the world can throw at us. The government has acted decisively to strengthen growth and to limit the impact of the global financial crisis on Australian jobs - firstly, through our $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy, the bulk of which kicks in from next week. That will certainly provide welcome relief to households and to business. And there is our $15.1 billion COAG package, which will help stimulate growth, create jobs and drive a continued national reform agenda, which is so important for strengthening our economy for the long term. Then there is the $300 million investment in local councils to build local community infrastructure. On top of that, the Reserve Bank has cut the official cash rate by 300 basis points. This means that fiscal policy and monetary policy are working in tandem to strengthen our households, to strengthen our economy and to protect jobs.I think Australians can take heart from the fact that both the government and the Reserve Bank are taking every responsible step to strengthen the Australian economy, because the Australian economy has slowed considerably since the beginning of the global financial crisis. There is no doubt from these figures that we are not out of the woods yet; this will be a long and protracted global financial crisis. It has some way to run, but we on this side of the House will take every possible action that can be responsibly taken to strengthen our economy, to protect jobs and to protect Australian business.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition asks a second question about inflation. I would draw the honourable Leader of the Opposition's attention to this fact: in the period that the Liberals were in office, inflationary pressures caused the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates 10 times in a row. Normally what you try to do with fiscal policy is to act in concert with those running monetary policy. What did they do in the course of 2007 and before? In a period of considerable expansion in the Australian economy coming off the back of a global resources boom, what you had instead was the government, through its fiscal policy, adding to demand in the economy. At the time at which this government took office we had government expenditures running at five per cent real in terms of their growth rate in the past - in other words, fiscal policy was adding to the pressures which exist in the economy. What, therefore, did the Reserve Bank do? They stuck up interest rates - not just once, not just twice but 10 times in a row. The responsible course of action by those opposite would have been to have adopted a more cautious approach to fiscal policy at the time. They failed to do so. That is why interest rates rose. I would suggest that the Leader of the Opposition reflect carefully on the economic circumstances which gave rise to those high interest rates in the past and the actions which should have been taken.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bonner for her question. It goes to the national accounts and it goes to important data for the future direction of the national economy. As the Treasurer outlined in his answer to the House before, the Australian economy grew by 0.1 per cent in the September quarter and 1.9 per cent through the year. It is important in the midst of a global financial crisis to place this performance in context. That is, if we look at that figure of 1.9 per cent growth across the year, it demonstrates that the Australian economy grew more rapidly than any of the G7 major economies. I draw the attention of honourable members to these facts: the US grew by 0.7 per cent through the year to September; Japan grew by zero per cent in the year to September; Germany grew by 0.8 per cent; France grew by 0.6 per cent; the UK grew by 0.3; Italy grew by minus 0.9; and Canada grew by 0.5.If you also go to the current state of economies generally around the world, you find that, while this economy in difficult global circumstances has continued to generate positive growth despite the challenges, we have a large number of economies around the world which have already fallen into recession: the United States, Japan, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Singapore, Hong Kong and New Zealand. Beyond that again, if you were to add those economies which have generated negative growth in the September quarter, you would see that occurring not only in the US, the UK, Germany, Italy and Japan but also in other economies. In fact, a large number of economies in addition to those have had at least one-quarter of economic growth registering negative during the course of the most recent period, including the economies of France and Canada.The reason I draw attention to these figures is to put in context the performance of the Australian economy at a difficult time. We have a huge contraction in global economic growth across the world on the back of an unfolding global economic recession and the Australian economy is still managing to generate positive economic growth. I would say, however, that the challenge which lies ahead will be difficult for the Australian economy, because the roll-on impact of contracting economic growth around the world on real growth and jobs growth in Australia will be very difficult in the year which lies ahead.I would also draw the attention of honourable members to recent statements by the President of China, Hu Jintao, about the challenges that they are now facing with a slowing of growth within the Chinese economy. We have noted carefully in this House before the statement of economic stimulus delivered by the Chinese government a month or so ago, but it becomes plain that China will continue to do more by way of monetary policy and other measures to continue to support growth into the future.The member for Bonner also asked the question: what is the government doing to respond to the challenges which arise from the most recent national accounts data? It is simply this: the government's strategy for the future will be to continue to rely on fiscal policy operating in harmony with monetary policy. Through fiscal policy we have delivered a $10.4 billion stimulus package, referred to by the Treasurer. But beyond that we have also delivered our support to local government, our support to the car industry and, through our $15.1 billion package, our support to the states - necessary for reform but also providing stimulus on the way through. If you aggregate these numbers, it is worth while considering the dimensions. That aggregates to about $32 billion. That equates to some three per cent of GDP. - Plainly not all of that is delivered in one financial year but, for the period ahead, I would draw to the attention of honourable members, including to the most voluminous interventions by the member for North Sydney, that for the year ahead we are looking at about $15 billion, or a figure approaching that, in terms of additional injection. If you take the Economic Security Strategy stimulus package announced in October, together with the one-year tranche of funding coming out of the COAG funding arrangements agreed last Saturday here in Canberra, this is necessary stimulus to be ahead of the curve for the challenges which we face for the period ahead.I say to those opposite that the reason the government acted when it did - not just in providing guarantees to bank deposits and not just in delivering the economic stimulus strategy, which has been so robustly attacked by many members opposite, but also in continuing with our funding of reform programs with the states and territories - was to provide necessary stimulus in what will be a very difficult year, 2009. We did it to provide that additional one to 1.5 per cent of GDP injection into the economy - necessary action - on top of the now 300 basis point reduction in interest rates we have seen by the Reserve Bank over recent months. Of course, the bulk of those Reserve Bank interest rate cuts, together with the stimulus packages that we have announced, do not come into effect for some time, but we believe this is a necessary course of action to prepare for the difficulties which lie ahead.I say to the House and to the opposition that the government's strategy on stimulating the Australian economy and providing support for families and jobs ahead is clear cut. It is based on the national interest. I urge those opposite, rather than act consistently in their own political self-interest, to on a bipartisan basis get behind the measures which the government has embraced. It is the right course for the nation. It is what we need in what will be a very difficult year in 2009, when our growth numbers, employment growth and unemployment will be challenged and under severe duress.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. It goes to the question of interest rates and pass-through to all categories of consumers. I have just come across, interestingly, an opinion piece written by the Leader of the Opposition back in January in the venerable national journal of repute the Australian -  -  - Have you got a problem with Aus, have you? I draw the member for Curtin's attention to this, and I quote the Leader of the Opposition. He said:Banks _ will charge as much for every product they have _ as the market will allow _Here we have the free marketeer at work - the free marketeer on interest rates, the 'member for Goldman Sachs' - in full flight in January of this year, effectively saying that banks should charge as much as they can get away with. Yet today we have, in a highly coordinated attack from the other arm of the opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, a suggestion that governments should, in fact, dictate the reverse.Our policy is clear cut and it has been throughout - namely, we call upon the banks, and have done so from the beginning, to provide pass-through of interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank as rapidly as possible, and we have maintained that position. I note the decisions yesterday by two of the banking majors to pass on 100 basis points of the cut. The other two are to pass on 80. For those who have not passed on the full amount, our call remains the same: to pass on the full amount as rapidly as possible.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. Today's national account figures underline the importance of the government's strategy to push back against the very powerful negative pressures that are coming to bear on the Australian economy. Central to that, of course, is the government's strategy to strengthen our commitment to investing in infrastructure. A critical part of that, of course, is the establishment of the nation-building funds. That legislation is part way through this parliament and is before the Senate at the moment.The Liberal opposition have moved a variety of misconceived amendments to the government's legislation which would seriously undermine the government's strategy, yet again appearing to try and walk both sides of the street and ostensibly support what the government is seeking to do while in practice drastically undermining the whole scheme. I cite just one example: the attempt by the opposition to give the Senate the power to disallow money going to the funds would seriously undermine the Future Fund's ability to manage the investment of these funds because it would reduce the prospective time spans in which it would know the amounts of money that it had at hand to invest. That would inevitably alter the investment strategy and would, over the longer term, undermine returns available to those funds. This is clearly something the opposition do not understand. It is something they did not do when they were establishing the Future Fund - which was set up on an equivalent basis and has proved to be the model on which these funds are being established - at least with respect to the investment processes. This demonstrates, along with a number of the other amendments, that the Liberals do not have a proper, sound understanding of economic management principles. - I notice that the member for Goldstein is interjecting. I would like to highlight some of his observations on these matters on the Insiders program on Sunday. He stated, for example:Why are superannuation funds investing in infrastructure projects in other countries and not here?The claim that investment by superannuation funds in infrastructure in Australia is not occurring will come as something of a surprise to the people running Southern Cross Station in Melbourne, to the people responsible for the Eastern Distributor in Sydney and to the people running numerous major airports around the country, because the fact is that infrastructure is being invested in by superannuation funds. More importantly, the member for Goldstein said:_ 100 years of inconsistent regulations _ They were all sitting there yesterday with an opportunity to address that _By implication, they did not. 'They', of course, were the various governments around the country, state and federal, and what the member was referring to was COAG. What he obviously failed to notice was that, in fact, those governments were precisely addressing the very important thing he did refer to - 100 years of inconsistent regulation - which notably the previous government over 11 years did literally nothing about. To the absolute contrary of what the member for Goldstein said, these governments - state and federal - are addressing these problems.The member for Goldstein unfortunately is not alone in this lack of understanding of the basic principles of economic management. We notice, for example, that the Leader of the Opposition describes the prospect of the international financial crisis pushing the budget into deficit as 'failure in economic management' and says it 'should be a last resort'. Yet he and his party have out there a lengthy list of very expensive, unfunded and uncosted promises to a variety of people that they have never walked away from. More recently - only two days ago - the shadow Treasurer, the member for Curtin, committed the opposition, on top of those other commitments, to introducing tax cuts as well - with, of course, not the slightest hint of any savings initiatives anywhere. - That is exactly right, Mr Speaker. All of these things would, of course, by themselves, without any assistance from the very powerful negative pressures coming from the global financial crisis, drive the budget into deficit - the very thing that the Leader of the Opposition says should be a last resort. It is hardly surprising that we are seeing this degree of confusion on the part of the opposition given the protracted auditioning that is going on for the role of shadow Treasurer at the moment. They are all parading around the country trying to show their wares on who should be shadow Treasurer. The government is not going to be diverted -  -  - They're touchy - very touchy. - Anybody's rehearsal would be better than yours on Sunday, mate - that's all I can say. The confusion on the part of the opposition and the inability to establish a coherent position on economic management, on whether or not we should invest in infrastructure, on what spending position and what overall fiscal setting should apply and on what position should apply with respect to monetary policy, are undermining the ability of the government to tackle the global financial crisis and the consequences that apply for Australia. We will not be diverted by the misconceived amendments that are being put forward in the Senate seeking to wreck the government's nation-building funds legislation from within. The government proposes to vote against those amendments and will stand by its legislation, to continue to invest for the future of Australia and to continue to invest in battling and pushing back against the very powerful downward economic pressures.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow Treasurer for her question. The Prime Minister, I think, accurately answered the question from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition before by saying that we call on the banks to pass through in full, as rapidly as possible, any Reserve Bank official rate cut. In the House yesterday, I noted that two of the majors did precisely that, and it was not just for mortgages; it was also for their business loans. That was good, and it was long overdue. The fact is that the banks do have more to do when it comes to business lending, and they certainly have more to do when it comes to credit cards, and we are the first government in a long time to put them under any pressure to so do. In 11 years, those on that side of the House could not even put in place a bank-switching package. They did nothing for 11 years. We are serious about ensuring that official rate cuts flow through to the economy and that the banks play their part when it comes to fiscal stimulus in this economy. We are very serious about it.But I find the new position from the opposition quite remarkable. This is what the Leader of the Opposition wrote in an op-ed in the Australian on 21 January this year, when there was a debate about whether the banks should pass through in full - and, of course, that is precisely what I was calling on the banks to do at the time. Here is what the Leader of the Opposition wrote in the Australian at the end of January. Just listen to this. This is another example. Do not listen to what he writes; look at what he actually does. This is what he wrote:_ banks are free to price their products as they wish. After all, they are in the business of making profits and, all things being equal, they will charge as much for every product they have on offer as the market will allow them.That is a repudiation of my position at the time that there should be a full pass-through.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Braddon for his question and his ongoing interest in the welfare of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. Indeed, he is interested in strategic policy issues more generally. At 5 pm this afternoon an RAAF C17 will touch down at Richmond air base. On board will be Lieutenant Michael Fussell, the fatally wounded special forces soldier who the House paid tribute to on Monday.Lieutenant Fussell gave his life fighting to make Australia, and indeed the world, a safer place in which to live. It now falls on us in this place not only to honour and thank him and, indeed, to honour and thank the six who fell before him in Afghanistan but also to ensure that they did not give their lives in vain. That means doing all we can to ensure that the United States, NATO and the UN have a formula to succeed in Afghanistan with coherent, well-resourced and coordinated civil, political and military plans aimed at successfully denying terrorists a safe haven and a breeding ground in Central Asia.The House will be aware that over the course of the past 12 months the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have been engaging with the US, NATO, the UN and all the partner nations pushing for more troops and more strategies. Over the course of the past two weeks I continued to pursue those objectives by visiting Canada, the US, Spain, Portugal and the UK. In Canada, defence ministers from the eight nation-states operating in Regional Command South spent a full day discussing Afghanistan, the challenges there and indeed the challenges in the immediate region.I also had bilateral discussions with Secretary Gates and my counterparts from the UK, the Netherlands and Canada. In London, Minister Smith and I attended the second AUKMIN meeting - that is, the meeting between the defence ministers and the foreign ministers from our respective countries, Australia and the United Kingdom. We had good discussions with both Secretary Hutton and Secretary Miliband.While I had other reasons to be in Spain and Portugal, I also took the opportunity to discuss Afghanistan with the defence and foreign ministers from those two countries. In all of these discussions, nothing gave me cause to believe that Afghanistan will be anything but a dangerous and challenging place for some years to come. It is very easy to be pessimistic about Afghanistan, but the reality is that the 38 partner nations there have no choice but to push on. Allowing Afghanistan to again descend into a place in which terrorists can resource and plan their acts around the globe is simply not an acceptable option.There is good reason to believe that in working together the international community can achieve relative peace, stability and security both in Afghanistan and in the immediate region. On that point my meetings over the course of the past two weeks were encouraging. For example, Secretary Gates reaffirmed the determination of the United States to significantly enhance its troop numbers, well above the numbers President-elect Obama was talking about during the election campaign. They are now talking about up to five brigade combat teams or, to put it another way, 30,000 additional troops.Secretary Gates also confirmed the determination to push on with the idea of establishing a trust fund from which money will flow into further capacity building in both the Afghan national army and the Afghan national police. That greater capacity is of course crucial to Afghanistan being able to hold the gains we make. Indeed, Secretary Gates is now talking about more personnel beyond the 80,000 aspiration determined at Bucharest in April of this year. He is now talking some 130,000 Afghan national army personnel.Pakistan was very much a topic of conversation. There is no doubt that the partner nations and indeed the global community now fully understand that success will not come in Afghanistan unless we tackle the substantial challenges we have in Pakistan. No conversation I have these days is without significant reference to those challenges across the border. There was also a consensus amongst the people I spoke with that we do need to do more collectively. We agreed to do so to ensure that the UN special representative in Afghanistan is fully resourced so that he is in a position to do the work which has been asked of him, particularly with respect to better coordinating the military and civil effort in Afghanistan. In addition, I also sense the mood may be changing amongst European NATO nation partners. I really do sense that people are reconsidering their positions and we might see some further commitments from some of those European based NATO partners.The government will continue to engage and to push for the further action that we need to substantially progress our campaign in Afghanistan. Success in Afghanistan is important to global security, it is important to the Afghani people and it is important to our troops, who are making real sacrifices on the ground. Securing success in Afghanistan will be the best way that we can thank Andrew Russell, David 'Poppy' Pearce, Luke Worsley, Jason Marks, Matty Locke, Sean McCarthy and now Michael Fussell. It is the best way to thank them for what they have done for their country.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the National Party for his question. Presumably the bank in question listened carefully to what the Leader of the Opposition had to say in January when he said:But banks are free to price their products as they wish. After all, they are in the business of making profits _That is the stated doctrine of the alternative Prime Minister of the country, the Leader of the Liberal Party, unless he chooses to disavow those remarks - and I would be happy to see him do so, if he wished to do so.Our response to the banks is as reflected in my remarks earlier today to the parliament as well as by the Treasurer and others, and that applies not just to mortgage holders; it applies also to business loan holders, including those in our hard-pressed regional and rural areas including our farm producers. As the Treasurer indicated before, in the case of two of the banks there has been a decision to pass through the official rate cut of yesterday to their business lenders as well. That is welcome. I would join with the comment made yesterday by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and again today by the Treasurer, and that is for the banks to do everything possible to pass through official rate cuts to all Australian users of credit, whether they are in farm areas or in metropolitan areas, whether they are in small business in cities or running farms in the country. These are all part and parcel of the Australian economic story.As the Leader of the National Party correctly pointed out in his remarks, the performance of the farm sector has been of critical importance to the national accounts performance of this entire Australian economy in the quarter just past. Therefore, this government will continue to work with the banks to ensure that we put maximum pressure on the banks to pass through official rate cuts to all users of credit as rapidly as possible. That was our policy in the past. That is our policy in the future. We certainly do not have a policy which says: 'Banks should be free to price their products as they wish. After all, they are simply in the business of making profits.' We have a wider view of the responsibility of government than reflected in the free-marketeering orthodoxy underlined by these remarks by the Leader of the Opposition in an opinion piece under his name and deliberately written in January this year.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question and know that he is deeply concerned for all the schools in his electorate, both government and non-government. This government gave the Australian people three very important commitments in education. We said to the non-government schools around the country that, if elected, we would deliver funds to them on the SES formula and with the indexation arrangements applying at the time. We have a bill before the Senate, the Schools Assistance Bill, which does just that: $28 billion of resources for the next four years. That bill also delivers on our election commitment for transparency: transparency measures are in the bill for non-government schools, and identical transparency measures have been agreed to for government schools at the recent Council of Australian Governments meeting. Thirdly, that bill delivers on this government's commitment to the Australian people to deliver a national curriculum. The bill is currently being held up because the Liberal Party is opposing that section of the bill which delivers the national curriculum. - In doing so, of course, the Liberal Party has embarked on a course which means that non-government schools around this country could open in January and February next year without the benefit of government resources. I am sure all members in this House can imagine what chaos and what pressure that will bring non-government schools - on the principals, on the teachers, on the parents and, indeed, on the students themselves - given that for many of these non-government schools government funds are 40, 50, 60 or 70 per cent of the funds that they use. - Earlier today I conducted a media conference accompanied by Mr Bill Daniels, who is the head of the association of independent schools, the national voice of independent schools in this country. I was also accompanied at the media conference by Mr Bill Griffiths, who is from the National Catholic Education Office of this country, the national voice for Catholic schools. Both Mr Bill Daniels and Mr Bill Griffiths said at that media conference to this parliament and to the Australian people that they support the national curriculum, they do not seek the deletion of the clause dealing with the national curriculum in the Schools Assistance Bill and they ask this parliament to pass the bill. I thank Bill Griffiths and Bill Daniels for appearing at that media event. I also thank them for facilitating me sending, as this parliament sits, a letter to every non-government school in the country, and that will be received by email in the next few hours. That letter from me to the non-government schools communities around the country says in part:The Independent Schools Council of Australia and the National Catholic Education Commission have supported the bill. Unfortunately, the Senate has not passed the bill. In these circumstances the government will continue to urge the Senate to pass the bill. We will continue to do everything we can to give funding certainty and consistent accountability to non-government schools for the year ahead.I table that letter. It may assist members of parliament, particularly members of the Liberal Party, who get phone calls from non-government schools today asking them why it is that they are holding up funding to non-government schools. - The shadow minister, in holding up funding to schools, does so in defiance of the nationally expressed view of the non-government representatives, both independent and Catholic. The shadow minister then says, though he acts in defiance of those representatives, that he is reflecting the concerns of schools like Montessori schools about the national curriculum. I have received a press release from Montessori Australia entitled 'The Montessori community supports passage of schools assistance bill', and it quotes spokesperson Christine Harrison:The Montessori community appreciates the need for robust debate, but what is really important to our parents, schools and the students we educate across the country is certainty of funding as the school year finishes.Ms Harrison goes on:We support the introduction of a national curriculum - that is the Montessori schools speaking - and see this as an opportunity to continue to work with the Government to allow endorsement of the internationally recognised Montessori curriculum and really only want to see the Bill passed.She goes on:We are confident that Montessori schools will be able to offer the Montessori curriculum under the framework of the new national curriculum.The shadow minister for education in this matter represents no-one. The non-government schools of this nation are calling on the Liberal Party to pass the bill, including the national curriculum. This is now a matter that has gone beyond the shadow minister for education and needs to be dealt with by the Leader of the Opposition. This is a serious matter about the delivery of $28 billion of funds to non-government schools. Non-government schools around the nation are asking the Liberal Party to pass the bill. They support the national curriculum. The Leader of the Opposition must act. If non-government schools do not get these funds because of Liberal obstruction and non-government schools cannot open at the end of January next year, if they are standing down teachers, if they are turning students away and if there is educational chaos, then that will be on the head of the Leader of the Liberal Party and the Liberal Party generally. It seems remarkable to me that the Liberal Party in this country today cannot see its way clear to support funding for non-government schools.</DOC>

 - I thank the shadow minister for the question. It is the first time he has shown any real interest in our strategy to tackle binge drinking. What the shadow minister needs to look at, if he really wants to look at the impact of our alcopops measure, is the data for the sales of spirits - when you combine both alcopops and straight spirits - which shows a reduction of 9.3 per cent. The figures for the alcopops measure are very clear. Unfortunately, the shadow minister is determined only to side with the distillers when it comes to this argument. He is not interested in targeting the very products that are marketed to young kids and that are being increasingly consumed and will be consumed at increasing rates over Christmas - something that the shadow minister should be out there urging young people to take care with, not raising these silly points.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Leichardt for his question and for his ongoing interest in aviation issues, particularly those related to Cairns Airport and the tourism industry in his electorate. The Australian government believes in an Australian based and a majority Australian owned Qantas. At no stage has the government indicated support for any other proposal, in principle or otherwise. Qantas has publicly stated that it is 'exploring a potential merger with British Airways PLC via a dual listed companies structure'. Whilst Qantas advised me of the discussions that have been taking place, there has been no proposal put to the government for approval of any Qantas-BA merger. Any merger would need to comply fully with Qantas's obligations under the Qantas Sale Act, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act, the Trade Practices Act and Australia's international air services agreements.The Qantas Sale Act 1992 requires that Qantas's main operational base and headquarters remain in Australia, the name of Qantas must be preserved for the company's scheduled international passenger services, the company must be incorporated in Australia, at least two-thirds of the board of Qantas must be Australian citizens and the chairman of the board must be an Australian citizen. Total foreign ownership must not exceed 49 per cent. At the moment, no single foreign interest can exceed 25 per cent and total foreign airline ownership cannot exceed 35 per cent.These provisions ensure that Qantas remains Australian. Qantas must remain Australian based and majority Australian owned, and that will not change - something that I believe has the bipartisan support of the House. Indeed, all Australian international airlines must be no more than 49 per cent foreign owned. This applies to Jetstar, V Australia, Pacific Blue, SkyAirWorld, Airnorth, OzJet and three Australian international freight operators: HeavyLift Cargo, Tasman Cargo and Express Freighters.The government's aviation green paper, which we released yesterday at the National Press Club, indicated that the government will consider reviewing the additional ownership restrictions that only apply to Qantas but do not apply to any other Australian international airline so that there can be a level playing field. The government has made it clear that no consideration is being given to changing any other section of the Qantas Sale Act.Just this week we have been reminded why a national airline is important, not just for our economy but for national security. On Saturday evening I rang Alan Joyce, the new CEO of Qantas, to request on behalf of the government the assistance of Qantas and Jetstar in putting on extra flights so that Australian citizens could depart from Thailand safely given the conflict which was occurring there, particularly centred around Bangkok airport. As has always been the case with this fine Australian company, Mr Joyce indicated that he would do whatever was in the country's interest to assist Australian citizens. It was once again a reminder of the important role in our national security and in the interests of our national citizens that having Australian based carriers can have, which is why it is important that we build the Australian based aviation industry - something that was the theme of the green paper that the government launched yesterday and something that we look forward to building on in the lead-up to the national aviation strategy white paper, which we will be bringing down in the second half of 2009.</DOC>

 - Can I say to the member who has asked the question: I really do not think in these difficult economic times after the global financial crisis, whilst we are seeing that touch upon the Australian real economy, that it is the time to play this kind of politics. Can I say to the member opposite that, as he would well know, the government has published its forecasts in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. We have said up-front and clearly to the Australian community that, because we are not immune from the global financial crisis and the looming prospect of recession in many developed countries around the world, we are expecting an increase in unemployment. For every worker involved in that, for every family, that is obviously a dreadful circumstance, whether it happens at Christmas or whether it happens at any other time.The approach that the government has taken is to act to keep this economy in front, to act to protect jobs. That is why we did the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy, estimated to have an equivalent effect of 75,000 jobs. That is one of the reasons we entered into a new historic partnership with states and territories around the country at COAG - because its employment consequences are viewed as being more than 130,000 jobs. That is why you have heard the Prime Minister talk about fast-tracking infrastructure - because that is about vitally needed services for the Australian community, but it is also about jobs.That is why, when we did the Economic Security Strategy, we made available 56,000 new training places - training for work, training for jobs. We know in this economy, even after the global financial crisis, there are still some employers who are crying out for skilled labour, and we want any Australians who need that work to be able to get the skills which enable them to take up those work opportunities. This is a government that is, front and centre, committed to working with Australians to make sure that Australians have jobs and their jobs are protected. This is not the stuff of party politics. This is about keeping Australians in work, and that is why the government at every stage in responding to the global financial crisis has acted to keep this nation in front of the curve.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question and for his interest in fairness in Australian workplaces. Of course, the Rudd Labor government went to the last election with our industrial relations policy, Forward with Fairness, which included in it a commitment to assist low-paid employees and their employers to access the benefits of collective bargaining. We have had 15 years of enterprise bargaining in this country, first brought to this country by Labor, and it has delivered significant economic benefits for employees, employers and the nation.There have been gains in productivity and service delivery improvements. It has enabled employers to keep good staff and staff morale has improved. Through productivity gains, employees have been able to achieve better wages and conditions. But we also know that there are Australians who have not had the benefits of enterprise bargaining and the government wants to extend the benefits of enterprise bargaining to a greater category of Australian working people.In particular, we are very concerned about those low-wage employees who are substantially reliant on the safety net. At this point, we should remind ourselves that the minimum wage in this country today is $14.31 an hour. We want to assist employees who are earning $14.31 an hour and employees who are substantially reliant on the safety net. These were the very employees who suffered the most under Work Choices, as they had basic pay and conditions ripped away.I would like the House to just for a minute listen to the voices of some of these workers. They were interviewed for the Fair Pay Commission report published this year. There was a man called Sam who lives with his wife, one small child and two parents in a house in Perth. He is the sole income earner for that household of five people. He earns around $17 an hour, depending on his shifts as a security guard. He has watched the rent on this home go up from $120 per week to $375 per week. There is a great deal of pressure on that man. There were other low-paid workers who were interviewed for this who talked about not having enough money to leave their suburb to go and see another part of the city, because of their low wages.We are introducing in the Fair Work Bill 2008 a special bargaining stream to assist these low-paid workers. We know that these low-paid workers and many of their employers lack the capacity to bargain. They have never bargained before. So we want Fair Work Australia to be able to assist them with that bargaining in a hands-on facilitative roleIf bargaining facilitated by them cannot reach a conclusion, we will, through the Fair Work Bill 2008, be empowering Fair Work Australia to in very limited circumstances make a workplace determination. But in order to do that they have to be sure that the parties are unable to reach agreement, that the employees are substantially reliant on the safety net, that it would promote bargaining in the future, that it would promote productivity and efficiency in the enterprises and that it is in the public interest. This is a strictly limited category of workplace determinations for low-paid employees who have never had the benefits of a collective bargain.When I look across this chamber, I see the Leader of the Opposition and members of the Liberal Party. The Leader of the Opposition has made a lot of money in his lifetime. I certainly do not begrudge him that. No-one in this chamber is a low-paid worker. But what I say is wrong is for members of the Liberal Party to say to low-wage Australians that they will block that Fair Work Bill 2008 and stop these employees getting wage justice. On the incomes that they are on and with the resources that they have at their command, to say to these low-wage workers on $14-odd an hour that they will deny them wage justice is wrong. That is what blocking the Fair Work Bill 2008 would do; that is what the party of Work Choices looks like it is committing itself to.The Leader of the Opposition said that Work Choices was dead. He is obviously in the process of being rolled by his colleagues. But let us just remind everyone what being the party of Work Choices means: it means that you believe in ripping off these low-wage workers and not assisting them to get the benefits of enterprise bargaining. Unfortunately, that is what the Liberal Party seems to stand for.</DOC>

 - On the first point which was raised by the Leader of the Opposition concerning representations by the state government of New South Wales - I think that is what he asked - I am unaware of any such representations. It would be normal entirely for the Commonwealth Treasury to be in touch with state treasuries - as would have occurred in the period in which the Liberals were in government; it certainly occurs now - on the overall public sector borrowing requirements of state and territory governments. That is simply the normal way in which things are done.In terms of the funding for future infrastructure, the honourable Leader of the Opposition would be aware - although he obviously finds these matters entirely amusing - that the government stands committed to implementing its nation-building agenda. The Leader of the Opposition should be aware that the government has established three nation-building funds: the Building Australia Fund for the funding of infrastructure; the Education Investment Fund, which is for the purposes of adding to education infrastructure across the country; and a fund for the future of our hospital infrastructure as well. - The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about representations from the government of New South Wales concerning their public sector borrowing requirements. He asked in particular whether I was aware of any such representations. I have given him a direct answer to that. He then went to the question of the funding of infrastructure. On infrastructure, which in the past was funded exclusively by state and territory governments, this government has a clear and different policy and is embracing a new approach, which is that the national government will invest in infrastructure, including health and education infrastructure. That is why we established three nation-building funds, which have yet to attract the bipartisan support of those opposite. Quite apart from their nation-building utility, can I say to those opposite that these funds also provide added stimulus to the economy for the period ahead.Can I say also to the Leader of the Opposition that we continue to examine all appropriate measures to properly support infrastructure investment into the future. That is the normal thing that you would expect to do. That is the normal thing you would expect any democratically elected government to do, one which supports the whole process of infrastructure building and nation building in the Australian economy. Those opposite should actually bother to pause and ask themselves this question: with the global financial crisis underway, how are you going to fill the infrastructure gap other than through proper public investment? Our policy is clear.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. With some forbearance from members and on behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs could I update the House on circumstances. Many members would be aware that on 2 December, yesterday, the Constitutional Court of Thailand ruled that the ruling People's Power Party be dissolved and its executive members banned from politics for a period of five years. Two other governing coalition parties have also been dissolved and that ruling effectively means that the former Prime Minister, Somchai Wongsawat, and his government no longer hold office, and I understand the former Prime Minister has now stood down from office. At this stage it is not clear how and when the new government will be formed. The Australian government hopes that all groups in Thailand will adhere to the constitutional and peaceful processes in order to return to peaceful, stable and democratic government.Recent political confrontation resulting in the forced closure of two Bangkok airports over the last week has obviously been a setback for Thailand. We are aware of statements by the People's Alliance for Democracy that they will abandon their protests at the airport today, 3 December, and again reports have suggested that that is occurring. The government calls on those demonstrators to adhere to their undertakings to end their occupation of the airports and to allow foreign tourists to return to their homes. There are still conflicting reports about the timing of any resumption of flights; that will obviously depend on the ability of the Thai airport authorities to recertify airport facilities.Today the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade upgraded its travel advice for Thailand following the ruling of significance by the Constitutional Court. It will now be that: 'Australians are strongly advised to reconsider their need to travel to Thailand due to the very uncertain political situation, ongoing disruption to flights and severe congestion at the airports.' The government understand the frustration being felt by hundreds of Australians who are stranded in Bangkok and we are continuing with efforts to assist Australians to depart the country. Indeed, we understand also the anxiety of many at home, including parents whose children are on the schoolies vacation in Thailand.The government, as the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government indicated earlier, has spoken with Qantas and Jetstar, which have, to their very great credit, confirmed that they will be operating extra flights out of Phuket in response to the airport closures at Bangkok. Qantas has announced a third special flight from Phuket to Singapore, which will be tomorrow morning. Jetstar has also redirected its scheduled Melbourne-Bangkok flight to Phuket again for tomorrow. Thai Airways has also scheduled additional flights from Phuket to Perth, departing today and Friday, 5 December, and I understand there may be flights also departing from the military airport. Passengers should most certainly contact their airline directly for any further details on these flights.In answer to the last part of the question, I would like to acknowledge officers who, for the past 72 hours, have assisted over 1,500 Australians to depart the country. We are also assisting with bus transportation for Australian travellers from Bangkok to Phuket to meet Qantas's specially scheduled flights. Consular officials are also travelling with the buses to assist in Phuket and Singapore, where passengers will transit. Consular officials are deployed at Thailand's international airports that are still operating - Phuket, Chang Mai and U-Tapao - to assist Australians in difficulty and the ambassador has made direct representations to try to speed up that process. The Australian embassy has also established a call centre and has spoken to nearly 4,000 Australians, and the ambassador and other embassy staff have briefed nearly 800 Australians at 20 hotels.The government expects that there will be continuing political uncertainty in Thailand in the short term and we will continue to work to assist those Australians who are stranded in Bangkok to depart that country. Australians in Thailand and indeed in Australia who need consular assistance or advice can contact the Australian embassy on +6623446300 or the 24-hour consular emergency centre, which is +61262613305. I thank members.</DOC>

 - One thing about the Leader of the Opposition - we know he has a glass jaw. As soon as this was read out, up the corridor they go to Mr Pearce, the member for Aston. Off he comes and says, 'Look, there is not really a problem after all.' The problem is that the Leader of the Opposition, supported by the member for Curtin - the rapidly disappearing member for Curtin - who is the shadow Treasurer -  - We had earlier today in question time the question of the member for Curtin, the current shadow Treasurer. The question was along the lines of the pass through of official interest rates to customers. It probed deeply the consistency of the government's position. What I sought to do in response to that question, which has obviously upset the Leader of the Opposition, was to refer him to his statements in the Australian, where he said:But banks are free to price their products as they wish. After all, they are in the business of making profits ...That is what he said. What I was seeking to do, I believe effectively, was to contrast that position on the one hand with the highly orchestrated attack - this time within the first 10 questions of question time - by the member for Curtin, the shadow Treasurer. Can I suggest for those opposite that if they are going to have a consistent line of attack on the government, be it on this, be it on bank guarantees or be it on fiscal stimulus, it would be useful if the policy was consistent.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Ballarat for her question. I know that she has an ongoing concern for people with disability in Ballarat and beyond. It is a very timely question because today is the International Day of People with Disability, and I am pleased to join with my colleagues the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Attorney-General and the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children's Services, who this week have announced some significant initiatives to assist people with disability.The Rudd government came into office with a commitment to reform employment services, including services for job seekers with disability. To commence the reform process the government announced earlier this year that we would change an absurd policy of the previous government that compelled DSP recipients to have their benefits reviewed before accessing employment services, thereby jeopardising their income just because they wanted to put their hand up for work. This roadblock to work has been abolished by the government, and that occurred on 8 September this year.Today I am pleased to outline further significant initiatives to reform employment services in order to give job seekers with disability greater opportunities to contribute to the social and economic life of this country. First, the Rudd government proposes to uncap access to employment services for people with disability. As with universal employment services, job seekers with disability who need assistance will be able to obtain that in a timely fashion. Under the previous government system the people with the most severe disability were actually in a capped program, whereas people with lesser disability can generally access a place. This is a nonsensical policy - a counterproductive approach to assisting job seekers. This particular reform, after consultation with the disability sector, is considered an iconic reform.The uncapping of access to services that I am announcing today will remove a major inequity that has led to both perverse and unfair outcomes. This change will allow specialist disability employment service providers to effectively assist school leavers with disability and help them transition into the workforce. Disability employment service providers will in future be able to have effective partnerships with schools to help students with disability plan to enter the workforce and avoid the cycle of welfare that so tragically befalls many people with disability in our community. Also, in line with changes and improvements to universal employment services, we will remove complexity and red tape in order to provide the opportunity for providers to devote their time to assisting clients, not to doing paperwork. These proposed reforms are the result of detailed consultations that I have had with job seekers, their advocates and providers. In coming weeks I will be asking for further feedback to fine tune these reforms, with the final details of the new system to be announced in the New Year.We greatly value the contribution of people with disability in this country and that is why this week we have seen the Rudd government draft disability standards for access to premises to assist people with disability to access workplaces and other commercial buildings, and relief in the form of $1,400 for singles and $2,100 for couples flow to DSP recipients. These are important achievements. These are important reforms in this vital area of public policy, but we know that there is more work to be done. I look forward to working with my colleagues and indeed with the disability sector, employers and others to improve the lives of people with disability.</DOC>

 - I am not sure what portfolio responsibility the member for Greenway has, but I would suggest to her, as a member of the opposition frontbench rather than the opposition backbench, that it is time for the nation to have a sensible long-term debate about Sydney's long-term airport needs, because that is where -  - There is the member for Cook, always out there looking for the populist political point. The member for Cook: friend of Wollongong and friend of the Illawarra!The member for Dickson then left the chamber. - Therefore the nation needs a debate about Sydney's long-term airport needs. -  - Here they all go, engaging in populist politics rather than looking at the nation's long-term needs. Could I say to those opposite -  - The member for Greenway said that the people of Western Sydney deserve to know. Could I just say that I understand - I am advised at least - that the opposition confirmed yesterday their support for Badgerys Creek. I would appreciate confirmation from those opposite that that is the case. Perhaps I am misadvised. We believe that what the nation needs is proper deliberation about our long-term infrastructure needs. It will be conducted in a proper public policy format because we are a government that believes in long-term infrastructure planning. Those opposite are interested in purely personal political self-advancement. That is the difference.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. We know that as we come into the warmer months more Australians will be heading into the water. In a country where swimming and water are so important to our way of life, we think it is important that we have adequate water safety programs in place. - I note the member opposite interjecting on this. I think that saving lives and preventing people from drowning is something that we can all agree upon in this place. In the last two weeks alone, we have tragically lost five young lives to drowning in three separate incidents. This is a painful wake-up call to all. The 2008 National drowning report found that 261 Australians drowned last year. Tragically, we know that toddlers are overrepresented in these figures with, on average, over 35 children under the age of five drowning each year in this country and four times that number being hospitalised as a result of water incidents. Many of those suffer permanent brain damage.I note that just last month members from both sides of the House, and indeed many senators, joined me in launching the Royal Life Saving Society's Keep Watch program. They gave a commitment at that time to promote these important messages within their own electorates. I encourage all to heed Keep Watch's key message: when it comes to pool fencing, check it, fix it and watch it. Many families may think that their backyard fence is safe, not realising that fences need maintenance too. We are seeing that, as these fences age, more and more children are getting through them. They are getting under them or they are getting over them. I encourage all members in this House to download and distribute the Royal Life Saving Society's free checklist to help pool owners inspect their own fences. I can report that this checklist can be found at homepoolsafety.com.au.Of course, we can and we must do more. The Australian government is providing over $20 million of funding to fantastic Australian organisations like Surf Life Saving, the Royal Life Saving Society and AUSTSWIM to run key water safety programs. In addition to that, in this year's budget the government was very proud to announce a further $12.2 million to help save lives. This funding will support, in conjunction with Mr Laurie Lawrence, the development and the distribution of a DVD for new parents to reduce drowning injuries and deaths in the zero- to four-year age group. We are determined to work harder and we are determined to work closer with water safety organisations and with state and local governments to ensure that we have the best practices in place.In closing I would like to acknowledge the brave parents who have lost children in such tragic circumstances but who, despite their own pain, have found the strength to talk publicly about their experiences, what we can do to minimise the risk for other families and what we can do to help save other young Australian lives. We owe it to them to work together to help prevent the heartbreak that comes with the loss of a child through such devastating circumstances. We can all do more to ensure that there are fewer tragedies this summer.</DOC>

 - The proposition put by the Acting Leader of the Opposition is just absurd. The global financial crisis is impacting on all organisations who raise funds on credit markets, including commercial banks and state governments. The current conditions in financial markets do make it harder for state governments to borrow to fund important capital works. In the environment we are in at the moment, nothing could be more important than capital works, particularly when it comes to critical economic infrastructure. The government has made no secret of its commitment to invest in infrastructure and its commitment to see the private sector invest in infrastructure and the state governments do the same. This is a very, very important part of strengthening our economy in the face of the global financial crisis but, as importantly, an important part of reform in the Australian economy, which had been neglected for 12 long years.Critical economic infrastructure goes to the core of the capacity constraints that this economy has suffered from and under over a very long period of time. As the Reserve Bank pointed out, on 20 occasions the previous government was warned by the Reserve Bank about the implications for inflation because of its failure to take infrastructure issues seriously. This government is determined to ensure that Australia does have the infrastructure it needs to underpin growth and prosperity for the long term. Like any sensible government, and like any government that is committed to economic prosperity, we will take on board any sensible suggestions that are made to us from either the private sector or the public sector.As for the ridiculous speculation that the member put forward then, and other matters in today's newspapers, what this government is on about is a commitment to infrastructure. We will take on board in our discussions with the states some means to assist them if that is required - if that is required - when it comes to their borrowing programs. There has been an exchange of correspondence with the Queensland Treasurer, which the member is aware of, and I have written back to the Queensland Treasurer suggesting to him that we are happy to work constructively with the state governments to see a resolution to this problem but rejecting the solutions that he put forward in that letter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Chisholm for her question. I know she will be relieved to know, as members of the government will be relieved to know, that the Senate has passed the Schools Assistance Bill and there is now no threat to the funding of non-government schools in 2009. Members of the government may be wondering how this happened, because they would recall that we were in this parliament yesterday and the stated position of the shadow minister for education -  - who chimes in right on cue - was that he was going to fight on. He was going to fight on because he wanted to delete from the government's bill the reference to the national curriculum. The bill has been delivered in whole. It delivers $28 billion of funds to non-government schools, it delivers the new transparency measures we promised in the form we promised them and it delivers our commitment to the national curriculum. This has been achieved because the shadow minister for education today engaged in what must go down as one of the most humiliating backflips in Australian politics. He was fighting on as late as this morning and then went into the Senate and performed this humiliating backflip. Instead of just having the fortitude to go out publicly and say, 'Yes, I did backflip; I did change my mind,' the shadow minister for education has been trying to pretend to all the world that apparently a statement about curriculum was made today in the Senate that had never been made before. This simply is not true.Can I indicate to the House on how many occasions in the past - and this is not an exhaustive list - the government has given commitments to schools that offer alternative curriculums, like Steiner schools and Montessori schools, that they would be able to work with the national curriculum process and that their teaching styles were not under threat. That is something the shadow minister in his humiliation and shame is trying to pretend only happened this morning.I take the House to an extract of my second reading speech on the Schools Assistance Bill 2008 on 21 October, and I table it; to my response to amendments moved in the House by the shadow minister raising this issue on 21 October, and I table it; and to my speech to the Curriculum Corporation on 10 November, which dealt comprehensively with these issues, and I table it. In fact, Senator Carr today in the Senate used these words in the statement that he made - a statement drawn from my speech of 10 November. Then I take the parliament to the words of the member for Bennelong, the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Child Care, who on my behalf delivered the summing-up speech to the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority Bill 2008 in this place on 26 November and used the same form of words that was used by Senator Carr in the Senate today on the parliamentary record, and I table it. Then, of course, there is a transcript from me on radio in Adelaide yesterday, 1 December, which deals comprehensively with these issues, and I table it. Then there is a transcript from 2 December of an ABC Radio National breakfast interview dealing comprehensively with these issues, and I table it. Then, of course, there is a media release from me of 3 December which deals comprehensively with these issues, and I table it. Then there is my response to the Senate's amendments in the record of parliamentary proceedings from yesterday, 3 December, which gives the same form of reassurance, and I table it. Then there is a Hansard extract from yesterday in which I gave exactly the same reassurances and used the same form of words, dated, of course, 3 December, and I table it. Then there is a transcript of my television interview on ABC2 News Breakfast this morning, where I used the same form of words and gave the same kinds of reassurances, and I table it. - The irresponsible shadow minister who yells now -  - in his humiliation and shame -  - has put parents and teachers and principals in non-government schools through agony for no reason. Last night they would have watched the TV news and thought that they were not going to get funded. This morning they would have woken up to newspaper headlines that said that there was a threat to their funding. They would have listened to the radio this morning and perhaps watched breakfast TV and believed that there was a threat to their funding, all caused by the shadow minister for education because he viewed his cheap and petty politics as more important than giving a quick reassurance to these families that their school choice would be honoured and their children would be able to go to the school of their choice next year.Well, can I say this: the shadow minister has been humiliated, but what we can say to the mums and dads, the teachers and principals and, most importantly, the children of non-government schools is that they will benefit, from 1 January next year, from $28 billion of resources delivered to them by the Rudd Labor government, worked on constructively by the Australian Greens and Senator Nick Xenophon - and fought every step of the way by the Liberal Party.</DOC>

 - The answer is no. Those events did not happen. I will repeat what I said before, because the government is prepared to examine all appropriate measures to ensure that investment flows to critical economic infrastructure, particularly given the global financial crisis.

 - I thank the member for her question. The Rudd government's $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy will provide relief for families and for pensioners and will strengthen the economy and create up to 75,000 jobs. From Monday, 8 December, the Economic Security Strategy will deliver a lump sum payment of $1,400 for single pensioners, $2,100 for pensioner couples and $1,000 for those receiving carer allowance. Families on family tax benefit A will also receive $1,000 per child. These payments are targeted towards pensioners and others in our community who are doing it the toughest and they are people who need this support. Something like four million pensioners, seniors and carers and two million Australian families will next week be receiving additional assistance.We on this side of the House strongly support the Economic Security Strategy because it delivers support to those who need it most and it delivers it in a timely way when the economy requires it. This Economic Security Strategy is decisive and it is the early action that we need to protect our economy because of the fact that world growth is slowing. This country is better placed to withstand the fallout from the global financial crisis than many other countries, but of course it is difficult for us to resist the pull of the international global financial crisis. But with these payments, with the big cuts in interest rates and with the investments in health, education and infrastructure, all arms of policy are now directed towards creating jobs and buffering our nation from the worst that the world can throw at us. This government has taken decisive action, we have taken responsible action and we have taken it at a time that is absolutely necessary to strengthen our economy.We know that those opposites have no alternative. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the Acting Leader of the Opposition, was on Lateline last night. She was asked by the host to name one alternative policy that the opposition had. And do you know what? She could not name one - not one during a seven- to 10-minute interview. Not one policy could she name last evening.Those over there are prepared to sit on their hands in the middle of a global financial crisis. They cannot get fully behind the government's Economic Security Strategy. What they want to do is take pot shots at that strategy and individual elements of it. But I would suggest that the Australian people are looking for a lot more from those opposite. They want them to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. I would urge them to get on board because this strategy is absolutely what this country needs at this time.</DOC>

 - I have got nothing more to add to the answer that I gave before. I said very clearly that the government is prepared to examine any sensible and alternative measure. I have already said that the proposition put by the Acting Leader of the Opposition is completely absurd. I have made that very clear. I have made it very clear that the proposition put formally to the federal government by the Queensland Treasurer in communications with us directly by letter is not acceptable to the Commonwealth government. I have also made it very clear to the treasurers and to the premiers that we are happy to talk with them about what sensible measures could be taken over time to ensure that their capital works programs proceed in a way which strengthens our economy and ensures that infrastructure in this economy is built - is built because it is needed for the long-term productive potential of the economy but also, most particularly, proceeds now given the global financial crisis and what that means in terms of protecting jobs and protecting industry and strengthening our economy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lyons for his question. I am sure he will be very pleased to know that from next week more than 10,000 families in his community who receive family tax benefit A will be receiving extra assistance under this package and almost 21,000 pensioners and carers and other seniors will also be receiving assistance. This is much needed assistance that will go to nearly two million families and four million pensioners, carers and people with a disability who will receive this extra help through the government's Economic Security Strategy payments - $1,400 for single pensioners and $2,100 for couples, and families who are on family tax benefit A will receive $1,000 for each eligible child.Many people have been in touch with us, as you can imagine, to tell us just how these payments are going to help them out. I had an email recently from Jackie in Melbourne, who wrote to say how much she welcomes the Economic Security Strategy. She writes:Our six-year-old son has an autism spectrum disorder and we receive the carer allowance, so the $1,000 announced for carers is fantastic. My query is that we receive the family tax benefit A, so does that mean that we will receive $2,000? If that is the case, we will be heading out to get the much needed fridge and washing machine.I am very pleased to be able to let Jackie know that she will be receiving $2,000, so she will be able to go ahead and buy that fridge and that washing machine.We do know that there are number of people on the other side of the House who actually do not want Jackie to get that fridge and washing machine. Probably most famously - I know you have heard a few remarks from this particular person - the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate said the following to the Canberra Times about these Economic Security Strategy statements, and I am quoting:'It was the National Party that came out to say 'we're going to call bull dust on this one'_Remarkable. The National Party wants to stop nearly two million Australian families getting this $1,000 payment per child - two million Australian families that they do not want to get this extra help.I say to the National Party and to their coalition colleagues that they really should keep up with the rest of the world. Maybe read a newspaper. There is no question they are living in complete denial about the global financial crisis and the way in which the world has changed. It does seem that the National Party are not on their own. - What did he say? - I think that really sums it up: it is not only the National Party; it is the Liberal Party as well that is living in the past. It is not only the member for O'Connor who thinks that $2,000 for a fridge and a washing machine is not real money. It is extraordinary, when you look at some of the latest goings on on a particular website that has some recent news from the Liberal Party. You might be wondering, Mr Speaker: we could find out who is the latest Leader of the Opposition and what sort of zany activities the Young Liberals are getting up to. - That is exactly what I was referring to, Mr Speaker: the comments from the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, updated extraordinarily by the member for O'Connor. But I was amazed when I went to the New South Wales Young Liberals website. I found this extraordinary picture of John Howard - this is 'up-to-date'; it was on the website today - and right down here is a little picture of the member for Wentworth. - If I can just finish by saying there is a lovely message from Mr Howard, signed 'Prime Minister of Australia'. You guys are so out of touch, so out of date: you don't even realise you lost the last election.</DOC>

 - I thank the Acting Leader of the Opposition for her question. I notice that with the Leader of the Opposition away she has finally got one, Mr Speaker. -  - The tactics committee says she has got five, is that right? She has asked me about media reports -  -  - I think it would be a good idea just to go through some of the media from this morning which relates directly to the management of the economy. - Mr Speaker, I said earlier that all of those allegations were absurd, but I was asked about reports in the paper. Of course there have been plenty of media reports about where those opposite are coming from in terms of the economy. This was at the doors this morning from a reporter to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition:You're changing your line from last week -  - It certainly does, Mr Speaker, because there is a fundamental difference between those on this side of the House and those on that side of the House. We absolutely believe in infrastructure, in building it to invest in the economy - to strengthen it particularly at a time of global financial crisis. There are very big differences in terms of economic management between those opposite and those on this side of the House and they go to the very core of our future prosperity. This morning on the door, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked this question:You're changing your line from last week -  - This morning on the doors, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked this question -  -  - Mr Speaker, I have been asked a question about infrastructure -  -  - I have been asked a question about its funding. This morning in a doorstop, this is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was asked -  - I have answered this question, Mr Speaker. This government is committed to investing in infrastructure, it is committed to examining any sensible measure to do so, and that is exactly what - </DOC>

 - I thank the Member for Dobell for his question. Yes, I am relieved that it was not one with respect to defence, science and personnel. What I can announce to the House and confirm is that the veterans community in Australia at this time, as a result of the ESS payments, will be in possession of some $407 million leading up to Christmas, a time when many of these people are in great need.In Dobell's case, I can tell the local member that 3,300-plus pensioners will be in possession of some $4.2 million in the lead-up to Christmas. This is the latest in a series of initiatives from the Rudd government with respect to our veterans community, a community that did it hard for our country at a time when we needed it and have often lived with the aftermath of that with respect to the circumstances of their service.I contrast this, as I am asked for the position of others on this matter, with the actions of the opposition. Members will recall that the opposition, with respect to pensioner support, came forward initially with the proposal for $30 per week but in fact had excluded veterans from their original proposal. Subsequently, there was a change and that included the situation of single pensioners. But then they got confused again and went forward with an amendment in the Senate which in fact only covered some 35,000 single service pensioners.It does not stop there. If you go back over the time of the previous government, you will find a number of issues where the previous government dropped the ball and did not really do what was required to deal with the needs of the veterans community. It covered issues of compensation, commemoration and health care. For example, with respect to compensation, one of the most outstanding issues over the time of the Howard government was the method of indexation of disability pensions, particularly TPI and other above special rate disability pensions. After 10 years, after inquiries, after demonstrations, finally, after the then opposition moved forward with a proposal to change that method of indexation, the government of the day, in the shadows of the election, actually moved. That has now been implemented earlier this year.Then there were the situations with respect to health care. Members will be aware of the concerns around the F111 deseal-reseal issue. I recall attending a meeting as shadow minister last year on the question of the best way forward to deal with those issues, because we knew that new issues were being presented. I had members on my side of the House raising those concerns with me. I committed, as the shadow minister at the time, to a parliamentary inquiry into these issues. That inquiry is now well and truly underway and about to come to a conclusion under the chairmanship of the member for Brisbane. At the time that I made that commitment, the then minister was asked the same question. The then minister refused to act upon the commitment; he refused to give it.There are also issues around commemoration. One is the battle for Australia Day. As members know, when in opposition we made a commitment to have it declared as a national day of commemoration. That was welcomed by the member for Bradfield - the opposition leader at the time we made the announcement - who indicated that, in fact, we acted accordingly, and I thank him for that. But I do not think we should forget that this proposal was raised repeatedly during the time of the previous government and was rejected repeatedly. The fact is they were not prepared to act at that time.The other outstanding issue that I will mention in passing relates to the Clarke review. The fact of the matter is the Clarke review was undertaken by the previous government but many recommendations that came down from Justice Clarke were ignored. They were not acted upon. We made a commitment to inquire into that and to review it, and that review is currently underway. I understand that review is now welcomed by the opposition, but let us not forget that for years they did nothing about taking action. We all recall what occurred around the question of the cabinet submission at the time with respect to that issue.I will finish on one last one: the issue of medallic recognition for bravery at Long Tan. Again, this issue was around for a long time under the previous government and they took no action on it. I congratulate the former minister for having the courage to move forward on that in the shadows of the election. I understand that the inaction of years before was not necessarily his fault. The fact of the matter is that, again, this issue was only acted upon at the last moment. Since the election we have seen confusion from the opposition in this area. We have seen a situation where, belatedly, they have come to accept these and a range of other policies that we brought forward at the election and since the election. I am glad that they now support them, but I think they have to explain to the wider veterans community why they did not support them at the time when they could have done something about it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question. I acknowledge that the question she raised raises some matters which are significant to local communities in her electorate. I understand that and she is gesturing to say it is a bigger issue than that, but I do understand she is bringing this forward as a local member. - Adelaide, of course, is very close to my heart - my parents live there, my family lives there - so matters and circumstances often get raised with me going to Adelaide. I can assure the shadow minister for education about that and should he be interested in matters and circumstances related to Adelaide, I would recommend to him the editorial in today's Adelaide Advertiser for his edification.On the question that the member for McEwen has raised with me, the Rudd government of course has taken a series of actions to deal with the crisis in the Murray-Darling and with water problems beyond the Murray-Darling. - The member for McEwen - who is now having her shadow minister chime in, a shadow minister who was a member of a government that never bought a drop of water back - would be aware that this government has taken a series of actions to deal with the water crisis. Amongst them we have entered negotiations with states and territories. We have moved decisively on federal actions in relation to the Murray-Darling. We have commenced buybacks of water entitlements, something that never happened over 12 years of the government of which the member for McEwen was a part. There is a difficult set of problems and we have never said to the Australian people that these were going to be resolved overnight. We have had a longstanding drought and we face the circumstances of climate change. These are difficult issues which take concerted action. But in the 12 months of this government we have made more of a start than the government of which she was a member ever made.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question and know that she is deeply interested in fairness in Australian workplaces and I know that she, like me, would be very concerned when false claims are made in this debate, false claims particularly made by the Liberal Party, which is twisting and turning, trying to find a justification for voting against the Fair Work Bill.I want to clarify this matter once and for all. The Labor government is committed to retaining the prohibition on compulsory bargaining fees and the Fair Work Bill is completely in accord with this commitment. The Fair Work Bill expressly prohibits a union or employer industrial association from demanding or for purporting to demand or doing anything that would have the effect of demanding or purporting to have the effect of demanding payment of a bargaining services fee. Any breach of this provision attracts a penalty of $66,000.The bill ensures that Fair Work Australia cannot approve any agreement that includes bargaining fees. It also provides other strong protections such as prohibiting coercion to pay a bargaining fee. However, as has always been the case under the Workplace Relations Act, it does not prevent a person freely entering into a contract or commercial arrangement for the provision of bargaining services. For instance, an employer organisation may charge an employer on a fee-for-service basis for assistance and representation during the bargaining process, and in fact many employer organisations do just that.During the course of the Fair Work Bill debate this week from the party of Work Choices opposite we have heard some wild and inaccurate claims about this matter. Take for example this complete nonsense from the opposition spokesperson for workplace relations who said:Another free kick that is gained by the union movement within this legislation is that the unions are allowed to demand bargaining fees from non-union members.That claim is wrong. And then one of the architects of Work Choices, the member for Mayo, said:Of course, what will be included in these agreements? Union bargaining fees.Another claim completely wrong! Then we have had this rot from the member for Warringah when he said:Fifth, and finally, it seems - and I stress 'it seems' - that this bill does actually allow bargaining fees _This claim is wrong.Let me be very clear about this. The effect of the provisions in the Fair Work Bill is exactly the same as the current provisions in the Workplace Relations Act, the provisions first introduced by the coalition government in 2003. No amount of misleading is going to change that fact. And while the shadow minister for workplace relations has got this matter wrong and the member for Mayo has got this matter wrong, it may seem quite amazing that the member for Warringah got it wrong, because when he was minister he introduced legislation with the same terms as the Fair Work Bill. He was the minister responsible for legislation which dealt with this matter in the same terms. So you would have thought that when he was minister introducing that legislation he may at some point have been briefed on its meaning and, consequently, not have made inaccurate statements about legislation in similar terms.What is all this about? What are all these false claims about? Why are members of the Work Choices party of Australia coming into this parliament and making these false claims? It is abundantly clear. They are twisting and turning and looking for any excuse to vote against the Fair Work Bill. Why? Because they are and always will be the Work Choices party, the party of industrial relations extremism in this country. - </DOC>

 - In answer to the member for Mayo's question can I say, firstly, when he was working assisting with drafting Work Choices legislation, which enabled the rip-off of workers at risk in the Australian economy and enabled them to lose their penalty rates and overtime without compensation -  -  - It is a simple fact and, yes, it was offensive to all those at-risk workers -  - My simple point was that the former government was a government that acted in a series of areas but not in relation to this one in any effective way. Can I say to the member for Mayo that I have reasonable eyesight, assisted as I am, but clearly I cannot read across the chamber a letter he holds up. I am very happy, should he choose to have the letter brought round, to ensure that it is responded to and responded to promptly, but I cannot respond to it in detail having it held up as far away from me as that letter was.What I can say to the member for Mayo is that the government understands that right across the Murray-Darling Basin irrigators and the environment are suffering as a result of very extended drought. These statistics are probably very familiar to the member for Mayo but, for members of the House, we have now had 38 consecutive months of below average monthly inflows into the River Murray. Over the last 10 years, inflows into five of the eight catchments in the southern Murray-Darling Basin have been around or worse than the CSIRO's worst case projections for 2030. As we all know, water entitlements issued to the river under the Living Murray initiative -  - My point in going through these statistics is that water is short. There is nothing that covers that up. Water is short, and in these difficult situations -  -  - obviously governments are trying to manage the situation.Through the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council, the Rudd government is supporting measures to protect the Lower Lakes from acidifying in the short term. Obviously, as the water levels get lower and lower, the question of the acidic content of the lakes becomes critical. South Australia is also developing longer term management options for the Lower Lakes, with funding support from the Rudd Labor government. The Australian government has agreed to provide South Australia with up to $200 million for long-term management of the Lower Lakes and the Coorong and up to $120 million for a pipeline network to service communities reliant on the Lower Lakes for fresh water supplies. These steps are being taken because we understand how difficult the situation is, how difficult it is for the residents of South Australia and how difficult it is for those who are reliant on the water in the river for irrigation and other purposes. We have taken these actions as a government because we understand these problems. I would compare that record in 12 months with the record of inaction over 12 long years. - The member for McEwen, who is gesticulating wildly now, might like to think about the opportunities lost over those 12 long years.Leave granted.</DOC>

 - I will give you a deal you can't resist, Joe! I thank the member for Leichhardt for the question, because the member for Leichhardt actually represents a seat which depends on a key part of the Australian economy - the tourism sector. To be fair to the member for North Sydney, he understands the importance of the tourism industry, as he was the responsible minister who put the white paper in place and established Tourism Australia to try and create new opportunities for Australian tourism in the 21st century.In context, can I remind the House that for the first time ever the tourism industry is actually starting to think about itself as a key part of the Australian economy. For far too long it was just regarded as an add-on. Tourism opportunities were not really seen as being part of the Australian workforce or a sizeable section of the Australian economy. The facts are that it actually directly employs 480,000 Australians and represents 3.7 per cent of Australia's GDP.But when you look back over recent years you wonder when the tourism industry is going to be able to escape some of the challenges that it has had - the international difficulties of September 11, the threat of terrorism, the issue of SARS and the threat of bird flu. Domestically, we had the collapse of Ansett. More recently, I think about the difficulties we have confronted internationally with the price of oil and the strength of the Australian dollar. For example, 10 years ago no Australian thought about going to Japan to have a skiing holiday over the Christmas-New Year period. All of a sudden those things started to fall right for the Australian tourism industry and, in this context, a weakening of the dollar is good for industry. The price of oil came down, but then we were confronted by a global financial crisis.That effectively means that there is going to be no immediate turnaround in our international numbers, as the member for Cook, a former CEO of Tourism Australia, would appreciate. It is the responsibility of Tourism Australia to work to maintain a presence in those markets as we go through the current global financial crisis. I therefore remind the House of the comments made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition this morning in their Christmas valedictories. In a serious way they talked about not just us and our staff having a holiday or a break over this Christmas-New Year period but Australians at large thinking about how they can have a break and help fellow Australians.It is the responsibility of the tourism industry, in association with employer organisations, to start thinking through a strategy which facilitates people to focus on the need for a break from work and overcoming the stress of not only work but life in general. I ask Tourism Australia to start discussing more rigorously with key employer organisations such as ACCI how they can lift up a campaign that was in its infancy some years ago called 'No leave, no life'. They will be hosting a roundtable in Sydney next week to start working out a concerted strategy in association with employers to concentrate on this initiative.This is exceptionally important because, as I said to the House last week, Australian workers have been allowed to accumulate 121 million days of accrued leave and the estimated wage value of that accrued leave is around $31 billion. Perhaps more importantly, a study commissioned by Tourism Australia found around 40 per cent of employees cited workplace issues as the most significant barriers to taking leave. In this instance they have accumulated annual leave and long service leave. It is the responsibility of management to think about how they manage their workforce. It is also smart, given the increase in wages, to actually get this liability off their books. With increases in wages and salaries the liability increases over time, so it is not smart for an employer to allow this accumulation of annual leave and long service leave.For those reasons, and with the approach of Christmas and the New Year period and as the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition said this morning, we have got to do what we can to encourage all Australians who can manage it and afford it to have a holiday at home. That means in a lot of ways you are helping a lot of small and medium sized businesses who are doing it very tough at the moment. Last week the National Tourism Alliance, with whom I meet on a regular basis, reminded me that tourism is a robust industry and it will get through this difficulty yet again. The Economic Security Strategy, which kicks in next week, also has the potential to assist the industry because it has to compete for the disposable dollar. It is about families thinking about having a few days or a week away, thinking about going to a restaurant or a theme park or one of our national landscape opportunities, such as the Alps, the Green Cauldron on the Northern Rivers of New South Wales, the Great Ocean Road and the Flinders Ranges in South Australia. There is a host of opportunities in Australia to have that break from work and also assist in maintaining the viability of the Australian tourism industry and a lot of small and medium sized businesses who are looking for a helping hand in this very difficult period.The Australian tourism industry stands to gain from this initiative. If we can just unlock a small proportion of the 121 million days of accrued leave and turn it into an Australian holiday experience, we will potentially make a significant contribution to domestic tourism, help support small and medium sized businesses and help Australia through this global financial crisis. The onus is on each and every one of us to help our mates in a tough period. I commend the 'No leave, no life' campaign to the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Maranoa for his question because I certainly do not agree with the head of the National Australia Bank on those comments. I made it very clear in the House yesterday that the government's view is that the banks can pass through in full the recent Reserve Bank official cash rate cut when it comes to mortgage rates, that they should be doing much better when it comes to business loans and that they should be doing much better when it comes to credit cards. This week we have seen some substantial reductions when it comes to business loans, and we would always like to see more, and we would certainly like to see more when it comes to credit cards. I think one major firm overnight announced a reduction and the government would definitely like to see a lot more.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Solomon for his question and I note that recently he gave a speech in the House about the Northern Territory's rising road toll, calling particularly upon young people in the Northern Territory to take care. I know that this is an issue that affects every member of this House. As we prepare for the holiday period, tens of thousands of Australians will be travelling around the country to spend time with their family and loved ones or to take up the Minister for Tourism's call to travel during the festive season. But it is an unfortunate reality that a number of those who embark on that journey will not reach their destination. Over the last 12 months, 1,509 Australians died on the nation's roads. Whilst this was six per cent less than the previous year, it still equates to over four people every day. This is indeed a national tragedy and the statistics alone of course do not even begin to tell the full story of pain and loss experienced by their families. A loss of life at Christmas is particularly devastating.We all have a role to play in reducing the road toll. We should all remember the so-called 'fatal four' that are factors in the overwhelming majority of crashes: drink-driving, speeding, fatigue and not wearing a seatbelt. These can literally be fatal mistakes.Last night the Australian Automobile Association, the Australian Trucking Association and the Australian Local Government Association hosted a function here at Parliament House that was attended by both sides of the House. They came with one clear message: road safety is paramount. The three organisations reminded us that the National Road Safety Strategy's target of a 40 per cent reduction in fatalities by 2010 is unlikely to be met. That is why we, as a parliament, have to redouble our efforts.This year Australia's transport ministers initiated a National Road Safety Council to bring together community leaders and experts to coordinate road safety reforms. We have held an Indigenous road safety summit and the first ever motorcycle and scooter safety conference. We have kicked off the keys2drive program with the AAA which focuses on road safety for young drivers. We are consulting on a proposal to make electronic stability control mandatory in all new Australian vehicles. ESC helps drivers keep control of their vehicles and research shows that vehicles equipped with the ESC are 25 per cent less likely to be involved in a fatal accident.These are just some of the things that the government is doing. I urge all members to take care on the roads and to take the opportunity in the lead-up to the Christmas break to remind constituents in their electorates about the road safety message. My office and my department are willing to assist members of parliament to get that message out in each and every one of our electorates, and I encourage you to do that in the coming weeks.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I know that she is very interested in a range of health issues, particularly in her electorate. I join with her in being extremely worried about these reports. When the news was first conveyed through the media that these steps were proposed to be taken in the New South Wales budget, I asked my department to urgently remind the New South Wales government that there is an agreement with the Commonwealth and all states and territories that blood products will be provided free of charge. I have today written to my colleague Mr Della Bosca to ask whether the reports are in fact correct that these are the intended measures. I confess to you that the budget papers do not make it apparent whether these reports are accurate or not but we certainly are very concerned and we will be making sure that the agreement that is already signed onto by all jurisdictions will be adhered to.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Isaacs for this question. I know that many on this side of the House are worried, as we get into the festive season, about making sure that people do celebrate and enjoy themselves in a sensible way and particularly that young people take care to look after themselves. We have discussed the comprehensive strategy that the government is taking, on a number of occasions in this House. We have now announced 19 community grants in local communities across the country; we have launched our new, hard-hitting campaign particularly targeted at young people to highlight the risks of binge drinking; and at COAG on the weekend we committed the largest Australian government investment in preventative health, including establishing incentive payments for the states who reduce hazardous consumption of alcohol, as well as programs to target alcohol abuse through the workplace. And of course we took action in the budget to close the dangerous coalition loophole on alcopops.The early signs are that the alcopops measure is working. As I have reported to the House previously, the data that is available to us shows that spirits sales have dropped by almost 10 per cent since the loophole was closed. But, unfortunately, I must report to the House that, as the sales are dropping, parts of the alcohol industry are getting increasingly desperate. They first used deceptive data, trying to argue that the measure was not working and therefore should be dropped. More recently they tried arguing that the measure was working so well that revenue was down and therefore the measure should be dropped. It seems to us that the only thing they have not been prepared to do so far is to come out directly and say that they are trying to protect their profits at the expense of young people and therefore think the measure should be dropped.But recently - and I think this might be what the member for Isaacs was particularly interested in - their desperation has reached new heights. We have seen reports in the media and evidence from retailers that new products are being introduced purporting to be beer based alcohops, or 'malternatives', as they have been dubbed, which the industry believe can get around the alcopops measure. This was a cynical and ruthless tactic from parts of the industry that are getting increasingly desperate to protect their profits and continue to harm young people.But I can inform the House today of action that has been taken by Customs officials. I am advised that Customs have in fact chemically tested imports of certain beverages that have the appearance of alcopops but that are claimed to be beer - and 'claimed' is the operative word here, because I am advised by Customs the chemical analysis shows that the beverages did not have the essential characteristics of beer and were therefore not able to be classified as such. So trying to get around the law does not always pay. I am further advised by Customs that it is their view that these should be correctly classified in such a way that they attract the rate applying to ready-to-drinks and spirits, which is $68.54 per litre of alcohol content. Customs will monitor the classification of these beverages in accordance with normal risk based compliance approaches. In accordance with Customs' normal response to noncompliance, duty will be required to be paid at the correct rate and penalties may be applied but only after considering the individual circumstances of each case.So I am pleased to be able to inform the House that these increasingly desperate attempts by parts of the industry to get around this measure will not be successful. With four Australians under 25 dying in an average week due to alcohol related injuries, we cannot afford to ignore this problem. This government is not prepared to stand by and do nothing, as those opposite were. We are going to remain vigilant as parts of the spirits industry try every trick in the book to keep their profits high, leaving their credibility rock-bottom low.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It is good to see so many members interested in important issues in our community relating to health. Not just in New South Wales but across the country in rural and regional communities, maternity services are very much under pressure and have been for a long period of time -  
A government member - Twelve years! - Twelve years might be a good point to make here! I am aware of the issue at Pambula Hospital. In fact, the reason that I am acutely aware of it is that the member for Eden-Monaro has been very persistent in raising this issue with me, which is what you would expect local members to do.As we have been at pains to point out many times in this House, we do not have the answer to immediately and magically be able to fix every problem in the health system on day one. We do, however, have a long-term commitment to making sure that hospital services are available in our community. We believe strongly that women should be able to have their babies as close to home as they safely can - and I am due to receive, before Christmas, our maternity services review, which has been conducted by the newly appointed Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer.We are determined to fix this long term. I know that puts pressure on individual members from time to time, when decisions are made, not by us, that have an effect on the community. But this needs to be fixed long term and we are committed to doing that. We, unlike those opposite, took action very quickly upon getting elected to get advice to make sure that the decisions we make for a whole range of obstetrics and maternity services are sustainable long into the future - and that is not just in Pambula; it is in many other places across the country - and we will continue to take that action.</DOC>

 - I want to thank the member for Blair for the question and acknowledge his strong engagement with the farmers, including the dairy farmers and the sunflower, lucerne, vegetables, bean and grain crop farmers, all involved in his electorate of Blair. It has been an extraordinary year and a year of great contradictions for many of the challenges that Australia's farmers have faced during the course of this year.Commodity prices rose to record highs and there has been some easing but the easing happened at the same time that the dollar fell back as well, which meant that we were insulated from some of the advantages of those farm input prices being eased. There were some good rains in some parts of the country and some honourable members from each side of a House have been giving me reports in recent days. There is some good news. I received a text message from a farmer in Cowra, just as question time began. He has been lucky that his grain harvest is happening today. That is very good but it is certainly not the story across the whole of the country. There are some parts of the country where the harvest did not come off because of drought. There are some parts in recent weeks where the harvest did not come off because of rain. Such have been some of the challenges faced during the course of this year.While many areas of the country have come out of drought declaration, it is important to remember that 48 per cent of the land mass in Australia remains drought declared. Forty-eight per cent is a fairly extraordinary figure across the nation when these figures are based on whether or not it has been assessed historically that you are dealing with a one in 20 to 25 year event.The year in terms of our agricultural policy has been a combination of implementing the promises which we gave and commissioning two very major reviews which have now nearly concluded and will form the work program very much for next year. The promises to be delivered on began this year with the wheat marketing reforms -  - The show of coalition unity which wheat always attracts! We have also been implementing with Australia's farming future in mind a significant investment in making sure that our R&amp;D programs are squarely aimed at preparing farmers for the future and preparing farmers for the challenges that climate change brings. We have also established the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, AFMA, on a bipartisan basis as a commission and $20 million to help our forestry industries prepare for the future.Of the two major reviews I referred to, one refers to quarantine and the other refers to drought. All honourable members are aware of the devastation that was caused following equine influenza. Industry estimates a billion dollars damage to it through that. It is probably more, but we will certainly never know. Roger Beale has handed his report to me and that is now being considered by government as a comprehensive view of how Australia can better protect its biosecurity status. The national review of drought policy has formed a good part of the discussion this year, acknowledging that the challenges the climate is bringing us in the future are different from what we have had in the past. I reiterate the guarantee that I have consistently given and that the Prime Minister has repeated: it is a review of how we will handle the next drought and does not carry changes to the protections people enjoy - they are going through the current drought and some of the most difficult experiences of their working lives. I would also add the Economic Security Strategy. More than $4 billion of that money goes into rural and regional Australia, forming a very important part of that total package.Many of the issues that have gone on around the world have all come down in agriculture, and we knew from the beginning of the year when they were predicted as an agricultural theme for the year when the United Nations deemed 2008 to be the International Year of the Potato, which honourable members may not be aware of. It was a year where we saw a global food crisis, a global financial crisis and climate change, all of which put very strong pressure on us to make sure that we get the policy settings right to prepare our primary producers for the future.</DOC>

 - I absolutely thank the member for the question. That is extraordinary. For 12 years the Ipswich motorway has been an issue in Brisbane. For 12 years they did nothing about the Ipswich Motorway. The government went out there and started work on it. The Prime Minister and I on 2 March of this year - and I remember it because it was my birthday - spent the day working on the Ipswich Motorway with Shayne Neumann and Bernie Ripoll, and the members who supported this important, critical project for Brisbane. It is terrific that the last question asked this year by the opposition is one which is critical of our nation-building agenda, because it says it all. - The blow-out is in the tyres of the coalition vehicle. That is the blow-out, because they have just blown it. They have just sent a message to everyone in Brisbane, particularly to people around Ipswich - the good burghers of Ipswich - and Moreton, of course, and all the seats along that road, that they are against it. They were against it for 12 years and, now that there is action being taken, they are against it again. It is just mind-boggling.This government is absolutely committed to fulfilling our commitments on road, rail, ports, broadband and nation building. Those opposite just exposed themselves once again through that extraordinarily pathetic question. I thank whoever it was on the tactics committee who decided to give me a belated birthday present by asking that question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corio for his question, which will be the last question in the parliamentary session this year. Can I perhaps echo a theme started by the member for Batman, that there would be many members in this parliament and many members of the Australian community who are looking forward to some quiet time at the end of the year and a few holiday pursuits. Amongst the things that people might be thinking of doing as they move towards the festive season and get a bit of quiet time is going to the movies. Of course, one of the movies they may be going to see would be the new movie Australia by Baz Luhrmann. Certainly I know the Minister for Trade is a big advocate for it. I do not know how he manages to find the time, but he is someone who -  - Yes, a romantic. The Acting Leader of the Opposition is suggesting he must be a romantic because he did take himself off to that movie very quickly and came back with good reports. That movie is one way of showing Australian landscapes and Australian stories to the world. One way in which we think about ourselves and work through in our own minds what it means to be Australian is through the images reflected in popular culture. There would be many members of this House who grew up with images of Skippy, Neighbours, A Country Practice and various other shows that have reflected to us what it is to be Australian.I actually rise at the end of question time to deal with a rumour I know is sweeping through the corridors of Parliament House. It may be concerning people, but there is no truth in the rumour that over the summer break members of the opposition will be filming an Australian version of Batman. I am informed that the Leader of the Opposition screen tested well for the role of millionaire Bruce Wayne but did not do quite so well with the superhero bit. I am informed that the member for Sturt screen tested very well as Robin. You can imagine him in that role. I am informed that various members of the Liberal front bench screen tested well in the roles of the Riddler and the Joker, and I am informed that the Acting Leader of the Opposition, in the honourable tradition of Eartha Kitt and Nicole Kidman, screen tested well as Catwoman. With those comments, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>
