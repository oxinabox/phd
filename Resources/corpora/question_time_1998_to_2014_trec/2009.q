     That works out at $233,000 per job per year, and I ask the Prime Minister whether he believes there are any alternative policies, or if he has considered any alternative policies, which would create more jobs for the $42 billion or indeed policies that would create the same number of jobs at a lower cost to the budget?

     Prime Minister, could you elaborate on your comment and, given that every inquiry since 1939 has focused on fuel reduction in fire-prone areas, do you believe it is time we learnt from Aboriginal Australians, whose firestick management practices created the bush environment that white Australians are attempting to modify to a landscape that has never existed?

    ' However, yesterday, only 24 hours later, Anna Bligh conceded that she could not guarantee those jobs.

     In each case, we asked the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to provide the House with the projected economic growth figures, inflation rates, budget surpluses and other financial assumptions through to 2022 that would support the Prime Minister's dubious claim that all of the massive debt he is running up will be repaid by that date.
     I refer to the answer that each of them gave, which was that these assumptions were to be found in the budget papers.

    Prime Minister, how many of these connections included a personal phone call from the Treasurer, updates to the Treasurer's home fax, a car dealer's mobile phone details being handed over to the CEO of a finance company seeking a $500 million Commonwealth guarantee, a Treasury official referring to the Prime Minister's friendship with a car dealer when seeking finance on that dealer's behalf, and self-assessment of financial viability by the dealer?
     Isn't it true that if you look at the total picture, of the 240 car dealers, only one had the right connections and got the special treatment?

     Overinvestment in housing, which has been chronic in this country, has been contributed to by favourable treatment in the tax system.
     We should abolish negative gearing and modify the capital gains tax exemption by, for example, applying that exemption only to the unimproved value of houses purchased.

     It is our information that the Queensland government still has not set up machinery for enabling First Australians to own their own land - private, deeded land tenure - a right enjoyed by every other Australian.
     The Queensland government has now promised this right for three, arguably eight, years.
     Given the 1966 referendum which gave constitutional powers over First Australians to the federal government, would the minister not agree that it is time now for the federal government to exercise its responsibility and undertake the issuance of such deeds, a function already accepted as federal government responsibility in the Northern Territory?
     Is the minister aware that throughout the latter 1980s 90 per cent of house-building labour in Queensland's First Australian communities was local and, very importantly, part CDEP?
     This, along with local concrete block factories, enabled seven houses to be built for every one that is now being built.
     Finally, occupancy rates in communities were last year averaging around 15 people per home.
     Could the minister, in line with stated Rudd government policy, implement such policies now?
     Otherwise, what is already an emergency will become the most serious of crises.

    It should make the job of the Reserve Bank easier, not harder.
    That is why the Government is committed to strengthening the budget position as well as improving the quality of public spending.
    Given that the Reserve Bank has indicated that it will unwind its stimulatory monetary policy and given that the Prime Minister insists on spending the government's stimulus in full, will the minister now confirm that spending and interest rate policies are actually working against each other?

     I refer to his remarks in this House on 9 August 2007.
     He said:It is traditional in the economic debate about the relationship between government spending and interest rates to focus on the quantity of government spending, the size of the surplus and the size of the deficit.
     That is vital; it is very important, but there is another dimension which is often overlooked - that is, the quality of government spending.
     What is that money being spent on?
     Quantity is obviously vital and the settings are vital but so too is the quality.

     As she has not visited the Wahroonga Public School, as she offered to do many months ago, is her promise to Langwarrin Primary School as hollow as her promise to the students of the Wahroonga Public School?

     The Prime Minister would be aware that the life expectancy of original Australians is 17 years less than other Australians'.
     In spite of the Prime Minister's genuine and generous saying sorry, is he aware that last year the front page of the Australian reported that there are three times more original Australian children stolen in New South Wales now than in the stolen generation era?
     Queensland's and the Northern Territory's are double this rate.
     Is the Prime Minister further aware that 30 per cent of the Australian continent is Aboriginal lands, yet upon it an original Australian cannot own even half an acre, since the law does not provide for any private ownership title whatsoever?
     This is in spite of promises by Queensland since 1991, for example.
     Additionally, land that came as a result of non-alienated reserved areas, purchases and the Mabo decision is now having most of its property rights stripped away through an ever-increasing dispossession by World Heritage, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, GBRMPA, national parks and, now, runaway conservation zones and wild river proposals.
     First Australians' rights to earn a living from their lands and seas, or even get food, are now being taken away.
     In light of this panorama of lethal paternalism, could the Prime Minister consider designating in his department a senior official who could have the overarching power to deal with these cross-ministry issues?
     Finally, is the Prime Minister aware that the legal team that won Mabo is now being pulled together to fight against the wild rivers and other declarations?

     My question relates to the 42 asylum seekers from the SIEV36.
     The actions of the 42 asylum seekers are still the subject of police inquiries and a Northern Territory coronial inquest because police believe the fuel on the vessel was deliberately set alight, killing five people and seriously injuring many on board, including Australian service personnel.
     Can the minister confirm that permanent residency has been granted to these 42 asylum seekers and that they are not required to report their whereabouts to the department of immigration or any other agency?

     I refer the Prime Minister to the Minister for Home Affairs' answers about the Australian Federal Police report Strategic Intelligence Forecast - Transnational criminal trends and threats to Australia, which reportedly indicates that the government's changes to border protection policy would be marketed by people smugglers to potential asylum seekers.
     Given that the minister has neither read nor bothered to get a copy of this very important report, which has been provided to nine government agencies, including the Prime Minister's own department, and six overseas agencies, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, will the Prime Minister now ensure that he reads the report and reports back to the parliament on its assessments?

     When asked whether Australia was tough or soft on asylum seekers coming by boat he replied, 'Soft.
    ' Why won't the Prime Minister admit what Majid and the Australian Federal Police have recognised -  -  - I am glad our border protection is a matter of such hilarity to the government.
     - On this side we take it seriously.
     -  - Why won't the Prime Minister admit what Majid and the Australian Federal Police have recognised that it is in fact the government's changes to border protection policy which have provided people smugglers with a powerful marketing tool to induce more and more asylum seekers to risk their lives coming to Australia?

    In light of the fact that electricity averages 25 per cent of all mining costs and since the proposed increases in electricity prices have been modelled by MMA for Treasury to be over 25½ per cent, and since the CPRS regime is now agreed to by the bulk of the LNP members from Queensland as well as the opposition, could the Treasurer assure the House that he will take action to see that competitively priced renewable energy will come on stream from his and Resources and Energy Minister Ferguson's transmission line clean energy corridor initiative in Northern Australia?

     I remind the Prime Minister -  - My question is to the Prime Minister.
     I remind the Prime Minister of his explicit commitment that he would reject all political donations to the Labor Party from Kevin Reynolds and Joe McDonald of the West Australian division of the CFMEU and to his commitment yesterday that since the year 2000 the federal Labor Party has 'not received any donations from the Western Australian construction division of the CFMEU'.
     I further refer him to the following comments by Mr Reynolds in the lead-up to the 2007 federal election:Interviewer: How much of that money has been budgeted for Western Australian seats?
    Reynolds: $40,000.
    Interviewer: Okay, whereabouts?
    Reynolds: Stirling and Hasluck.
    , 20 grand each.
    Prime Minister, as Stirling and Hasluck are federal seats, do you still claim that you kept your promise?
