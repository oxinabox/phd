 - I have not read all the evidence that has been presented to the Senate. But I do know this, and the Australian people know this: the man who has just asked me that question is somebody who is trying to deny to the Australian people $13 billion worth of personal tax cuts. The Labor Party and those parties in the Senate who are opposed to our tax package are saying to the Australian people, `Although you voted so that 81 per cent of Australian taxpayers would have a top marginal rate of 30 cents in the dollar, we are going to do our damnedest to stop the Australian people getting it.'Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition: now that the parliament has resumed, our commitment to giving personal tax relief to the battlers of Australia, the family men and women of Australia, remains undiminished. Our commitment to reforming the Australian taxation system is as strong now as it has ever been and your attempts to sabotage long-term reform of the Australian taxation system will do you immense political damage.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Bradfield, that report grew out of the establishment of a task force which took place within two or three weeks of the election of the coalition government in March 1996. Because the report of the task force was tabled after the parliament had risen in December of last year, I want to record my thanks in particular to the chairman of that task force, a very remarkable man, Captain David Eldridge of the Salvation Army.The task force tested and evaluated the early intervention strategies of 26 pilot projects right around Australia. When I launched the report at St John's in Darlinghurst in Sydney in December, the groups that had been visited by the task force and the groups that had been touched by the various pilots represented a very wide spectrum of the Australian community. When I launched the task force report, I was very pleased to announce that the government would immediately implement its principal recommendation, and that was continuation of the early intervention strategies which had been proved to be so successful and which had been the subject of the pilot schemes that had been conducted as a result of the initiative in March 1996.We are going to provide a new $60 million, four-year program. The new program will provide 100  services of the type piloted, and this will assist 12,000 cases a year involving about 7,000 young people and 7,000 parents. I have asked officials to advise me by mid-1999 on options for implementing other key task force recommendations. I do take this opportunity to thank the members of the task force and to remind the House that they have piloted and trialled methods of early intervention which, on the basis of those pilots, have encouraged the government to invest further resources in what I believe will be an extremely successful approach.The report of the task force shows that young people and their parents are keen to get help before problems become crises. One third of young people living away from home before intervention, as a result of the experience of the task force's work, returned to live with one or both of their parents. This emphasis on early intervention is not only useful in relation to strategies combating youth homelessness but, of course, is also undeniably useful in relation to strategies combating drug abuse.I take the opportunity to say again how much the government appreciates the work in so many of these areas of the great welfare sector organisations like the Salvation Army, whose practical hands-on, real life experience is superior to that of any people involved in  this area anywhere in Australia. It will be, with appropriate help, the continuing policy of my government to involve them even more in giving advice and making judgments on the adequate delivery of welfare services in Australia.</DOC>

 - Can I inform the House there is only one shadow Treasurer that you should never believe on every occasion. It is the member for Hotham. Let me make the point that in the last three years under the government's policy, which has seen Australia become one of the strongest economies in the world, 400,000 new jobs were created. - Four hundred thousand new jobs were created, and the unemployment rate is as low now as it has been since Labor and Keating put Australia into recession.The point I make is that we can do better in relation to unemployment if we do all of the things that I have set out, if we continue the strong economic growth that this government has put in place. We can do better if we deregulate the labour market, which is  something Labor opposes. You will never improve labour market deregulation, and therefore you will not get benefits in increased jobs, while you have got Labor being obstructionist in the Senate.The third thing that we can do is reform the Australian taxation system. But I make the point that you will never get a better tax system and you will never get the increased jobs whilst you have got Labor being obstructionist in the Senate. The fourth thing you can do is improve the interaction between the welfare and the tax systems. - That will create jobs and get a lower unemployment rate in Australia. - There are four elements of government policy that will create jobs for Australia, four elements that are opposed by the Australian Labor Party, the party of high unemployment.</DOC>

 - Against a backdrop of international economic turmoil, particularly in a region which is now nearly totally in recession if not depression, the Australian economy continues to grow, according to the last September quarter national accounts, at a rate of five per cent. This makes Australia probably the fastest growing developed economy in the world. The Chief Economist of the National Australia Bank, no known optimist, described the result recently as `stunning'. The IMF Deputy Managing Director, Stanley Fischer, described it as `having done remarkably well' and Paul Krugman, in a recent edition of Fortune  magazine, said Australia was the `miracle economy' of the world financial crisis.Since this government has come to office, inflation has averaged one per cent per annum. Under the Labor Party, inflation averaged 5.2 per cent per annum. Under this government, real wages have grown around 2½ per cent per annum. Under the Labor Party, they grew 0.5 per cent per annum. Employment grew 2.1 per cent in 1998 and the unemployment rate fell to a decade long low. There are nearly 400,000 more Australians employed today than when the government came to office in March 1996. In its living wage submission to the national wage case, the ACTU says this:Total employment growth has surged over recent months. Labour market data exhibits considerable volatility from month to month. However, the apparent strength of the labour market is not a flukey result.The ACTU says that the apparent strength of the labour market is not a flukey result. No, it is not. You had to put a budget back into balance to get it. You had to bring down inflation and interest rates. You had to start paying back Labor debt.Mortgage interest rates are now at their lowest levels in a generation, small business overdraft indicator rates are the lowest in 30 years, the budget is in surplus and we are on track to halve Labor's debt. We had the opportunity to wipe out Labor's debt with the privatisation of Telstra. In an area with an Asian economy which is now totally in recession, if not depression, this is a remarkable performance by the Australian economy. To quote the ACTU, this is not a flukey result. This is the result of good policy - good policy opposed all the way by the Labor Party in this parliament.</DOC>

 - I refer to the tax package itself and the researches and modellings that we published and put out in the tax package. Salomon Smith Barney predicted that tax reform would lift GDP by 2.3 per cent. That is not bad, is it? Econotech, using MM 303, indicated a long run GDP gain, with the replacement of a WST with a VAT, of around two per cent. Murphy final analysis of the package is indicating an effect of an increase in GDP, I believe, of 1.8 per cent. The Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research model was used and adopted by ACOSS. In its submission to the Senate, ACOSS could prove no class of person was worse off. The Melbourne Institute, using ORANI, indicated that indirect tax reform could lift GDP by 3.8 per cent. Access Economics said that the tax package would lift GDP by 2.5 per cent and create 190,000 new jobs. Why would the Labor Party sit there and say, `We are against increased GDP as found by Salomon's, increased GDP as found by Econotech, increased GDP as found by the Melbourne Institute, increased GDP as found by Access -  - What effect do you think a growth in GDP would have: a negative effect on employment? Is that the Labor Party's argument now? With all of these increases in the GDP, what effect do you think that would have? As Access Economics said, 190,000 new jobs. Isn't it a great thing to be cutting people's personal income taxes? Isn't it a great thing, after all of these years, to get a new tax system, and won't it be a great thing for Australia to have a stronger economy under tax reform?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. He asked what we have been doing to help create jobs. I am pleased to inform the honourable member that immediately after the election we started to implement the policies which were endorsed by the Australian people at the last election and which were aimed at starting to resolve some of the problems created by our predecessors, whose policies cost this country a lot of jobs. One of the things we did was to introduce and use the regulation power. This is a power available to this government, as it was used five times by my predecessor, the member for Kingsford-Smith, in respect of unfair dismissals. Why did we introduce that? Because we said to the Australian people, `If you elect us, we will do all within our power to provide a fair go for small business. If you give small business a fair go then we believe there are 50,000 jobs to be created.'It was very interesting last week that the Senate committee heard some people running small business give evidence about the impact of the unfair dismissal laws on their business and their intentions of creating jobs. A Mr Tonkin of Tonkin's Car Audio told the committee:Yes, we would certainly put on more people. At the moment every person you put on now is a potential litigation waiting to happen.A Mr Maloney said:This year I was planning to hire two people full time. Those people will now not have jobs.He went on to say:This is real. It is hurting people. It is putting people out of business and breaking up families. It is costing Australia and it is costing the economy.What do the Labor Party say when they are confronted by the reality of their own policies? They  have the cheek to say, `This is a political stunt. The real people should come up and tell us what is really happening in our businesses.' The fact is that Labor created this problem. They are now the barriers, standing in the way of a sensible solution.It is exactly the same with youth employment. We have a problem with youth employment and, as a government, we are working to fix that. We are again fixing up the problems created by Labor. They of course think that a lot of these young people's jobs are jobs not worth having. I at least pay tribute to the member for Melbourne, who said in his book:The ridiculous notion that some jobs are not real jobs but merely theme park jobs or McJobs must be abandoned. Many of the jobs in the old economy are no more fulfilling or better paid than such new jobs, and they are often dirtier and more dangerous.We reckon a job at McDonald's is a job worth having. We are prepared to support those employers prepared to give young people a job. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: you have a few dissentient voices on your own backbench and frontbench. It is about time we saw some real leadership to actually create jobs in this country.</DOC>

 - I did indeed have the great delight of being present at the dedication of the building in Canowindra for the Age of Fishes Museum. That building has  been constructed with the assistance of a $200,000 grant from the government's Regional Tourism Development Program. That is a very interesting program in that it provides an opportunity for jobs growth, and for communities to get behind finds in their area and to do something of great importance for our nation.That whole museum is built on a 10 square metre pond in which, 360 million years ago, 3,000 fish died simultaneously. The area silted up and created some excellent fossils from which eight species have been found. We have international experts coming to look at Australia, taking into account their experience overseas, and contributing to the scientific knowledge of how our world was formed and where life came from. One of the professors there, Dr Alex Ritchie, is a very interesting and learned fellow who has been naming a number of the fish found after a number of their benefactors and after a number of the towns in the area. This project has been supported by the Cabonne Shire, the Parkes Shire and the Cowra Shire councils and by the federal government.We have seen a move towards regional tourism in the form of events, gardens and museums. You have motor racing at Bathurst, you have the Cowra japanese gardens, and you have a number of festivals and  tourism attractions in regional Australia. All of these contribute -  - It is a very exceptional project, worthy of support. It has a number of the towns' support. It is something that I support for the future of Australia - for our regional tourism as well as for its scientific value. It is something that the government is giving serious consideration to.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. The government's partial sale of Telstra has been an outstanding success. It has enjoyed widespread support from the Australian community, has allowed the government to retire a significant proportion of Labor debt and has led to the establishment of the nation's biggest environmental repair program, the Natural Heritage Trust.The shares in Telstra that are held now by 1.3 million Australians are very much prized. But, despite this success, Labor has steadfastly opposed this sale of Telstra and the future sale of Telstra. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition has staked his reputation on this opposition. So I was surprised at the weekend to read that the opposition's position seems to have changed on this issue. The man who is touted as a future potential Leader of the Opposition, the member for Melbourne, has spoken out against his leader. He said:Part private ownership of Telstra creates internal tensions and contradictions and inhibits the extent to which social value can be obtained from a huge investment of public capital. If the balance of Telstra is not sold, it may be desirable to restructure its core infrastructure functions into complete public ownership and fully privatise some of its service provision's functions.That quote comes from the manifesto called Open Australia , which I believe is to be launched later this week. Now we see the honourable member for Melbourne supporting the honourable member for Werriwa, who has said similar things in the past. What the honourable member for Melbourne recognises is that his party's position on the sale of Telstra is indefensible. It is particularly indefensible when you look at it alongside Labor's sale of the Commonwealth Bank and Labor's sale of Qantas.We also learnt about six weeks ago from an article in the Business Review Weekly that what the former Labor government proposed to do with Telstra was not to sell it to the mums and dads of Australia. The former  Labor Prime Minister had a proposal to sell Telstra to BHP - not the mums and dads of Australia.  I congratulate the future Leader of the Opposition on the stand that he has taken on the hypocrisy of Labor over the sale and I welcome his support for the sale of Telstra.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I must preface any answer I give by saying that they are unsubstantiated statements that are being made in the House today. I do not know the truth or otherwise of them. I would be pleased to see the details if you chose -  - If the member had bothered to listen to the rest of the answer, he would have been spared this waste of time. I was about to say that if he would choose to send me the documentation I will refer it to the Treasurer and we will give you a written answer.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I appreciate the interest that the member for Moreton shows in foreign affairs issues and in particular in the important relationship between Australia and Indonesia. In answer to the first part of the question I think it would be fair to say that Indonesians generally know that Australia is a good friend during this period which could only be described as a crossroads in Indonesian history. We are helping Indonesia very considerably with the recovery of its economy. We are helping Indonesia in the lead-up to the crucial elections on 7 June, and we are working with Indonesia over the fraught and longstanding issue of East Timor.The honourable member also asked me whether I was aware of any developments over the past week that could have an adverse impact on this important relationship. What I am aware of is the quite extraordinary behaviour of none other than the member for Kingsford-Smith. Of course the House is aware of the really quite bizarre attacks by the member for Kingsford-Smith on his own party, on the long-suffering member for Holt. The man the Leader of the Opposition said was the greatest foreign minister in history  has yet again been savaged by the member for Kingsford-Smith.The member for Kingsford-Smith attacked the Whitlam government and Mr Whitlam personally, whom he described on this issue of East Timor as `dangerously ambiguous'. He attacked Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, who on the issue of East Timor presided over `profound foreign policy failures'. You would think that the member for Kingsford-Smith had operated over all those years in a complete vacuum. He was not a member of the Labor Party? He was not a member of parliament? He was not a member of the cabinet? He never sat in a cabinet meeting and discussed the issue of East Timor or relations with Indonesia? Of course he did. We all know that what he is really about is cheapskate populism without any consultation with the backbench committee. It has not been discussed in detail with the caucus committee - we know that - or indeed with the Leader of the Opposition. This extraordinary speech was not run past the office of the Leader of the Opposition; it just happened.In conclusion, let me make this point. The member for Kingsford-Smith can play politics within the Labor Party, left and right, attacking the record of Labor. As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, you can hack each other to death, we do not care. In fact, we quite enjoy it. I would not be answering this question if we did not. The member for Kingsford-Smith did something that you should not do; that is, when the Indonesian ambassador wrote a letter to him the other day, that private correspondence miraculously appeared in the newspapers. I cannot tell you how that happened, but I can tell you that the Indonesian ambassador took a very dim view of this and spoke to the media complaining about the member for Kingsford-Smith leaking private correspondence which gave his view.Mr Speaker, that sort of thing is what does damage to Australia's standing. The Leader of the Opposition  should show some leadership and find a new spokesman on foreign affairs who knows something about the history of these issues and over whom he might like to try to exercise some leadership.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, as is usual when the member for Lilley asks a question, most of his facts are at best tainted and, in many instances, completely inaccurate. Of course I agree with the Treasurer in his comments in relation to the issues that have been raised. He drafted the legislation and naturally he will interpret it in accordance with the government's wishes in that regard. This tax package offers enormous benefits for renters and for all low income earners and the honourable member for Lilley knows that. - Substantial welfare increases, to start off with, and increases in pensions and benefits to all Australians. All those paying tax will pay less tax. - As I was saying, the new tax package provides enormous benefits to all Australians, including renters. Under these arrangements -  - This issue is clearly about the tax package and the legislation is about the tax package. The legislation makes it clear that proprietors are able to choose the system that best suits their circumstances and renters will be in a position to respond because of the increased benefits that this tax package provides to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that there are millions of Australians on middle incomes who are looking forward to cuts in personal income tax. That is what they voted for in the election last year and, as far as we are concerned, that is what we are going to deliver for them. This government is determined to deliver in full the package which it was given a mandate from the Australian people to implement at the last election.On the Liberal and National Party side of the House, we believe that middle income earners should be paying lower income tax. We believe that under our plan 81 per cent of taxpayers will pay no more than a top marginal income tax rate of 30 per cent. Only the Labor Party stands in the way of 81 per cent of taxpayers getting a tax cut down to those levels. Under the government's plan, 95 per cent of Australian taxpayers get a cut in their marginal income tax rate. If Labor has its way and defeats income tax cuts, which is Labor's policy - let us make this clear; Labor's policy is to defeat income tax cuts - a taxpayer on 1.2 times average earnings will be paying a top marginal rate of 47 per cent or 48½ per cent with the Medicare levy. Under Labor's plan, if you are earning 1-2 times average weekly earnings, you will be paying half to the tax office. Under the coalition plan, the average earner will be kicked down to a rate of 30c in the dollar.Let us also remember that, under the tax plan in the Senate, the government is trying to increase family benefits by increasing tax-free thresholds for each child - that is, an additional $1,000 increase in the tax-free threshold. There will be an increase of $2,500 in the tax-free threshold for families that have a child under 5 years of age. There is an increase in the taper rate, which is currently at 50 per cent, down to 30 per cent, to take out those poverty traps that are currently in the tax systemAt the last election the Labor Party had three big tax ideas. The first was to put a capital gains tax on all pre-1985 assets, and after the election they said that that policy was wrong. The second policy they had was to increase the tariff on all four-wheel drive vehicles. - The member for Hotham said he was going to `drive out the Toorak tractors' - don't we remember that? The Leader of the Opposition came out and said, `We were wrong about that policy as well.' Their third policy was to oppose the government's tax plan. They were wrong on capital gains, and they admit it; they were wrong on four-wheel drives, and they admit it; and they are wrong on the GST, and they  might as well admit it. You might as well accept that the people of Australia voted for tax reform. They want lower income taxes, and we want to give them lower income taxes. Pass the tax package.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. It is timely because tomorrow morning I am opening a conference of all state officials to discuss where we are going with water safety in Australia. Currently, $76 million is being spent on the issue of water safety in Australia and how to save Australian lives. It is quite unusual in that this is the most amount of money ever spent in the history of Australia, yet we are still losing lives. So it is imperative, before we put any more money on the wall, that we look at how we are currently spending the money and where future money should be spent in order to save lives. I am quite encouraged that the Treasurer has got it absolutely right as far as non-profit organisations are concerned, and this government will continue to assist our remarkable agencies such as the Surf Life Saving Association, the Royal Life Saving Society Australia and Austswim in their efforts to help Australians and save them from deaths by drowning.</DOC>

 - You are renowned for your extraordinary wit. - I did hear the question; it was about the visit of President Scalfaro. I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his unexpected question! Since our two electorates are adjacent to each other, I know that there are a large number of Australians of Italian origin in the honourable member's electorate, as there are in my electorate, and that the honourable member for Sturt is a very enthusiastic advocate of their cause.The visit by President Scalfaro was, I think, as all members of the House would recognise, a very great success and was symbolic of the extraordinary improvements there have been in Australia's relationship with Italy over recent years. We have said as a government that of course we focus first and foremost on our own region, as all countries do, in our foreign policy, but we have global interests. One of our global interests is with the European Union, and one of the key countries in the European Union is Italy. We have upgraded our relationship with Italy. We have established an economic and cultural council, which the Deputy Prime Minister has presided over on one occasion, and we have had quite a number of interactions between Australian and Italian ministers.I think the success of our strategy with Italy is demonstrated by the significant growth in our exports to Italy over recent times and the growing people-to-people contacts between our two countries, so it was a great honour to have the President of Italy visit Australia last year. All of us on this side of the House, and I am sure some on the other side of the House, too, were delighted to have had the opportunity to meet him. I also enjoyed extensive discussions with the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, who travelled with the President on that occasion.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I am sure she, like all members of this House, and in common with the Australian travelling community, believes that it is appropriate that we place an enormous emphasis on aviation safety in this country. I believe that my predecessors in this role and the government have given CASA an outstanding board, which is headed up by a competent  and enthusiastic chairman, who understands aviation safety and is absolutely committed to it. So, of course, I and the government have confidence in CASA's board and its chairman.In relation to the chairman's concerns, expressed publicly about BASI, I have met and talked at length with the chairman and the board, as was revealed by Senator Ian Macdonald this morning. I have for some time been working on the terms of reference for a broad and, I stress, independent inquiry into BASI. I think it is appropriate and timely that we do so. Very shortly, I will be announcing both the terms of reference and the names of those who will be undertaking that considerable responsibility.The overall comment that needs to be made here is that you had a very long time indeed when you were in government to get aviation safety in Australia up to the highest and most satisfactory levels possible. You, only in your latter days in office, restructured the thing and gave a broad canvass, with which the government broadly concurs. But we were the people who sought very hard to put an effective board in charge of that organisation. I have every confidence that Australia maintains and continues to maintain nothing but the highest standards in aviation safety.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question as well, and for the interest he shows in the appalling humanitarian crisis of Kosovo.First of all, the Australian government has given what diplomatic support we can to the contact group. When I was in Europe during the course of the last week I was pleased to have the opportunity to speak with, amongst others, the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, and other officials in Europe about the crisis in Kosovo. I think the efforts that have been made, particularly by Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and his French counterpart, Mr Vedrine, is quite a considerable achievement. I very much hope that the talks at Rambouillet in France, which are scheduled to get under way today, will be successful and that we see some substantial progress at last in terms of achieving the autonomy package that is being proposed by the contact group.As I mentioned earlier, we have also been very concerned about the humanitarian consequences of the political disaster of Kosovo. We recently provided $100,000 to help with the problem there, but I know that other countries are doing a great deal to assist as well. We judge that the best contribution overall that Australia can make to this issue is for us to provide as strong a diplomatic support as we can for the contact group for the negotiations between the Yugoslav government and the secessionists in Kosovo and to hope that those negotiations can produce a  constructive autonomy package  which will help to bring peace to that troubled part of the Balkans.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for giving me an opportunity to say something about this. About a year ago, when we had the Constitutional Convention, I gave a number of undertakings to the Australian people through that convention. The first of those undertakings was that, if a clear view about a republican model came from the convention, I would put it. The second undertaking I gave was that, on matters relating to the republic, the coalition parties would have an open vote.I remind the Leader of the Opposition that I have now been involved in two elections as leader of the coalition, and on both of those occasions I have been completely frank and open about my own personal view. - In the context of the debate on the republic. - If the opposition wants to score a little point, okay, score one to the boy wonder from Dobell. But let us return to a serious subject, because I think the Leader of the Opposition asked this as a serious question. I have been completely open with the Australian people. I do not think the constitution ought to be changed to create an Australian republic, and nothing that I have heard in the debate over the past few months has altered my view on that. There will be a completely open vote amongst my colleagues in relation to that. Some of my colleagues agree with me, some of them differ from me. - I would say to those opposite that, if you really want to get an affirmative vote for your majority proposition, you will not politicise this issue. You will do enormous damage to your own cause if you try to score a lot of political points off us on this issue.Let me tell you my view on the preamble. I think that, as we approach the Centenary of Federation, there are a growing number of Australians - Liberal and Labor, republican and anti-republican alike - who would like to see embedded in the basic document of this country some recognition of the prior occupation of the landmass of Australia by the indigenous people. That is my view. As I go around Australia, I find a  greater unanimity of support for that than I do on the issue of the republic.Over the last three months, I have perceived quavering views about the republic. I do not know what is going to happen in the referendum on the republic. I really do not. I think people who get up and say, `Oh, it's in trouble' are deluding themselves - I do not know that it is. But people who run around saying that it has 60 per cent or 70 per cent support are deluding themselves too. I think there are a large number of people in the Australian community who genuinely have not made up their minds on this issue. There are a lot of direct-election republicans who want to have a direct election for the president, a stance which I am personally far more strongly opposed to than I am to the mainstream model that is being put at the referendum, although I am strongly opposed to both.I think we ought to talk rather openly about this issue. I think it is an issue which challenges the political maturity of both sides of Australian politics. The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about the preamble. I have given you my personal view about it. Then, in typical political style - which is fair enough for a Leader of the Opposition - he asked me for some kind of unequivocal guarantee. I am not going to give an unequ ivocal guarantee, because I have already told my party and the National Party that they can have a free vote on matters related to this issue. The unequivocal guarantee that I will give to the Leader of the Opposition and to the Australian people is that, at all times, I will be completely open and direct with the Australian people.I have been twice elected as Prime Minister of this country as an anti-republican. I remain an anti-republican, but, as Prime Minister of this country, I think that the national unity of this country would be enhanced - and I think this parliament would be ennobled and enhanced - if we could find a workable way to recognise in the basic document of our country the prior occupation of the landmass of this country by the indigenous people.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, it is a pleasure to follow the Prime Minister and the fine answer that he has given. Work for the Dole is one of the signature programs of this Howard government. Already more than 400 Work for the Dole projects have commenced and more than 18,000 young Australians have gained work experience through this program. Before Christmas I announced a further 300 projects involving another 13,000 young Australians, including, I am  happy to say, three projects in the electorate of Parramatta involving 168 people.Numerous community organisations throughout Australia have been very, very happy to work with the government on this program. Many, many organisations, including local councils, have been happy to work with the government on this program but, unfortunately, the New South Wales Labor government has instructed its agencies and instrumentalities not to cooperate without first securing union approval. The New South Wales Labor government has given unions a veto over these programs designed to benefit young Australians.The latest Labor politician to leap to the Sussex Street command is the Labor Mayor of Parramatta, who has just come out and attacked the Work for the Dole programs in Parramatta, despite the fact that they involve the construction of new community facilities, despite the fact that they involve work experience with neighbourhood centres and migrant resource centres and despite the fact that they are run by that great Australian organisation Mission Australia.Modern Labor might be what the Leader of the Opposition likes to talk about. He might like to say that they support reciprocal obligation but only in so far as it suits Labor's union mates. You have to ask the question: why is it that the ALP is punishing the unemployed to protect the unions? The answer is not very hard to find. Of the 24 new members of this parliament following the last election, 12 of them - or 50 per cent - were union officials before entering this place. Of the 34 ALP frontbenchers, 18 of them - or 52 per cent - were union officials before they entered this place.The Leader of the Opposition is paralysed with indecision in coping with the kinds of reform pressures that he is getting from the member for Melbourne and the member for Werriwa, and it is quite easy to see why - because too many of his own team believe in a government of the unions, by the unions, for the unions, and Labor will stay in the wilderness until that changes.</DOC>

 - The shadow minister is utterly predictable. The case she refers to first came up in debate in 1996 as a result of the government's attempt to remove a blatant rort that had existed for many years. I was informed at the time that the previous government had attempted to do something but had not been able to do something. At the time, I was informed that it was a genuine case, and I answered a question on notice to that effect. I did today ask for it to be checked again. The advice I am  given is that it was a real case. The psychiatrist was counselled by the Health Insurance Commission's medical adviser. The case was discussed with the Royal Australasian College of Psychiatrists.Further, with respect to the way the article was written, I will read my brief and I am happy to table it afterwards. In relation to the newspaper article stating that the Health Insurance Commission official did not have knowledge of Dr 747, I can say that the official was not involved in the case and therefore had no knowledge of the particular practitioner. I am advised also that the journalist did not provide sufficient information to enable officers to validate the information. It would seem to me that it is quite impossible to come to the conclusions the journalist did from the information that the Health Insurance Commission advises me that it provided.The final thing I will say is that the article finishes by saying:National Association of Practising Psychiatrists (NAPP) president Gil Anaf said NAPP had tried repeatedly and in vain to obtain the details of Dr 747's case from the Government.I have never heard of Dr Anaf and, until today, I had never heard of the National Association of Practising Psychiatrists. I presume they exist. I note their executive officer is one Stephen Milgate, who acts for a number of groups that would be considered to have hard, right-wing views. What he is doing here is making a political point - nothing else. We would not deal with the National Association of Practising Psychiatrists. They are a political organisation. We deal with the Royal Australasian College of Psychiatrists, which is a professional organisation.Finally, this initiative in the 1996 budget - an initiative, I might say, that the Labor Party opposed - has meant that in the last 12 months the number of Australians who have been able to see a psychiatrist has increased 10 per cent, which is a dramatic improvement. I table the document.</DOC>

 - As I have said on a number of occasions, the Treasury has modelled all sorts of effects of the tax package, including prices, household expenditures and all sorts of other things. In relation to their modelling, they assumed, for the purposes of their modelling, no change in employment, not because they did not think that employment would be increased, as their evidence was that they believe it will be increased for a number of reasons, but because, if there was an assumption about an increase in employment in the figures, it would make the modelling even better - the advantages would be even greater. As the evidence showed, they took cautious assumptions, which could not be challenged on any basis, for all of the modelling work they did.I would venture to say that if you actually put in the benefits to employment which follow from the following things: a more productive tax system; increased GDP growth; personal income tax cuts; the fiscal stimulus from the overall package -  - If you factor in the undoubted employment increases which follow from a more productive tax system, the better allocation of resources, an increase in GDP, cuts in personal income tax, the simplified business taxation system and a fiscal  stimulus, then the benefits become even greater. This is a new tax system which was put to the Australian people, which they openly voted for, and which the Labor Party cannot bring itself to support.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. Can I say to the House at the outset that there are few issues in this country that cause more ongoing alarm and concern to parents, community organisations and political parties on both sides of politics than the continuing menace of drug addiction, particularly for the young people of Australia. In answering the honourable member's question, I do not claim any particular monopoly of wisdom and I do not claim to have all of the answers to this problem, but I certainly do not believe that you will solve the problem by glib calls for a simplistic solution.The only way that we can hope to make a difference as governments at either a federal or a state level is to follow a strategy in three areas: we need to tighten and make more effective law enforcement; we need to educate people against the perils of drug addiction; and we also need to have effective programs of rehabilitation and detoxification for people who want to break the drug habit. I remain personally of the view that such glib solutions as heroin trials are not the long-term answer to the drug problem.Let me say something about the government's Tough on Drugs strategy, which I believe the evidence suggests has been very effective, as evidenced by the record seizures of illegal narcotics that have taken place in recent months. Federal agencies have seized 565 kilograms of heroin in the first seven months of 1998-99, and this compares with an average of only 113 kilograms in the period  1990 to 1996. That is a fivefold increase. Federal agencies have seized over 274 kilograms of cocaine in the first seven months of 1998-99, compared with an average of 127 kilograms for each full year from 1990 to 1996.These successes have been possible because of the resources that have been made available to law enforcement agencies. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs Service. I also thank and congratulate the state police forces around Australia for the cooperation that those federal agencies have received. Only through an integrated approach will it be possible to achieve greater results in this area.The government has allocated $215 million over four years already to the Tough on Drugs strategy. That includes $35 million to help Customs protect our borders, more than $75 million to attack the illegal drug trade, $95 million for treatment programs and around $8 million to develop a new school drug education strategy based on a goal of zero tolerance of drugs in school - a goal that I believe the overwhelming majority of Australian parents support and subscribe to very strongly.In August 1998 the government announced a $30 million first instalment of the Tough on Drugs grants to 24 communities and 60 non-government organisations to fund education and treatment. During the 1998 election campaign, I announced a further $75 million to strengthen the fight against illicit drugs. This will involve more money for treatment and education, three extra mobile strike teams and state-of-the-art border protection facilities. This will bring to almost $300 million the government's commitment to fighting illicit drug use in this country.Finally, I want to thank the members of the Australian National Council on Drugs, under the skilful chairmanship of Major Brian Watters of the Salvation Army. This is a very broadly based community organisation led by a man who understands far more than many of the other commentators on this issue the human cost of drugs, and who has a far  deeper understanding of the right policies needed to fight them.</DOC>

 - I am very pleased to talk about Peter Dixon's report; I have it here. It is called The government's tax package: further analysis based on the Monash model . Let me read it out:Employment will be stimulated in the short run by 30,000 jobs.Their big point is that they are opposing a policy which will only create 30,000 jobs. Oh,  what a terrible policy! So do you know what the Senate committee said? It said to Peter Dixon -  - Look, I will read you the full report if you have got time for 50 pages. - I will read it for both of us. -  - After the Labor Party appointed modeller Professor Dixon said that the government's tax package would stimulate in the short run 30,000 jobs, the Senate then said, `We do not like that. We want you to make another assumption.' The Senate committee said, `Why don't you assume that there is a wage break-out?' In other words, `Why don't you assume that, notwithstanding the fact that everybody gets personal income tax cuts and has higher after tax take home pay, the first thing they do, once they get higher after tax take home pay, is they go for a wage increase? Why don't you assume that?' If you do assume that, you can feed it into his model and say a wages break-out costs jobs. Is that telling us anything we do not know? We learned under Labor how a wages break-out costs jobs. All that illustrates again is the importance of the government holding the line on wages, which is what we have been doing. As Senator George Campbell said of the wages break-out in 1981, `A hundred thousand dead men hanging off the belts of the ACTU'. Who are the former ACTU presidents in this House? - We now have Mark Latham publishing his book Civilising Global Capital  -  - I have been doing some interesting reading recently. I have been reading Civilising Global Capital  by Mark Latham. I have been reading Out of the Rut , which has got a chapter by Lindsay Tanner. There is another book coming out on Friday which I am awaiting very, very eagerly. This is not a shadow ministry, this front bench; this is a book club! They are writing books to each other, and the book I am really waiting for is the one from the shadow Treasurer entitled, `Why Mark and Lindsay are Wrong, by S. Crean' - stop the clock, back to the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question and acknowledge her fine victory on tax reform in the October election. Of course it is important to understand tax reform in its entirety. Not only does the government propose to reform the indirect tax base - and I think that is pretty well known - the government proposes to cut personal income taxes in this country by $13 billion. The Australian public have not had a tax cut since the Labor Party stole the l-a-w tax cuts after the 1993 election. That was not a policy; that was l-a-w.As part of the government's proposal, which is to reduce personal income taxes, we are also proposing to double the $1,000 tax-free threshold for each dependent child. What that means is that each child in each family gets an extra $140 tax cut. If you happen to be a single income family with one child  under five, we are going to double the additional tax-free threshold of $2,500. So, for a family with one child under five, you get a tax-free threshold in total of $5,000 so that you get a tax cut to help with the costs involved in raising that child, and that is an increase of $350 a year per family.In addition, we are increasing the maximum assistance for child care for lower income families by seven per cent. That is another part of the government's tax plan. Allied to all of this, of course, are income tax cuts which, for a woman in the work force, means that every single rate of marginal income tax is cut - the 20 per cent rate comes down to 17 per cent, the 34 goes down to 30 per cent, the 43 goes down to 40 per cent and the thresholds are extended.So for mothers in paid work the tax reform package offers the following benefits: the tax-free threshold is increased from $5,400 to $6,000 dollars; every single one of their marginal income tax rates is cut; there is a new family tax benefit, higher than the current family tax benefit; there is an easing in the income test for family assistance; and there is provision of increased child care. For mothers at home, the package offers the following: an increase in the threshold for the mother at home looking after a child under five, which doubles to $5,000 dollars; an increase in family assistance; an easing of the income test and an easing of the taper test so that no longer do you have 50c taken out for each additional dollar that you earn - that is cut down to 30 per cent, getting rid of poverty traps; and a reduction in the penalty for making the transition from staying at home to entering or re-entering the work force.This is a tax plan which not only is good for Australia's economy; this is a tax plan which is great for Australia's families. This is a tax plan that looks after the family that has the mother who is looking after children, that looks after the family that has the mother in the work force, that gives tax relief and makes sure that our tax and welfare systems come together. It is the kind of tax plan which Australia has long demanded, which Australia voted for and which this government wants to ensure Australians can have.</DOC>

 - One could be forgiven for thinking that the honourable member had not listened to the answer that the Treasurer just gave on our tax package. It is a whole tax package. It is about delivering $13 billion worth of tax cuts to the families of Australia. And that $13 billion of tax cuts will be spent on things like holidays, things like tourism packages, things like trips away for the family - things that the community of Australia has not experienced since the 1991-92 recession we had to have when people dared not go on holidays in case they came back and their job was gone. This government is doing something about reinstating tourism in this country. We have dedicated $8 million to a domestic tourism campaign which looks like stimulating our domestic tourism economy which the opposition left in absolute tatters.</DOC>

 - I am aware of some alternative policy proposals with regard to the privatisation of Telstra. Those alternative proposals are in stark contrast to the official Labor policy which opposes any further privatisation of Telstra. Those proposals come from none other than the Labor spokesman on privatisation.Last night on the 7.30 Report the honourable member for Melbourne made some very interesting comments. He declared that Labor  was not democratic enough. He said it was not inclusive enough. He said that the Labor Party was full of branch stacking. He went on to endorse the British tories' practice of direct election from the rank and file members of leaders of the party. - Order! I draw the minister's attention to the question and ask him to direct his answer to the point of the question. - He went on to make a very strong and persuasive case for the full privatisation of Telstra. He said:If it is left partly privatised and we have a situation where you've got this vast amount of public money that is tied up with control of nothing, vast amounts of money tied up with little practical benefit being delivered to the community. . .I agree with that. The only thing I would add to it is that the control of Telstra and various other corporatised bodies ceased when the member's leader corporatised Telstra in the early 1990s. The honourable member for Melbourne went on to say:When you only have majority public ownership, your ability to use that ownership for social and community outcomes is very constrained.I agree again, Mr Speaker. The alternative is the government's policy for the full privatisation, which supports the honourable member for Melbourne. If we had that full privatisation we would be able to get rid of servicing Labor's debt that is taking billions of dollars each year, which should be channelled into welfare, hospitals and education.The government welcomes this enlightened and modern thinking from the honourable member for Melbourne. It endorses the views previously expressed by the honourable member for Werriwa. If only this enlightened and modern thinking could spread along the ranks of the Labor Party we might see an opposition in this country that is not stuck in the groove of the 1950s - yesterday's Labor with yesterday's policies - instead of having a modern thinking approach that is relevant to a modern Australia and a modern world.</DOC>

I have not yet been to a region of Australia where people are anything other than insistent that we get the tax package up and quickly. Given the enormous cuts in transport costs, including in air transport, I can only say there is very good reason for strong support in regional Australia for wanting the tax package. It will generate a lot more economic activity and a lot better economic outcomes for everyone.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. There are some very interesting things being said about workplace relations. I might start by quoting these few words to the House, as I am sure you will be interested in them. This is what one single voice had to say about industrial relations  and, in particular, about the award system. The words are as follows:The Australian award system of the 1980s reflected the workplace and production process of the 1950s. Awards contain detailed prescription covering most issues in the employment contract down to matters such as bicycle allowances and the provision of boiling water. In the one dimensional world of the industrial age, this comprehensive prescription was sustainable. Now the diversity, flexibility and changing skill requirements of the new economy are undermining the award system, the corporatist strategies of the 1980s are no longer viable in the new environment.I could have said it myself. In fact, that is a rationale for our policy. But who said it? It was the member for Melbourne. What a contrast! What did the Leader of the Opposition have to say? In respect of our award simplification and the 20 allowable matters - so that you can remove the bicycle allowance and the like - he told the union movement back in July, `We do not believe in telling Australian workers which 20 things they are allowed to worry about in their workplace.' He was attacking the very proposition that we put and the member for Melbourne, in his own quiet but penetrating way, is attacking the position of the Leader of the Opposition.They talk about policy revival for the Labor Party, but when it comes to industrial relations, what did the Leader of the Opposition tell the ACTU council? He said - and it was quoted in the Financial Review - that he would not be changing it one jot or tittle. He absolutely stuck with the position which they had back in the 1980s. Now we have the member for Melbourne making a rational case to overthrow the policy position being advocated by the Leader of the Opposition.Even on absolutely essential elements, particularly from Labor's point of view about the collective nature of bargaining, the member for Melbourne says, `Greater choice within the award system would reduce the burden of bureaucratic formalities associated with enterprise bargaining.' We know what this is. This is code for undermining the policy position of your colleagues on the front bench. There is no question whatsoever about it. Just to cap it off, there you were on television last night making the parallel with Gough Whitlam back in 1966-67. The parallel was, `If you are going to take this party into the future, you first have to reform the internal organisation of the party. You have to have the leadership to address the problems.' Read Graham Freudenberg's book on the Whitlam years. He said that in 1966 those reformists within Labor took a simple view to put some coherence into Labor's strategy - first year, reform the party; second year, reform the policies; and third year, go to the people. It was a penetrating attack on a weak leader, and we will look forward to reminding you of it.</DOC>

 - I am glad the Leader of the Opposition has asked me a question about housing because in the last three years housing has become more affordable in this country than it has been at any time in the last 30 years. If there is one group of Australians that every one of us who sits on the Liberal and National side of parliament can look in the eye without any fear of contradiction and say to them that we have made their financial situation much better, it is the home buyers of Australia. This government has delivered the lowest interest rates for Australian home buyers in 30 years. - The policies of the coalition government over the last three years not only have reduced interest rates, they have put the average home within the reach of the Australian home buyer to a far greater extent than at any time during the last 30 years. If you look at our record in relation to housing, you will see that it is the best record of any Australian government since the 1960s. That is the starting point of any rational discussion of the impact of policy on housing.We have structured our tax package so that, first and foremost, we will deliver massive personal tax cuts to all Australians. Whenever a question is asked about tax in this country, the person asking the question ought to be able to explain why it is that he leads a party that is trying to deny $13 billion of personal tax cuts to Australia. The man who asked me that question is the man who wants to take tax cuts away from the average Australian battler. - The Prime Minister will address the question of jobs in the housing industry. - The employment impact of the taxation package will be overwhelmingly beneficial because it will produce increases in gross domestic product. It will be overwhelmingly beneficial because it will deliver disposable income into the hands of the Australian taxpayer. The government which has reduced interest rates for Australian home buyers is now the government that wants to implement the wish of the Australian people to endow those home buyers with greater disposable income via personal in  come tax cuts. There is only one group of people that stands in the way of the achievement of that objective. - The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. The Prime Minister is obliged - you are right - to deal with the question of jobs in the housing industry and the way in which the GST impacts on it. He has not, as far as I have noted, concluded his answer, and I invite him to do so. - I simply say to the House that the employment impact of the tax package is overwhelmingly beneficial. The government does not believe that the tax package will have a detrimental effect on employment in the housing industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mallee for his question. I acknowledge his work, most recently in South America and elsewhere, particularly with the citrus industry and getting that industry on to the front foot with exports. Indeed some citrus growers in his electorate now are securing sales of $60,000 a hectare with citrus exports to the USA, and I commend that. The government has a strategic approach to further diversify our export effort to deal with the East Asian situation. I want to point out to the House that there are still three-quarters of a million jobs - 750,000 jobs - in the Australian economy facilitated by those exports to East Asia. We have put a real effort into boosting the bilateral Market Development Taskforce activity - examples are Fuji apples into Japan for the first time and further beef into Taiwan. Our wine exports to Japan in 1998 - including  from your own electorate, Mr Speaker - were up 135 per cent in the difficult trading circumstances of Japan last year. Our wine exporters deserve a gold medal; indeed, all our exporters deserve a gold medal for pushing ahead.I have just this day completed chairing the Australia-Vietnam fifth meeting of JTECC with the Minister for Planning and Environment from Vietnam. It is interesting to record that, for 1998, two-way trade between Australia and Vietnam, against the odds, has increased 39 per cent on the previous year. That is again an outstanding effort by our exporters. That trade now exceeds $1 billion and is a win-win situation for both Australia and Vietnam. Tomorrow the government will produce the Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement - yet another book, but a book that counts, and one which will show very clearly the extent of trade diversification which is helping - and it is a pretty sharp contrast. The only thing produced by the shadow minister for trade has been one press release yesterday. He, of course, is your Senate chairman of choice with regard to the GST. - Is he doing a fantastic job? Yesterday in his press release he made two bad mistakes. Firstly, he said TOOS will be down on Thursday; in fact it will be tomorrow - Wednesday. We will let him off for that, but try this for size. I quote from the press release:When the budget deficit for calendar year 1998 topped $10 billion . . . There was no budget deficit either this financial year or last financial year. You had better get yourselves a new Senate chairman of choice.</DOC>

 - I provided an answer on this matter to the honourable member for Lilley yesterday, when I pointed out very strongly that all renters will be better off under the government's new tax package because they will receive increased pensions and benefits, including increased rent assistance. - The clear facts are that those who are renting, whether they be in caravan parks, in units or in any other form of accommodation, will have access to increased rent assistance as a part of the government's package. So renters will be significantly better off. Indeed, as a result of the announcements made by the Treasurer over the weekend, there is significant flexibility provided in the package, which will provide the opportunity for rental facilities to be offered in the most effective way to those who need them. So there will be increases in benefits available to all, to ensure that they are able to meet their rental requirements.I am rather interested that the member for Lilley, of all people, would be raising this matter. I was just looking through some old documents and, in 1993, when the honourable member was last in this place and was described at the time as `an influential member of the Caucus economics committee', he actually advocated increased taxes on accommodation. He actually advocated increased taxes on accommodation on World at Noon on the ABC. He said:Labor's progressive taxation philosophy fitted well with increased taxes on tourist accommodation and the like.So a little while ago he was an advocate of increased taxes on accommodation. - What are caravan parks if they are not tourist accommodation as well? -  - The honourable member for Lilley does not have a book - he has not got around to that - but I understand he does have a web site, referred to, I think, as `Wayne's World', which crashes from time to time and has all the intellectual power of a Mickey Mouse comic. The reality is that the people he seeks to denigrate are amongst those who will be extremely well served and will benefit greatly from this government's tax package.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the strike that the New South Wales Teachers Federation is bringing about in New South Wales today. This is the same union which has opposed the national literacy plan, which has opposed a proactive role for schools in getting jobs for school leavers; it is the same union which has set out to sabotage efforts to improve school accountability, and it is the same union which has consistently misrepresented the Commonwealth government's contribution to government schools in New South Wales.Members of this House will be interested to know that government schools in New South Wales this year will be receiving some $78 million more than they received in the last year of the Labor government, and that government schools across Australia this year will be receiving some $235 million more than they received from the Labor Party in its last year in government. This strike will do nothing to improve the quality of education in New South Wales or to lift public esteem for public education. The union does not care about public education, because no-one who opposes proper standards and accountability can be said to support public education.You would think this would be a very obvious point. Unfortunately, on the other side of the House, it is only obvious apparently to the member for Melbourne. In his book, Open Australia, the member for Melbourne makes the point, and I think he makes it very well:The quid pro quo which the government is entitled to demand is a fully accountable and transparent system. Testing of schools and students to ensure that standards are being attained and parents properly informed about their child's progress are essential ingredients in rebuilding public faith in the education system.This is totally different, of course, from the policies of the New South Wales Teachers Federation; it is totally different from the policies of the Carr government; and it is totally different from the policies of the Labor Party. The invisible shadow minister has made not a squeak about this strike. - The member for Dobell. The point has been made very clearly and it shows the structural problem with the union party - the Labor Party. This has been made very clear by the member for Werriwa. - This strike is occurring because of the capitulation, time after time, of the Labor government in New South Wales. That is why this strike is occurring, and that is why public education in New South Wales is being damaged. This point has been made perfectly clear by the member for Werriwa who said, `Labor needs to avoid repeating the mistakes of Bob Carr in New South Wales.' - Mr Speaker, let me just complete this very correct statement by the member for Werriwa that `The Labor Party needs to avoid' -  - Mr Speaker, I am addressing the reasons why this strike is occurring. -  - `The Labor Party needs to avoid repeating the mistakes of Bob Carr in New South Wales' -  -  - My point is simply that what we are seeing in New South Wales - damaging parents, damaging children and  damaging the reputation of government schools in that state - is a result of the weakness of the Labor government in that state, revealing that the union party is unable to maintain a decent education policy and standards which will satisfy parents that public schools are delivering what they want. The teachers themselves in New South Wales, as a majority, do not support this strike. The union is defying the majority of teachers, and the result of its strike is only counterproductive for government schooling, which this government supports.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I note that since I indicated yesterday that the government would be calling a review into BASI - a review which I think is probably timely, because there has not been one for nine years, and I think it is healthy just to ensure that it is operating as it ought, that it is meeting the expectations of the travelling population in Australia and that it is enjoying satisfactory levels of independence - the member for Dickson promptly responded by saying that we ought to have an inquiry into CASA as well. It is worth noting that there has been one inquiry into BASI over the last nine years; in that period of time there have been 14 into CASA and its predecessor. - The member for Dickson would like to make it 15. The fact of the matter is that CASA has been inquired into unto the point of death and utter fatigue. We know what is wrong. We have been informed, if I can say so, by the chairman of CASA and others of some of the things that need to be addressed. The point is that this government  acknowledges that and has given CASA an effective board made up of people who understand aviation safety issues. That board has the capacity and power to address the issues that they say are of concern within their own organisation. I have had several meetings not only with the chairman but with the board as well. They are putting in place the mechanisms and the responses that they need and that are appropriate to ensure that CASA is able to maximise the level of its performance.I conclude by saying that it is very unfortunate indeed that the shadow spokesman for aviation in this place seems to be determined to cast doubt on the arrangements we have in place in this country in relation to aviation safety. Our record is amongst the most outstanding in the world. We ought to be proud of that. It is not at risk.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question. - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question and the honourable member for Calwell for his interjection. We are old friends, my old university tutor and I -  - He taught me everything I know. -  - He taught me a subject called `the morality of power'. Can you believe that?I saw some reports on the AAP wire from Australian Democrats Leader, Meg Lees, who today challenged the government to separate tax cuts for lower and middle income earners from the rest of the tax package. The government has a bill in the Senate which reduces marginal tax rates. It is a bill which reduces the 20 per cent rate to 17 per cent, the 34 per cent rate to 30, the 43 per cent rate to 30, and the 47 rate to 40. When you reduce income tax rates you reduce them for all levels of income up to the threshold. You cannot reduce a marginal income tax rate for certain categories of taxpayer. It applies to income as it is earned through those ranges. You cannot say that there is a 17 per cent rate for one class of persons on their first $20,000 of income and there is a different rate for another class of persons on their first $20,000 of income. It is the law that sets the rate, and you cannot change the rates for certain classes of taxpayer - and that is for obvious reasons.As a way of example, I refer the House to the Taxation Legislation Amendment Act, No. 197 of 1992. This is the famous l-a-w. This is the act which, I believe, is still on the statute books. It has never been repealed and, as we know, was never proclaimed by the Labor Party once they were re-elected in 1993.A cursory look at the l-a-w - which Labor passed before the election and then withdrew after the election - shows that it actually specified the rates, not for a certain class of taxpayer but for a certain class of income. It is instructive to look at the l-a-w. If it had been proclaimed for one day - remember it was passed by both houses of parliament but never proclaimed; these were the tax cuts for  1996-97 - income tax rates would have been reduced. The 34c rate would have gone down to 30c and the 43c rate would have gone down to 40c. But the l-a-w income tax cuts did not cut rates for low income earners. This is a very important point. The people who never got a tax cut under the l-a-w were the people who were earning up to $20,700.This government wants to cut income tax rates for low income earners by reducing that rate from 20c to 17c. It is a little bit rich to hear the Labor Party talking today about the fact that it does not think we should be cutting rates for upper and middle income earners when that was what the Labor Party's law said. - The point I was making is, when the law cuts marginal tax rates, it cuts it for classes of income; it does not do it for classes of taxpayer. So you cannot say that one class of taxpayer has one rate and another taxpayer on the same income has another. A law that cuts tax rates does it across income levels. That is why you cannot separate it out. That is why the government has its bill in the Senate to cut income tax rates. It was as a result of the fraud of the Labor Party in never proclaiming that act, not for one day, that this government decided it would introduce income tax cuts, and it will not deviate from the income tax cuts which it promised the Australian people.We want to make sure that we deliver in full on the income tax cuts that the Australian people were promised. We want to restore faith with the Australian people who were so fraudulently deceived by the Labor Party which never, not for one day, made this law operative. </DOC>

 - The short answer is that a number of concerns have been raised by the Chairman of CASA and by the board. I do not have any intention of publicly canvassing the discussions which I have had with the Chairman of CASA or with the board of CASA - I see no reason to do so. The essential response to your question is this: the terms of the inquiry will allow those who have concerns along these lines to have them properly canvassed.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the allegations. In fact, there was moderately widespread knowledge of the proposal, given that we worked with the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists on it and had made no secret of that. In terms of contracts being entered into in three weeks, I do not know the number. Concerning investigation, I do not feel I should interfere with that in any way. I am aware of the procedures being gone through because they were at my -  -  - Order! The minister has the call. - I am trying to answer the question seriously. I just cannot cope with the idiotic psychobabble from Jabba the Hutt over there. The final thing is that the investigation is at my suggestion and requires radiology practices to sign statutory declarations. That is being adequately followed up by the HIC and I see no reason to do anything further.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I know the great concern that he has for people in residential care in his electorate - as indeed does this government. When we took over, we discovered that the previous Labor government had left 10 years of mess. We found that we were 10,000 places short and that their own benchmarking had not been met.  But, by putting in the reforms, by the year 2000 we will reach the 100 places per 1,000 people over the age of 70 years. We will meet that target and there will be sufficient accommodation and CACP packages for those people who need them.I have found that empirical evidence is always a good way to get a point across. I would like to read three points from a letter received from Terry Healey, the Chief Executive Officer of Eldercare, a major religious and charitable provider in South Australia. I use these excerpts with his permission. He says:Few can complain about the changes that have resulted from the process of aged care reform. The outcomes for Eldercare have been significant and we are now in the best financial position we have been in for several years.He goes on to say:Many employee representative bodies claimed aged care reform would result in fewer and less qualified staff. Eldercare's outcome, not perception or guess, is that we have received more, spent more on staff and recruited staff of higher skill categories.Thirdly, he says:The certainty of capital funds has allowed us to proceed with the confidence to build a new facility providing high and low care for 101 residents. This facility with a completed cost of over $10m will replace a facility in Rose Park.I can simply say that it was the Prime Minister who put in place those additional plans for capital funding. They have been highly successful, Prime Minister. This is a testimonial from a very successful operative. The bottom line is very simply that the Labor Party left a mess; we are cleaning it up. Indeed, this is the sort of testimonial we are now receiving.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. He shows a constant interest in important international issues as an active member of the coalition in the foreign affairs, trade and defence area.As many members of the House made clear by their contributions to the condolence motion yesterday, King Hussein's death is a tragic loss not only to his people, who held him in the highest regard and with genuine affection, but also to the international community as a whole. He enjoyed an extraordinary reputation as a tireless and courageous champion of peace in the Middle East. His successor, King Abdullah, has also committed himself to the path of peace and has made it clear that he will carry on the work of his father.The member for Aston asked about the Middle East peace process. I can inform the House that, in the Australian government's view, that peace process is at the moment very delicately balanced. There will be an election in Israel on 17 May and subsequently there will be an election for the Prime Minister of Israel. Once those elections are concluded we very much hope that the peace process will resume its momentum. The Australian government was delighted with the  Wye River agreement. We would like to see the full implementation by all sides of the commitments made in the Wye River negotiations. As I have said, once the Israeli elections are out of the way - and I think it is realistic to expect the process to be stalled until they are out of the way - then we would urge the Israeli government as well as the Palestinian authorities not only to resume the implementation of the Wye River agreement but to move forward along with the Syrians, Lebanese and others with the full negotiations to conclude the Middle East peace process.</DOC>

Can I remind the Leader of the Opposition that we now live in a society where 40.3 per cent of the population own shares. - He says, `So what'! Forty point three per cent of the Australian population own shares, and that is a direct result, I am proud to say, of the privatisation policies of the coalition government. If the member for Melbourne had his way, it would be 75 per cent of the Australian population, because he is the great privatiser.I would inform the House that the changes that were made to the code were, with one or  two very minor exceptions, direct recommendations contained in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet's brief to an incoming government. They make the guidelines more contemporary. They are totally defensible. I completely reject the envy credo of the Labor Party, and I do not intend to be Prime Minister of a country which allows a situation to develop where men and women who have been successful in business, men and women who have accumulated assets, are intimidated out of offering themselves for public service. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore who has asked this question which goes to the heart of what the Australian community is really interested in and what the Australian community expects of its elected representatives in the national parliament, which is a focus on job generation.I am very pleased to draw the House's attention to a statement summarising a survey released today by Morgan and Banks. Under the title `Phenomenal Job Growth', the Morgan and Banks survey indicates that Australian employers are exhibiting extremely high levels of optimism, with over one-third, namely 35.6 per cent, saying they will put on staff in the next three months. Morgan and Banks Ltd, Australia's largest recruitment firm, surveyed 3,206 employers to formulate the job index. They say it is the most optimistic and the best result that has been produced since the index was inaugurated in 1995.Mr Geoff Morgan, the joint managing director of Morgan and Banks had this to say:For the first time ever, an overwhelming mood of optimism has been recorded across all industry sectors.Let me say that again, in case anybody sitting opposite did not understand the import of that statement:For  the first time ever, an overwhelming mood of optimism has been recorded across all industry sectors.This is a direct result of the policies pursued over the last three years by the government I am proud to lead. This is a direct result of the coalition government getting the budget in order. This is a direct result of the lowest interest rates we have had for 30 years. It is a direct result of the low inflation we have had. It is a direct result of the measures we have taken to build economic growth and economic confidence. Fifty-four thousand new jobs were created in December alone, and more than 400,000 new jobs have been created since the coalition came to power.But, at 7.5 per cent, everybody would agree that the unemployment rate is still far too high. There is a responsibility on us on this side and there is a responsibility on you on the Labor Party side to take further policy steps to bring that unemployment rate down. And you will have an opportunity over the next few weeks in the Senate to make a decision as to whether you are going to knock off our unfair dismissal regulation. Because, if you do that, you will destroy the job prospects of 50,000 Australians in small business. If you and the Australian Democrats continue to oppose the measures that we have put forward to entrench junior wages within the Australian employment system, you will be putting at risk the jobs of several hundred thousand young Australians.I say to the Australian Labor Party: if you want to build on the momentum so clearly evidenced by the Morgan and Banks survey, if you want to make a contribution to getting unemployment lower than 7.5 per cent, you will drop your opposition to our unfair dismissal regulation, you will drop your opposition to our attempt to protect the jobs of 300,000 or 400,000 young Australians and  you will join the government in further measures to free up the labour market, consistent with the maintenance of the Australian safety net system which has been a cornerstone of our policy since we were elected in March of 1996.We have the best opportunity in this country for almost a decade to really achieve a big breakthrough on the unemployment front. We have high economic growth, we have a very strong Australian economy, we have booming business confidence, we have a government that has the courage to implement the taxation and other reforms to bring about change; all we need is an opposition both here and in the Senate that is prepared to put the national interest ahead of petty, party-political point scoring.</DOC>

I repeat that these changes were essentially recommended by the Prime Minister's department in the brief to the incoming government.

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. I was interested to see the National Bank's monthly business survey for January, which was released I believe yesterday. It shows that business conditions improved for the sixth consecutive month in trend terms, all components of business conditions improved, business confidence remains at extremely high levels and has now returned to the high levels recorded prior to the Asian financial crisis.The chief economist of the National Australia Bank, Mr Allan Oster, said in this survey:The National's latest business survey suggests a strengthening trend in economic activity evident in recent months was maintained in early 1999. Looking ahead, the domestic economy has enough momentum to continue expanding strongly for at least six months.The Prime Minister has already referred to the Morgan and Banks survey which was released today. The quarterly Morgan and Banks job index released today says:. . . employers are exhibiting extremely high levels of optimism, with over one-third saying they will put on staff in the next three months and only 12 per cent saying they will downsize, giving a net effect of 23.6 per cent, the highest level of confidence in the economy since the job index commenced.Whilst I may not actually say it myself, I note that the headline was `Phenomenal Job Growth Predicted from Morgan and Banks'. Even outside the Australian Labor Party, which will not admit the government's success in economic management because it has opposed nearly every step that was necessary to get it there, there have been important recognitions from other elements which are opposed to the government in relation to the government's economic management.I was interested to see the ACTU's living wage submission to the national wage case bench. I thought I would quote from it, because it is so rare that I agree with the ACTU. In fact this could be the last time I agree with the ACTU this millennium. The ACTU said:Australia has worked its way through the crisis and is in good shape and with sound fundamentals to weather any future storms form Asia or elsewhere. This is due to certain features of the Australian economy, sound macro fundamentals of economic growth and low inflation, the flexibility of our exporters, our stable financial system, the productivity boom of the 1990s and flexible and adaptable economic institutions, particularly in the labour market.The ACTU is now welcoming `flexible and adaptable economic institutions, particularly in the labour market', which I suppose puts them in the progressive wing of the Labor Party, along with the member for Melbourne and the member for Werriwa - I welcome them both here today, the thinkers of the Labor Party - against the member for Hotham and the member for Brand. I said yesterday that I have actually read both of your books, which I think are important contributions to economic thinking. - I welcome the way in which you endorse government policy. But we have to say that there are at least two people on the Labor frontbench who have been unable to bring themselves to modern economic thinking. They are respectively the Leader and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. They are now behind the ACTU, behind the member for Werriwa, behind the member for Melbourne - unable to congratulate the government on its economic management. I encourage them to try to modernise their thinking and to take a leaf from each of the books that have been published, because they may learn something.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for his question. I particularly appreciate the work the member for Indi does on behalf of Australia on foreign affairs issues, both as a member of the joint house committee and on a number of trips he has made to Asia over the years. He is a very able member.I understand that the United Nations sponsored talks in New York have gone into adjournment and that those talks could be described as being at a critical juncture. The whole of that negotiation - involving Indonesian foreign minister, Ali Alatas, and his department, as well as the Portuguese government and their foreign minister, Mr Gama - is at a very sensitive juncture. Of course responsible members of this parliament are restrained in the remarks that they would make about this because of the sensitivity of the time.As the House well knows, the government has made it perfectly clear that our preference is to see an autonomous East Timor, obviously subject to the agreement of the people of East Timor. Of course we will accept that if the people of East Timor want to go their own way - and the Indonesian government has made it clear they can if they want to - we will accept and support that decision. But the key is to make sure that there is a smooth  and successful transition - a peaceful and calm transition - either to a fully autonomous province or, if the East Timorese people choose to go that way, to an independent state. Obviously Australia is already very active behind the scenes in doing what we can to help achieve a smooth and peaceful outcome.The government has been very active on this issue. Over the last two weeks I have met with the Indonesian economy minister, Mr Ginanjar, I met with Kofi Annan, I met with the EU Presidency of the Council of Ministers and with the European Commission, the British Foreign Secretary and the United States Assistant Secretary of State, inter alia, to discuss the very difficult issue of East Timor. I must say that I have been very impressed with the positive responses I have received from each and every one of those people.In two weeks time, members of the government - including the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, the Minister for Defence and I will be in Bali for the ministerial forum with the Indonesian government. Also over the next two weeks, I will be having a number of discussions with East Timorese leaders. -  - The interjections make the point, because what is really bizarre about this historic time in the destiny of East Timor is the attitude of the federal opposition. I understand that this morning the opposition had yet another meeting to discuss the issue of East Timor, and there was considerable debate in this meeting. What I did hear this morning when I was listening to the radio was the Leader of the Opposition emerging for the very first time, as far as I am aware, in recent weeks on this issue to claim that the government was `behind the game' on the issue of East Timor - as if the Prime Minister's letter of 19 December had been an event definitely `we, as the opposition, ought to forget.'Let me make this point: the Labor Party had 13 years in government. Some of you may not remember it, because it is becoming  a little while ago. But you had 13 years in government and your foreign affairs spokesman says that, in those 13 years, there was a litany of wrong decisions with respect to East Timor by the Labor government. You had a litany of wrong decisions and you have the audacity to lecture us about how to handle the issue of East Timor. What sort of advice is that? Would you go to somebody who says that they made a litany of wrong decisions and ask for their advice? Do you think that, up there in the press gallery, they are interested in your advice when you say you presided over a litany of wrong decisions? Not a chance. -  - I hardly need to remind the House that in the caucus meeting yesterday the member for Holt, the former foreign minister - the man the Leader of the Opposition described as `the greatest foreign minister since Metternich' or whatever it was - said that the member for Kingsford-Smith had mounted `a comprehensive assault on the competence and moral integrity of successive Labor Prime Ministers and foreign ministers.' That is what the member for Holt said, and he is a man who was respected in his role as the foreign minister. In fact, the more I contrast him with the member for Kingsford-Smith, the better I think he was - not great, but better than the member for Kingsford-Smith.Throughout this extraordinary debate in the Labor Party - this fusillade of fire across the factions and within the factions of the Labor Party - the Leader of the Opposition, like Jabba the Hutt, sits there doing absolutely nothing, allowing this debate to go on behind him, with the member for Kingsford-Smith, like Salacious Crumb, buzzing around. The opposition is out of control on an issue of central importance to Australian foreign policy at this time. It will always be remembered that the Labor Party said, at this turning point in history, that they made a litany of wrong decisions and then played politics at the crucial turning point in history. It is a  pathetic indictment, at the end of the day, of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes for his question and reflect on the fact that he already capably represents such centres as Dubbo with Roger Fletcher, Parkes with IMC and Broken Hill - all good exporting centres adding to our export progress and the further expansion of our exports to the world. I am delighted to affirm an announcement that there will be further trade diversification efforts bilaterally, regionally and multilaterally, with working visits to Iran and, I announce now, to Turkey as well, commencing at the end of the next parliamentary sitting week. As Minister for Trade, I will lead a delegation comprising senior personnel from Austrade and Australian business.Secondly, I will be introducing legislation in this Autumn session of parliament to extend the Export Market Development Grant  scheme for another two years, involving $300 million. Thirdly, the government will launch in May a major new study on the prospective economic benefits of a millennium round. Fourthly, for the first time we are going to invite public submissions to help refine our World Trade Organisation negotiating agenda, to build confidence and to connect with the Australian constituency in relation to these trade issues. We recognise fully there is no such thing as a level playing field and, therefore, we have a very hard-edged pragmatic trade policy approach. Fifthly, a new study is to be prepared on agrifood export opportunities to the Asian region. Finally, I will be launching two new reports on the government's online trade strategy - electronic commerce represents so much potential for Australia, not just capital city Australia but isolated parts of Australia as well - when I attend with the member for Indi at Wangaratta on Friday. I look forward to doing that.I point out to the House that, last year, 17 of our major trading partners have had a massive contraction of GDP - it has come down into negative growth - whereas Australia has remained with a positive growth of plus five per cent. We are maintaining a strong domestic economic base, which is allowing our exporters to cut the mustard and get the job done. As I present the Trade - Outcomes and Objectives statement, I make the point that the gold medal in this equation should go to our hardworking exporters, who have done so well in difficult times.</DOC>

 - I did see that report in today's Australian  regarding the recent ABC board, where a suggestion was put forward to sell part of the ABC Online - although, I did notice, with the ABC retaining majority control and revenue from the sale to be used to supplement funds for program making. The honourable member should know from his portfolio responsibilities that the ABC's legislation permits it to undertake commercial activities, which `are related to or incidental to the performance of any of the functions of the corporation'. So it is a matter for the ABC board and management as to whether or not this suggestion has merit.However, if the board did go ahead and commercialise some of ABC Online, the government would require that it be compatible with the ABC's primary responsibility as a free to air public broadcaster. It would have to be at arms length from the ABC's budget funded activities, with clear accounting mechanisms and subject to the ABC's normal controls on editorial content and responsibilities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I am pleased to be able to inform honourable members that last week the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee approved for release in Australia the drug Relenza, which is an anti-influenza drug. This makes us the first country in the world to approve this drug. Relenza is the trademark of the chemical zanamivir, which acts directly against the influenza virus, which is what makes it so exciting. The drug is taken as an inhalant. It is active against influenza A and influenza B. It can help people who have been directly exposed to influenza but have not yet picked up the symptoms.It was an exciting piece of medical research developed in Melbourne by Biota technology, who have done it in conjunction with Glaxo. They discovered a particular hot spot on part of the virus that they could direct a protein against and effectively neutralise that one single hot spot on an enzyme called neuranimidase, and that effectively deactivates the virus. We still have a few minor issues to work out as to how we will label the information on the product, but we are highly hopeful that this will be available to the Australian public by this winter.</DOC>

 - I respect the point you made, Mr Speaker, but I am very happy to respond. I simply make a couple of points: the first is that the power under the act which is being used for inquiry into the Greenfields transactional company, or whatever it is, was in fact sponsored by the government. It is our amendment. I repeat: I do not mind what questions are asked of the Greenfields Foundation, within the law; I do not mind at all. Matters relating to fundraising for the Liberal Party are of course the responsibility of the Liberal Party. I am completely comfortable and relaxed about the whole issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question. I know he is concerned with the young unemployed people in his electorate. I think most Australians believe that the ability to read and write is part of the educational birthright of young Australians. When this government came into office, we found that some 30 per cent of young people coming through school did not have adequate literacy or numeracy skills. This government is now engaged in a rescue mission for Labor's lost generation, for the 30 per cent of young people who missed out on these vital  skills during the 13 years when Labor was in office.From last week, Centrelink is referring young people who are unemployed for six months or more who present with literacy and numeracy difficulties for assessment. If they present with serious problems as a result of that assessment, they are being referred to the appropriate course to raise their literacy and numeracy skills. I believe that most members of the community think that if they are working hard to provide support for young people who are unemployed, it is fair that young people should be prepared themselves to put in and address the major obstacle to employment. The government has put $143 million into this program and contracted some 69 providers.I regret to say that the reaction of the Labor Party to this wonderful initiative has been an extremely negative one. We have seen the member for Batman refer to it as a hollow stunt; $143 million and 69 providers - a hollow stunt. Senator Lundy says that it is just going to further disadvantage the disadvantaged. In other words the party that created the disadvantage wants nothing to be done to address the disadvantage.There are one or two on the other side of the House who realise that this absolute policy vacuum has got to be addressed if the Labor Party has any credibility. Mark Latham, the member for Werriwa, has said that the published policies of the Labor Party, federal and state, have fallen short of the new thinking which is required to address the major issues facing Australia. He has been quite honest, up-front and frank about what the problems are.I noticed the other day that the member for Melbourne, Lindsay Tanner, has indicated that he is fed up with the situation that has been created by the weak leadership of the party and its weak leadership group, and he is calling for a commitment to a specific literacy goal on behalf of the Labor Party. His view is that the Labor Party should aim to lift numeracy and literacy above 90 per cent over the medium term. Well, that is a start. It is actually less, I have to say, than the commitment that all the states and territories have  already agreed with the Commonwealth - that every child coming out of primary school should be able to read, write and count at an appropriate level - but it is light years ahead of the policy of the Labor Party. Mr Lindsay Tanner, the member for Melbourne, knows that the weak leadership which is leading to this policy vacuum is, in the end, going to damage his political party and is already damaging it in the eyes of the Australian people.The new thinkers of the Labor Party are making a direct challenge to those who are currently responsible for its failures. Lindsay Tanner has an education policy, the member for Werriwa had an education policy until it was butchered by the Leader of the Opposition's office - Mike Pezzullo and John Angley - but it is the invisible member for Dobell who is carrying the can for the leadership of the Labor Party at the moment, and he shows no signs of getting them back on track.</DOC>

 - On a day when you get a survey talking about phenomenal jobs growth, when you have the working men and women of Australia wanting the Labor Party to get their hands off their tax cuts -  - As I was saying, at a time when the working men and women of Australia are wanting to know from the Australian Labor Party when they are going to take their hands off their tax cuts, when those Australians who think that 81 per cent of the Australian population ought to be on a marginal tax rate -  - I thought it was one of those questions that deserved a bit of a preamble as part of the answer, and the preamble simply is to remind the parliament and the Australian people that the Australian Labor Party is not interested in talking about employment issues, the Australian Labor Party is not interested in a constructive policy debate, the Australian Labor Party is not prepared, on a day when we have -  - I think the Australian people have just heard it out of the horses's mouth: he will keep his hands on the tax cuts of the Australian workers - $13 billion of tax cuts. -  - That is the great political debate in Australia at the moment, and I am indebted to the Leader of the Opposition for crystallising the issue. I think the Leader of the Opposition has done us a great turn. - Mr Speaker, the Labor Party will not debate sensible tax reform, the Labor Party will not debate a decent employment policy. Of course, there has been no breach of the guidelines by me.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question, and I congratulate him on his own recent published work.  Funnily enough, I am aware of a number of published evaluations of the effectiveness of government programs, the most recent of which describes the programs of the former Labor government as `leading to perverse outcomes with some unemployed people forced to undertake inappropriate and even demoralising training'. This assessment did not come from some free market think-tank; it did not come from some pro-business zealot; it came of course from the member for Melbourne in his recent published work. The member for Melbourne is not just speaking for himself here; he has obviously been talking to large numbers of his colleagues, because he says:Labor MPs regularly encountered people who had done several Working Nation program courses and still had little chance of finding a job.This is not the only recent published evaluation. In his book, the member for Werriwa said:Contestability in the provision of place management services signifies an important break from the passive provision of public services in disadvantaged areas.He said:It allows a number of parish and charity based organisations, for instance, which would be well placed, to apply for place management projects.The member for Werriwa expresses himself in his typically dense prose, but what he is saying is that he entirely supports the Job Network. And, in case anyone thought the member for Werriwa had calmed down over the Christmas break, another published assessment, this time in the Financial Review  in January, said:The recent dumbing down of Australian Labor policy looks unappealing and unnecessary. It is - he said - enough to break the heart of any thinking social democrat.In a final published work, he said:There is a great sucking sound that can be heard around the corridors of parliament, which is presumably the leadership vacuum which exists right now at the top of the ALP.</DOC>

 - I am grateful the opportunity to respond to the question from the member for Petrie because, as Australians, we are greatly proud of our nation of such a diverse group of people - our original inhabitants, our indigenous Australians; the descendants of earlier generations; and, of course, the significant group of people who have settled in Australia having been overseas born, being some 23 per cent of our population.Among this diversity, of course, Australian citizenship is our common bond. It is fundamental to our national unity, and it has proved a focal point of our unique identity. Although we have been self-governing for some near century, it was only on 26 January 1949 that the status of Australian citizenship formally came into being. Before that, we were British subjects, as some members may recall. Since that time more than 3.1 million people have become Australian citizens. It has certainly been very significant. It is the glue that binds us together. It is an appropriate time, of course, to look at and appreciate the import  ance of it. In that context, we established last year under Sir Ninian Stephen an Australian Citizenship Council which is looking at ways of promoting community awareness of it and reviewing the policy and law in relation to that area.I did last week launch for the Citizenship Council an issues paper designed to encourage the community to have a say on these matters. I conducted here in Canberra in the Albert Hall a citizenship ceremony on 3 February which was a re-creation of the first ever citizenship ceremony held in Australia. At that original ceremony there were seven men from the various states of Australia and territory and I was delighted that the two survivors were able to return as guests of honour for a contemporary celebration. That celebration had amongst it people who were drawn from all corners of this globe, reflecting very much the diversity of our present migration program.We have a range of other activities as part of this celebration. These include the commemorative stamp issued by Australia Post. We will be holding a conference here in July entitled `Individual, Community, Nation - 50 years of Australian Citizenship'. We will have a web site competition and an essay and artistic design competition for children. Finally, I hope members will have seen the National Australia Day Council's Visions of Australia program which we have been sponsoring. These are very important announcements by prominent Australians of the Year about what being Australian means to them.</DOC>

 - I am far more serious, Mr Speaker, than the Labor Party ever was. I would like to say, first of all, that the entire premise of the question is wrong. The fact is that this will not cost the Commonwealth budget anything, as far as I understand it. What the question shows is that the Labor Party does not understand health. This is clearly shown by their line of attack on this. The MRI initiative was part of a broader initiative that was actually a cost-saving measure. We saved $80 million over four years on the forward estimates by working together with the radiologists. That included a cap on radiology expenditure. So if one area of expenditure happens to blow out, other areas of expenditure will be reduced. - The interjections by the Leader of the Opposition show that he simply does not understand health. We have had such an arrangement in place with pathologists for a number of years now and that arrangement has worked extremely successfully. So should there be a blow out, which I do not actually believe there will be, it will be found by the radiologists from other areas within their Medicare part of the Medicare table. That is the first thing. There is no blow out in expenditure here, whatsoever, and the whole process was part of a savings measure rather than an expenditure measure.The second point which I would say the Labor Party do not seem to understand by their line of questioning in this, is that, as far as I know, there has been no massive blow out in MRI numbers, although I have not been briefed about the investigation by the HIC because that would not be proper. I will come back to that in a second. But the fact is that the time between ordering an MRI machine and the delivery of that machine is of the order of nine to 12 months or more. So the machines that are on order could have been ordered any time in the preceding 12 months. I do not know when they would have  been ordered but, given that MRI is an expanding technology, it is not surprising that they would have been ordered.Finally, it is a long-established practice, followed by previous health ministers and backed up in legislation, that any investigative process is completely independent of government. I do not seek to know about it. I am not informed about it. I do not seek to influence it. The Health Insurance Commission has a completely credible record in this area and if there has been any wrongdoing, they will find it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge her real interest in this important matter. Last year 1,760 or so people were tragically killed on our roads. That is well down on the 1970s but it is still far too high. The research shows that speed remains an important element, along with fatigue. In the case of the trucking industry, both of those factors are still significant and both still need to be fully dealt with.We have now developed in this country a very effective strategy for dealing with driver fatigue in the trucking industry. Its acceptance and now promotion by the trucking industry is, I think, welcomed by everybody, particularly people using the roads.We now need to move on the area of speeding trucks. At the state level there have been, of course, strong penalties in place for a long time to tackle this problem. But there has been a concern as highlighted in your question that operators of federally-registered vehicles have had an opportunity to avoid the full force of state laws. We have now moved to close that loophole with the so-called `three strikes and you're out' changes to laws which will govern federally-registered heavy vehi  cles. It will complement the penalties already operating at the state level.What it will mean for owners or operators of heavy vehicles is that if they continually break the law in relation to speeding, they will be subjected to very stiff penalties, including suspension of their heavy vehicle registrations. If they are not fitted with speed limiters, they will be required to be so fitted. In net terms, Mr Speaker, if owners or operators set schedules that cannot be met without speeding, or if they do not take measures to ensure that their drivers can act responsibly and within the law, they will have to wear the responsibility and that will mean - apart from anything else - losing the income available while the truck is off the road. I believe that all road users would welcome these measures.</DOC>

 - It is quite common for grants to be given on a non-competitive basis. In fact, in the Labor Party's health policy in 1998 I notice there is the Hunter Medical Research Centre, where they would provide $15 million in capital funding to house the Hunter Medical Research Institute - a grant not on the basis of a competitive tender. I suppose the Kathleen Cunningham Foundation was on a competitive tender, was it? Of course it was not. What about the National Diabetes Supply Scheme?  What about the national HIV-AIDS education program for doctors? What about the evaluation of the second national HIV-AIDS strategy? What about the community sector support scheme? None of them was done on a competitive basis and none was required to under the Labor Party because they were grants.Prior to giving the grant to Professor de Kretser, I checked with my department that this was an utterly proper course of action to follow and I was advised that the action was completely proper. They also said it was in keeping with the sorts of things the Labor Party does. A person who says one thing and expects another from others is a hypocrite. -  - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question on this third day of the parliamentary sitting year, which also marks the International Year of Older Persons. It is appropriate in this first sitting week to focus on what the government is doing to assist our veterans and war widows to remain in their own homes, where they want to be, for longer.Last week I launched my department's initiative entitled Homefront in the home of Bruce and Jill Ruxton in Victoria. Mr Ruxton is a very good subject because, firstly, he is a veteran and, secondly, he lives in his own home and wants to remain in his own home. -  - The Homefront program is designed to prevent falls in the home. Research shows that one in three people over the age of 65 today will suffer a fall each year. If you look at the cost to the health budget of such falls, it really is quite an alarming statistic. Statistics show that the cost to the health budget for accidental falls is double that of road traffic accidents in this country today. That demonstrates there is a significant cost to the budget for falls that occur in the home. It accounts for something like 31 per cent of the total injury costs in the health budget each year.The Homefront program, which is a free service to our veteran community, will allow them to have an assessment of their home. Following that assessment by professionals, advice will be given relating to perhaps the need for rails in the bathroom or non-slip surfaces. There are many parts of the home in which there could potentially be an accident that could be prevented merely by some intervention. This is a very important preventative measure that is designed to assist our veterans and our war widows to remain in their own homes for longer and I commend it to members of both sides of the House. I hope there is interest from the other side, notwithstanding their mirth at the start of the question.</DOC>

 - The contemporary practice of which I spoke yesterday included a large number of things, including the 40.3 per cent private share ownership, which is one of the proud achievements of the coalition government. It recognises the fact that we are a society now that has a large number of people who not only aspire to own shares but have now got the money to own shares. That is a direct result of the economic policies of my government, and it is that range of contemporary consideration that is so important in putting something like this together.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for directing a question in this House on something of interest to the mainstream of the Australian community. I am delighted to say to the House that today's labour force figures confirm the tremendous employment gains made last month. The unemployment rate remains steady at 7.5 per cent and, after increasing by 53,600 last month, employment remains  steady in January. Given the way in which these figures often go, I think many Australians will see the maintenance of that figure of 7.5 per cent, which is the lowest figure since September 1990, as further evidence of the success of the government's policies in stabilising and reducing the unemployment level.I am very happy to report that today's fall in the number of unemployed young people has taken youth unemployment to 24.1 per cent - its lowest level since February 1991. Having said that, let me say immediately that just as last month's figures represented only one month so it is that this month's figures also represent only one month. A great deal more needs to be done, particularly for younger people, if any government or any side of politics is even to begin to contemplate claiming that real success, lasting success, has been achieved in bringing about a big reduction in unemployment.There are a number of things that we can all do. To start with, the parliament can pass the government's unfair dismissal law. We can pass that law that will create, not in the words of the government but in the words of small business, 50,000 more jobs. We can drag that 7.5 per cent down further. Who is holding it up? It is not the Liberal Party and it is not the National Party. It is the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. They are the people who are threatening to hold it up. That is the first thing we can do.The second thing we can do is to pass the government's legislation to protect the jobs of 230,000 young Australians who now, in no small measure, owe their jobs to the existence of youth wages within the Australian wage structure. What we are saying is that it makes commonsense to preserve that structure. It is anti the cause of young people in this country. It is destructive of job generation for young people to try to sweep away the youth wage structure. All I can say is that the Labor Party will have a second test in a short period of time - that is, will they vote in the Senate to pass the government's legislation on this score? If their behaviour here in the parliament yesterday is any guide, the omens are not good. I would say to those 230,000 young  Australians whose existing jobs depend in no small measure on the existence of this provision in our award structure: `If your position is put at risk, you have the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats alone to blame for that particular decision.'The third thing that the Labor Party can do is to pass unamended in the Senate the government's taxation reform package. The government's taxation reform package, by adding further to economic growth in Australia, is going to add to employment over the long haul. So there are three tests for the Labor Party: test No. 1, vote for 50,000 more jobs, according to small business, by letting the unfair dismissal regulation go unrepealed; test No. 2, vote to entrench youth wages and protect the jobs of 230,000 young Australians; and test No. 3, pass the tax package - the greatest single next reform that the Australian economy needs. They are three simple tests. The Labor Party has a national responsibility, and all Australians will be watching over the weeks and months ahead to see whether the Australian Labor Party matches Australia's need.</DOC>

 - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has invited me, in responding to that question, to take at face value his reference to the words of somebody else. Normally, one might be tempted in this place to do that, but I have learnt from long experience that when you hear somebody from the opposition - particularly the deputy opposition leader - get up and say -  - Mr Speaker, I am right on the money. - I have learnt through long experience that you do not necessarily accept, when somebody in the opposition gets up and says, `X said this,' that X really said it. - Well, you said somebody said something yesterday -  - I have a bit of paper in my hand that demonstrates that yesterday you misled the parliament. Yesterday the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me a question relating to employment and relating to a number of matters. In the course of his question he said:If that is true, Prime Minister, how do you explain the Treasurer's statement to the Press Club last year when he said, `Look, we've done lots of modelling on employment'?That is not what the Treasurer said at the Press Club last year. What the Treasurer said at the Press Club last year was this:Look, we've done a lot of modelling.He made no reference to employment. - No reference to employment - no reference at all to employment. -  - So not only did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition quite intentionally mislead the parliament -  - That is ridiculous. - And the evidence of his deliberate deceit of the parliament is to be found in his own press statement of 17 December last year when on this occasion -  because it then suited his purpose - he correctly quoted the Treasurer as having said, `Look, we've done a lot of modelling.' - Mr Speaker, these matters were canvassed yesterday and I do not have anything further to add.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. I can assure the House that, because this is a government which is determined to reform the tax system, not only can we improve the tax system but also we can dramatically reduce the compliance burden on business as a result of their taxation obligations.Under the government's tax reform, we are abolishing five existing tax and payment reporting systems: prescribed payments, PAYE, reportable payments, provisional tax and company instalments, and replacing them with one system of pay-as-you-go tax. Because we are introducing a broad based indirect tax which requires business to report sales and purchases on a quarterly basis, we can, from the back of that return, make it  possible for a business to do all of its tax requirements on one form quarterly - one form quarterly.At the moment a small company and its directors typically need to make about 16 payments to the ATO and, for some businesses, up to 32 payments in any one year. Under Labor's tax system, companies have to put in provisional tax reporting forms and get instalment notices in return. They have to put in their fringe benefits returns on different forms and get assessments. And they have to put in their company and superannuation forms on another set of compliance documents and get their returns. Under Labor's wholesale sales tax, if they are in the wholesale sales tax system - the system that the Labor Party loves - they get a book like this with all their sales tax remittances. If they have a prescribed payments system under Labor's tax system, they get a book like this which they have to fill in. Under the PAYE system - Labor's PAYE system - they get this booklet which they have to fill in on a separate and different set of records and, if they come into the reportable payments system under Labor's tax system, they get this book as well. Up to 32 payments to the Australian Taxation Office: that is a business's reporting requirements to the Australian Taxation Office under Labor's loved tax system.Under the tax system which the government proposes to introduce, you will have this one page four times a year. This is the draft return - the business activity statement - which is filled in four times a year on which you put sales and purchases and on which you get your assessment for all withholding tax obligations, company taxes, reportable payments system, prescribed payments system, diesel fuel excise credit and every other requirement. That is what tax reform under the coalition will bring in benefits to small business.Labor's loved reporting requirements are dense and thick - like the Labor Party. If small business gets a new tax system from 1 July 1999, not only can we introduce that as the system -  - He always laughs loudest when he is doing worst, Mr Speaker. Not only will that be the requirement of small business, but small business will be getting a cash flow benefit through the alignment of the PAYG system of up to $150 million. Small business are going to say to themselves, `Why was it that after 13 years of a Labor government they could not do better than that? Why was it that it took a coalition government, in its first term, to produce a system like that? And why is it that Labor, after an election - a fair and square election - still refuses to help the small businesses of Australia?' We say: get on with it - let us pass the tax package and let us have decent reform in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question and for his work as chairman of the government members employment committee. On that note, I would like to congratulate the ABC for this  morning's interview with Malcolm Jackman, who is the head of the big private sector job agency, Manpower, who, according to the ABC, said that the government's recent changes to the Job Network have made all the difference. Mr Jackman said:I am . . . positive about it . . . I'm positive because the government has . . . made it a lot more commercially viable . . . And given those factors, it makes me a lot more bullish about wanting to be in the marketplace.Why wouldn't Manpower, or any other job agency large or small, seek to join a Job Network which is getting better all the time?In January 1999 the Job Network placed 16,000 job seekers on benefit into work and this was 50 per cent better than the outcomes achieved by the CES a year earlier. In January 1999, 43,000 vacancies were registered with the Job Network by employers, which is nearly double the result achieved by the CES a year earlier. On both counts, the Job Network in January substantially outperformed the CES in earlier years.Despite a slow start, Job Network has now found work for 23 per cent more unemployed people on benefit between May and January than the CES did in the corresponding period a year earlier. Job Network has also done significantly better in placing the long-term unemployed. It has done better in finding full-time permanent jobs.Despite this, some people are still living in the past - not, of course, the member for Melbourne or the member for Werriwa but certainly the ALP leadership team because, on this subject, the Leader of the Opposition sounds like a cracked record. You have to ask yourself when will he finally get the message that open markets work and competitive systems work. The reason why he does not get the message is that members opposite are slaves of the unions and they are slaves of the public sector. Fifty-two per cent of ALP frontbenchers are former trade union officials. Fifty per cent of the ALP's 1998 parliamentary intake are -  - Mr Speaker, I was asked about explanations as to why there was  continuing opposition. Fifty per cent of the ALP's 1998 parliamentary intake are former union officials. On my reckoning, there are only two -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. On my reckoning, just two of all the members opposite were other than trade union officials, political staffers or public sector employees before entering this place, which is why the member for Melbourne is entirely right in saying that Labor MPs are not representative of the Australian community or even of Labor voters. - The member for Melbourne is absolutely right, and that is before you even begin to consider Labor's nine hereditary peers who have followed their daddies into parliament and, even in those cases, inherited their fathers' economic policies.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. The unemployment numbers today, as the Prime Minister has said, are steady on the previous month at 7.5, which is a good number in itself. We have also seen a very good unemployment rate for young people. If you look at the number of young people as a percentage of the total  population, that number at 5.4 per cent, I think it is, is the lowest number since 1989; so that is a good number. But, if you look at the actual number of young people unemployed in the 15- to 19-year-old age group, we have still got 71,000 young people looking for jobs, and that is why this government is so absolutely determined to press ahead with the reforms which we believe will, once implemented, give young people a better chance of a job.I must say that we are very concerned within the government that, whilst we are working hard to get these numbers down, if the Labor Party continues to oppose the legislation which yesterday they voted against rather than reducing employment for some young people, the chances are young people will actually lose their jobs - deliberately as a result of a policy being pursued by the Labor Party and their obstruction in the Senate.I am asked what obstruction is there in the way of the government implementing the policy. It is as simple as that. The fact of the matter is that we have a series of proposals, all of which are being obstructed by the Labor Party who are absolutely intent on denying people the job opportunities we believe they ought to have. For example, in the area of workplace relations we have a policy commitment to improve further the labour market to make it more flexible, to help it create more jobs. I am asked, `What is the obstruction to that?' The fact of the matter is it is Labor's political obstruction and the use of their numbers in the Senate that stand in the way of the system that is going to help create jobs. As to what are the alternative policies, the Labor Party themselves could take a different view, and they could take the view of Tony Blair, who took over from Margaret Thatcher. This is what he said to the trade unions back in September 1997 -  - He said:We are not going back to the days of industrial warfare, strikes without ballots, mass and flying pickets and secondary action . . . We will keep the flexibility of the current labour market - it may  make some shiver, but, in the end, it is warmer in the real world.Why can't the Leader of the Opposition say that? I will tell you why he cannot say that, and that is because he has got a whole stream of people on his back bench and on his front bench who are representing a narrow sectional interest against the general interest, against the public interest. We have got a narrowing interest: 44 per cent of all Labor members have a trade union background; 52 per cent of their frontbench have got a union background. I do know what my colleague was referring to when he talked about the nine hereditary peers, but we have got a lot of them here. We have got Lord Brand from Fremantle; we have got the Earl of Reid. Who else have we got? We have got the Duke of Hotham. They are stacked with union people. -  - The point I make is that there is a very serious issue here. The government is attempting to put through a whole series of policy reforms which we believe will help to create jobs. Against that we find a wall of opposition, basically from the trade union movement represented by members in this place. Look at the new members, for example. Reading the maiden speeches of the new members is very instructive because they do not reflect a mainstream view. The member for Lalor, for example -  - I will bring the matter to a conclusion. The point I make is that there is a serious obstruction to good policy. The problem is to be found within the organisation of our political opponents. It is not just us who are saying that. The member for Werriwa said that there are two types of opposition parties. He said:The first represents what I would call scab lifting.He goes on to say:Since 1996 federal Labor has been in the scab lifter mode. This approach sits easily with the political background of Labor's inner circle comprising ex-state ALP secretaries and ex-union secretaries.If you go through the new members, it is very revealing. The member for Charlton, Lady Charlton, says:My deep appreciation -  - I conclude by making this point. - I conclude by making the point which I think has become very obvious to everyone this week as the parliament has returned, and that is that there are very seri  ous issues here and there is a real contest within the Labor Party about the way in which they will form policy in the future. That is a relevant issue to the policies the government is attempting to put through this week. The comments of the member for Melbourne have lit a fire under the Leader of the Opposition that is going to burn all this year.</DOC>

 - The premise in the question is somewhat wrong. I did not actually instigate an investigation - the Health Insurance Commission is looking at that in due course. - You are confusing an investigation with the normal examination of process. And I am afraid that, just as with everything else, you do not understand it. I did actually talk to the Health Insurance Commission last night and they informed me that to date there is no reason to believe that anybody had advanced information about the MRI proposal.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question and recognise the honourable member's understanding of matters rural and how things work in the bush. I have travelled Australia in the last couple of months visiting a lot of rural centres across Australia. Notwithstanding the fact that the economy is going extremely well due to  the good policy settings of our government, there are parts of rural Australia that are still experiencing difficulties because of low commodity prices and climatic conditions. We need to understand that.Universally across Australia, in talking to people in rural Australia, people say they want the government's tax reform package passed, because they know - whether they are rural workers, they are farmers or they are running small businesses in regional towns - that the reforms proposed in our tax reform package are going to benefit everybody in rural Australia. Rural Australia over the years has disproportionately been disaffected by Labor's policies.We all remember the election of 1993, when the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, promised tax cuts for all Australians and passed them into law but never enacted them. He has never delivered those tax cuts to any Australian - and the Labor Party had the hide, when we came to office, to ask us to deliver the tax cuts that they cheated on. They had the hide to ask us to deliver them! Now they have got the hide to oppose $13 billion worth of tax cuts which are going to benefit all Australians, particularly rural Australians including rural workers.In that budget in the election campaign of 1993, not only did they promise to provide tax cuts but they promised no increased taxes. Remember? And what happened? Everything went up. Not only did they deny Australians the tax cuts they promised but they increased wholesale sales tax across-the-board. Remember Keating's sales tax in 1993? It got worse, because it now impacts on rural Australia.We are now proposing a tax reform package that includes $13 billion worth of tax cuts that are going to benefit rural workers in Australia. In fact, a station hand married with two children on a single income, earning about $400 a week, will get a $23 a week tax cut. The Labor Party are opposing this. They never delivered on their tax cuts and they are now trying to stop the coalition government from delivering them now.Worse than that, as an example of what the Labor Party does to rural Australia, you have got a Labor government in New South Wales  which, in the term of the last four years, has gutted $40 million out of the agriculture department in New South Wales. Where is the member for Clarence, who is supposedly representing rural New South Wales? He has allowed Carr to gut $40 million out of the department of agriculture in New South Wales.Rural Australia know that they need the tax reform package that our government is proposing. They know that the $13 billion worth of tax cuts are going to benefit everybody in rural Australia and they know that only the Labor Party and the Democrats are stopping our government from implementing a policy that we were elected at the last election to implement. You will be held accountable for opposing these tax cuts. You will be held accountable by the people in rural Australia.</DOC>

 - I am happy to give a detailed answer because there are many implications here. If the House wants to know it, I will. As far as I can see, the allegations being made broadly, and they are a bit broader than the question, are that public moneys were wasted; the investigation was slow - normally investigations take two to three months; there has been a lack of accountability; that it was my decision and that somehow overruled the department; that someone had inside knowledge; that somehow that related to me talking. As far as I can see about the summary of the seven allegations,  let me take them one by one. As for the first allegation that public moneys have been wasted, the fact is -  - I will give Labor the answer they want - that's fine - if they don't want a full answer. The first thing I will say is that there is no evidence that all these machines were ordered in the weeks before the budget. You are quite wrong there. There is no evidence. - They were ordered over the previous 12 months - and if you had listened to my answer two days ago you would have understood that. The second point is that I completely and categorically deny and repudiate any suggestion whatsoever there was any leak from me or any leak from my office - categorically. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. As he would know, and as I think I have said to this House on a number of occasions, Australia is probably living through the most difficult international economic climate since the Second World War. Right throughout the period of the 1980s and early 1990s, Asia was booming and providing an impetus for Australian growth. All of that has changed in the last 18 months or so since first Thailand, then Korea and then Indonesia went into IMF programs. We have seen a continued depression in Japan. We have seen Hong Kong and Singapore slide into recession. We have seen the New Zealand economy slide into recession and, outside of China, we have seen the whole of the Asian region, once considered the strong economic region of the world, practically in recession if not worse.Throughout that period it has always been the case that an international downturn would have an effect on Australia. But we went into the Asian downturn in a strengthened position because this government did the hard work to fix a budget deficit of $10 billion, which had been created by the honourable member for Brand when he was the Minister for Finance of Australia. He left that deficit to this government, notwithstanding pledges that the budget was then in surplus.If we had not fixed the fiscal position in 1996, before the Asian downturn was known, Australia would have been in a terribly  exposed position. It was making sure that we had the budget in place, that we had a new monetary policy and that we were able to reduce interest rates - and, since this government has come to office, interest rates have been reduced to some of the lowest in 30 years - that protected the Australian economy at a time of international downturn.On the basis of the last national accounts, at five per cent growth, Australia was not only, outside of China, the only growing economy in Asia but the strongest growing economy in the developed world. In recent times, as business confidence has picked up, you have seen people like the National Bank describe that as a stunning performance. That was the assessment of the chief economist at the National Australia Bank. The IMF deputy director, Stanley Fischer, talked about Australia doing remarkably well. In Fortune magazine in December of last year, Paul Krugman, considered by many to be the pre-eminent economist in the world, said words to the effect, `In case you did not know it, Australia is the miracle economy of the world financial crisis.'I think we can recognise the benefits of good policy in all of that. We have to recognise the performance of our exporters, who were able to divert exports to new markets as a consequence. We have to recognise the part that was played by a floating exchange rate. We have to recognise the enormous benefit to Australian business of low interest rates. We have to recognise the fact that it was this government that took the standard variable mortgage rate down from 10½ per cent to something like six per cent, putting money back in the pockets of Australian home buyers. It was this government that put money back in the pockets of Australian home buyers, which made sure that retail spending kept the domestic economy strong at a time of international economic turmoil.As I said before, one of the things that was important to that was a floating exchange rate. I pay tribute to those in the Labor Party who have supported economic reform for the work that was done. But for the modern leadership of the Labor Party to turn its back on opening up the economy is for it to turn its back on  probably the only successes it had in the 1980s. As the member for Melbourne said - and I think this is something that all members of the parliament should consider carefully, particularly the Labor frontbench:The Labor Party cannot afford to indulge in the politics of nostalgia. Strident denunciations of economic rationalism and broad hints that we can return to the good old days of high tariffs and pork-barrelling may produce short-term political benefits but they will only engender disillusionment in the long run.Let us be honest about this: that is an indictment of the economic policies of your shadow Treasurer and of the leader. You could not have lined the targets up better - two of the hereditary peers - of the deputy leader of the Labor Party and the leader of the Labor Party. Let us hear it again:Strident denunciations of economic rationalism and broad hints - this is how it is done; wink, wink, nudge, nudge - that we can return to the good old days of high tariffs and pork-barrelling may produce short-term political benefits but they will only engender disillusionment in the long run.There is the challenge to the modern Labor Party. Can they embrace the policies of Werriwa and Melbourne and turn their backs on Hotham and Brand? This is the great economic challenge for the Labor Party. If the Prince of Hotham wants to stand by his political program, as I said earlier, he can write a book and say why the member for Melbourne and the member for Werriwa are wrong.The great challenge for the modern Labor Party is: can you embrace the future or will you cling to the past? The future is represented by Melbourne and Werriwa; the past is represented by Hotham and Brand. The future is represented by joining the government in the great reform process; the past is represented by the strident denunciations and the `back to the future' policies and populism of Brand and Fremantle. - And Fremantle as well. There is no future in following the hereditary peers here. Follow Werriwa and Melbourne,  learn the lessons of the international downturn and support the great reform agenda that this coalition government is leading.</DOC>

 - There are two questions there, and I will answer each of them in turn. The first relates to the investigation. I have checked my words on the 9th and they are correct. There are two processes under way here. The first is a process that was put in place before the budget at the suggestion of my department when they told me several days before the budget that there could be a loophole here, or a problem, and that we should address it ahead of time. I put in place then a process -  -  - This sledging is very difficult, Mr Speaker. I put in place then a process that would see that all machines would be registered and that the Health Insurance Commission would check each and every registration.As for the Leader of the Opposition's interjection that this was somehow outside the process of government, let me say what the process was. -  - No, it is not my department's suggestion; you did not understand it. - My department said in Senate estimates that I made the decision. That is correct. Let me tell you the process of my making the decision. The department advised my office that there may be a problem. I asked my department for proposals that could address that problem. I discussed them with my department. I asked my department which was their preferred option and I made a decision along the lines of - in fact, identical with - the preferred option put to me by my department. So the notion that you are suggesting that I somehow came in over the top and put something in myself is not correct. The fact is, though, that in this government the final decision is always with the minister, and I took that decision on the advice of my department and I took my department's preferred advice.I might say that then, because we were close to the budget - because of the other interjection by the Leader of the Opposition - I wrote to the Treasurer, Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and Administration, as is absolutely appropriate, to have it agreed for the budget process.The second investigation, which the Leader of the Opposition will not be aware of, which is why there may be some confusion, is that the Health Insurance Commission received anonymous and unsubstantiated allegations in December. It is not clear whether these are fact or whether these are as a result of professional, personal or organisational jealousies. In effect, with this additional information, only eight weeks ago, I might say, the Health Insurance Commission of its own volition decided to go through the process it normally would when there is any doubt. This process is completely independent of government, as it should be.In terms of will I say which machines came in before the budget cut-off, this also shows a lack of understanding of the process by the opposition, and it goes back to the earlier  question. I have no evidence, and no evidence has been presented to me or provided by the opposition, that there was actually a rush of orders in the weeks before the budget. -  - The fact is that to order a MRI and have it in place may in fact take 12 months. - We are talking here about a new technology that is very underrepresented in Australia. In 1996 Australia had 2.8 MRI units per million of population compared with 21.3 units per million in Japan, 15.6 units per million in the United States and 6.5 units per million in Germany. So it is not at all unusual to expect that with a new technology, when there is a very rapid growth in that technology and where Australia is a long way behind in that technology, there should be new units being ordered. In fact, with all the new units being ordered, we are still less than half of what Germany has on a per capita basis. -  - Eight times behind Japan or six times behind the United States. So it is a silly schoolboy debating point. It was well known that we were looking at MRI. The Australian Health Technology Advisory Committee released a report in October 1997 and said that we should fund it, and this created substantial expectation. We commenced negotiations with the Royal Australian College of Radiologists in an open way in December. I said publicly and privately that I wanted to find a way to fund MRI. Then, with the authority of the ERC, I entered into formal negotiations with the College of Radiologists because this involved placing a cap on the number of services. It involved actually a savings measure where the net effect was an $80 million saving to the budget. So there was a great expectation in the industry from October that this service  that was underutilised in Australia by any independent measure would be more utilised.I do not know when the machines came in except to say that I asked the Health Insurance Commission last night whether there is any evidence that anyone had advance knowledge of the decision, and I was advised that their investigations to date have not provided any evidence whatsoever. Finally in terms of my role, I asked the Health Insurance Commission last night what is the role of ministers in this. I will read you their written advice, and I am happy to table the page. It reads:The Health Insurance Act 1973 contains secrecy provisions which preclude the release of information about individual cases.So it would be against the law for the Health Insurance Commission to provide it to me. -  - I must say that to even provide the dates could show to individual people that they are potentially under investigation, and the Health Insurance Commission has said that it would be improper to make that available. Let me just read their words:The Health Insurance Act 1973 contains secrecy provisions which preclude the release of information about individual cases. Furthermore, it has not been the practice of successive Health Ministers to interfere in the action of the HIC with respect to individual providers. This practice is a sound one and there is no basis for an exception being made in this case.I will table that. Further, I will table the Health Insurance Act 1973, under which I operate, which was passed under a Labor government. Finally, there is absolutely nothing that has been shown up here, yet. There is mud slinging and there are allegations. I would say to the Leader of the Opposition that it may turn out, when this process has gone through its normal course, that this anonymous, unsubstantiated allegation is in fact a professional rivalry, and you have fallen for it hook, line and sinker.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I know of the concern that she has, for all of New South Wales as well as for her own seat, for the way in which home and community care money is spent. In this current year, the Commonwealth government is providing $500 million funding for HACC. That represents 60 per cent of all HACC money that is spent across Australia. This represents a rise of $24 million - a five per cent rise - in HACC funding on behalf of the federal government. With regard to New South Wales, $156 million is being paid, which represents an increase of $9.5 million.I saw some suggestion that this increase was contingent upon other fee structures being put in place, and I would say that this payment of $156 million, including the increase of $9.5 million, is not conditional on any fee structure. But I would say this: it is contingent upon the New South Wales minister providing me with sufficient financial data to ensure that the money will be spent with a diversity and equity which will satisfy the needs of individuals. I currently await that information from the New South Wales minister. Particularly during the lead-up to a  New South Wales election, it is most important that the federal government is ensured that federal money is spent properly in the interests of individuals and is not used in a pork-barrelling manner in the state election.</DOC>

 - One would have thought that the former Minister for Finance, the now Leader of the Opposition, would be somewhat familiar with procedures relating to budget and when there are variations thereof in the lead-up to it. But I suppose all of us would be forgiven for gaining the impression that he had little or no knowledge of just how the budget operated. After all, he was responsible for $10.3 billion worth of deficit when he left office. - Let me elaborate that process and how it related to the question put to me by the Leader of the Opposition. Whenever there is a matter which has an impact on or relates to a variation in respect of the budget, it is the practice and the procedure, which has been honoured from time immemorial, for ministers to write to the Prime Minister, to the Treasurer and to the minister for finance to indicate what that variation or otherwise  might be. In this instance, following on from the process in the lead-up to the last budget, in respect of radiology, including MRI, there was a decision taken and, within the bounds of that decision, the Minister for Health and Aged Care wrote to the three ministers in question. It was a capped fund; it was simply an acknowledgment of that. It was a capped fund, and it was within those bounds that those letters were written. I distinctly recall that letter. It was straightforward and followed procedures to the letter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question and for his concern. I think it is fair to say that, on this rather rare occasion, I can speak for all members of the parliament when I say that we were shocked by the death of the Australian missionary Mr Graham Staines and his two sons, Phillip and Timothy, who were aged 10 and six respectively. They were killed on 22 January in the Indian province of Orissa. Mr Staines and his sons were killed while they slept at a Christian camp. The Indian authorities have now arrested 52 people in relation to the incident. The government acted quickly on hearing of the details of the deaths. I would like to commend the Australian High Commission and, personally, the Australian High Commissioner, Rob Laurie, for the decisive action they took at that time.The consul of the High Commission travelled to Orissa province on 24 January to gain first-hand information about what occurred and to provide all necessary support and assistance to Mrs Staines and her daughter who lived in the town of Baripada. I am sure all members of the House would agree with me that the courage of Mrs Staines and her daughter in these circumstances was quite extraordinary and was a great credit to both of them and to Australia.The High Commission has advised that the Indian government has now announced that it will institute a special judicial inquiry into the killing of the Staines. The inquiry will be headed by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court. It is expected to commence sitting this week and to present its final report within two months. The terms of reference for the inquiry will be announced in the next few days. Our High Commission in New Delhi will monitor the inquiry closely to ensure that, at the end of the day, those who were responsible for this most horrific killing are brought to justice.</DOC>

 - As to the last part of the question, I do not concede that; in fact, I reject the claim made by the honourable member for Wills. At the time the assistance was announced, I made it clear that it was for emergency assistance for individuals and small businesses facing hardship. The press release made no mention of compensation for everyone affected. The Minister for Finance and Administration issued more detailed eligibility criteria later the same day, and these were drafted in consultation with the Victorian government to reflect the intention. Initial estimates of the funding required were also developed in close consultation with Victoria.The availability of assistance was widely publicised, including through a series of press advertisements and hotlines, Centrelink  publicity material and outreach activities, and through community organisations providing material aid. The government has allowed an appropriate and generous period for claims to be lodged. It extended the time for claims under the community assistance component to 31 January 1999 at the request of the Victorian Premier.I understand that there have been claims that Commonwealth guidelines prevented the Victorian government reimbursing charities for electric appliances given to people during the gas crisis. This, I am advised, is not accurate. For example, the Salvation Army has been reimbursed at least $200,000 for kettles and frying pans, and we are investigating why their further claims have not been paid.I have been informed that a total of $3.8 million was spent under the community assistance component of the program, including at least $700,000 to the Salvation Army. The Department of Finance and Administration is investigating why their further claims, which I think were referred to on the 7.30 Report last night, have not been reimbursed because clearly they should have been, within the guidelines laid down. The department is investigating that claim, firstly, to establish its accuracy and, secondly, to establish why those additional claims have not been met. Final expenditure under the program is likely to be around $7.3 million: $0.2 million for Newstart, $3.3 million for small business and $3.8 million for community assistance.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question. The honourable member for Parramatta is one of those members who can claim great credit for this scheme. He has been a strong and consistent supporter of what has become known as the Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development scheme. This morning I had the great pleasure of going to a breakfast in Sydney where I welcomed the first 80 members of the Australian Youth Ambassadors for Development scheme who are going to leave Australia very soon for periods of between three and 12 months in the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Nepal, Vanuatu, Fiji and the Solomon Islands.These 80 people were selected from 700 applicants, and they will be going to those countries to share their experiences, talents and skills in a wide range of areas - from engineering to public health, to teaching, and so the list goes on. There are two things that this scheme will achieve. First of all, it will ensure that a large number of young Australians develop a clear and positive understanding of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region. After all, we need to understand our own region if we are going to successfully engage with it. That does not just mean members of parliament or the bureaucracy; it means the mainstream of Australian society.These people will get to know the region. And the other side of this is that the region will get to know Australians. People in our region will come to know young and talented Australians. I am absolutely convinced that this will generate a very positive image for Australia. This is a great scheme. Five hundred young Australians will participate in this scheme over the next two years. All I can say is that if we maintain the quality of the first 80 in the scheme these young people will do Australia enormous credit. This is a scheme which I am proud this government has set up and which I know will work and work successfully for many years to come.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  -  - Mr Speaker -  - I am told that the mail-out that is referred to by the member for Canberra actually occurred before the federal election was announced and therefore before the caretaker period had commenced. I am told that it was consistent with some 10 years of practice under which the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Family and Community Services have sent aged pension news to DVA pensioners. Similar mail-outs occurred under the Labor government -  - Yes, including a previous Labor minister who, I am advised, actually provided the addresses of veterans to the Labor Mayor of Brisbane for a mail-out in 1995. In that case, the mail-out was conducted by a private mailing house without any formal protection of privacy. This case -  - This matter was referred to the former -  -  - This matter was referred to the former Privacy Commissioner, Ms Moira Scollay. She found that there had been a minor breach of the Privacy Act by what is now the Department of Family and Community Services and by Centrelink. She noted that  no personal information was disclosed to any third parties, and personal information was used only to provide pensioners and recipients of veterans' entitlements with information. The commissioner accepted that the mail-out had been conducted in good faith and noted that the department and Centrelink had agreed to a number of procedural changes to ensure there were no similar breaches in future. I understand that before she left office the Privacy Commissioner was satisfied that the matter had been adequately dealt with and intended to take no further action. I am also advised that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is negotiating a memorandum of understanding with Centrelink to govern future use of the veterans database, which is more than the previous Labor government did.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. When I was down in her electorate last week I saw the way she is recognised by her constituents. She is a great member and a great representative of that part of New South Wales. While I was at Nowra last week, I opened the new Tingira Child Care Centre. This is certainly good news for defence families because the opening of that facility means that there are now 16 child-care centres operating around Australia for defence families.I also made available the good news that a contractor is going to provide these facilities for defence families around Australia. Since the defence child-care program was introduced in 1991, it has been managed by the parents of those children and those parents who, by the very nature of defence service in Australia today, are often transferred to postings all around Australia. The responsibility that they had was not only for the running of the child care centre but also for the legal and the managerial side of things, so  there was a very unfair burden placed on those defence families.As a result of this initiative of the government, and the comprehensive tendering process, I announce that KU Children's Services will be providing this service for defence around Australia. Progressively, over the course of this year, we will see some 900 children of defence personnel taking the opportunity to have their children cared for in these excellent child-care centres for defence families. It is certainly good news for defence families. I hope that the opposition will support this initiative because it is certainly supported and appreciated by the defence personnel all around Australia.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I want to make it very clear to the House that in fact I would have thought all honourable members would have acquainted themselves by now with a comprehensive statement that I released yesterday with respect to charter matters. Clearly, if members - including the member for Melbourne - had looked at that statement, it would have been very clear that there was considerable doubt regarding the question of debt relating to taking accompanying passengers on charter flights. The government looked at that over recent days, and the Department of Finance and Administration obtained independent legal advice which also made it very clear that the question of debt was in considerable doubt.Using that as the base, I come back to the honourable member for Melbourne's question. With respect to any additional persons on any charter - and, in particular, any additional persons on charters that were within the entitlement of the minister, Senator Ellison - on the basis that they were within entitlement, it is quite clear that there is considerable doubt as to whether or not there were any moneys owing, any claim that should be made or any debt outstanding.I think we should also see this in its proper light. There was no additional cost to the Commonwealth, no additional cost to the taxpayers of Australia and no benefit of any nature to Senator Chris Ellison in respect of any of these charters, including the one referred to by the honourable member for Melbourne. Therefore, the matter of repayment is not the question. A payment was made because that man is a man of integrity who wanted to make it abundantly clear to the general public, to the people of Australia, that there should be no perception out there that any decision had been taken by the government or elsewhere that may have been of an advantage to him.The questions that were asked by the member for Melbourne are simply based on  a false premise. It is clear from the legal advice that there is doubt about the question of debt. There are no moneys due to the Commonwealth, no additional moneys have been outlaid by the taxpayers of Australia, and there is no benefit to Senator Ellison. The matter in all the circumstances has been handled appropriately.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, could I say to the honourable member for Gilmore, who has been an outstanding representative of the small businessmen in her electorate, that the government reforms of unfair dismissal laws will massively benefit the small business community of Australia. We have had some evidence of that in the last 48 hours in the form of a survey by ACCI, an organisation that represents more small businesses in Australia than any other organisation.I know that the Australian Labor Party - which takes its marching orders from the trade unions on this issue and certainly does not take into account the views of small business - may dismiss it, but the ACCI survey revealed that almost 54 per cent of small businesses surveyed reported that unfair dismissals remained an impediment to taking on more staff.We on this side of the parliament who represent the interests of small business, who understand the interests of small business, know from our own experience that if you can get rid of the existing unreasonable, unfair dismissal regime you can generate more jobs. A figure of 50,000 more jobs has been mentioned by representatives of the small business community.I heard on the radio this morning that the Labor Party is going to move a motion in the Senate this week to overturn the regulation put down by my colleague the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small  Business. Let me say to the Labor Party: if you move that motion, you are trying to destroy 50,000 jobs in Australia. If you move that motion, you are acting antagonistically towards the interests of small business in this community. We may have an unemployment level of 7.5 per cent, but we will not make further progress unless we get rid of these ridiculous unfair dismissal laws -  - These unfair dismissal laws have worked to undermine the generation of jobs in Australia -  - And the more you interject, the more I know that we have fingered you for what you are: you are the mouthpieces in this place of the trade union movement. - We know that a disproportionately large number of the frontbench of the Labor Party are former trade union officials, but I did not know from that that they were going to do the bidding of the trade union movement on every issue.Small business survival demands that the government's unfair dismissal proposals be upheld. The interests of small business will be served if the Labor Party desists from its obstructive behaviour. More importantly, 50,000 more jobs in Australia can be generated if the Labor Party retreats from its absurd position.</DOC>

 - It seems I have to indicate once again to the honourable member for Melbourne that the question of repayment has never arisen. A question of payment is of course relevant and payments have been made, notwithstanding that the taxpayers of Australia have paid not one extra cent -  - Mr Speaker, I am addressing the part of the question which referred to the word `repayment'. I stress that a payment was made. It is now clear that a payment was made on two occasions: once in September last year and subsequently in recent days. Those payments relate to charters and they are not based upon what can be described as anything other than the honesty of the man in question and his view that there ought to be a very clear indication given as to how this matter should be dealt with and that there should be no perception to the contrary.At the time when the honourable member for Melbourne referred to the first of those payments, the minister relevant to members' entitlements was Senator Minchin. He dealt with the matter appropriately and on the advice that he received. Most ministers do that on a day-to-day basis without consulting their fellow ministers, including their portfolio ministers. At that time, he did it and he did it appropriately - I have looked at the records. He did not discuss it with me.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest in the government's tax reform proposals. As the House now well knows, the government believes that low and middle income earners should have a cut in income tax. Under the government's plan, 81 per cent of taxpayers will pay no more than 30 cents in the dollar. Under the government's proposal, 95 per cent of taxpayers will receive a cut in their marginal income tax rate. Unless these changes are put through, without the government's income tax cuts, by the turn of the century a taxpayer earning only 1.2 times average earnings will be paying a top marginal rate of 47 per cent, plus the Medicare levy.One of the things that the government's tax reform package also does is reduce effective marginal tax rates. Under Labor's tax system - the tax system which we inherited - some taxpayers in the income bracket between $27,600 and $29,600 lose 105 per cent of every dollar they earn. Under Labor's tax system - which the government inherited - after 13 years -  - The Leader of the Opposition could not fix the tax system in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth or thirteenth year! I hate to say it, Mr Speaker, but his last little effort was act No. 197 of 1992. It was not a promise; it was l-a-w. It was l-a-w which did not apply for one taxpayer for one day. Labor was elected on that in 1992. It was passed into l-a-w before the 1993 election. It was not a promise; it was l-a-w, but it did not apply for one day. He now says, `If only I'd had a fourteenth, a fifteenth or a sixteenth year, I'd have been able to do something.'After 13 years, the Labor Party had taxpayers who earned between $27,600 and $29,600 paying $1.05 in tax and lost benefits for every dollar they earned. That was Labor's system. The government's package will reduce income tax rates for middle income earners to effective marginal tax rates of 61.5 per cent, which is the 30 per cent income tax, the 1.5 per cent  Medicare levy and the 30 per cent government taper rate.Late last week, the Australian Council of Social Service put out a proposal to butcher the government's tax plan, to change the dramatic reform of the indirect tax base and to take away income tax cuts which the people of Australia voted for at the last election. In that proposal, in place of a tax rate of 30 per cent to be paid on income between $20,000 and $50,000, ACOSS proposes that we increase the rate from 30 per cent to either 34 or 32 per cent. That would be an increase in the marginal tax rate for 53 per cent of taxpayers. It would be an increase in the marginal tax rate for average earners. It would be an increase in the marginal tax rate for people who earn $20,000 less than average earners.It is a proposal by the Australian Council of Social Service to butcher the government's indirect tax base so that all food items could be bought tax free - your caviar, your lobster, your oysters - and people in middle income ranges would have an increase in their income tax rates. That is the proposal that was put forward by the Australian Council of Social Service. Will the government be accepting it? No, the government will not be accepting it. The government will not be accepting higher marginal income rates for middle income earners. This is a government that believes in lower personal income tax for middle income earners. This is a government that is reducing all marginal tax rates except the top one, because we are biasing income tax cuts to lower and middle income Australia.The one thing we would not do is what the Labor Party did in act No. 197 of 1992. I have gone back and tried to check this out. This could have been the only proposed l-a-w that cut marginal income tax rates for everybody except those on the lowest rate. That was the Labor Party's plan. I suppose the Labor Party says, `You can't blame us; we never implemented our law anyway.' If they had implemented their law, it would have been the only cut in income taxes in the last 20 years which deliberately and specifically excluded the lowest marginal tax rates. That l-a-w is still on the statute book. - We always know when he engages in psychobabble that he is having a bad day. It could have been implemented in any one of the three years that the Labor Party was in office. It was never implemented for one day. It could even be implemented today, so I am advised, by the government passing some kind of regulation to implement that statute. But this government will not be doing it. - We would not be gazetting the l-a-w, because the l-a-w did not provide any income tax cuts for low income earners, and we believe that low income earners should be getting tax cuts, that middle income earners should be getting them as well, and that people that worked and saved should be getting them. We also believe that since the Australian people voted for this policy at the last election they deserve to have it implemented and implemented in full. And we will not let them down in the way the Labor Party did in 1993.</DOC>

 - Of course, you can ask any question you like, and I will answer questions from information within my own knowledge. The structure of the Greenfields Foundation is a matter that the office-bearers of that foundation, I am quite certain, would be very ready to answer. I understand, from what I have read in the newspapers - and I have absolutely no reason to doubt this - that the relevant officer of the Australian Electoral Commission some weeks ago said that, in relation to the returns of the party which I am proud to lead and of which I have been a member, the Liberal Party of Australia, everything had been done in accordance with the law. I do not administer the electoral laws. I do not raise money for the Liberal Party; that is raised by the organisation. - I repeat that I answer in relation to matters within my knowledge. I cannot answer in detail about the fundraising activities of my party, any more than the Leader of the Opposition, I imagine, can answer in detail about the fundraising activities of his party. If you want to know something over and above what has been published as required by law in relation to the fundraising activities of the Liberal Party, you direct  your question to the Liberal Party organisation, and the Liberal Party organisation will decide how it will respond to that question. In relation to the Greenfields Foundation, if you want to direct some questions to that organisation about its composition, its contributions, its behaviour, its structure - anything in fact allowed by the law - you, as I said last week, are free to go ahead and do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. The government is working on a whole series of fronts to improve the economic climate so that particularly our small businesses but also our larger businesses can see their way ahead to create more jobs. There are a lot of things that we can do. Getting interest rates down has been a great help in terms of encouraging the growth of our businesses. In the workplace relations area, for example, the junior rates being able to be included in awards is, I think, a very good measure. It will protect young people's jobs but it will also help with the commission having the final say by the incorporation of junior rates into other awards which currently do not have them. That will open job opportunities.In that proposal, we include the simple but important proposition that the commission, in making its decisions, ought to take into account not only the interests of people who have a job but also the impact on the unemployed. That is a paradigm shift for this parliament to in fact bring the unemployed into the equation and to genuinely give them the chance of a job.Of course, in respect of unfair dismissal laws, as the Prime Minister said, we have moved decisively to try to address what is a genuine problem - a real problem - holding back job creation. Helen Hughes, a respected  academic, in the last week or so wrote on this issue in her paper entitled `Why small business is not hiring.' She said:In the long-term, the climate of legal uncertainty created by the unfair dismissal laws will mean that instead of responding to increase demand by hiring workers, employers will increase the capital intensity, replace workers with machines and use more careful and begrudging selection procedures. This will further marginalise young job seekers.I think this is just a matter of commonsense. Let us say you are an employer and you are running a small business. You believe the system is stacked against you, that it is unfair. Ultimately, all other things being equal, if you have a choice between giving a person a job or getting a new piece of capital equipment, and if it is going to penalise you to employ somebody, you will say - as with a lot of businesses where they get the chance - `I think I will have a machine because they will not drag me before the Industrial Relations Court and expect me to pay damages and the like.'The obstacles in the way of these sensible policies are pretty obvious: 52 per cent of Labor's frontbench has a trade union background as an official. That is the crunch point. - You are the leader of an opposition that is absolutely stacked with the vested interests of a minority group, a group who today represent only 28 per cent of the Australian labour force. You are representing a diminishing group, with an ever smaller base, that is unable to understand the national interests. The Leader of the Opposition says that he is going to have a policy review. What a joke!One of the most significant issues facing any government responsible for economic policy is how to run the labour market. Last December, on this most significant issue, what was the position of the Leader of the Opposition? He said he was not going to change it `one jot or tittle,' to use his words. What a contrast that makes to the state Labor administration. On this junior wage rates issue, Queensland, for example, has the same antidiscrimination issue before them. Have they moved to deny young people job opportunities? Of course they haven't. They are at odds with you. In New South Wales, they have the same legislative prescription against antidiscrimination but the legislative prescription only comes into effect upon the executive action of the minister. Has the minister, Jeff Shaw - your mate Jeff Shaw in New South Wales - acted in New South Wales to deny young people jobs? No, he hasn't. Why hasn't he? Because the practical implications of the policy that you are pursuing will of course mean that young people will lose their jobs. Even the New South Wales government knows that if you remove that exemption young people will lose their jobs.Tasmania is another Labor administration - three out of three. Do they have the same proposal? No, they don't. Why don't they? Because as a government they are actually responsible here and now, today, for looking after young people's jobs. At least they can see the practical point.Mr Speaker, the fact of the matter is that Labor is run by the unions. The hierarchy of the trade union movement is opposed to a sensible measure and the Leader of the Opposition simply does what he is told. He thinks he can exploit people's concerns about fear of change.What did the member for Werriwa say about Labor? He said that Labor `constantly tries to lift the scab off the wound of change', and that `since 1996, federal Labor has been in the scab lifter mode'. That says a lot about the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I do not agree with Des Moore on that point. I think his paper is worth reading but I do not agree with him on that and nor does the government. What a cheek it is for the Labor opposition to ask us about the circumstances of people on low pay in this country. To quote the publication Out of the rut  that the Treasurer has probably still got with him - written by a few of your Labor Party supporters - the circumstances of the average person at the bottom of the pay scale was that after 13 years they were 100 bucks a week worse off.Look at the circumstances of those people today. In the two decisions we have already had from the commission, under a framework that we have established, the fact is that those people on low pay are five per cent better off in real terms. So don't you come in here talking about us in respect of the low paid. You delivered for the low paid a reduction in their real wages and the highest level of unemployment since the great recession.On top of that, you are so weak on this issue that you are basically supporting the ACTU. It is an inflationary claim which will throw a whole lot of people out into unemployment. It fails to acknowledge, what we at least acknowledge in our position, that there has to be a fair balance. An $8 a week wage increase is a very reasonable balance between the interests of the unemployed, those on low pay and the interests of the economy as a whole. This just shows that these people are completely out of touch and that they have a very short memory about the shocking record of economic mismanagement that they presided over for 13 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question, and I know that the honourable member for Herbert, as does the government, strongly supports a balanced immigration program with a composition that benefits Australia. If you are going to sustain such a program which is going to produce those sorts of benefits, you need to be able to locate and remove individuals who might be here unlawfully, working illegally and those who have overstayed visas and the like.It is important, if you are going to be able to ensure the integrity of the program, that those compliance activities are actively supported. The government has done that by providing additional resources. We have re-prioritised the activities so that we are no longer just engaging in what was euphemistically referred to as `employer awareness programs'. We have actually increased the physical location and apprehension of those people who are breaching visa requirements. The data-matching activity in which we are involved ensures that, when information is provided to agencies such as the tax office, the Health Insurance Commission and the like, that information can be linked to the immigration department's information about those people who are in Australia and who may have overstayed visas.People who are located face detention; they face being removed from Australia. Of course, those who are working illegally face the cancellation of a visa. They are liable for the costs of their removal and of their detention, and any prospective applications that they might make abroad to come back to Australia are obviously more carefully scrutinised. The impact of those measures has been significant - something of the order of 977 illegal workers were located in various factories and restaurants and in the sex industry, as I understand it. That represents some 16 per cent increase on the figures that we saw last year. - Employers find it very inconvenient when they have been engaging people who may be unlawful to find them removed from their operations, very often at key times. Of course, those who are involved in harbouring those who might be illegal can be prosecuted, in addition. If the honourable member is encouraging the prosecution of small businesses that are involved in employing illegals, I would like to hear him speaking about those matters.Let me make the point that over the years that we have been in office now these numbers have been progressively increased, to the point where last year some 12,000 people were located. That is something of the order of 15 per cent of those who may be unlawfully in Australia at any point in time. These compliance activities are important for ensuring that we are able to maintain the integrity of the immigration program - one, I know, which is strongly supported by all members in this House.</DOC>

 - What was the commodity, Mr Speaker? -  - I can certainly assure the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that it will not increase the price by the 10 per cent falsely claimed by some of your colleagues. Obviously, there will be some price increase, but the impact of the 10 per cent which has been carelessly - and I think quite irresponsibly - flung around, will be significantly offset by the fact that fuel will fall in cost because of the introduction of the taxation package. There will be the abolition of wholesale sales tax. The precise percentage  will be significantly less than 10 per cent and, I understand, less than five per cent.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for the question he asks me and the continued interest he has in the forestry workers of his electorate. It is of interest to me that the strategists of the Labor Party never give their Tasmanian representatives the same opportunity to pursue the interests of their forestry workers in Tasmania - notwithstanding a very good visit I had there recently.The member asked me about regional forest agreements being concluded in New South Wales. I have got to tell him that there is no substantive progress at this point in time between the Commonwealth and the present New South Wales Labor government -  - That is for the simple reason that - in answer to you, Mr Speaker, and to the member interjecting - although there was a personal agreement between the minister and myself on 13 November last year to provide all necessary data that the New South Wales Labor government used to establish the calculations and the decisions they have passed through that parliament unilaterally, that promised data is yet to be provided. There must be one of two reasons for that: either they have got something to hide in that information, or otherwise they have lost the  envelope upon which it was written, because there cannot be very much of it.The regional forest agreement process is one that obliges the cooperating parties - that is, the Commonwealth and state governments - to pay attention to the environmental, the social and the economic factors involved. The Commonwealth is committed to this and has, since 13 November last year, provided considerable information - to which I will shortly refer - to the New South Wales state government. I remind you, Sir, there was not one word from the New South Wales government to meet their side of the bargain.I have to remind the House that, under another piece of Keating l-a-w, I am obliged to cancel any woodchip export licences at the end of this calendar year if the area from which the wood is obtained has no RFA coverage. One might wonder just how much further an effect that could have on the employment of good workers in New South Wales when one looks at it. - There he goes. A great idea, says the Labor Party. That is just the message that is necessary. So there are problems already for one of the major woodchip exporters, which are attempting to renegotiate their contract at this moment with no possibility of being able to tell their markets that they can continue to supply.By comparison, in Queanbeyan today I attended the launch of the New South Wales coalition's policy on forestry. It contains an absolute commitment to re-establish communications with the Commonwealth to ensure that New South Wales, like the state of Tasmania and like the state of Victoria, will be covered by the Regional Forest Agreement written under the rules of the National Forest Policy Statement. One might remember who produced the national forest policy statement: it was the previous Keating government, which has now been totally dishonoured by the New South Wales Labor government.It is not so in Tasmania, where the Deputy Premier of Tasmania went to the recent Senate inquiry on the RFA legislation which has passed this House and told those senators present to pass the RFA legislation through the Senate without amendment. That is the Tasmanian Labor government's position. They have already signed an RFA and they have already passed RFA legislation. The Labor government down there wants this government to pass the Commonwealth legislation as well.The member also asked me a question regarding the structural adjustment funds, known as FISAP, and how that has been applied in New South Wales to date. Let me read a brief part from a mitigation study from the forest assessment branch:The study estimated that this is the result to date -  -  - I beg your pardon - not in the question? Let me read it to you. -  - I've got it. Strategically, as I said. You don't get them over your side. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The reality is that there is no chance of a dorothy dixer coming from Tasmania on any matter relating to forestry because the Tasmanians are telling you that you are wrong. - I am delighted to do so, Mr Speaker. Let me just give it to you this way. The study of the Eden region was commissioned to look at the social impact and estimated to date, through the activities of the New South Wales Labor government, that there have been 120 jobs -  -  - It is amazing what little interest the opposition has in lost jobs. The study estimated the loss of 120 timber -  - The record in this House is 1,800 words for an answer, and it was Paul Keating who gave it. - The study estimates the loss of 120 timber industry jobs in the Eden region and focuses on the experiences of 32 former native timber industry workers and contractors who lost their jobs between December 1995 and June 1997 -  - On the sample study of the 32 that received assistance and were out of work, six are now in full-time employment, nine are in part-time employment and 12 are unemployed, with the remainder having retired - in other words, half of those people who lost their jobs, notwithstanding, as the report tells us, some $1.8 million of FISAP money paid to assist them.The report goes on to say that those involved suffered significant loss of self-esteem, financial insecurity and uncertainty about their future. That is the way the Labor government has treated people in New South Wales. The coalition has promised that that practice will cease. The coalition says they will have a regional forest agreement, as every other state government has. I will welcome that opportunity on 27 March. - Oh, I am delighted to do so. I table the document.</DOC>

 - I am also aware of the scoping agreement in New South Wales, which has also been disregarded by that state. - Both the state government and the federal government no longer intend to utilise the Environmental Protection Authority in terms of the reassessment of the Regional Forest Agreement, but on the other hand an expert committee is to be appointed and for a very good reason. There is no expert knowledge on the board of the EPA to properly assess the sustainable yield. Both sides have agreed that the better solution is to have people such as Professor Ian Ferguson and Dr Turner, of the ANU, with one representative of the EPA to conduct that process. The EPA representative will not be skilled in forest management - which would seem to be a fundamental requirement for such a scientifically necessary process as establishing the sustainable yield of a forest - and they will be able to overview the process to ensure that that comes.The EPA has recently had a freedom of information request put to it and it has been established that all the remarks they made on the Regional Forest Agreement in Western Australia were the opinion of the board and were not supported by any commissioned scientific studies whatsoever. It would be better for the forests of Western Australia and the workers of Western Australia that when we get down to sustainable yield - something that New South Wales has ignored entirely - the people who assess the calculations for their accuracy need to be the people who understand the science. I think people like Professor Ferguson from the school of forestry in Melbourne and Dr Turner from the school of forestry in Canberra - the only two degree courses in Australia - are the best equipped to make that judgment. I stand entirely behind that decision taken between the Western Australian government and the Commonwealth on this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I am pleased to inform the House that there are now record levels of new apprentices in training. In fact, at 30 September last year, the latest official statistics, there were 199,400 new apprentices in Australia and commencements were running at record levels of over 123,000 during the year.This is a remarkable turnaround from the situation that existed under the previous government. In fact, the numbers in new apprenticeships have increased some 65,000 over the years 1995 to 1998 - an increase of somewhere around 50 per cent in the number of apprenticeship opportunities for young people in Australia. How can we account for this turnaround? The member for Pearce was interested to know this. - As the Prime Minister has said, this turnaround has occurred because, first of all, there was a change of government - a change to a government which was prepared to represent the interests of young people and not the sectional interests of the trade union movement. The major problem faced by the apprenticeship system under the Labor Party was that the trade union movement, the ACTU, insisted on controlling apprenticeships, insisted on regulating them to the point where many employers were simply not prepared to take on an apprentice or trainee because they knew as soon as they did so they would be inviting a union into the workplace. - The member for Paterson is nodding in agreement. He knows the truth of this. And indeed, he is not the only member on the other side of the House who knows the truth of this because the member for Werriwa as far back as 1990 said in Reviving Labor's Agenda :The union movement . . . exercises tremendous power in the ALP.He said:This decade the ALP will be forced to confront the fading relevance of its trade union affiliates.They are still on the frontbench and the Leader of the Opposition has not confronted their fading relevance yet, but in this decade sometime - and there is not long to go - he will have to do that.The member for Melbourne in his recent well-considered book on Open Australia has made precisely the same point. He says:The nature of Labor's links with the trade union movement also requires some rethinking.He said:The first institution which is in need of an overhaul is the Labor Party itself. The structure and organisational dynamics of the ALP have changed very little since the 1920s.The Leader of the Opposition needs to realise that so long as the Labor Party is a sectional party not only will it continue to undermine and indeed attack the interests of young people in Australia through its position on  junior wages, unfair dismissals and the apprentice system, but it will never be seen as relevant by the people of Australia as having anything to say that might take this country into an era of expanded opportunities in the next century.</DOC>

 - It is not much of a question, but it is at least a question, so I suppose we can be grateful for small mercies. The organisation known as Greenwich University Pty Ltd has, I understand, been recognised by Norfolk Island. Norfolk Island is an external territory of Australia, and the establishment of Greenwich University in that jurisdiction is the responsibility of the Norfolk Island minister responsible for higher education. - Greenwich University can only be recognised within Australia if it is registered with the Australian Qualifications Framework register of bodies with authority to issue qualifications. - If Norfolk Island wishes to have that institution registered in Australia, then it can apply to the Ministerial Council on  Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, and I understand that the Norfolk Island minister has now written to that council seeking recognition for the university. It is at this point that the role of the Commonwealth becomes relevant. MCEETYA - the ministerial council - will have to satisfy itself that Norfolk Island and Greenwich University have put in place appropriate procedures to ensure academic quality in that institution. I say, in concluding, to any students who may be misled by any statements on the Internet that students should always check carefully that any course is one that meets their needs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for the question and acknowledge his deep and abiding interest in family issues and, indeed, the leadership that he provides in this area. As the honourable member mentioned, Senator Newman yesterday announced the Relate program, which is a further government initiative to help support Australian families and Australian relationships. This government has been to the fore in providing additional funding and additional programs to assist Australian families in particular and to help encourage relationships to be strong and effective.It is interesting to note that research has shown that, for people who divorce, one-third regret the decision five years later and two in five believe that the divorce could have been avoided. So this government is in the process of trying to assist people when relationships run into difficulties, to not walk away from the problems, to face them, to communicate more effectively - one with another - to ensure that the family is able to keep together. This Relate program is a part of the government's initiatives to assist families, which include $6 million for marriage and relationship education services, $16 million to  expand counselling and mediation and $10.5 million to support services for men in family relationships.All of these things are important initiatives because when we strengthen families and we strengthen relationships we strengthen the fundamental unit of our society and we build stronger communities. I would like to commend this program to Australians. We want to use the resources of Centrelink and, indeed, the various welfare organisations to access the counselling services that are available to ensure that people who have a problem are able to receive advice when they need it.</DOC>

 - I am informed by the Chief of Air Force that he made a decision, on his professional judgment, to restrict Air Force operations in the latter time of the trial period. He did this for three reasons: the first was pilot workload, the second was frequency management and the third was lack of clear procedures at low level operation. Those were considerations that he took on a professional basis, and I have no reason to doubt them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I have been aware of Jerilderie for around 18 months now, ever since the Deputy Prime Minister raised the issue with me specifically. The situation in Jerilderie is that the hospital there has 15 beds and 18 staff, and over the last two years it has had three patients, in spite of costing $800,000 a year to run. Until two weeks ago the local doctor had no visiting rights to the hospital, which meant that he was not able to have anyone in the hospital for more than four hours at a time.On the basis of representations from the Deputy Prime Minister and a very large petition that I received about 15 months ago from the Jerilderie community, we put to the New South Wales government did they want this funded under the multipurpose centre arrangements we had in place. We did it that way because we have previously just funded state priorities. New South Wales put back to us quite clearly that they did not want it funded as it was not one of their priorities. We went back to them in early 1998 to ask whether they wished to reconsider this. The department was told, no, they did not want to reconsider it and they did not want to fund Jerilderie.We became so frustrated that the Deputy Prime Minister, after consulting with me, announced in August last year that we would actually fund, unilaterally, a multipurpose centre, both of us being hopeful that we would get approval for the new regional health centres as part of election policy. That happened. We hope as soon as possible to fund 30 new regional health centres - Jerilderie will be one of them - but we are pleased that, after having announced it ourselves, the New South Wales government has finally decided to come on board. I note that in that article it was mentioned that this may not happen until July 2000. I would be optimistic that we could do it before then.</DOC>

 - In 1995 when Labor was in office, the Ombudsman issued a report which said that he had received many complaints about the Department of Social Security call system, as it was in those days. People could not get through at all. So, under Labor, people could not get through at all. -  - Since this government came to office, the number of staff employed in call centres has doubled. There are a large number of extra call centres that have been provided and special measures are now being taken to ensure that there are staff rostered on in times of peak demand. For instance, over the Christmas-new year period, which is traditionally a time when Centrelink services are stretched to their limit, more than 300 extra staff were engaged. If the honourable member for Lilley was monitoring the Senate estimates process, he would have heard that Centrelink reported to the Senate that the response and recovery time from the Christmas period was the best ever this year.There is a very heavy demand on the call centres and, at times of peak demand, there will be delays in the answering of calls. That is inevitable; no-one has ever attempted to deny that. What will happen as a result of the government's, and Centrelink's, new service model is that there will be a reduced demand on the call centres because decisions will be made on the spot by the officer handling the file. Over 40 per cent of all the calls to the call centres at the present time are calls from people who are inquiring about the progress  on their file. If the decision is made on the spot, there will be no need for those calls.In relation to the amount of time that is taken to get an appointment for Newstart interviews, I am advised today that the average is between three to four days. There were some delays longer than that over the Christmas period, naturally, because there are a number of statutory holidays, and some difficulties have occurred, particularly, in Melbourne. Those issues have now been resolved, and I would be happy to provide, if the House would grant the time, some more details on the number of days delay in each place.Because of the improvements made by this government to the call centres, the demand has naturally increased. There is more work yet to be done. Substantial progress has been achieved. We have significantly devoted extra resources to the call centres, and their performance is improving. I am optimistic that those trends will continue into the future and that Centrelink customers will receive an even better service in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his long-term interest in transport matters and, in particular, in the area of rail reform. If there was an area of transport in this country that was really left in a decrepit state, more so than other sectors of transport, by the previous government, it was certainly rail.The ARTC has been operating since July 1998. It has already made very significant progress in furthering the goals of the intergovernmental agreement of November 1997. ARTC took control of the Victorian interstate track in July 1998. It now provides for a single point of access for operators wishing to access the South Australian and Victorian interstate tracks. It is negotiating  with track owners in Western Australia, New South Wales and Queensland for exclusive rights to market and sell access to the interstate track in those jurisdictions.The ARTC access pricing regime has resulted in prices for interstate network access in South Australia and Victoria being set at two per cent less in real terms than 1995 prices, which goes to demonstrate what good policy can achieve.The ARTC has played a pivotal role in promoting the entry of new freight operators to the interstate freight market - competition that is working. In particular, the entry of former interstate freight carriers FreightCorp and V-Line has made a real difference.Since taking control of the Victorian interstate track, speed restrictions - which of course impact on everything from fuel costs to reliability of the network to competitiveness to  attracting business - have been reduced. This has resulted in a reduction from 27 per cent to around 22 per cent of the track being subjected to speed restrictions, and that will improve dramatically over the next few months.It needs to be kept in mind that we have allocated some $250 million of Commonwealth money to the upgrading of the track across Australia. We hope that we can encourage significantly greater investment from the private sector and from the states. Indeed, the first section of line to be designated for upgrading is Pura Pura, between Melbourne and Adelaide. The Labor Party had a go at rebuilding that, and the trains travelled slower after they had done the track up than they did before they began. We have now managed to start a major reinvestment program in Australian rail and I believe that the benefits will be very widespread.</DOC>

We did not want to do that, so the things that I put into place on my department's advice were the statutory declarations that it believed, and still believes, were adequate to deal with the situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for giving me this further opportunity to explain something of the improved services that Centrelink is offering around Australia, particularly services to rural and regional Australia.Late last month I was very pleased to announce an extension of Centrelink's Rural Outreach program with 100 new Centrelink services in rural and regional Australia. I might add that they are all extra services. They are all in places where there were no services previously offered and, for the first time, Centrelink customers will be able to meet face to face with a representative of the government who will be able to handle some of their transactions and certainly give them assistance about where to go if they need additional help. There will be 74 extra Centrelink agents in country centres around Australia, 11 new Centrelink visiting services, 25 videoconferencing facilities, information kiosks, a mobile career information service  for New South Wales and a whole range of self-help services as well.These are examples of this government putting into practice its commitment to regional Australia: delivering services. I was appalled to hear nothing but criticism from the opposition about these additional services to country Australia. They are the ones who withdrew services from rural and regional Australia; this government is restoring them. These new services will provide people in small country communities, where there is never likely to be a full-scale Centrelink office, with the sort of personal contact that is an essential element of our new service model.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Robertson for that question about something of ongoing interest to all of the people of Australia - that is, the generation of jobs. I am very proud to say to the honour  able member for Robertson that employment in Australia has risen by around 400,000 since this government came to office in March 1996. In 1998 alone, 177,500 new jobs were created in Australia. This represents an annual growth of 2.1 per cent.I might point out to the honourable member for Robertson that this 2.1 per cent growth figure compares to the figure of an average of 0.7 per cent for the whole of the OECD area. In other words, jobs growth under this government in this country is three times the rate of jobs growth throughout the OECD area. That is a direct consequence of the policies that have been followed by the coalition government, despite the obstruction and the objections and the obfuscation of the opposition and other parties in the Senate.Recent job growth has seen Australia's unemployment rate fall to 7.5 per cent, and that, I am pleased to say, is the lowest level since September 1990. Despite that, there is still a lot more that needs to be done to get that rate lower. You will not get that rate lower unless you take the shackles off small business to employ more people. You will not get that rate lower unless you further reform the unfair dismissal laws. The Labor Party and the Democrats will have an opportunity in the very near future to cast their votes for and against lower unemployment in Australia. They will have the opportunity to support or oppose the government's further stance on unfair dismissal. They will have an opportunity to oppose or support our attempt to further entrench the rights of 225,000 young workers in Australia.If the Labor Party votes against both of these measures, the Labor Party will be voting to increase unemployment in Australia. If the Labor Party votes against these measures, the Labor Party will be voting to condemn tens of thousands of young Australians to the unemployment queues of this country.</DOC>

 - Indeed I do recall giving such an undertaking. I then called the office of Mr Morris, the member for Newcastle, on a number of occasions on the following day to try to get the information which he promised to send to me. He subsequently put out a press release and, attached to it, was a single piece of paper - the bill from a single funeral director. He did deliver the press release to my office. As I promised in my undertaking, Prime Minister, I sent it to the Treasurer. - My God, you are a clever little lot, aren't you? Undertaking and funerals - that is really very good. Nine out of 10 for you.So I did indeed send it to the Treasurer's office and the Treasurer has indeed sent it to the ACCC to be investigated, all in accordance with my undertaking and the comments I made thereafter.</DOC>

 - When the government released its tax policy and sought the endorsement of the Australian people in the last election, it made it entirely clear that this was a policy which was on a timetable for full introduction as from 1 July 2000. Indeed, we set out on page 31 of the policy the timetable and process for reform, indicating quite clearly then that the government would in January 1999 commence the private health insurance initiative. I am pleased to say that the government has. We indicated that in the first half of 1999 we would enact legislation to broaden the indirect tax base and repeal  wholesale sales tax and that the personal income tax cuts and the new broad based indirect tax would commence from 1 July 2000. That was the timetable that was laid down in advance of the election, and the government seeks to do no more and no less but to deliver on time, in full, for the Australian people.I noticed yesterday that there was a suggestion from some of the senators that they would not be in a position to finish the debate and vote on this legislation by 30 June 1999. I would like to actually table in the House of Representatives a press release from Senator Meg Lees dated 24 November 1998, in which she says:Democrats Leader Meg Lees has successfully brokered an agreement on a Senate inquiry into tax reform.She said that the elements of it are a select committee of seven members, separate inquiries by three reference committees, a guaranteed start to debate on 19 April and `a fixed sitting pattern for the first half of 1999, moved by the government.' She said:This provides a possible 84 hours of debate before June 30th according to figures provided by the Government. Previous debating `records' are Telstra (29 hours) Workplace Relations (48 hours) and Native Title Amendment Bill (56 hours).I formally table that media release in the House of Representatives. As Senator Lees said on 24 November 1998, she had brokered an agreement for 84 hours of debate, beating every single record for a debate in the Senate since the start of Federation. In addition to that, the four inquiries which were established according to Senator Lees's timetable in December have until April to report, which means four inquiries going nearly four months each - more than 52 weeks of Senate inquiry, more than a year of Senate inquiry, which is longer than any other Senate inquiry in the history of Federation. It is 84 hours of debate, longer than any other debate in the history of Federation.You can imagine the government's surprise to hear the suggestion yesterday, on 15 February, some three or four months before the debate is scheduled to conclude, that some senators may not be in a position to vote. The  Australian Labor Party has made it clear that it is going to vote against everything, so it does not need any time to open its mind or consider Senate inquiries. The Australian Democrats are hooked on their own agreement for the longest inquiry and the longest debate in Australian federal history. As for this side of the parliament, this side of the parliament says that we intend to deliver in full what the Australian people were promised. All of the palaver that is going on in the Senate at the moment boils down to one proposition: that the Australian people should have income tax cuts taken away from them. On this side of the parliament, we intend to deliver income tax cuts in full, on time and on budget. This side of the parliament is determined to make sure that, when the Australian people are promised income tax cuts, they get those income tax cuts. There is one way to deliver that, and that is to pass in the Senate what the government put to the people.I see that the member for Dickson is quite vocal in this debate. She is a former Democrats economic spokeswoman. -  - No, there were such things, Mr Speaker. After the 1993 election, when the Labor Party promised before the election not to put up any taxes, she led the Democrats to vote with the Labor Party to break their promise. How much more important would it be for the Democrats to vote with the government to keep a promise? This is a government which wants to deliver to the Australian people deserved income tax cuts. They voted for income tax cuts and, if the government has its way, they will get income tax cuts.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hinkler for his question. In the last election the government advanced, as one of our policy proposals, that we should provide a fairer deal for small business in respect of unfair dismissals and we are entitled, under the Workplace Relations Act, to move to implement a regulation to achieve that objective. It was also part of our policy that we would act quickly - that this was an issue which required a determined, resolute government to get on and start to fix some of these fundamental problems. For that reason, prior to Christmas, under the auspices of the Workplace Relations Act - which was, of course, supported in the Senate, supported by the member for Dickson, a Labor Party frontbencher - we were entitled to provide that exemption and so a regulation was enacted, brought into being.When the Labor Party vote down that regulation in the Senate, they will not be just voting down a proposal; they will be taking the black letter law of the country today which provides a benefit to small business - which is a law in operation today to encourage small business to give people a job - they will be taking an existing federal law, and throwing it out for the benefit of the trade union hacks that they respond to and which are so heavily represented by those on the other side.This is a sensible proposal in conformity with international conventions, provided for by the Workplace Relations Act and which we know would genuinely provide real opportunities for people to get jobs with small business. The consequence of this was very neatly summarised by Helen Hughes in an article recently. In effect, she said this policy approach of Labor was saying to small business, `If you have a choice between giving a person a job or investing in new equipment, go for the new equipment every time' - because the policy position advocated by the trade union movement, and just repeated here by their lap-dogs on the front bench of the Labor Party, is against the interests of small business.The fact is they do not really have their own policy; they have got the trade union policy. Why don't they have their own policy? Because they are split amongst themselves about the future direction of workplace relations policy. The Leader of the Opposition says, `Let's have a policy review,' but of course he said before Christmas that by not one jot or tittle would they change Labor's approach to workplace relations.We are now seeing the splits within the Labor Party splinter right across the factions. We had, for example, a very entertaining piece written just a few days ago on 12 February in the Daily Telegraph by the member for Werriwa, which had a shot at one of his left-wing colleagues, the member for Grayndler. He said this about one of his policy proposals:Talk about a confused politician. The establishment of a big government bank would destroy the  prospects of successful community banking in regional Australia.So they are fighting over that policy. Laurie Brereton, the member for Kingsford-Smith, is attacking the former foreign affairs minister - another split - and we have also got Senator George Campbell running a proposal for shorter working hours and that has been attacked by the member for Melbourne. Talk about a confused politician: they are a confused opposition, a split opposition, devoid of any leadership.</DOC>

 - Absolutely not. I will not make any such concession because you have provided no evidence that that is the case whatsoever. -  - If you had listened to my last answer last week, you would know that I did tell you that in October the year before last the Australian Health Technology Advisory Committee said that the government should fund MRI. I started consultations with the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists in December 1997. I had specific authority from the ERC to go out and negotiate because the overall package was a savings measure for which we needed the cooperation of radiologists. Whenever I was asked, from the time of the AHTAC report in October  1997 up until the announcement, I would say privately that we would attempt to fund MRI. It was well known and well expected and did not require any inside knowledge.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. We all recognise that the honourable member is a hard worker on behalf of the rural constituency of Eden-Monaro. We also recognise that the Carr Labor government are having a meeting there today trying to pay a bit of lip service to the rural community in Eden-Monaro after they have basically closed down the forestry industry in New South Wales.The question the member has asked is a very important one because the farm sector knows very well the benefits that have already flowed from the sound economic management of the first Howard-Fischer government. A lot of difficult decisions were made in that first term of our government which resulted in a much better fiscal position and outlook, particularly with regard to the budget surplus that has been put together. The best part about it was that it produced six consecutive interest rate cuts resulting in the lowest interest rates in nearly 30 years. What that means to the farm sector is $550 million worth of savings on interest per annum. From the good economic management of this government, the farm sector is saving $550 million every year. That is $550 million that can be put into retiring debt, reinvested in new infrastructure on the farm property or used to alleviate other difficult circumstances that they have faced over the years. That is a direct result of the sound economic management of our government.But to get to that point we had to fight the Labor Party every inch of the way. They opposed every single measure that we went to put in place to achieve those interest rate cuts. They blocked every single one. And that was  on the back of their interest rate regime of the late 1980s and early 1990s that pushed interest rates way above 20 per cent and saw a lot of farm families having to leave the land because they could not cover the interest rates that the Labor Party drove to those high levels.For the future we are proposing a tax reform package which the Labor Party are again opposing. We are putting forward a tax reform package that will see $880 million worth of benefit annually to the farm sector. And they are not just our figures - they are the figures of the NFF. They are the figures the NFF put out in a release when they made their submission, and I quote:The NFF's submission accepts the Government's claim that the package would remove $880 million of costs . . .Every year a further $880 million worth of savings to the farm sector on top of the $550 million that they are already benefiting from because of the interest rate cuts. But what are the Labor Party doing? They are opposing them. They opposed the changes to improve the economic management of Australia and they are opposing the tax reform package that will see these benefits go to rural Australia. The Labor Party are opposed to any benefits going to rural Australia. The Labor Party are opposed to industrial relations reform which will see a much better circumstance for rural Australia, particularly with regard to unfair dismissal.People in rural Australia should not forget the fact that, over the last three or four years, at every opportunity the Labor Party have opposed what this government has been doing to improve the circumstances of people operating in rural Australia.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition clearly does not get it, but I suppose he is judging things by his own standard in government, which in this area was absolutely abysmal. The fact is that this was a savings measure. This saved money. If you have a look at the budget there was a positive and negative side. We would never have got the radiologists on board for the cooperative approach that they have taken to help us in other areas unless we funded MRI, which quite frankly should have been funded years ago and has disadvantaged many Australians.When the whole thing is in place it will be seen that what we have done is something that very few other countries in the world have ever been able to achieve: we have introduced a new technology in a cost controlled manner. I would think that 403,000 scans would be about right because we are planning on about 120,000 a year. I am advised as of last week that, even in the worst case scenario, which is 20 per cent increase in the number of scans per month, every month, for the rest of the year, we will come in under 120,000 scans this year. We will spend less than has been budgeted this year. So the fact is we have introduced a new technology in a way you were never capable of. We have brought radiology, pathology and general practice expenditures under control in a way you were never capable of doing, by working with the profession.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. We have three state Labor governments. Two of them have lodged submissions with the Industrial Relations Commission on the living wage case. They make very interesting reading, I must say, about the approach and attitude of those state governments towards current economic management and to the Workplace Relations Act and the reforms that we have introduced. In fact, I think it would be fair to say that, unlike the federal Labor Party, who can do nothing but entirely praise everything that the ACTU does, the two state Labor governments have to deal in the real world. Whilst both submissions contain an assertion of support for the ACTU, I must say that the ACTU has a case of damnation with faint praise.The New South Wales government says that it supports the ACTU claim, but then it argues that the commission should alternatively `grant the maximum increase that is consistent with the economic material'. In other words, if you do what is economically responsible then you will soon throw out the ACTU claim. The Queenslanders are not quite so subtle, I have to say. They say that they support the ACTU claim but, in the same sentence, they go on to say:. . . but only on the basis that the commission should consider the claim on the merits in the light of the good economic performance during `98 and economic forecasts for `99.Queensland Labor argues that -  - Mr Speaker, if it helps you, the submissions have been made public and  are simply a reflection of the publicly stated policies of the respective governments. The Queenslanders say that, as a minimum, the commission should adopt the outcomes of last year's decision. So much for supporting the ACTU - go back to where the commission was last year!In what would have to be an embarrassment for the federal Labor Party, the Queensland Labor government's submission also then goes on to provide us with an endorsement of the federal coalition's economic management. Just to take a couple of aspects, they say that, amongst other things, the chart shows the positive movement of labour productivity, especially in the latter part of the 1990s. Why would that be? It is because we have introduced significant reforms. We are actually getting a benefit, and even a Queensland Labor government can see it. They then say that, with the possible exception of unemployment, the available public economic analyses indicate that the national economy is sound and performing within acceptable parameters. Treasurer, take a bow, because that is the Queensland state Labor government reflecting on your economic management.What do they say about the Workplace Relations Act? They say:The Workplace Relations Act 1996 focuses on the need to create a framework of cooperative workplace relations which will promote economic prosperity and enhance the welfare of the people of Australia.I could not say it better myself. - Thank you very much, Prime Minister. Then they say:In short, there is to be a focus on developing a mature workplace culture at the Australian workplace which encourages employers and employees to take primary responsibility for their working arrangements and which leads to formalising those arrangements through agreement making. In a sense, the process of agreement making can be said to be a manifestation, at least in part, of a maturing workplace culture.I take that as a compliment. That is exactly what we are doing and I have a Queensland state administration saying so. Then they say that there appears to be a renewed growth in the pace of agreement making under the  Workplace Relations Act. They are dead right - of course there is. What is the federal Labour Party's policy? They want to put a halt to agreement making and go back to elements of the previous centralised system.The fact of the matter is, I would say that Peter Beattie has been talking to the member for Dickson in writing a complimentary report on the Workplace Relations Act. I thank her for whatever part she has played in it. It demonstrates again, on an absolutely key issue - namely, the wages of hundreds of thousands of Australian employees - that the federal Labor Party is riven by division. It has no policy position other than what the ACTU dictates. It has adopted that now; it is not to be changed one jot or tittle. Labor is simply to respond to the ACTU's agenda. As the Queensland Labor Party shows, at least they are in part in touch with reality. You are out of touch, you are behind the scenes, and it is time you undertook the major policy revision which your ex-frontbencher and your current frontbencher require of you.</DOC>

 - I can give the member for Kingsford-Smith one assurance: this government will always stand up for Australia's interests. We will, of course, lobby in support of our interests and we will obviously do so in a principled way. We will not do so in an unprincipled way. This issue is of concern to the government, and we make no apology for our determination to lobby to ensure that there is an appropriate outcome in the World Heritage Committee's consideration of the whole issue.You can rest assured that we will do all we possibly can to get an outcome that is in the best interests of those jobs that would be created for Australians from this project. Off the top of my head, I think the figure is something like a thousand jobs in the Northern Territory. The Labor Party obviously does not support those thousand jobs, despite all the crocodile tears they shed over the issue of unemployment - and they are indeed crocodile tears.The answer to the question is quite simple: we will do what we can in a principled, constructive but determined way to promote our national interest. But the House may be interested to know that it is now 531 days since the member for Kingsford-Smith has asked me a question. I congratulate him - in 1997, no questions, and in 1998, he did it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for his question and for his support for this program and also for the very different but equally excellent Green Corps program. I am aware of differing views about Work for the Dole, in particular the view of the member for Batman, who said last week that this program was a poll driven stunt. I do not, for a moment, doubt his sincere desire to help the unemployed, but he should not use young job seekers who are doing the right thing by themselves and their community as a political football, because this an excellent program which is getting better all the time.I am advised that some 40 per cent of Work for the Dole graduates have proceeded to unsubsidised work or to further education and training, and this compares very favourably with much more expensive programs under the former government's Working Nation program. I am advised that 85 per cent of participants report that the program has helped their determination to get a job.  Eighty-three per cent of employers, according to Morgan and Banks, say that Work for the Dole increases participants' chances of gaining permanent work. So on this issue, the member for Batman and the Leader of the Opposition are the last of the Bourbons, railing against a world that has changed.In Australia, a form of work for the dole first appeared as the Community Service Scheme, which the coalition took to the 1987 election, at much the same time as Professor Lawrence Mead, in America, was developing notions of responsibilities to match welfare rights. Since then, many others have caught on. Just last week David Thompson, of Jobs Australia, said:. . . in principle, the idea that people in receipt of benefits . . . having some obligation to help themselves, there's no argument at all with that principle.Michael Raper, the head of ACOSS, said:We have no problem with the concept of mutual obligation. Indeed, we too feel that mutual obligation ought to be expanded.And then none other than the member for Werriwa wrote on Friday the week before last:The Federal Government should invest heavily in a major expansion of mutual responsibility. . .              . . .             . . .That is why the old welfare system - that is to say, Labor's welfare system - was failing. Because it gave money to people for being inactive, it actually worked against the best interests of the disadvantaged. It was slowly destroying the people it was supposed to assist.That is what the member for Werriwa thinks. If the Leader of the Opposition was at all serious about rebuilding Labor's policy from the ground up, he could demonstrate that by immediately inviting the member for Werriwa to return to the frontbench.</DOC>

 - This gives me the opportunity to correct the years 1999 and 1998 for the two years I mentioned in my earlier answer. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade operates in Australia's national interest, and it is our national interest that the Jabiluka mine is able to proceed. I said, in answer to an earlier question, that I thought a thousand jobs - from memory - would be created by this project, and I see that I was right. But, over and above that, an estimated $12 billion will be earned from this mine for Australia - $12,000 million.The honourable member for Kingsford-Smith thinks there is something wrong with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade developing a strategy to ensure that this perfectly legitimate, safe, and properly considered project be kept off the world heritage in danger list. We are absolutely determined to prosecute this case, as I said earlier, in a principled, but determined, way. As we do when we lobby for Australian interests, and as we did during the climate change negotiations, we will promote Australia's interests with a considerable degree of energy and - I very much hope - success. We have nothing to apologise for, nothing to be ashamed of, and there is absolutely nothing unprincipled about promoting Australia's national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, which gives me the opportunity to again reinforce the initiatives that Centrelink is taking to ensure that its services are provided to all Australians, including those in rural and regional areas. At least 100 new services will be established over the next few weeks, including 74 newly appointed agents. There will be a range of other services as well to comprehensively add to the network of facilities that Centrelink offers to make contact with its clients so that people are able to access government services. This government has done more than any to ensure that services in rural and regional Australia match as widely as possible what is available in the cities.Centrelink recognises its particular responsibility as the service delivery agency on behalf of the government to ensure that its services are available not just in the capital cities but also in the small towns, including the small towns in the honourable member's electorate. I welcome the representations I have received from members in country electorates who are conscious of the importance of ensuring that their constituents have access to these services in a personal way. That is a part of Centrelink's new service model - the way in which personal contact can be maintained with the six million clients whom the organisation serves. This extension into rural and regional areas marks a major advance in ensuring that all Australians have access to government services.</DOC>

 - The government's policy in respect of the no disadvantage test has been established in the Workplace Relations Act and I think the arrangement we put in place is very fair and reasonable. It has been accompanied by charging the commission with the responsibility to also look after the interests of the low paid, particularly in the living wage case. The fact is, when you compare what we have done in the last three years with what Labor did over 13 years, you will see that during our government people on low incomes, in particular, have enjoyed a far more benign economic environment than Labor was ever able to put in place. Labor's record was the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression. - In the three years we have been in government, we have seen an increase of five per cent in the real wages of people who are low paid and a wages system with the commission having responsibility for looking after the interests of the low paid. In conclusion -  - I have been asked what our intentions are. Our intentions are to continue to look after the interests of the low paid. In respect of the specifics of our policy, unlike the opposition, we had a forward looking progressive policy, which we announced in the last election, and that is the policy we will be implementing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is a substantially more intelligent question than the previous two questions I have been asked in question time, not that that would be difficult. - There are indeed elections in Indonesia due to be held on 7 June. These free and fair elections are critical to ensuring stability of Indonesia and enabling that country - the world's fourth most populous country - to become a true, open, liberal democracy. Through the Australian Electoral Commission, Australia will provide technical assistance to Indonesia for the preparations and for the conduct of the election. The commission has so far identified some broad areas of initial Australian assistance: electoral administration, including support for the identification of sites for registration and polling, ballot production and distribution, polling station layout and configuration and results compilation. The commission has also identified assistance to domestic monitoring groups to facilitate development and adoption of a common monitoring methodology.It is the view of the government, in the light of the importance of these elections not just to Indonesia itself and to ASEAN but also to Australia, that Australia should provide additional assistance over and above the assistance I have identified. Further proposals will be considered, including with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), which has the carriage of international assistance for these elections.We have also sought support for the UNDP effort in Indonesia from the United States, the European Union and Japan. I know that the  United States and Japan and I also hope the European Union are going to provide considerable assistance to make these elections not only successful but also to ensure that Indonesia becomes the world's third largest operating democracy.</DOC>

 - It is interesting to see the shadow minister's interest in Norfolk Island and its educational system. I am aware of the press release issued by Greenwich University. That press release contains a number of incorrect statements. It is incorrect to say that my department was fully informed and involved in the process leading to the establishment of Greenwich University.I understand that in the period during which Norfolk Island was responsible for the establishment of Greenwich University in Norfolk Island, there were some inquiries of my department at an informal and junior level. I am not aware of any significant documentation relating to Norfolk Island in my department. -  - As a consequence, it would be quite inaccurate to say, as the press release says, that the establishment of Greenwich University was under active consideration by my department. There was no decision to be taken -  -  - in relation to Greenwich University. My department was not required to give approval or otherwise for  the establishment -  -  - As I said yesterday to the House, the minister responsible for education in Norfolk Island has requested the Ministerial Council on Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to consider giving approval to Greenwich University to operate on the mainland of Australia. In the course of considering that application, the Commonwealth and other states and territories will be satisfying themselves or otherwise that the procedures are in place to ensure the quality of the courses offered by that institution. However, I repeat my advice and caution to students relating to Greenwich University that if they are proposing to select courses at that university they should ensure that those courses are of quality and will provide them with the kind of instruction that they are seeking.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his excellent question, because I know how concerned he is about people who will remain at home and need means of communicating in the event that they perhaps take a fall or have some crisis. Accordingly, the government has introduced a trial `safe at  home' initiative in which we are investing half a million dollars with 13 organisations across Australia. They will focus on 270 individual Australians who will benefit from this trial. The trial is designed to have this help in place 24 hours a day for 365 days of the year. It is a very important trial, and I might add that this is in addition to the $280 million over four years that is being committed to the stay at home package. We in the government believe that the quality of life for individuals who need help in their home is better when they are able to stay home with access to care that may be able to be brought to them. And we believe that the evaluation of this trial will be an important new development in allowing more Australians, as they age, to remain in their own home with dignity and independence.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The member for Dickson has been very fond of trying to claim in this place in recent times that things have never been worse at CASA, that she has no confidence in CASA, and she apparently believes that we all ought to be thoroughly concerned about the way things are in aviation safety in Australia. The member for Dickson has evidently forgotten the years of the previous Labor government. No, she was not part of it. - I think it is really quite relevant to consider that in the seven years that Labor oversaw the Civil Aviation Authority - before they replaced it with CASA - they had four different chairpersons. - Four different chairpersons in seven years, four different chief executives and six heads of safety regulation. Quite frankly, the shadow minister wants to take us back, it would appear, to those sorts of days of instability. Aviation safety is an extraordinarily important area -  -  - Issues like airspace management are, by definition, extraordinarily complex. There are from time to time professional differences of opinion about how they might best be taken forward, but the areas of agreement -   -  - If I can conclude, it will be short and sweet. The fact is that something as sophisticated and technically complex as airspace management does sometimes result in a difference of views about how it might be best executed, but the things that Australia's aviation safety leaders agree on far outweigh the areas of difference. I see no reason at all to move from my clear statement of support for the people who are responsible for aviation safety in Australia, including Dick Smith.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Latrobe for his question. That study does reveal some very interesting statistics. As the member says in his question, we have seen quite a jump in the number of firms with no unionised employees. In fact, in one year alone it went from 88 per cent to 91 per cent - that is over the 1995-96 period - which, I must say, does speak volumes about the relevance of the trade union movement, particularly within the small business community.The political consequence of that is that we have 52 per cent of the frontbench on the Labor Party side who are ex-trade union officials but, in the vast mass of the small business community, people who once were in unions are getting out of unions. Why are  they getting out of unions? They are getting out of unions because they are irrelevant to what most employees and most small businesses are trying to do - that is, work sensibly together to try to improve their business so that they have more take-home pay, more profits in their business and more investment in expanding their business, thereby generating growth in the Australian economy.The fact of the matter is that, on this whole issue of unfair dismissal, we have yet another symptom of the problems within Labor's ranks, and that is that they are so overwhelmed by the trade union interest they are simply incapable of understanding the circumstances facing small business, the demands on small business and what we as a parliament need to do to encourage small business.In conclusion, the Australian workplace industrial relations survey might point to one reason why some people have been leaving unions. That 1995 survey showed that a sense of insecurity is more prevalent amongst unionists than non-unionists regardless of which sector they are employed in, and that workplaces with union delegates were relatively more insecure than those without. My advice is that this is largely a result of the negative attitudes presented to workers by unions, which is the old traditional `them versus us' attitude. I suppose it is also the case that in some of the unionised industries we have had historically high levels of industrial action.It is a good point that the member makes in his question, and that is that the trade union hierarchy today is virtually irrelevant in the small business community. Therefore, the explanation for Labor's disinterest in small business is that 52 per cent of their frontbench, and something like 17 or 19 of the 20 senators to join the Labor Party in recent years, have all been trade union officials or ex-party secretaries. They are unable to see the national interest. They are certainly unable to see the interests of small business and, as a result, they are opposed to sensible measures which would help create jobs.</DOC>

 - The government has a variety of approaches and policies for reducing unemployment in Australia. The first and most important policy is to maintain a high level of economic growth. I am proud to say that under the government I lead Australia's economic growth is world class. Australia's economic growth is ahead of virtually every other nation. Thanks to the extremely good stewardship of the Australian Treasury by my  colleague the Treasurer, we have a level of economic performance in this country which is the best for 25 or 30 years.The major way in which you generate jobs is to have a strong and growing economy. One of the ways to maintain a strong and growing economy is to constantly be at the task of continuing reform. That is why we remain committed to reform of the Australian taxation system. That is why we have reform of the Australian labour market. That is why we are removing the work disincentives in the welfare system. That is why our tax package eliminates poverty gaps. That is why we are trying to take the burdens off small business by further reforms to our unfair dismissal laws.But over the last 24 hours in the Australian Senate the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have resolved to destroy 50,000 Australian jobs. The Australian Labor Party, by voting down the unfair dismissal law, has sent the message to the Australian small business community that basically it does not believe in small business, that basically it is prepared to burden the Australian small business community with an unfair dismissal law which, although better than the one we inherited in March 1996, is still inadequate.The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats will have another opportunity in a short period of time to vote to save the jobs of 230,000 young Australians because we are seeking to entrench in the law of this country the maintenance of junior wages within the award system. It is the view of the retail industry, which is a major employer of young Australians, that if that entrenching does not take place, if that measure is not passed into law, then the job security of 230,000 young Australians will be lessened. I cannot believe that a party which has always said that it is concerned about unemployment, that always says that it is concerned about the young, would be prepared, on top of what it did in the Senate last night on the unfair dismissal law, to vote against the measures relating to youth wages.I have just one message for the Australian Labor Party on this, and that is that every time employment figures come out in this  country the Australian public will be reminded that the Australian Labor Party last night voted to destroy 50,000 jobs in the small business community in Australia.</DOC>

The ACCC activity is part of what was detailed in the course of the election campaign. I stand by that. I might add that every day the Labor Party delays the passage of the tax package is a further kick in the guts of our exporters, doing it hard enough on a very unlevel playing field, because you are delaying a benefit for our exporters.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. There is no doubt that the small business community has repeatedly called for a fairer deal. Whether it is by independent surveys or surveys carried out by the employer organisations or whether it is just talking to people who are actually running their businesses, they are saying right across the Australian small business community that if they had a fairer deal they would go out and create jobs. The action of the Labor Party last night has cruelly dashed the hopes of literally tens of thousands of Australians who look to the parliament to provide a system which will give them a chance of a job.I am asked whether or not this measure is consistent with international standards. Even the ILO recognises the real need for small business exemptions. Article 2 of the Termination of Employment Convention 1982 plainly allows for exemptions based on the size of an enterprise and exclusions based on a probationary period of a reasonable duration. It is a pretty important point, because this whole unfair dismissal fiasco put in place by the Labor Party was legislated for on the basis of the ILO conventions. The whole justification of Labor's policy was that this was the international standard and they were going to foist it on the small business community. If you reckon that the ILO convention establishes a reasonable standard for Australia, why is it that when it comes to the interests of small business you disregard the very convention which you used as an argument for this whole fiasco in the first place?Yesterday, as the Labor Party was knocking these exemptions out, including the filing fee and the probationary period, we found out that in New South Wales the union movement was once again pulling the strings of the Labor Party. In a quite amazing decision, the minister, Mr Shaw, has announced that, in respect of applications for unfair dismissal, if you are a non-unionist you have got to pay the filing fee but if you are a unionist you are exempt. This is disgraceful discrimination, and it is just another example of a Labor Party frontbench doing what it is told by trade union bosses. Who ends up paying the price for this disregard of the national interest? It is the very unemployed that you would claim otherwise to be attempting to support.Jeff Shaw has got his preselection because of what the unions say, because of the unions' control in the New South Wales Labor Party, in exactly the same way as the New South Wales trade union movement controls the preselection of so many of Labor's frontbenchers and backbenchers. As Bob Carr said in respect of electricity privatisation and the ETU, `I have had lunch after lunch with the appropriate delegates from the ETU, but the union's leaders are putting their own jobs and superannuation before me and the best interests of the state.' That is yet another example. When it comes to good policy, the fact of the matter is that the Labor Party frontbench, whether it is New South Wales or federal, do what the unions tell them. The people who pay the price are those people who are today trying to run a small business or the thousands of unemployed who have had their hopes cruelly dashed by your policy failure.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am aware that a task force prepared a report for the Primate of the Anglican Church of Australia yesterday in relation to the government's tax package. As would probably be known, at least going back to 1993 the church has strongly opposed tax reform. But I welcome the fact that I think this probably represents the most open statement to date by the Anglican Church and by the churches generally of support for tax reform in this country. The news release which was put out by the Primate of Australia was headed `Anglican Church says yes to GST but questions adequacy of compensation package'. The statement says:The Anglican Church of Australia generally supports the Australian Government's goods and services tax initiative and other reforms to the taxation system.We welcome that as a positive contribution. The Australian Labor Party, of course, has a closed mind on tax reform. If there is one group in Australia that will oppose every reform, it is the Australian Labor Party. So I welcome the fact that the Anglican Church says that.The subcommittee was divided on the question of whether or not GST should extend to food. It did not in fact find that GST should not apply to food. It divided on the question. It then went on to say, as the government says, that compensation for tax  changes is necessary. It raised a number of things that would have to have been done if GST were not applied to food. It raised the possibility of taking back income tax cuts. This government won't be taking back income tax cuts.It raised the possibility of increasing the GST rate from 10 to 11 per cent. This government won't be increasing the rate of GST. It said that the important thing was to make sure that there was adequate compensation - a point that this government completely agrees with. This government is going to be increasing pensions by four per cent. We are going to be introducing bonuses for aged persons to look after their savings. We are going to be increasing the amount of family allowance, lifting the means test and reducing the taper rate. We are going to be lifting the value of all allowances.After - what is it now? Since August of last year - some six months of every interested group in Australia going backwards and forwards through the government's tax proposal, they have not identified one demographic that will be worse off as a result of the tax changes. In fact, ACOSS found that all demographics, including pensioners, would be better off.This contrasts of course with 1993 when the Australian Labor Party, on the votes of the Australian Democrats, and it is their economic spokesman who is now a Labor frontbencher, hiked all indirect taxes in this country, including petrol taxes, and paid compensation of zero - not one single dollar - and took away income tax cuts, again on the urging and with the support of the Australian Democrats.These must be the only tax changes, at least in the last decade and probably for decades in Australian politics where there has been compensation - and more than adequate compensation. That is what makes this tax package different, and that is why the Australian public are entitled to have a new tax system, their income tax cuts in full, their increases in allowances and benefits; and every day that the Labor Party engages in cheap populist nonsense is a day they hold back a new tax system for Australia.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Cowan, I would say two things. I do not think I am the first, nor would I be the last, Prime Minister of Australia to have authorised some perfectly defensible expenditure in relation to furniture in my office or any other things. I would counsel those who sit opposite not to start going down the path of helping yourself to taxpayers' support. I would counsel you, friend, warmly not to do it. I would counsel you not to.In relation to the particularity of the question asked by the honourable member for Cowan, the refurbishment of the previous furniture was clearly deemed appropriate by the Joint House Department because I am advised that it commissioned a consultant's report in relation to the refurbishment of furniture that had been there for 10 years.The alternative which was urged upon me by those in the design integrity group of the Joint House Department - and I think one or two of those people are unhappy with my decision, not because of the cost but because of the style of the furniture - and which I inform the House I rejected would have cost $24,000 or more. I rejected it in favour of a cheaper alternative. It was not only $14,000 cheaper but I am very proud to say that it was Australian made.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question about the state of the economy. The opposition has not asked a question about the state of the economy this year. So I am very grateful that the member has asked me. The Reserve Bank bulletin released yesterday stated:The growth performance of the Australian economy exceeded most expectations in 1998. In a year in which growth in the world economy halved, and in which the economies of many of Australia's trading partners experienced large outright contractions, Australia's GDP grew, according to the latest data, at above its trend rate.To put this in context, we are living in a region which has gone through the largest financial contraction in our lifetimes. Outside of China, the whole of the Asian region is in recession or depression. The Australian economy not only survived recession, not only grew, but grew at above trend rate and became one of the fastest growing economies in the world.Today, the Westpac Consumer Confidence Index was released. Under the heading `Consumer confidence surges again', it states that the combined two-month jump in confidence - that is this month and last month - is the largest since October-November 1993, coinciding with Sydney's successful bid for the Olympic Games. The last high surge - about as high as the jump that the then Premier of New South Wales made when Sydney won the Olympics.Since this government came to office, inflation has averaged about one per cent per annum compared to 5.2 per cent per annum under Labor. I repeat: one per cent compared to a Labor average of 5.2 per cent. Productivity growth has been three per cent compared to 1.5 per cent under Labor. Real wages have grown by 2½ per cent under the coalition when the figure averaged 0.5 per cent under Labor. One of Labor's great successes in office was to depress real wages. That, of course, was one of its policy objectives. Employment has grown by 2.1 per cent and  nearly 400,000 new jobs have been created in Australia since the government came to office. - The shadow Treasurer interjects. He has been shadow Treasurer for four months -  -  - He has been shadow Treasurer for four months and he has yet to make a speech on the Australian economy. His colleagues can write a book faster than he can make a speech. - There we have the Count of Hotham, the Earl of Brand, the hereditary peers of the Labor frontbench. What do you have to do to get on in the Labor Party these days? Get born in the back of a Comcar, I suppose! He has not made one speech on the back of the economy. He has not asked one question on the economy in the course of the last two weeks. The Labor Party was forecasting before the election that there would be a recession in Australia -  - When this government came to office we said that the Australian budget should be brought back into surplus, and we were fought every step of the way by Labor. Every single step of the way, the Labor Party fought us in fixing the Australian economy. The good news is that they failed. They are trying the same tactic in relation to tax.

 - I certainly can tell you what the correct position is. I heard a report of a carping complaint by the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Carr, relating to the fact that the plan submitted by Mrs Lo Po' had not been signed. And it has not been signed for a very good reason: it is incomplete; it does not comply with the agreement signed last year.Let me say something about the timing. The last three plans have come in in the months of April, May and June. This year they have come in in February. Why on earth do you think that might be so? It could not possibly be, of course, that the Premier would want it to come forward before the election in March, would it? That would not be the reason that they brought it forward from the months of April, May and June as in previous years. -  - When I asked for the financial details that have to be provided under the agreement, which I received at 4.30 yesterday afternoon, I immediately checked. What do you think I found? I found $2.7 million missing. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition needs all the help he can get from you. As I said, what do you think I found when I had the figures analysed? I found that there was a missing $2.7 million - unaccounted for. Where do you think that money has gone? Would Mr Carr like to tell us? Did it go into another program? Did it go to the Olympics perhaps? Where did the money go? This $2.7 million is in addition to another $12.6 million that New South Wales failed to get for the older people of New South Wales and people with disabilities because they have failed to match the Commonwealth offers in the first  two years of this Carr government. In other words, under HACC agreements the New South Wales government has cheated New South Wales needy people out of $15 million worth of assistance. Where did the money go, Mr Carr?The answer is: don't carp that the agreement has not been signed - provide the information. Victoria managed to get the information in in time. Their agreement has been signed. I would simply say that perhaps Mrs Lo Po' could get a bit of help from Mr Knowles.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The short answer is that my approval of a master plan does not provide approval for any major projects such as a new runway. It in no way forestalls or prejudges any consideration of further matters in relation to the development of the airport, including matters relating to noise.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. He draws attention to a very significant feature of education in Australia, and that is that 70 per cent of school leavers in this country do not go from school direct to university. It is the view of this government that all these young people are entitled to a proper pathway from school to post school employment, education and training. As a result of the commitment of this government, we are now seeing increasing numbers of these young people going into school based apprenticeships and undertaking vocational education programs in schools.I am aware that there are alternative attitudes to the prospects of these young people. So far as the Labor Party on the other side of the House is concerned, there is no doubt at all that there is a massive blind spot which exists in relation to the 70 per cent not going on to university. This indeed was recognised by Peter Baldwin, the former member for Sydney, who made the point, `Accommodating the needs of those not intending to proceed directly on to university education in the final years of schooling is something that we did not do enough about in government.' All one can say is that looking at the Labor Party at the present time they have no intention of doing anything about it in opposition either. There has not been a single question about apprenticeships from the member for Batman, the shadow minister for training, since December 1977 -  - Well, probably since 1977, but certainly since 1997. I will give him the benefit of the doubt. The member for Melbourne, one of the two thinkers on the other side of the chamber, seems to share the blindness in this regard because in his 250-page book he devoted just one page to young people leaving school.I have to say that the member for Werriwa, in his 390-page book, managed not a single reference to apprenticeship training, which is of great importance to 70 per cent of young people. Members may well wonder why the Labor Party has this massive blind spot. It has this blind spot because the trade union move  ment has shown it is not interested in genuine training opportunities for these young people. - The interest of the member for Dobell in this matter does not seem to extend beyond Norfolk Island. This is the only issue concerning the education of these young people that he has raised in the House since the start of this year. The massive blind spot that the Labor Party suffers in this area is ultimately because every member on the other side of the House owes their preselection to the Australian trade union movement. They are a sectional party representing the interests of organisations which, when they were in government, sought to destroy the apprenticeship system. - Mr Speaker, I was referring to the lack of interest in this issue by those opposite - which I was asked about. The reason is that the union movement in Australia took an attitude -  - I was asked about alternative policies to the government's. We remember that in 1995 the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. Small and large businesses in this country want to help train young people in the skills this country needs. They will do so only when they have an apprenticeship system in place which is friendly to small businesses, which gives young people the opportunity to undertake the flexible courses that will allow those businesses to be competitive. The Labor Party and the trade union movement have consistently opposed this. That is because they are a sectional party. Because we represent all Australians and we represent young people, we are putting these constructive policies into effect.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. I know he has a very large veteran population in his electorate. I think this pilgrimage is of interest to members on both sides of this parliament. Prior to the last federal election, the coalition gave a commitment that we would be upgrading a commemorative area at Sandakan and also sponsoring a pilgrimage back to Sandakan-Ranau, the site of the death march in the Second World War.I am pleased to report to the House today that there is a $750,000 upgrade of the site at Sandakan which unarguably, I think, is the site of the worst atrocity in the Second World War where Australians suffered. I am also pleased to advise the House today that a pilgrimage will be sponsored and will take place next month to Sandakan-Ranau. That is sponsored under the government's Their Service-Our Heritage commemorative program.Mr Speaker, 1,800 Australians died in the death march, either in Sandakan prisoner of war camp or on the march to Ranau. There were six survivors. They survived only because they escaped the march and were fortunate, with local help in some instances, to survive. They were able to tell the nation and the world of the horror of Sandakan and  the death march. Unfortunately, only one of those six survivors is with us today. He lives near Brisbane in the electorate of the member for Longman. I have had the great privilege of meeting Mr Owen Campbell. He will be one of the members of the pilgrimage back to Sandakan, along with his wife.Far too few Australians fully understand some of the atrocities of war. That is why these pilgrimages are extremely important not only to us here in parliament but also to all Australians. I think they do create that awareness in our community. They keep alive the memory of those who lost their lives, those who suffered and those who still lie buried missing on foreign soil. It is a very important part of a government's responsibility to keep alive the memory and to remember the lives of those who did suffer.As I said earlier, the pilgrimage will include Mr Owen Campbell, the sole survivor of the death march. It will also include ex-prisoners of war. It will include the next of kin and widows of prisoners of war of Sandakan. I will be leading that very historic pilgrimage and it will be my great privilege to lead them back to Sandakan and Ranau next month. An invitation has also been issued to the shadow minister. He has indicated to me that, subject to his leader's approval, unless he nominates someone else, he will be joining that pilgrimage. I commend the history of Sandakan-Ranau to all members of this House and, indeed, to all Australians.</DOC>

 - In the last election, the government had a detailed policy which we released. - I am very happy to answer that question and, in fact, that is exactly what I was going to inform the House. Members will appreciate that when a government has a policy position we need to take that policy position and to transform the general policy, as outlined in the election, into a bill. It is public knowledge that the government intends to introduce a workplace relations amendment bill at some stage in the middle of the year - perhaps June or thereabouts. Obviously, we have been discussing how we will go about the implementation of the government's policy.In terms of what is our policy, the policy is as announced. Obviously, there are the usual processes of discussion about how we will ensure that that legislative package, when it is introduced into the House, reflects the policy position of the government. That is just a normal conventional process which we are sensibly going about.To answer your question further, last year we put out discussion papers - for example, on the role of the commission. We put out discussion papers on secret ballots. We have had submissions on those issues and we have had discussions on them, obviously, between me and my department. You would hardly expect otherwise.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for the question and for the close interest he takes in the Work for the Dole projects in his electorate. Based on encouraging early results, the government expanded Work for the Dole from a 10,000-place pilot scheme to 125,000 places over four years. I am pleased to say that further evaluation has confirmed the wisdom of that decision. Analysis of that  initial pilot program shows that 32 per cent of Work for the Dole participants have gone on to unsubsidised work or to further education or training at a cost of $3,900 per success.This compares very favourably with the Working Nation programs under the former government. For instance, the LEAP program had a 26 per cent success rate at the cost of $26,900 per outcome. The Jobskills program had a 30 per cent success rate at the cost of $36,000 per outcome. The New Work Opportunities program, which was really the flagship labour market program under the former government, had a 21 per cent success rate at the cost of $52,000 per outcome. It is clear that, compared with Working Nation programs, Work for the Dole is getting results which are significantly better for job seekers, and far better for taxpayers.Work for the Dole is not so much a training program as a work experience program, because this government believes that the best training for work is work itself. That is what the government believes, and that is what the member for Melbourne believes because the member for Melbourne said of the former government's Working Nation programs, `They led to perverse outcomes, with some unemployed people forced to undertake inappropriate and even demoralising training.'I have been asked why some observers are still undermining this scheme. The answer is quite simple: members opposite are slaves to the union movement and quite unrepresentative of the Australian people. Some 14 per cent of Australian adults are members of the trade union movement. The percentage of members opposite who are members of the trade union movement is not 30 per cent, it is not 50 per cent, it is not 70 per cent - it is 100 per cent. Every one of them is a trade union member because they are required to be by the Labor Party. - I was asked, `Why are some members opposite continuing to undermine this scheme?' They will never get anywhere with the Australian people while they believe in government of the unions, by the unions, for the unions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question in relation to waterfront reform. The 12 stevedoring companies which submitted restructuring plans by 31 December last year have in fact until 30 April to implement those plans and access funds provided under the government's reform package announced on 8 April last year. Two of the companies, Strang Stevedoring and Northern Shipping and Stevedoring, have qualified for redundancy related payments, and the details of those payments are now being settled.Stevedores were advised of that funding deadline in December. The clock is ticking. Those elements of the MUA which seek to continue to frustrate reform would be well advised, I think, to look to the longer term interests of their members. It is time indeed, I think, for some constructive action and commitment from the MUA. Too many jobs in the maritime area have been lost because reform has been opposed.With regard to stevedoring reform and the deadline to access funds, I believe we have been firm but absolutely fair. The government is not in any way threatening the parties: we are simply stating the facts. Our obligation is to see that waterfront reform is delivered as soon as possible, and that is to the very great advantage of this entire community.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for the question and for his interest in tourism. It is a recognition of a well-known trend in tourism that sports events and attractions get people to come to an area and to spend money in an area. That is something that the previous government of New South Wales recognised when it sought to get the Olympics, and it is something that the Victorian government has recognised in its pursuit of the Bledisloe Cup, the State of Origin, the Grand Prix and, now, the Commonwealth Games.As a federal government, we support those sorts of initiatives by state governments. We have not noticed any such initiative in recent times from the current New South Wales government. In relation to the Olympic Games, we have seen nothing from the Bob Carr state government in pursuit of event tourism. This government is spending in excess of -  - Whilst it is important to note that state governments do carry the risk for these games to make sure they are financially viable and successful, this government is spending in excess of half a billion dollars - that is half a billion dollars, Mr Speaker - to make sure that Australia  positions itself to gain the greatest benefit and the most successful image for Australia into the next millennium from the Olympic Games.The Commonwealth has already provided $150 million for games facilities and they are lasting edifices that will benefit the people of Sydney. We have seen the situation where the State of Origin between New South Wales and Queensland has in fact been played out in Victoria where they have a stadium with a capacity of 80,000 people. We now see New South Wales and Sydney finally getting a stadium which befits a city of four million people. We have also spent $25 million on the relocation of the RAS showgrounds to Homebush. In February 1996, we saw the Prime Minister commit the incoming coalition government to the remainder of the $135 million to the Olympic Athlete Program, and that is for our Paralympians as well as for our Olympians. -  - We are looking to see our athletes be more successful at the 2000 Games than they have ever been before. That is quite an achievement, given the medal tally that we got at the Atlanta games. We are also looking to give a $5 million investment into drug research and drug testing to catch any drug cheats at the 2000 Games. We are sending a very strong message to athletes that they are role models and that it is important that, if they think about taking drugs during the Sydney games, they will be caught. We are taking a very tough line on drug cheats.We expect overall from the Olympic Games to get an extra 1.6 million visitors to Australia because of the images that we can portray successfully overseas. We also expect to generate from those visitors $6.1 billion of additional revenue, and this will create 150,000 new jobs. That is something that even the opposition cannot carp about.I recently launched a $150 million campaign by the Australian Tourist Commission looking at how we market Australia. In addition to that, we are spending $7 million  to promote business links from the Olympic Games. We are looking at an Olympic visitor program and we are looking at a business links program where we will host an Incat catamaran in Darling Harbour and have a business club for international visitors to our shores who are looking to do business in Australia and formulating links for them. We expect to see a lot of spin-offs for Australian manufacturers in the sporting industry, as well as in Australian business. -  - This government is spending in excess of half a billion dollars to make sure that Australia positions itself in the best manner possible. We are looking at further issues of security, immigration, customs, media activity, defence and health care associated with the games. This government is really making sure that Australia positions itself very well in the year 2000.</DOC>

 - I begin by saying that I think the question is seriously pathetic. It is absolutely pathetic. This government, more than any other government since 1975, has been completely transparent on this issue of the Balibo Five. You would have thought that the opposition, which had 13 years in government to address this issue, would at least have the decency to congratulate us on our integrity over this difficult issue.For 13 years, you covered up this issue, then we continued an inquiry set up by the man condemned by the member for Holt. We have a further inquiry and we allow intelligence material to be examined, and you have the audacity to ask a question like that. The answer to the question is that we did endeavour to get all the reports to the relatives of those who died by the time the statement was made. Because of a courier company, which I think is called DHL, in one case in Melbourne -  - You see, it is just pathetic. People die, you spend 13 years in government  and do nothing about it, then you make the sort of childish interjections you are making now. DHL failed to deliver to a gentleman in Melbourne and failed on one other occasion. We have taken this matter up with DHL. We are obviously profoundly disappointed. These people have been contacted by my department. -  - I was determined that the families would get the copies. It is disappointing that in a couple of cases they did not, but they are perfectly free to make any remarks they like. But you stand condemned because you were part of that cabinet and you did nothing about it for 13 years, so let us not have any more cheek from you -  -  - or from this person here who was the defence minister through part of that time. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question, which goes right to the heart of the tax debate. It goes right to the heart of any findings by Senate committees. It puts into sharp relief the attitude taken by the Labor Party and the minor parties on the issue of taxation reform. Indeed, a recent analysis released yesterday, I believe, by Access Economics into Australia's indirect taxation system has found that a severe erosion of indirect tax revenue is in prospect over the next decade under the present system. Without fundamental change  now, Access finds that a $7 billion shortfall will emerge by the first decade of the next century. -  - It says:This shortfall will continue to rise thereafter as growth in services continues to outstrip that of goods, ensuring the indirect tax base continues to erode.It goes on to say:To keep revenue at its current share of the national cake, Access says that increases in tax rates would be required over the next decade.That analysis, of course, is in accord with the field evidence, as I might call it, that we had in 1993. The former government found it necessary, after the 1993 election, having won re-election on the basis of opposing a goods and services tax, to increase a whole range of indirect taxes.The reality is that, unless the fundamental reform put forward by the government is adopted in its entirety, there will be a further erosion of the indirect tax base. We will see pressure for increases in indirect taxes similar to what occurred in 1993. In the eyes of some, that would be no bad thing. Senator Lees, the Leader of the Australian Democrats, in an interview this morning, indicated that she is in favour of increased taxation. In answer to the question, `Does that mean we have to collect more tax?', she said:Well, that is a very good question. Indeed, the argument goes that the answer is if we want to keep the standard of services we enjoy now, the answer is yes.There is only one policy on offer that can guarantee to the states of Australia the capacity to provide the services that they need into the future, without imposing a massively increased tax burden on the Australian people, and that is the policy that I took on behalf of the government to the last election.I say again to those in the Senate who are delaying this taxation package, to those who would seek to defeat the verdict of the Australian people: listen to what the Australian people said; understand that unless we reform  the Australian taxation system, root and branch, we are condemned to an inadequate, second-rate solution that is going to deny to the Australian economy the full measure of the esteem that it should occupy, even above what it has now, in the eyes of the rest of the world.</DOC>

 - I can inform the House that the top priority of this government is to maintain the magnificent economic performance of Australia over the last three years and, in particular, to ensure that the full benefit of that economic performance is allowed to flow through to the Australian labour market. In terms of an individual policy, our top priority is to reduce unemployment. That is why, within less than a month of being appointed as the new minister responsible for employment, the honourable member for Flinders, the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business had written me a letter of some 19  or 20 pages outlining new ideas to tackle unemployment.I notice that the opposition thinks there is something wrong about this. I can say that I am proud to have a minister who cares about reducing unemployment. I am proud to lead a government that has policies to reduce unemployment. I am absolutely ashamed that we have an opposition which is prepared to destroy 50,000 Australian jobs by defeating the unfair dismissal laws and is going to vote against 230,000 jobs for young Australians.Let me make it very clear that there will be no retreat by this government from policies to reduce unemployment. We are about examining all of the proposals that are relevant to reducing unemployment. Of course those proposals will be assessed against the election undertakings that we gave both in 1996 and in 1998, particularly those undertakings in relation to entitlements under Australian workplace agreements being the same as under the relevant award. They will be maintained.Unlike those opposite, we are not afraid to have policies to reduce unemployment. We are determined, despite your obstruction, to further reduce unemployment. The benefit of the magnificent economic growth of the Australian economy should be allowed, without obstruction, to flow through to the men and women of Australia who want work but cannot get it. You will do Australia a great service if you join the government in fighting unemployment instead of engaging in your tactics of obstruction, delay and blind negative opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. The good news is that this government is absolutely determined to press on, to do absolutely everything within our power to support people - and they can wave that letter around as much as they like. I encourage it. I tell you what: more people are going to read my letter than will ever read the books from the frontbench of the other side. -  - While this government adopts an optimistic view about what can be done by way of constructive policy to help those people who are unemployed, as to what we can do to build the Australian economy, we had a very interesting glimpse into the negative `opposition for the sake of opposition' attitude of the Leader of the Opposition this morning on AM.  He was asked, `What is the Labor Party's attitude to try to boost productivity?' and he uttered these most incredible words. He said, `You know, I think we have gone as far as we can go, I think sensibly, in getting productivity out of contestability.' In other words, what he is saying is that, as far as the reform agenda is concerned, the oppo  sition went as far as it could by the time it lost office in March 1996.We know that because members opposite have opposed every sensible measure to boost productivity that we have introduced in the meantime. What an indictment on the Labor Party when it comes to major reform. It is a confirmation of the statement that he made before Christmas - his promise to the unions for their funding of his campaign back in 1998 - namely, that he would not change the industrial relations policy of the Labor Party by one jot or tittle as a result of the demands on him by not just the Labor movement but also the 52 per cent of the ex-trade union officials who sit on his frontbench.The fact is that productivity has been surging under us, and that is good. It is good for employees and it is good for our businesses. It means higher living wages and it means that we have been able to make inroads into the problem of unemployment.This week the Labor Party showed their true colours when they voted against yet another measure to try and create jobs - the unfair dismissal laws. I call on every small business in the country, every person who is unemployed and those people who are concerned about unemployment, to write to the Labor Party. They should write to Kim Beazley, care of Parliament House, Canberra, and tell him what they think of his obstructionist policies.I conclude by noting that the letters seem to have started coming in. One letter written to the Leader of the Opposition and copied to me was from a gentleman who said to Mr Beazley:Rather than firms such as ours employing more people, which we won't currently because of the threat of the draconian law you are defending, you seem to prefer to keep people, including the young, on the dole, unproductive and in a hopeless government-induced vacuum which says little for the future of this country and even less for yourselves.</DOC>

 - I have not discussed the matter with the Treasurer, but if you read the letter you will see that it was attempting to put together in a succinct way -  -  - Good. You should read it a few times and maybe you would learn something from it. The letter said that this was an idea that had been floated around some time ago. In fact, the letter said that that particular measure had gone to the government's tax reform task force back in 1997 and it was decided not to proceed with it. So rather than it being your idea, we had considered it and discarded it. We did not proceed with it - end of story.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. Mr Speaker, I am aware of proposals to expand the Work for the Dole program and to extend the mutual obligation principle. They are based on the fundamental attitude that you do not help people by pretending that the world owes them a living. Why shouldn't this government or any other government aim over time to eliminate sit-down money from the Australian way of life?The difference between the government and the opposition is that we are discussing the  pros and cons of policy amongst colleagues while opposition members are shouting at each other in public. The difference is that we do not use ideas as weapons in the leadership struggle; we do not think of ideas as daggers to plunge into the back of the party leader. - I have been asked about alternative proposals. This morning the Leader of the Opposition called for a return to the Working Nation program policies that his colleagues know were expensive failures. The member for Melbourne wrote, in his recent book:Labor MPs regularly encountered people who had done several courses and still had little chance of finding a job.I was curious about who these Labor MPs might have been who were honest in private but not in public. In his book, the member for Melbourne acknowledges a number of people for their comments, including the member for Grayndler, the member for Kingsford-Smith, the member for Rankin, the member for Jagajaga and the member for Perth. I am looking forward to their own honesty in future publications.I have also been asked to explain why there are these different approaches, and the explanation is not far to find. The truth is that members opposite are slaves to the trade union movement. If any proof is necessary, it comes in the form of a press release dated Tuesday from the member for Hunter, which says:The Caucus unanimously supported a motion of support for the CFMEU . . . The caucus unanimously supported the socialist aristocracy that believes in hereditary jobs for coalminers. It is very clear that this is a government of innovation and ideas and that that is an opposition dominated by party hacks and fading trade union dynasties.</DOC>

 - The fact is that the numbers of long-term unemployed have been falling over recent months, thanks to the policies of this government. The fact is that Work for the Dole is proving to be far more effective in helping the unemployed than the Working Nation policies pursued by the trade union hacks and heavies opposite. As I was able to tell the House yesterday, the Work for the Dole Program has a 32 per cent outcome rate at the price of $3,900 per success. The New Work Opportunities Program, which was the flagship of Working Nation, had a 21 per cent success rate at the cost of $52,000. So these people ought to stop criticising the Work for the Dole Program. They should stop treating these fine young Australians who are participating in it as a political football. They should stop treating people who are trying to better themselves as lepers. Most of all, they should give up their allegiance to the trade union movement.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. As the member for Deakin is aware, numerous research studies have shown that many job seekers have literacy and numeracy problems which prevent them from getting the jobs that they are seeking. For example, males with very poor literacy and numeracy skills have been twice as likely to be unemployed in their late teens compared with those with average or better skills.One of the lasting scars of the 13 years of the previous Labor government was that one-third of young Australians were coming out of school without adequate literacy skills. They could not read and write properly. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition, who was education minister for some years under the previous government, is personally accountable for this massive failure which lies at the heart of youth unemployment today. He not only left Australia with a deficit of $10.3 billion but he left 30 per cent of young Australians with inadequate literacy skills. He more than anyone else should take responsibility for this failure. The member for Melbourne must have been very ashamed when he wrote in his book, reflecting on those years of Labor government:One in five have not attained appropriate literacy and numeracy standards by the time they leave primary school.He said, quite correctly:These children are already struggling to participate in the day-to-day life of their schools. The struggle will be intensified when they leave school and look for work.The Labor Party abandoned a generation of young Australians. They did this because they are nothing more in the end than the mouthpiece of the bosses of the education unions, who fought for years to prevent literacy standards being established and who still oppose the testing of young Australians and the accountability of schools and teachers to parents. We have over there a party in which every member is a member of the trade union movement, where 52 per cent of the frontbench have been officials in the trade union movement and where no policy can be adopt  ed unless that policy is compatible with the ideology of the unions behind the party. That is why we have so many young Australians today who cannot read and write adequately. It has been up to this government to emphasise the proper values of mutual obligation in this community and to provide young Australians with the opportunity to pick up these literacy and numeracy skills.</DOC>

 - It must be a continuing disappointment for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that an idea which he thought was worth having was not adopted by the government. -  - Well, we understand his disappointment. But the fact of the matter is this government has got a tax policy and we are in the process of implementing that tax policy. And what do you do? You are doing absolutely everything within your power to prevent the implementation of a policy which would create real jobs. - Mr Speaker, not much further needs to be said. The letter says:In my view, while such a proposal has some merit, it would be more appropriate - while it has some merit - to consider it in the context of an examination of the so-called Five Economists' Proposal - which I have already referred to. If you look at the five economists' proposal and my analysis of it, what I basically conclude is that in my view it was not -  - I would conclude by saying we obviously had an analysis of the five economists' proposal, we were not enamoured by it and that was the end of the matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question. Yes, yesterday I did travel to Far North Queensland to inspect particularly the crop damage as a result of Cyclone Rona in that part of Australia in recent times. As part of that process, we took the local members - the member for Kennedy  and the member for Leichhardt - with us and, in a gesture of bipartisanship, the member for Corio.We had a rather extensive and exhausting day, but the people of North Queensland were certainly appreciative of the fact that we took the opportunity to go and have a look at the devastation that has been caused by Cyclone Rona to the crops in the area concerned. We saw extensive damage to the sugarcane industry in the Far North Queensland area. From 20 to 40 per cent of the crop has been damaged. Seventy per cent of the banana crop has been damaged and about 80 per cent of the pawpaw crop.We have maintained all along that we are providing assistance through the Natural Disaster Relief Fund from the Commonwealth. There were obviously a number of suggestions made by local growers in the areas that we visited yesterday which I will take up with my ministerial colleagues in discussions. Whilst we were there, there were also issues raised about comments from the Premier of Queensland. He has been making some suggestions on what the Commonwealth should and should not do with regard to disaster relief. We stick by the arrangements that we have in place - and the Prime Minister enunciated those last weekend - with the Natural Disaster Relief Fund. But we might also make some suggestions to the Queensland government that, if they want to be constructive, they might replace the $58 million that they took out of their budget, after winning government, from their emergency relief fund. They cut it from $158 million to $99 million. So Mr Beattie might just have a look at that area.There is an interesting point, which I should inform the House about, that arose yesterday. I have been speaking a fair bit around Australia about the prospects of improving access to insurance products for farmers generally in Australia so they can better manage their risks. And we found yesterday some innovative farmers in North Queensland, particularly the banana growers, who had actually insured their crops in a cyclone area against cyclone damage - an expensive exercise where one grower had indicated that it cost him $40,000  in a premium to cover his crop for $500,000. But the telling point that was made was that they have to pay an 8½ per cent stamp duty on that insurance. - 8½ per cent stamp duty. So on that $40,000 premium he is paying $3,400 to the Queensland government for stamp duty. Another suggestion for Premier Beattie: he might consider reducing or removing that stamp duty on that policy. I think the honourable members who travelled with me yesterday - the members for Kennedy, Leichhardt and Corio - and certainly the farmers in North Queensland were appreciative of the interest and concerns of the Commonwealth in the plight that the farmers find themselves in at the moment.</DOC>

 - I thought that part of the letter was a fair and reasonable statement. It is surprising that the Labor Party seems so infected by outrage at the statement. - Confected, thank you, Prime Minister. This was simply another one of many ideas floated which can be considered. It refers to the fact that the way the ABS collects statistics could potentially result in that. Why would we raise that matter? Firstly to be up-front about it in our own consideration of it and, secondly, because when you were in office for years you had a deliberate policy to hide the unemployed on make work  programs that did nothing for this economy. You spent billions of dollars. The $2 billion dollar man, the former ex-ACTU president, spent billions of dollars of taxpayers' money hiding the unemployed and providing no solutions to Australia's long-term unemployment. You talk about long-term unemployment. Do you know what worries us on this side? We inherited a lot of people who are long-term unemployed. We on this side are genuinely concerned at the way this economy is structured. As we have had a downturn the number of long-term unemployed has been ratcheting up and up and up.When you fairly read my letter you will note that I start by saying that Australia has an unemployment problem which we inherited from Labor but within that problem there are particular components which are of concern to us - young people, that is why we are doing something about junior wage rates; the long-term unemployed, which is the reason I raise it; and indigenous Australians, where I believe the level of unemployment is too high and we need to have a specific further consideration of what we can do to improve those circumstances. Don't you come in here and talk to us about concerns for the long-term unemployed. The Labor Party in office punished the long-term unemployed by running a system at the dictates of the ex-ACTU presidents which denied those people a chance of a job.We do not accept a censure of a government which is prepared to look at ideas. We say, proudly, that this government is prepared to look at any idea, to leave no stone unturned, to do the right thing by the unemployed - long-term or otherwise.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his sensible and constructive question. It stands in stark contrast to the smut we get from the other side.I will be visiting Indonesia from 23 to 25 February - that is next week - partly to participate in the Australia-Indonesia ministerial forum in Bali and also to hold a number of key meetings in Jakarta. I will be meeting with President Habibie and I also intend to meet General Wiranto, the Minister for Defence and Security and Chief of ABRI, and Amien Rais. I will also visit Xanana Gusmao under his new detention arrangements in Jakarta on 25 February. I have made clear to the House before, and I have made clear elsewhere, that Xanana Gusmao is a crucial figure in the resolution of the problems of East Timor. We have had considerable contact with him through our ambassador in Jakarta and I think it is appropriate that I call on him myself and discuss the future of East Timor, which is such an important issue to this government.So this visit will allow me while I am in Indonesia to canvass a wide variety of opinion on the future of East Timor and to advocate in person the necessity of ensuring an ordered, stable and non-violent process of transition in East Timor, whether the outcome is autonomy or independence.From Jakarta I propose to travel to Lisbon where I will discuss the future of East Timor with Portugal's Foreign Minister, Mr Jaime Gama, on 27 February. Given the quick evolution of events affecting the future of East Timor, Australia gives its full support to an ordered, peaceful and fair settlement of the East Timor issue. It is with this goal in mind that I have been meeting, and I continue to meet, a wide range of participants in the East Timor issue, including key East Timorese figures.</DOC>

 - We did put the letter out last night, as the member knows, and on that basis there is no reason for him to be paraphrasing it the way he did. -  - That was not a quote, was it? No. In respect of the panel idea, the commission has had panels for many years. The idea of a panel to draw together expertise for a particular issue is not a new concept. The idea of ensuring that the commission has available to it economic expertise is not new, either. In fact, that has been discussed and acted upon for many years. It was one of a number of ideas. I do not think it is a bad idea. - I advanced the idea because it is an option. It is very important that the commission, in making decisions, has regard to the economic consequences of those decisions. I would have thought anybody - even an ex-trade union official like yourself - might appreciate the point that when the decision is handed down by the commission it would add authority to that decision if people can see in a transparent way that it has been deliberated upon by those who have specific expertise in the area.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question because I know the concern that she has for older Australians in her own electorate, as indeed this government has for those right across the country. We inherited an appalling situation from the Labor Party, with 10,000 places short and an acceptance by the Labor Party of the substandard care given in various facilities  across Australia. Quite frankly, we had to fix it up.Basically, we have introduced increased capital and recurrent funding for rural and remote facilities. We have introduced a system of accreditation which will no longer tolerate substandard - and, indeed, appalling in some circumstances - nursing homes for older Australians. I have seen a number of criticisms that have come forward from some quarters which tend to indicate that it is going to be all too hard for people to meet the new standards. I say this: we fund the 135,000 people who need residential care to the tune of $3 billion a year - that is $3 billion dollars a year on 135,000 people. We fund those individuals in order that they may get the care that they require. Providers are the means of giving that care, but our business is not to prop up providers who do not provide proper care.So that people can see how well it is working, I would like to quote some comments from a letter from the director of nursing at a stand-alone rural facility - a 40-bed community run organisation in Deniliquin - which was published by the Aged Care Standards Agency. The director of nursing, Jean Booth, writes:Let me tell you what accreditation has meant for us. Staff have formed working parties and become committed to the process, seeking positive outcomes for their efforts - for example, a reduction in skin tears and falls; a reduction in back injuries due to a no-lift policy; a reduction in our workers compensation premiums; regular maintenance programs for equipment; and introduction of specialty areas for nurses, i.e. we have specially trained nurses responsible for a particular area, such as palliative care, pain management and dementia care.They did not employ a consultant. At the end of her letter, she says:It is important that other nursing home and hostel proprietors, especially those in the country, be aware that accreditation can benefit all concerned and the process of preparing for accreditation can be a rewarding and positive exercise.Those reforms that we have put in place, and in which the Prime Minister was so much involved, are proving to have a very positive outcome but, most importantly, they will get rid of people who are providing substandard  care and will mean that the taxpayer is getting a good outcome for the dollar expended.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. I am aware of calls for a bipartisan approach to reducing unemployment, most particularly the calls made by the member for Batman yesterday and by the member for Hotham this morning. How can members opposite seek unity between the government and the opposition when there is no unity inside the ALP? I have been asked about published views on which a bipartisan approach might be possible. I have a published view here from the member for Werriwa, who says:Unless the disadvantaged are willing to make an effort to develop new skills and take new opportunities, governments are wasting their time. Without effort - Says the member for Werriwa - there can be no achievement. That is the kind of view on which a bipartisan approach might be possible. I have another statement of the member for Werriwa, who said last year:I think what government needs to do is provide in-kind assistance to the unemployed and then basically have a system whereby after six months on the dole people are moved into a community based form of work.That is the kind of statement on which the government might be prepared to offer bipartisanship. I have a statement here from the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr. He said of the Labor Party:I have had a gutful, I have had enough of the Labor organisation, I have had enough of head office, I have had enough of the trade unions. If I could press a button and get -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. If Bob Carr had any strength, he would act on this statement. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Bob Carr would act on that statement and he would end the kind of mindless allegiance to the union movement that the Labor Party has shown.  - The first requirement for bipartisanship is honesty, and what we need from members opposite is an honest appraisal of policies rather than cheap populism. The second requirement for bipartisanship is a bit of give and take. You cannot demand bipartisanship unless you are prepared to give it. Mr Speaker, if those opposite want bipartisanship, they have three opportunities to prove that they are serious: they can pass the Telstra bill, before the Senate; they can pass the unfair dismissal laws, before the Senate; and they can pass the tax package. If they are not prepared to offer bipartisanship, they cannot demand it. The fact is that, unless they are prepared to do something like this, their call for bipartisanship is a cheap populist stunt.</DOC>

 - I assume that the advice of Mark Textor to which the Leader of the Opposition is referring is the research that was appended to the letter that was written to me by the newly appointed Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business outlining a whole menu of proposals to be looked at for tackling the ongoing problem of unemployment. Can I again take  the opportunity of congratulating the minister for writing to me. Less than a month after he has the responsibility he is in there with 20 pages of ideas, and this mob over here are attacking him. I could be so lucky to have a minister who is so determined to do something about unemployment.I want to say to the House that you want ministers who care, you want ministers who are dedicated, and I am lucky that I have a whole frontbench of ministers who are prepared. I have a Treasurer who is prepared to overturn a budget deficit of $10½ billion; I have an education minister who is prepared to tackle the problem of literacy and numeracy; I have a foreign minister who has been responsible for bringing about a historic change in policy by both Indonesia and Australia towards East Timor - I have a foreign minister who was prepared to do it; I have a magnificent health minister over here on the left; and I also have some magnificent marginal seat winners on the frontbench. -  - Mr Speaker, I certainly am coming to that. Of all the things that I am indebted to in this House, I am indebted to  the opposition. I really am indebted because I am asked a question about double standards. I am asked a question about taking sides in industrial disputes. The whole of the opposition personifies taking sides in industrial disputes because of their irretrievable links to the Australian trade union movement.They talk about nobbling the Industrial Relations Commission. I remember 1991 when Bob Hawke was still the Prime Minister of Australia and Bill Kelty, of course - and it seems he has been forever - was the secretary of the ACTU. Talk about heredity; he has a lifetime peerage with the ACTU. In April or May 1991, when the Industrial Relations Commission brought down a finding that was unacceptable to the then Labor government, both the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, and the then secretary of the ACTU bitterly attacked that decision. They said it was unacceptable to the trade union movement. They not only nobbled the commission; they also nobbled the Hawke government of the time into defying that particular decision.The Labor Party comes into this parliament and talks about partisanship, but you supported the nobbling of the Industrial Relations Commission. - The Leader of the Opposition by his interjection allows me to -  - Mr Speaker, the question was about partisanship in industrial disputes. It invited me to respond to some research by Mr Mark Textor. Can I say that I have some experience with Mr Textor's research. I will tell you what: his research is not too bad, either. He has a reasonable track record, Mr Textor, and there are a few people around here who rather like it.I have also had experience with something else - that is, I never rely on quotations of  somebody else delivered from the other side, so I will go and have a look at what he actually had to say before I accept the Leader of the Opposition's version.If ever a party had no authority to talk about partisanship in industrial relations, it is the Australian Labor Party. They personify one side of the argument. They personify a blind commitment to class warfare. They personify a political party that is bound hand and foot to the dying trade union movement of Australia.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, at the end of a good fortnight for the government, it is a pleasure to announce, in response to the question by the member for Mallee, that, in addition to several ministers going to Indonesia and Singapore early next week, I will go on to make important bilateral visits to India, Iran and elsewhere.Why is it important? It is important because South Asia has been a particular priority of mine. As Minister for Trade, I have helped facilitate trade, investment and tourism over the last 2½ years in that direction. Australia's 11th largest export market today is India. Our second largest market for coking coal is India. Therefore, I am very pleased to say I will be co-chairing the Australia-India Joint Ministerial Commission in New Delhi at the end of next week.We will reflect on recent marketing openings for exporters of citrus, pears and peaches, which I know are major priorities for the member for Mallee and other members, including the member for Hinkler, and on expanding and diversifying our export efforts to the world and increasing jobs as a consequence.In Iran, of course, it will be a case of being the first Australian cabinet minister to visit there since 1992. It will provide a priority and  focus to building bilateral relations between Australia and Iran. It will build on the grain exports and also wool, dairy products and other breakthroughs which have been secured in recent times, and ensure further expansion in that trade effort.The Australian export effort today is a very diversified one. Full marks to our exporters ranging across services from information technology to the aviation arena with a focus on the `airshow downunder' - an excellent exhibition of Australian product which is taking place over these few days. I hope to get there on Friday. As Minister for Trade, why would I not go to this magnificent exhibition of Australian product?I simply want to say at the end of this fortnight, dominated by headlines of `ALP at war' - especially in proximity to Avalon up the road from Melbourne - we finish with the case that Bob Carr wobbles, Brumby giggles, Beazley blusters, and we get on with the job.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. I might start my answer by informing him that unemployment amongst women in Australia is now at 7.2 per cent, the lowest it has been since 1990. Far from the policies of our government reducing the work opportunities for Australian women, in fact, because of the strength of the Australian economy - and let me thank and compliment the Treasurer for the outstanding job that he has done in relation to economic management - the opportunities for women to gain work in Australia are growing stronger every month.If you have a strong economy, you have the capacity to generate jobs for both men and women. The foundation of job growth, the foundation of economic security for both men and women in Australia is a strong economy. I can assure the House, and it is borne out by the evidence of the last three years, that opportunities for women in the work force have expanded under the policies of this government. It is demonstrated not only by the level of the participation rate but also by the fact that at 7.2 per cent the unemployment level amongst Australian women is the lowest it has been for almost nine years. -  - Somebody interrupts - I think it is the member for Dickson - about wages. - It was the member for Jagajaga: I apologise to the member for Dickson. But the point is still valid that women's full-time total earnings including overtime increased by 4.2 per cent in the year to December 1998, which is 0.3 per cent of one per cent ahead of the increase for men. Let me conclude by saying that the opportunities for women and, very importantly, the choices available for women in Australian society over the last three years have been greatly expanded. I am very proud of the pro-women policies that the government has pursued.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for that question. Very importantly, the most effective way to improve employment opportunities for young people - indeed, the most effective way to improve employment opportunities for both men and women in Australia - is to run a strong, growing economy. It is something that we have been able to achieve consistently, and to the enormous credit of this government, over the last three years. I am delighted to remind the House - and the question from the member for Curtin allows me to do so - that growth in the Australian economy in the year to December 1998 was a remarkable 4.7 per cent. That figure is the most dramatic evidence of the success that this government has had in protecting the Australian economy against the worst effects of the Asian economic downturn.The youth unemployment rate under the former government reached a high of 34.9 per cent. The current level under the present government is 24.1 per cent. As honourable members know, those figures will vary from month to month but there has been an improvement between those two figures. But a great deal more needs to be done. It is in these areas where the government's will is in the right direction but the obstruction of the  Labor Party and others in the Senate is impeding further progress.We saw a few weeks ago the Senate's rejection of the government's unfair dismissal proposals. That meant the destruction of a potential 50,000 additional jobs within the Australian community. But the Labor Party will have an opportunity to redeem itself by allowing the passage through the Senate of the government's legislation that will protect junior wage rates in this country. If they can be entrenched - according not to the government or the Liberal Party or the National Party but according to the Australian Retail Association - age based youth wages, which our legislation is designed to promote, will protect the jobs of 230,000 young people in this country.We often hear from the Labor Party that action ought to be taken in this or that area. They have an opportunity in the Senate to take some action to protect the jobs of 230,000 young men and young women in this country. I hope that the Labor Party on this occasion will put aside their selfish, obstructionist tactics and vote in favour of a piece of legislation that is going to protect the jobs of almost one-quarter of a million young Australians over the years ahead.I am particularly proud of the way in which we have expanded the opportunities for new traineeships and new apprenticeships. At 30 September last year, there were 199,400 new apprentices in Australia. And commencements were at record levels of over 123,000 over the last 12 months. In other words, we have a great record in building opportunities for greater employment of young Australians. If the Senate would do its duty by the Australian people, there would be even brighter prospects for young Australians in the employment market.</DOC>

 - I will take the last point first. If many of the policies being advocated by the minister for employment were in fact implemented, there would be more jobs at higher levels of pay for Australian women. So let us not have any of this ridiculous proposition that, in some way, by clinging on to the Labor Party's approach to wages you produce higher real incomes. The undeniable fact is that over the 13 years that you were in government real wages suffered very badly. One of the reasons why we have a consumer boom in Australia at the present time is that Australian wage and salary earners, both men and women, have more money in their pockets. They have more money in their pockets because their real wages have gone up, and they have more money in their pockets because their interest rates have gone down.Nothing can take away from the double bonus delivered by the Howard government - that is, real wages are up, interest rates are down. When you combine that, what you are doing to both men and women all over the country is giving them additional purchasing power. If the Senate takes a different, more constructive attitude, if we are allowed to implement further reforms to Australia's industrial relations system, those opportunities will be further expanded.The only fear that working women in Australia have is of going back to the policies of the Australian Labor Party because those policies denied them the stable economy, the falling interest rates, the rising employment opportunity, the rising real wages. -  - You don't like it, but the reality is that Australian women, under Labor, had to suffer the highest interest rates since World War II; that Australian women, under Labor, did not enjoy real wage increases; that Australian women, under Labor, were given plenty of rhetoric and plenty of slogans but they were delivered high interest rates, falling  real wages and declining employment opportunities. I know you don't like it, but under us they have had lower interest rates, rising real wages and expanding choices, both in relation to work and their other responsibilities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forrest for his question. I think all members of the House will welcome the fact that December's national accounts show that the Australian economy in the calendar year to December 1998 grew by 4.7 per cent. That was growth in excess of Britain, France, Germany, the G7, the OECD and the United States. It was the fifth quarter in a row where growth in the Australian economy exceeded one per cent. And this was growth at a time when Asia was going through its deepest recession ever. When Japan, Malaysia, Korea, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore and New Zealand were in recession, Australia grew by 4.7 per cent. Last week's Economist  had this to say:Last year Australia was one of the rich world's fastest growing economies with GDP growth of 4.9 per cent while New Zealand sank into recession. Australia's economic figure has taken most forecasters by surprise. Australia is famous as the lucky country but its economic resilience owes more to policy than to serendipity.Then the Economist  goes on to set out the measures that have protected Australia during this severe international downturn - the measures which have kept inflation low, which have allowed us to cut interest rates to as low as they have ever been in Australia. Unemployment has fallen, and the floating of the Australian dollar and the flexibility in relation to that has protected our exporters. I want to pay tribute to Australia's exporters who, in this difficult environment, have managed to divert exports to growing areas of the world and have made so much difference to this country.The national accounts confirmed an inflation rate of 1.6 per cent. Since coming to office, under this government inflation has averaged one per cent. Under Labor, inflation averaged 5.2 per cent. Since coming to office, productivity growth under this government has averaged 2.8 per cent. -  - Under Labor it averaged 1.5 per cent. -  - He always yells the loudest when he is in the most trouble, Mr Speaker. He read Glen Milne's column this morning and he thought he had better come in and yell louder. He saw Laurie Brereton out there attacking his leadership and he determined to yell in this question time. Under the government, real wages have averaged around 2½ per cent per annum compared with 0.5 per cent per annum under Labor. Retail trade growth in January indicates that the Australian economy continues to grow.Having said that, I point out that the Asian financial crisis is not over and we would be foolish to think that we could stop now. We have successfully navigated the first 18 months of the Asian financial crisis but now is the time to lay the groundwork for future growth. Now is the time to get a new tax system for the growth opportunities in the next decade. Now is the time to reform industrial relations for the job opportunities in the next decade. Now is the time for the Australian budget to be kept in surplus and for debt to be reduced. Just as it was the decision three years ago that protected the Australian economy and gave it its opportunities today, so it will be the reforms of today which will give it its opportunities tomorrow. They are the reforms which this government intends to put in place.</DOC>

 - The evidence before the Senate committee that the member refers to is evidence put to it by the Australian Education Union. Of course, as an ex-union official herself, it falls to the member to bring that evidence to the attention of the House. It is no wonder that the Australian Labor Party is confused over the effect of the GST. Under the GST, education is of course GST free. The evidence of the Australian Education Union is completely misleading. That evidence overstates the impact of the GST on price increases and on families' disposable incomes. It does not take into account that most of the education services will be GST free.The Australian Education Union does not allow for the inefficient state and territory financial taxes that will be replaced by the GST. That was completely left out of the analysis. Of course, these taxes currently affect the price of all goods and services in Australia, including school uniforms. Also, the Australian Education Union double counts the effect of price increases when commenting on the GST's impact on families' disposable incomes.The fact is that the tax reform package contains a number of measures that compensate families for the effects of the GST. The average family, as members of this House will know, will be some $40 to $50 per week better off as a result of the reforms, including the income tax reductions, after allowing for the effects of the GST. Any political party that is foolish enough to rely on the evidence of the Australian Education Union, that stands around waiting for the briefing notes from the union to make a point, that does not have any independent capacity to analyse these factors, deserves the contempt and ridicule of the public that it gets. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. The government is moving to retain the system of junior wage rates which Australia has had for a long time. We also want to extend that system, at the discretion of the Industrial Relations Commission. - You believe in the commission. We simply say that the commission ought to have the discretion to widen the use of, and to make more available, junior wage rates. You ought to support that, but of course you don't, in a typically knee-jerk reaction to what is a sensible proposal to create jobs. -  - The other thing you are opposed to is that -  - We want to retain the system. We want the system to be available in those awards where it is not at the discretion of the commission, and we want the commission, in making decisions about this, to take into account not just the interests of people who have a job. We reckon that the interests of the people who are unemployed, particularly young people, should also be taken into account.There is a very stark choice for the parliament. You are either for jobs, in which case you will vote for the legislation or, alternatively, you are against the creation of jobs and the protection of jobs, and you will vote  against it. As the Prime Minister has already said, this measure is about protecting existing jobs. Tens of thousands of jobs are at risk if this legislation is not passed. But it is also a vehicle and an opportunity to create jobs by the insertion of junior wage rates in those industries that do not have them.We have had some numbers done. My advice is that in the building industry alone, to take one example, more than 6,000 jobs for young people could be created in that industry if this legislation were passed. The fact is that, as usual, the ACTU are opposed to this measure and they are dictating policy to the front bench on the other side. They even have the backbenchers asking questions which are obviously drafted by the Education Union.I ask the House to consider the practical implications of the ACTU's position. For example, they say that, with the end of age discrimination, an 18-year-old ought to be receiving a wage increase of $130.55. I ask people to think of the practical implications. The Labor Party's position is, if you put up the wage of an 18-year-old by $130.55, that not one job in the country will be jeopardised as a result. It defies commonsense to be saying to employers, `We will put up the wages of an 18-year-old by $6,500 a year, plus the oncosts, and we, the Labor Party, say that that will make no difference to your intentions to hire young people.' Regardless of your ideology and regardless of the dictates of the ACTU, surely the Labor Party front bench can understand that, if you put up the wages of 18-year-olds in the year 2000 by $130, then a lot of them are going to lose their jobs.I say, if the Labor Party do not understand that point, then those young people who have jobs today will certainly understand it. The parents of our young people will also understand the practical implications of a huge increase in the cost of employing young people, which we say, as a matter of commonsense, is going to destroy the job prospects of tens of thousands of young people. As a nation, we already have a problem with youth unemployment. The Labor Party's policy position is to make it worse, when there is a golden opportunity for this  country to provide job opportunities for young people.This issue will come to a head very shortly. There are those within the Labor Party and the Democrats who think this issue can simply be adjourned for some months. That will only heighten the levels of uncertainty among employers in the business community about the cost involved in employing young people. A resolution to defer this is simply going to cost many young people job opportunities. We believe that young people ought to have the chance of a job and we are determined that they have it.</DOC>

 - What this line of questioning absolutely fails to recognise is that those opposite do not want Australians to be aware of the reality that they have not been able to demonstrate anyone who will be worse off as a result of our tax reform. -  - The reality is that transport costs will be reduced very significantly as a result of our tax reform. The reality is that the changes in tax circumstances and benefits that elderly people will enjoy will enable them a boost in their lifestyle opportunities. The question is an absolute absurdity.</DOC>

 - One thing which did echo through to Teheran and New Delhi last week were some of the bomb blasts within the ALP: Whitlam versus Brereton, Whitlam versus comrade Barry Cohen, and then various other connotations which I know I cannot dwell on. - Where is your shadow minister for foreign affairs? Has he gone back to Gosford? - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I now see the shadow minister for foreign affairs on the back bench - more to come. I travelled with my ministerial colleagues to a pretty hectic set of meetings in Singapore, Denpasar in Indonesia, then on to India, to Iran where I was the first minister to visit in seven years since Minister Gareth Evans visited Teheran, then on to Dubai and to Turkey. There were four specific outcomes which pick up on the theme of the Financial Review  editorial last Saturday which said, `We have to look beyond an East-Asia only strategy.' Well welcome to the club! The Prime Minister has been arguing for that for years, and it has been the policy of the government for years to do exactly that, to pursue diversification of our export efforts.So I am delighted to have brought to the House and to the member for Riverina, who pursues issues with great vigour on behalf of her export constituency, that in India I was able to sign an investment protection and promotion agreement, to help rerail the relations with India, to set up a working group on wool and wool exports from Australia and to help bring about the inauguration of quarantine dialogue between Australia and India. While we will not agree on everything  with that bilateral relationship, we are absolutely committed to the commercial trade, investment and tourism links between Australia and South Asia and between Australia and India.In Iran, I was pleased to help facilitate, with Trevor Flugge and other members of the Australian Wheat Board, this latest member of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation - the sale of 1.3 million tonnes of wheat in that direction - and reflect on the changes which are taking place in Iran, some would argue not enough but, nevertheless, the changes under President Khatami - and I was pleased to be able to meet with him. Finally, in Turkey, amongst other things I was able to reflect on the value-added product Australia is now exporting. I was able to travel on an Austral ferry on the Bosporus for about 40 minutes - that is about the maximum DFAT would ever schedule you to do anything that might possibly be enjoyable on one of these trips, as opposed to the hard yards - which they should quite properly involve - of about eight ministerial meetings a day. I report this to the House: in respect of that value-added product, there was nothing but praise for the -  - I am pleased the Leader of the Opposition is dismissive of the efforts of Austral, a Western Australian exporter of great effort. I report to the House that there was nothing but praise for the ferry exports. That direction was also pursued by Bob Clifford in Argentina. I report further to the House that the main wheat importer into Turkey said to me:Turkey grows 20 million tonnes of wheat but we still want half a million tonnes of Australian wheat because of its quality, because it is delivered to specification and because it acts as a very good blend.It was a constructive visit of six countries in 10 days and one which helped diversify our export effort.</DOC>

 - Let me say that practically everything that Mr Crosby says is accurate, particularly when he engages in election advertising, I would have thought. The truth of the matter is, as we have made entirely clear in relation to governments, that governments are not required to apply GST to non-commercial services. What is more, governments are entitled to get back, as input tax credits, those taxes which they have paid for the purchases of goods and services. It is one of the reasons why the cost of government is dramatically lower under the new tax system, one of the reasons why people will be able to get better services, because if you have a better tax system which gives them input tax credits and if there is no liability in relation to their non-commercial services, that is good for local government, it is good for state government, it is good for Commonwealth government and it is good for the Australian taxpayer.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. He, alongside many other members of this House, is intensely interested in the changes that are taking place in Indonesia and, of course, East Timor. The honourable member asked specifically about the issue of reconciliation. It is an opportunity for me to tell him and the House that this government regards the process of reconciliation amongst the East Timorese as  the most fundamentally important task that has to be undertaken. One of the key messages, if not the key message, that we must try to get out from Australia is a message of encouragement of that process of reconciliation between the pro-integrationists and the pro-independence forces in East Timor. Not surprisingly, this was one of the key messages I delivered to Xanana Gusmao and also the pro-integration groups while I was in Jakarta recently. I am seeing Mr Ramos Horta today and I will be making the same point to him that, for us, the first and greatest priority is the process of reconciliation amongst the various groups in East Timor.We have also made it clear to a number of people in Indonesia associated with the East Timor question that we are happy to help with that process of reconciliation. Indeed, last week, some of the pro-integrationists asked our ambassador, John McCarthy, when he was in East Timor whether he would be able to help with this process. I was delighted that Xanana Gusmao was able, during the weekend, to meet with some of the pro-integrationists - and I do think that is a very important step towards the reconciliation that we hope will be achieved.In East Timor, regardless of the outcome of the consultative process, there clearly will be winners and losers. If it is that the people of East Timor choose independence, then the pro-integrationists will, naturally enough, have to be given appropriate guarantees. They will want guarantees: guarantees for their security, guarantees for their property and guarantees for their lives. I know that people like Xanana Gusmao are happy to provide those guarantees and, whichever way the consultation goes, we would encourage the winners to guarantee the security of those who are not successful in the consultative process.Finally, the honourable member asks me whether there are any alternative views on this question of East Timor. Suffice it to say, there are many alternative views on this question, and all of them are held in the Labor Party. There are numerous views in the Australian Labor Party on this question, and all I can say is that some of those views, such  as those of the member for Holt, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, are sincerely held - and I was impressed with what I heard of his meeting with Xanana Gusmao last week and with other Indonesian officials - but some of those views, it has to be said, are not so sincerely held. After all, the member for Kingsford-Smith went for 809 days, between 1996 and 1999, without asking anyone in this House a question on the issue of East Timor. If it was such an enormously important issue, such a matter of great passion, why would he go 809 days without asking a question about East Timor?</DOC>

 - I cannot recall that particular statement, but I have no doubt that I said it. I was probably John Symond's greatest publicist when he was reducing interest rates, because he was providing great competition to the banks. Let us recall the great competition to the banks and what it has given to Australian home buyers - under Labor, a 10.5 per cent variable mortgage interest rate; today, a standard variable I think of 6.4 per cent. You can go under six per cent for your home variable mortgage interest rate under a coalition government - the lowest standard variable mortgage interest rate since man walked on the moon. - Mr Speaker, I did not say that at all. As a cursory examination, if the member for Hotham were not yelling so loudly, I said it in relation to my own quote, not in relation to Mr Symond's. Of course, you can have a look at the Hansard . -  - If you did not yell, my friend, you would hear and learn. - I am quite prepared to perform the educational service - GST free to you! In relation to Mr Symond -  -  - You're yelling again, Simon. - You should try listening, my friend. I know it has been a bad period. - The point I was making was that, under this government, I think standard variable mortgage interest rates have come down by more than four per cent and in relation to introductory loans and the like I think by about five per cent or more. I congratulate Mr Symond for the work that he has done. I think Mr Symond in his evidence talked about an effect of 0.2 per cent or 0.25 per cent out of five per cent. - I will go back and have a look at it. As I recall, it was .25 per cent - after a five per cent reduction in interest rates. Mr Symond wants a GST to be applied to financial services - something that you totally  oppose. I recall you getting up here at the dispatch box and asking question after question on whether or not GST should apply to financial services and saying what an outrageous thing it would be if it did. Now you get up and you say, `Would you not be criticised by Mr Symond for not applying it to financial services?' You cannot have it both ways, old son. You are either against it or you are in favour of it.In relation to financial services, let me make the point that in no country in the world does GST apply to financial services. The Australian bankers and some operatives in the Australian financial services industries would like Australia to be the only country in the world applying a GST in relation to financial services. The Europeans have not done it, the Asians have not done it, they have not done it in East Europe, they have not done it in West Europe and they have not done it in the Americas. We made it entirely clear, as I said to you in my answers at the time, that we would not be doing it. Firstly, we do not believe that Australia should be the only country in the world to do that. Secondly, you cannot carve out value-add in financial services from other costs and interest rates. That is why it has not been done anywhere else in the world. Australia is following world's best practice in relation to financial services and in relation to world's best practice for GST generally.The big benefits are these. If you secure the revenue base, which means for average Australians the government has a revenue base that grows in proportion to the economy, the government will be able to honour its obligations in relation to pensions and education and in relation to hospital services. But it can also do one other thing: it can raise its revenue in a much more efficient way. It can cut income taxes, it can get a better taxation system, it can have a more vibrant economy and it can make sure that it sets Australia up for the opportunities of the future rather than the failures of Labor's past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question, and I have good news. Australia is on the threshold of becoming the greatest share-owning nation in the world - 5.5 million Australians either directly or indirectly own shares on the Australian Stock Exchange. This is the second highest level in the world after the United States, which has 43 per cent of its population owning shares. In Australia, we need 370,000 new first-time shareholders to become the greatest share-owning nation in the world. We are well on the way to doing that, because over the last eight months three-quarters of a million Australians became first-time shareholders. The average parcel of shares over the last 12 months has been $6,600, which means that Australians are starting to put their money into stocks and shares, investing in the companies that they deal with.The benefits to Australia are profound, adding depth and liquidity not only to the Australian economy but also to the Australian share market. Today, Australia stands as the largest share market in the Asia-Pacific region outside of Tokyo. We are larger than Hong Kong and we are larger than Singapore. This has primarily come about because of the strength of the Australian economy, and much of the good work has been done by the coalition over the last three years.In particular, increasing retail share ownership helps to add depth to the Australian share market. Five to six years ago you would find that institutions were dictating the price of shares before they went to market. Today, because of the large number of mums and dads in the share market, retail investment is driving the value of Australian shares before they go to market. The net result is this: with the initiatives of the coalition in relation to the GST package - and particularly the abolition of stamp duty on the transfer of shares, which is part of the GST package before the Australian parliament - we can become the  greatest share owning nation in the world. But it goes one step further. It will take one vote of the Labor Party to make us the greatest share owning nation in the world. You should support the sale of Telstra in the Senate. You should support it because that is a great indication of Australian share ownership and a great indication of what it means to provide opportunities to Australian mums and dads to invest in the companies that they deal with on a daily basis.</DOC>

 - I will answer that question. There is of course no error in the revenues applying to the GST. What the Insurance Council is arguing for - and presumably you are supporting it - is a more preferential treatment. Presumably you are supporting it, are you? You are presumably supporting the insurance industry. Here we have an industry which supports tax reform but says, in relation to one of the transitional measures, that it would like more generous treatment. So who do you think rides in for the more generous treatment? It is the people who reckon they are absolutely opposed to tax reform. - There is an answer. There is no error, and the argument is about a transitional issue. If you just bear with me, I can explain to you what the transitional issue is. The transitional issue is whether or not you should get an input tax credit for payouts where the event is before 1 July 2000. The second part of the transitional argument relates to what is called the unearned premium reserve. The Insurance Council of Australia seeks more beneficial treatment in relation to both issues.The Insurance Council of Australia does not oppose a GST. It supports it. What it wants is a more beneficial treatment so that, in relation to those two transitional issues, the insurance industry gets a better deal and consequently the revenue - and everything that is supported by the revenue, like the hospitals, the schools and the education system - gets a worse treatment. So if you want to ride to the defence of the Insurance Council on this transitional issue, you ride to the defence of a more generous treatment at the expense of some other part of the tax system. Let us be clear about this: it will be at the expense of some other part of the tax system. But of course the Labor Party could never actually rise above cheap, populist politics on this to actually grapple with the issue.In relation to both of those issues, denying input tax credits for pre-GST events is consistent with the principle that generally no input tax credit should be given where the service has not borne GST, and applying GST to unearned premiums is consistent with applying GST to any service provided after the implementation of the GST. The treatment in relation to the Insurance Council is consistent with the treatment of other industries. It is an argument by the Insurance Council to be given more beneficial treatment. If you are to adopt it, you could perhaps explain why you think other parts of the Australian economy, such as pensioners, health or hospitals, should be worse treated. But you cannot have it both ways. You cannot engage in absolute open  populism if you pretend to be a political leader or ever aspire to office.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I can tell her that the government is most assiduous in protecting Australia's interests - particularly with its immigration program - by ensuring that those people who are in Australia lawfully as visitors but do not have permission to work and those people who are here unlawfully and who ought to have left Australia, cannot take job opportunities away from young Australians. As part of our ongoing efforts, we have been quite comprehensively ensuring that where reports are received by us or where information is obtained by appropriate and lawful data matching means, compliance activity follows.We spend something of the order of $50 million a year on compliance activities. You could not maintain an efficacious migration program unless you were prepared to put into compliance the sort of effort that we are currently making. With those activities we have seen an increase from about 7,000 people who were located about three years ago when this government came to office to an increase of over 12,000 locations in the last financial year. Those numbers of locations are significant, because it is estimated that at any one time there are somewhere between 50,000 and 55,000 people who may be unlawful in Australia.A range of compliance activities have brought to light people working in contravention of visa requirements or people unlawful. In January and February it was of the order of 2,000 people who were located. I am sure members have seen some of those reports covered in the press. As a result of  those activities the government has determined to review the program of the former government that involved employer awareness education, to see how efficacious those arrangements were. We have also agreed to have a review undertaken as to employer sanctions and whether or not there ought to be changes in that regard. Some of the arrangements that I am aware of that have been undertaken, for instance in the United Kingdom, have involved employers being freed from the possibility of prosecution if they are able to demonstrate that they undertook some fairly simple inquiries at the time they engaged an employee. It might be the production of a birth certificate or a citizenship certificate or the keeping of a copy of a visa that included permission to work. It seemed to me that those sorts of arrangements are worth while looking at.There have been some misunderstandings, I think, in the tourist industry about some other proposals that I have indicated might be the subject of examination. I have made it very clear that the government supports the tourist industry and has been anxious to increase the number of people coming to Australia bona fide - that is, they have an intention of paying a visit to Australia and leaving at the conclusion of that visit. We do have something of the order of three million people visit Australia now each year. About 80,000 people apply who are rejected for entry. Where those rejections occur for proper reasons - and usually it is because we have an expectation that somebody may not be intent on obeying the visa conditions - sometimes representations are made, often by members of this House, often by families of people who may want to come. Some of them even offer to pay a bond to ensure compliance if such visits were to be allowed. I have indicated that the review might be able to look at those arrangements.I was surprised that the tourist industry was unaware that arrangements of that sort are already in place in Canada, have recently been considered and introduced in New Zealand, and are being looked at for introduction in the United Kingdom. If they were introduced it would ensure that more  people might be able to come, not fewer. It ought to be a matter that the tourist industry was addressing in a positive way as one which could expand tourist opportunities for Australia.</DOC>

 - I have no advice which would cause me to alter the answer I gave. I do have a recollection of this that the figure advised was between three and four per cent. Without having the opportunity of checking all the details of it, I can think offhand that some of the offsets would be the reduction in fuel, which is worth about 7c a litre for any business use, and the taxation component in relation to the cost of vehicles, to start off with. One would automatically expect that the director of the Funeral Directors Association would argue that the Treasury figure was incorrect. I suggest that the honourable member for Chisholm find a more objective source.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question and for his continuing interest in our national  cultural institutions. Construction officially began today on the National Museum, which is the Commonwealth's flagship for the Centenary of Federation celebrations. This is great news for Australians. The dream of a permanent home for the National Museum is becoming a reality after many years of delay. I remind the House that when we came to government we stated that we would establish a fully-fledged museum to be located with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. We are doing just that. As a result, about 1,000 jobs will be created in the Canberra region during the design and construction phase, and there will be more than 30 permanent new jobs when the buildings are completed.Also, from tomorrow we are opening a new display centre to the public, which will feature computer generated images and state-of-the-art designs of the new facility so that all Australians can see the museum being built from the ground up. The display is obviously going to be updated right through to the year 2000, when the museum will open. We will hold open days on the site on Acton Peninsula during the process of construction because it is very important that all Australians feel a sense of ownership and excitement about their national museum. After all, it will be a symbol and a reminder, as we enter the new millennium, of our collective past and our promising future.I am very glad of a glowing endorsement by a prominent radio broadcaster this morning on the radio station 2GB. Indeed, it was none other than Graham Richardson, who said:And the next thing I want to do is congratulate the Howard government. Yes, you heard it right. I want to congratulate the Howard government.Now, when I was Minister for the Arts many moons ago, I think from 1988 through to 1991 or through `90, I was always trying to get off the ground the National Museum of Australia and continually the likes of Peter Walsh and John Dawkins and the dries would undo me, so there was never any money for it.But you need a museum of your history, for your culture. You've got to have it and we're now going to have the National Museum of Australia and the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. [The museum] will be a state-of-the-art facility and it will have every aspect of Australia's history, including its Aboriginal history, on display. About time too in a nation like this . . . In Australia there's just nowhere to go. It's about time. Well done to the Howard government.Who could disagree with that?</DOC>

 - The answer is in line with the answer that you have been getting constantly with everything to do with the GST. The four per cent compensation package is to be put in place to be paid up front, before the impact of the 1.9 per cent inflation impact is felt, so that there can be compensation from the beginning and not catch-up. It is particularly relevant to older Australians, for whom this government has enormous concern, which of course the past government did not. Indeed, the other compensations that have been put in place for self-funded retirees as well as pensioners are fair and equitable, and will work well.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. This government is determined to lay firm foundations for  the success and achievement of the coming generation of Australians - a generation that has suffered, I regret to say, very badly from the mismanagement of the economy by the previous government. This government has consulted with young people in many different ways, but I think the most important consultation is now under way through the National Youth Round Table, which the government has established.The first round table is being held in Canberra over the next couple of days. Some 50 young Australians have been selected from some 1,000 applicants - very high quality applicants. These young people come from every state and territory in Australia. They are young people from a great mixture of backgrounds from metropolitan and rural Australia. They include many young people who have overcome quite serious barriers to success: young people who have been unemployed, young people suffering serious disabilities and young people suffering homelessness. These young people have, through their own personal efforts by taking charge of their own lives, sought to overcome these difficulties.I had the pleasure of meeting many of these young people last night. My parliamentary secretary, Trish Worth, opened the conference this morning. It is inspirational to find out their motive for applying. As one of the young people from Victoria said:We farm in the mountains of East Gippsland and have no means of electricity, gas, etc. It is due to school that I board during the week in the nearest city, Bairnsdale. I believe that I could bring a perspective of life in an isolated rural area that currently has the highest youth unemployment level in Australia. -  - The member for McMillan is warned. - One young person from South Australia said:Growing up as a young Aboriginal man, it was very hard in a lot of ways, but I have stuck my head out and gone forward with my life. Those difficulties I faced earlier have made me stronger. I want a chance to be heard. Too many young people do not stand up and be heard. Over the next two days, every member of this parliament will have a chance to hear these outstanding young people on the National Youth Round Table. I invite members from both sides of the House to consider attending the plenary sessions of the round table, which will be held in the main committee room, to listen to what these young people have to say to the national parliament. I know that all of us will be very interested in what they have to say and will be seeking to respond constructively to their comments on national policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The first thing you do in this place is don't believe any references the Labor Party make to previous quotes. The first point that should be made here is that, unlike the Labor Party, the coalition government have been prepared to address the issues of taxation reform in Australia in the package that we have put to the people, which we are now in the process of putting through the parliament, and we have also taken on the responsibility of having a look at the taxation system that applies to the business community in Australia. There are a number of proposals that have been put about. -  - There are a number of different sections of the business community that have put different points of view. The important thing is that this is being discussed. At least our government is having an open and frank debate with the business community about how we can make them more competitive in the future. It includes the service industry, it includes manufacturing businesses and it includes agricultural industries. We are  having an open and frank debate about that because we are very serious about getting all sectors of our business community, including the agricultural sector, world competitive by giving them the best taxation system we possibly can for the future.So here we have the Labor Party asking questions about business taxation when they have a history of opposing every bit of taxation reform we put up. They opposed every single measure that we went to put forward to improve the economy of this country that has provided low interest rates. They opposed every single measure. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The point that I was raising is that at least this government is prepared to address these difficult issues. The matter that has been raised is under discussion and will be seriously considered. It will be considered in the context of the best interests of all Australian businesses, including Australia's agricultural industries. At least it is the coalition government that is prepared to address these difficult issues for the benefit of the future of business in Australia.</DOC>

 - I know Laurie wasn't there. He was out there attacking Gough. I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest in the Asian economic  crisis, which has obviously been a central preoccupation on this side of the House for Australia's international relations over the last 18 months. -  - The meeting that I chaired in Sydney involved ministers and senior officials from 27 different countries and also from nine major international organisations. The reason we hosted the meeting was to galvanise the international community to maintain support for East Asia through the lengthy process of recovery and to ensure, as far as the aid donors were concerned, that there was some coordination of policies in dealing with East Asia.What was encouraging was that at this meeting the general consensus was that the Asian economic crisis had at least reached its floor and that in the next years we could look to some measure of recovery in the region, although that would not be to an equal degree in every country.There was also very strong agreement - and the House will be pleased to hear this - amongst both the donors and the recipient countries on strategies to address the Asian economic crisis. There was a very strong emphasis at the meeting, for example, on improved economic governance, particularly capacity building and financial system reform. There was, needless to say, a lot of emphasis on the need for appropriate social safety nets for those people most affected by the Asian economic crisis to be properly looked after and there was an encouraging degree of support for partnerships with the private sector and civil society.At the end of the meeting, in the interests of greater coordination between donors and recipient countries, all agreed with an Australian proposal that we establish an Asian recovery information centre in Manila, as part of the Asian Development Bank, which would help to collect and disseminate information not only about donors' activities but also about the state of the Asian economies and,  in particular, problems that need to be addressed.This was just another example of Australia taking a significant lead in addressing the Asian economic crisis. I would have to say that the leadership that we have shown in convening the meeting and the leadership we have shown generally throughout the Asian economic crisis - and I say this without any exaggeration - has been enormously appreciated throughout the Asia-Pacific region. It does not matter what the politics of politics may be; Australia's role in the Asian economic crisis will be remembered by our region for a very long time as a truly constructive contribution to the region.</DOC>

 - In the long years that I have been in public life I have rarely met a person of greater integrity than the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. The minister for workplace relations continues to enjoy my total confidence. This government deals in facts, and the fact is that the vote in the Senate yesterday was a blow to the job prospects of thousands of young Australians. The vote in the Senate yesterday was a recognition by those who sit opposite us, and others, that they have no alternative strategies to deal with youth unemployment. It was a reminder of the extent to which the Labor Party in particular is bereft of any policy - the extent to which the Labor Party, which has now been in opposition for three years, has spent no time over that three-year period in developing alternative policies. It merely falls back onto the old remedies and, in the face of repeated attempts by this government to do things to improve the job prospects of young Australians, merely lifts its hands and casts its vote at the direction of the trade union bosses who continue to dominate it.</DOC>

 - I want to make it very clear to the House that the government has no intention of backing away from its attempts to protect youth based wages. The legislation rejected in the Senate yesterday will, after a lapse of three months, be returned to the Senate after passage through this House because we are determined to persevere with our attempts. We as a government are at least trying to do something to reduce youth unemployment. Every single step this government has taken to enhance the job prospects of young Australians has been opposed by the Australian Labor Party. They opposed our proposals on unfair dismissal, they opposed our proposal to introduce work for the dole, and they have voted on several occasions to strike down our proposals in relation to protecting youth wages. The reason we want to protect youth wages is that young people's prospects of getting a job under the present system will be greater, and will remain greater, than they would be under the system that the Labor Party supports. If you abolish youth based wages, you will reduce the opportunities of young Australians to get work. McDonald's, which employs 44,000 young Australians under the age of 21, argued very recently that the removal of junior wage rates -  -  - I am very interested to hear the members of the Labor Party interject with hostility when reference is made to an organisation that employs 44,000 young Australians. Apparently in the eyes of the Australian Labor Party it is disreputable to employ young Australians. McDonald's has given job prospects and career prospects to thousands of young Australians over the years. I want every young Australian to know that the Labor Party sneers at the very reference to McDonald's. Let me say again that McDonald's employs 44,000 young Austral  ians under the age of 21. At a recent youth employment seminar, McDonald's argued that the removal of junior rates would ensure that young Australians were unable to compete with adults in the work force. They further argued that it would result in the virtual disappearance of entry-level positions. It would mean fewer jobs in total, and it would make the school to work transition more difficult.But let us go beyond McDonald's; let us go to the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission in a study has found that a one per cent increase in youth wages would reduce employment by two per cent in the retail industry, by 2.5 per cent in the cultural and recreational services industries and by five per cent in the accommodation industry. That is not the finding of an employer. This is not the finding of the Liberal Party or the National Party. This is the finding of the Productivity Commission.The ACCI has found that the replacement of age based wages would increase the cost of employing an 18-year-old by 40 per cent and of a 19-year old by 25 per cent. I might well ask the rhetorical question: how does anybody who sits opposite really imagine they are helping young people by increasing by 40 per cent the cost of employing an 18-year-old and by increasing by 25 per cent the cost of employing a 19-year-old? It stands to reason, it is a matter of elementary logic, that if you increase the cost of employing young people you are going to reduce the number of jobs available to young people. That is why we are opposed to what the Labor Party is doing, and that is why we will re-present this legislation in three months time.</DOC>

 - I did see those remarks attributed to the senator. I do recall an exchange between the senator and myself more than a year ago in the context of the youth allowance. I indicated then that when the government's tax plan came down there would be special provisions inserted to assist Australian parents in raising children. It is fair to say at that particular time, which I think was in March 1998, in response to a question asked of him by Senator Harradine, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, responded, indicating two things. He indicated that the family tax initiative that was a centrepiece of our very successful 1996 election campaign had been introduced at a cost of more than $1 billion, and that provided significant relief to Australian families.I also said that, over and above that, when the taxation plan came out that would also contain, over and above other provisions and other reforms, additional relief for Australian families.	Senator Hill gave an answer to that effect. It is also fair to say that on any analysis the taxation plan hugely benefits low and middle income families, and that the additional assistance given over and above the taxation cuts to people who have the responsibility of raising families are very, very considerable indeed.Naturally, along with any other senator, or indeed any other member who wants to discuss further aspects of the government's taxation plan, the Treasurer and other senior members of the government and myself are willing to do so. But I want to make it very clear that every undertaking that I have given to Senator Harradine, either directly or through Senator Hill, has been honoured, and certainly and most assuredly in respect of  taxation the commitment that I gave was honoured in full.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. I am aware of that research. When you think of it, it does not really come as a surprise, when you ask the community to rate issues of significance, that there is a general understanding in the Australian community about the social consequences of unemployment. To put it another way, Ted Evans, the Secretary to the Treasury, said famously a few years ago that the level of unemployment we have is the choice that we make. That is a very sensible and informed comment.Last night, when confronted with a choice, we saw the Labor Party vote against the creation of jobs and against the protection of existing jobs under the junior wage rate system. It is, I think, very apparent that the Labor Party is entirely out of touch with concerns in the Australian community about youth unemployment. Youth unemployment is already far too high. It is over 24 per cent, and that is why this government is so determined to do all within our power to give young people the chance of a job.It is commonsense. You do not need to be a rocket scientist or an economist to understand that if you put up the wage rate of an 18-year-old by $130 a week a lot of employers are going to say, `We cannot afford that sort of cost in employing and giving a young person a job.'Rob Gerard, who is with ACCI, runs Clipsal Industries. It is a family business, a  reputable business, well regarded. On radio this morning he said, `I've got to say today is in my opinion one of the blackest days for youth in Australia.' He then went on to reflect his own circumstances and his own experience. He said, `What will happen when junior rates go is that people will not put on the youth.' He referred to his own experience in his company and that, as he said, `Not everybody can have a university degree. I think the big thing for youth is to get your foot in the door and have a job to start.' That is a commonsense statement.We have the literary giants over here fighting about Labor Party policy but unable to understand not only the simple and commonsense proposition that what they did last night will undermine the job security of young people but also that one of the reasons why this government has been promoting this measure is that it would actually open opportunities today denied by the existing system.The fact is that the Labor Party, in the action they have taken, will be responsible, I believe, for many young people losing their jobs and many job opportunities being lost to young people. I believe it is a fair prediction - obviously there are a number of variables - to say that, when junior wage rates are abolished in the middle of next year, if we are unable to secure the passage of this legislation, the youth unemployment rate will go to over 30 per cent in this country. The responsibility for that will rest fairly and squarely with the Labor Party and a weak leader who has no capacity to stand up to the factions and to the union bullies who tell him what to do, even though thousands of young people will be disadvantaged as a result.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, let me start at the end of the Leader of the Opposition's question, when he talked about this low wage path. Has the Leader of the Opposition actually forgotten the fact that, in the 13 years that the Labor Party was in power, real wages in this country were suppressed? Has he forgotten the fact that, in the time that we have been in government, there has been a significant increase in real wages? But that increase in real wages has been built on gold - it has been built on the gold of higher productivity. 	 Because of the economic policies that my government has followed, we have been able to deliver to Australian workers a prosperity which Labor could never deliver. We have delivered to Australian workers higher real wages and more disposable income via the combination of higher real wages and lower interest rates.So lesson No. 1 for the Leader of the Opposition is that, far from taking this country down a low wage path, we have in fact taken this country along a high productivity and high wealth highway. I am very proud of the polices that this government has followed. We have followed all of them in the teeth of the most ferocious opposition from the Australian Labor Party and the pathetic gyrations of the Leader of the Opposition. When he thinks things are going badly, he condemns the government's policies and when things are going well he says, `Well, it's not due to what the government has done; it's due to what was done by the Labor Party five or 10 years ago when it was in government.' You have this funny graph - the path of economic policy bobs and weaves in between Liberal and Labor governments. When there is something good in the economy, it is due to the Labor Party and when there is something bad in the economy, it is due to the coalition parties.The reality is that we inherited a deficit of $10½ billion. We inherited a low productivity economy. We inherited a high interest rate economy. In three years, we have made Australians proud of the economic performance of this country. In three years, we have stared down the worst economic downturn which the Asia-Pacific region has ever seen.  In three years, we have delivered great economic leadership to this country. The pathetic question asked by the Leader of the Opposition demonstrates how bereft the Australian Labor Party is not only of leadership but also of policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. In stark contrast to the message that the Labor Party in the Senate gave to young Australia last night, this government has demonstrated that it cares about the job opportunities of young Australians. The skill levels of young Australians are rising as a result of the new apprenticeship reforms. We now have almost 200,000 young people in traineeships and apprenticeships, whereas the Labor Party, in government for 13 years, under union pressure, adopted policies that set out to destroy the apprenticeship system.We faced up to the issues of literacy and numeracy. We faced up to the issues of school to work transition. The Labor Party, last night in the Senate, gave young people the message that it does not care about their future, that it does not care if its policies are going to destroy job opportunities for young people.Why does the Labor Party take this attitude to junior wage rates? They take this attitude because this is the policy of the ACTU. It is the policy that Lord Crean of Hotham pursued for many years while he was President of the ACTU. The next anointed leader of the Labor Party is sitting over there. Kim Beazley has anointed him, Lord Crean of Hotham, as the next leader of the Labor Party. He is the person who, more than any other, has championed the policy which is now dominating the Labor Party, aided and abetted by the member for Batman.All one can say to the member for Hotham is he had better watch out for the bomb thrower, because there is a bomb out there which has got his name on it. This is a divided party under a weak leader, and the only thing that this leader stands for is the policy that his sectional union mates have forced onto him. He is a person without any concern for the job opportunities of young Australians. If you were to get out there, if you were to talk to young Australians, if you were to talk to businessmen, you would find out that young people in this country want jobs and that businessmen depend on those junior wage rates to give them jobs. This is a party which is divorced from reality and shows no concern for young people.</DOC>

 - It is true there are a large number of federal awards that do not have junior wage rates and, if you look at those industries which do not have junior wage rates, many of those industries do not have young people working in them. If you take the building industry, for example, the unions many years ago saw off the end of junior wage rates. As a result, if you are a young person, the opportunities for you to get a job  in the building industry and get a foot on that bottom rung of the ladder have largely been denied.In that particular industry, the fact of the matter is that, if we had junior wage rates, there would be something of the order of an extra 6,000 jobs for young people, giving them the experience, the opportunity to learn the trade on the job and the pathway to contribute to the building industry.You people for years have denied young people a chance of jobs in lots of industries in this country, which is why we want to see this legislation in place at the earliest opportunity. Opportunities should be provided for young people. We are entitled to put this measure to achieve that.Lastly, in respect of this vacuous, empty claim that existing people would lose their entitlements, what we are proposing - and you ought to be able to support this - is that the Industrial Relations Commission would have a discretion to insert junior wage rates and, in doing so, would obviously take into account the circumstances of existing employees to ensure that they were fairly treated. You are the great supporters of the Industrial Relations Commission but, when you voted last night, you voted to limit the discretions of the commission in respect of the maintenance of a system which has served Australia very well.I thank you for the question because it just demonstrates that, when it comes to giving young people the chance of a job, last night you voted against it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. No doubt he was asking me about the release today of industrial trends from ACCI and Westpac. The survey of industrial trends released had Mr Mark Paterson, the Chief Executive of ACCI, saying:Results of the March quarter survey of Australian manufacturers show a leap in business confidence matched by continuing strong growth of demand and production.Mr Bill Evans, the Westpac General Manager Economics, commented on this survey:This surge in business confidence, coupled with the healthy rise in December, represents the largest two quarter rise since the stockmarket boom of mid 1997, and the economic recovery in 1983. - The Leader of the Opposition asks what the NAB survey said. Quoting Mr Alan Oster, the NAB survey said:Overall, the National's latest Monthly Business Survey suggests that the strong domestic activity depicted in the Statistician's recent National Accounts for the December quarter 1998 was maintained in the first couple of months of 1999. - Indeed, maintained. You are complaining about `maintained', are you? Let me finish the quote. He is complaining that it is only maintained! - As Alan Oster says:Indeed, business conditions in February appear consistent with GDP growth continuing at an annualised rate of about 5%.We are only maintaining five per cent! Mr. Speaker, you have got to hand it to these people. No wonder Tanner and Latham look like geniuses. This is what the so-called official economic thinkers of the Labor Party were saying in July. This is what their shadow treasurer said:After three Costello budgets we have slower growth, we face the Asian crisis. It's not what I call a fireproofed economy.The Treasurer fireproofed the economic car by taking out the petrol. That is what he said in July 1998 when the Australian economy was growing at 4.9 per cent and we were the fastest growing economy in the world: we had taken the petrol out of the car. WTG!On The Newshour With Jim Lehrer in the United States yesterday - which is probably one of the premier current affairs programs in the United States - Paul Krugman, Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said this:If you were looking for a miracle economy in this crisis, it would be Australia. It is sort of in Asia, should be a victim and yet they have grown five per cent in the last year. Somehow they've managed to ride this out. - No, it was actually Australia. I suppose the Australian Labor Party would prefer it if it were Austria. And you are not the Austrian Labor Party either, my friend - although you may know more about that economy than this one. The ANZ job advertisements series which was released today showed that job ads rose 8.4 per cent in February -  - Oh, yes, trend terms. Thank you. Why do I keep getting Dorothy interjections from the Labor Party frontbench? - Mr Speaker, I respond through you to the question of trends. In trend terms, the number of job advertisements to January was 13.7 per cent higher than last year. It would be one thing if the Labor Party said, `We the Labor Party got the economy wrong, we the Labor Party shouldn't have opposed your efforts to put the budget back into balance, we the Labor Party congratulate the government for its economic management and we the Labor Party rejoice with Australians that we have so far ridden out the Asian crisis as one of the strong economies of the world' - that would be a respectable position. But to maintain this doomsaying and hope to  talk the economy down to have a self-fulfilling negative effect, to oppose every single measure that has been necessary to get the budget back into line, to oppose tax reform, to oppose labour market reform, to oppose monetary policy reform and to oppose the fiscal repair job is essentially to say that the Labor Party can take no responsibility and take no joy whatsoever from a strong economy which is giving opportunities to Australians. And that is what this government stands for.</DOC>

 - I know what McDonald's had to say about youth wages, and I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that the burden of what McDonald's has had to say about the GST and food is that the last thing you should ever do is have an approach to the GST whereby some food is exempted and some food is included. I have not only seen that through the public submissions but had the benefit of discussing that with the Managing Director of McDonald's, Mr Charlie Bell, more than 18 months ago, where Mr Bell contrasted the experience of McDonald's in New Zealand with the experience of McDonald's in Canada and the United Kingdom, and he said that the take-out from that was that the last thing you do is to go down the Canadian path or the United Kingdom path.It is a ridiculous situation where you have food inspectors testing whether pies are hot, cold or warm and you have all sorts of additional GST or VAT police going around carrying out these inspections. The message coming from McDonald's on the GST is: don't go down the Democrat path and exempt  food and try to include takeaway meals. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question.</DOC>

 - The member for Boothby will be pleased to know that the Job Network is continuing to go from strength to strength. In February, the Job Network placed 24,000 eligible job seekers on benefit into real work, compared to just 12,000 from the CES in February last year. In other words, the Job Network is now performing 100 per cent better than the old CES.While the government is responsible for the system which has brought about this improvement, we are not actually doing the work ourselves. The hard work is being done by Mission Employment, the Salvation Army's Employment Plus, Centacare, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and all these great charitable community based and private sector organisations which comprise the Job Network - organisations which all members in this House should support.I have been asked about alternative views, and never let it be said that this government is deaf to the wisdom which occasionally emanates from the other side of the House. Just a week ago, the member for Werriwa said:Only by remembering these groups - that is to say, groups like Mission Australia and the Salvation Army - and giving them more to do like running schools, health centres and recreation services can society and our sense of moral responsibility be restored .On this count, the member for Werriwa is absolutely right, and that is why I have been frequently saying that the Job Network is the Third Way in action. But that was until I came across the latest book of the member for  Melbourne where he described the Third Way as mere cocktail politics: `Pour two nips of market forces, throw in a few platitudes, add a dash of socialism and stir vigorously.' And they are all stirring vigorously over there.The member for Melbourne says we do not need a new label for vacuous pragmatism. At least the member for Melbourne and the member for Werriwa have ideas. They make speeches and they write books which people read and listen to and report. They have ideas about the principles on which the Job Network is based. The only thing the Leader of the Opposition can generate -  - The member for Werriwa and the member for Melbourne have ideas relevant to the Job Network. All the Leader of the Opposition can generate is bad headlines like `Crean rising to the top of the ALP', `Beazley must move fast to regain focus' -  - The minister knows that this has no relevance. - and `Beazley the issue, not Brereton'.</DOC>

 - Rural and regional Australia will be big winners under the further privatisation of Telstra. The government has made it abundantly clear in the lead-up to the last election and since -  -  - This is an opposition that catcalls, having ignored rural and regional Australia's telecommunications infrastructure problems for some 13 years. With the further privatisation of Telstra, we are able to direct hundreds of millions of dollars directly into rural Australia: $671 million, in fact, as a national package, of which will go $250 million to the Natural Heritage Trust of Australia, $120 million to establish and fund a television fund to expand SBS to eradicate black spots, up to $150 million to install telecommunications infrastructure to give untimed local access calls, and $70 million to establish rural transaction centres - the list goes on and on. - You need only to look at the legislation before the Senate at present to see the safeguards installed for country Australia. The package on the full sale of the Telstra facilities separates the regulatory and shareholder functions and roles of the  Commonwealth. The cornerstone of telecommunications policy is transparency and accountable regulation through proper processes based in legislation. We are well aware, obviously, that the use of the shareholder power to achieve regulatory objectives in relation to Telstra is inappropriate and would cause conflict with our Corporations Law requirements, but the point is to look at the legislation: every safeguard is spelt out in exacting detail.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member for Mallee - who, along with many members in both the Liberal and National parties representing rural and regional Australia, has taken a very strong interest in the need to achieve an appropriate balance between further competition in the oil industry and the protection of the rights and the interests of small business, particularly small service station proprietors - I can confirm previous assurances that the repeal of the sites and franchise acts will not be proclaimed until the oil code is finalised between all parties in the industry. The draft oil code was developed after extensive consultation with all sections of the industry, and the benefits to the industry and small business from the oil code will be significant.The new code will apply to a larger range of operations than did the previous legislative regime, so providing better protection for service station franchisees. The code will also contain specific provisions on issues like setting of tenure, renegotiation of contracts and unilateral variations that will give the industry greater flexibility to respond to such changes as new entrants in the petroleum retail market.At all stages we have sought to involve industry players, and that will continue as we finalise the code. I repeat that we will not proclaim the Petroleum Retail Legislation Repeal Bill until an acceptable agreement is reached on the final implementation of the oil code. As in any issue where there are differing perspectives, we will of course expect all parties to participate in the finalisation of oil code with a spirit of compromise and reasonableness. I say finally, by way of reminder to all members of this House, that the Liberal and National parties stand second to none, as far as the political parties of Australia are concerned, in protecting and defending the interests of small business.</DOC>

 - I welcome the question. I am very glad that it has finally been asked. I am aware that the member for Hotham was out claiming that the current account deficit was the highest on record in nominal dollars, unadjusted by GDP or for inflation. It would be like saying that the CPI is now at the highest level. It would be like saying that household disposable income is at the highest level. It would be like saying that employment is at its highest level ever. In absolute numbers, employment is at its highest level ever. In GDP terms -  -  - The current account deficit, measured as a proportion of GDP, which is the way it is traditionally measured -  - I always did, my friend - is at 5.4 per cent of GDP. The previous peaks in the current account deficit were at 6.5 per cent in 1985-86; 6.6 per cent of GDP in 1989-90; and 6.6 per cent of GDP in 1994. Not only was the current account deficit at 6.5 per cent of GDP in 1985-86, under a Labor government, but also the inflation rate was then 9.2 per cent and the variable mortgage interest rate was 13.5 per cent.In 1989-90, when the Labor Party peaked the current account deficit again at 6.6 per cent of GDP, inflation was 8.6 per cent and the variable mortgage interest rate was 17 per cent. In 1994-95, when the Labor Party again peaked the current account deficit at 6.6 per cent, inflation was at 3.9 per cent and the variable mortgage interest rate was at 10.5 per cent. The Labor Party then claims that the current account deficit is some kind of record because it is now at 5.4 per cent. But look at the economic climate in which it occurs: a headline inflation rate of 1.6 per cent and a variable mortgage interest rate of 6.5 per cent.Let us make an obvious point in relation to the current account deficit, which is: if you are going through the largest regional recession - if I may say so, there was no Asian regional recession in 1985-86, 1989-90 or 1994-95 -  - Asia was booming - you would expect, as you have seen in Australia, low commodity prices. At the moment, commodity prices are the lowest they have been in 20 years, or so. -  - The member for Melbourne tries to get a reputation as being intelligent, but it is only by comparison.  These are the lowest commodity prices in 20 years. Let me make the point that, when commodity prices are low, you would expect to get low prices for your exports. A current account deficit is likely to widen when you get low prices for your exports. It is axiomatic. The one thing that we will not be doing in relation to this current account deficit is trying to get the current account deficit narrower by putting the domestic economy into recession.Let us remember what happened in 1989-90 when the Labor Party blew the current account deficit out to 6.6 per cent of GDP. The Labor Party Treasurer prescribed the following remedy: that this was the recession that Australia had to have. Labor's answer to a current account deficit was recession, and it was a deliberate policy in 1989-90. It was no accident that you took mortgage interest rates to 17 per cent. Your Treasurer said that it was a policy to bring on a recession in response to a current account deficit.That recession cost Australia dearly. It has taken us nearly nine years to recover, in an employment sense, from Labor's 1989-90 recession. It has taken us nine years to get the unemployment rate down to 7½ per cent - which is too high, but is the lowest in a decade, coming off the recession record of Labor at 11.3 per cent. The recession of Labor at 11.3 per cent was done under a minister for employment who is now the Leader of the Australian Labor Party in this country.In relation to a current account deficit with external price weakness, this government intends to keep the domestic economy running strongly. We can afford to keep the domestic economy running strongly on an inflation rate of 1.6 per cent. We will keep it running strongly on an interest rate of around 6½ per cent. I say to the people of Australia: in this economic climate, when we are going through the biggest financial downturn on the external front that we have ever seen, a responsible government would be keeping a strong domestic economy because that is what is keeping them in jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that it is of great interest to all in the House but particularly to those in Brisbane. I was pleased to announce today that Brisbane's proposed cruise ship terminal has qualified for federal government support under the Infrastructure Borrowings Tax Offset Scheme, subject only to satisfactory environmental assessment and the scrutiny of the ATO.The cruise terminal at Hamilton on the Brisbane River will be eligible for a $10 million tax rebate over five years. This is great news for Brisbane, great news for jobs and great news for the Australian cruise industry. Internationally, the cruise industry is now growing at an annualised rate of around four per cent. It is the fastest growing sector in the international tourism industry. Up until this point in time, we have been losing some investment opportunities and jobs here because we have not had the necessary infrastructure and the necessary back-up. So the reality of the building of this infrastructure will make a very real difference. It would not have happened without the government's rebate. The financiers of the project had underwritten their offer subject to receiving the rebate. So it is indeed good news that this has happened.This terminal is likely to kick-start a $170 million development, including a 280-room hotel and tourism facilities including an aquarium, a large screen theatre and a whole range of other things. It will generate 2,500 construction jobs over 18 months and 1,200 permanent jobs after that. This project follows four projects worth some $900 million that were announced in January as qualifying for assistance under the scheme. I believe that it is an outstanding example of the government's commitment to improving Australia's infrastructure that has a real impact on  opening up new economic opportunities and in particular creating new job opportunities. I believe that it will be warmly welcomed by all members of this House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I will answer one of the last parts of the question first. The government's tax reform package is going to without question benefit farmers right across Australia. That has been substantiated by independent analysis that has been undertaken at the request of New South Wales farmers and the University of New England. The average farm across Australia is going to be about $5,400 a year better off in disposable income. That is accepted and acknowledged by farmers across Australia. It does not matter whether they are sugar cane farmers in North Queensland or horticulturalists in Victoria or South Australia. That has been acknowledged, because farmers understand that the tax reform package is going to provide a much better economic environment from which they are going to operate.It is going to take the burden of taxation off exports, particularly for the sugar industry. The sugar industry has to export a lot more on average than any other agricultural producer in Australia. On average we have to export 80 per cent of what we produce in agricultural industries in Australia, and we are going to remove $4½ billion worth of burden from our agricultural industries. We are going to  remove the burdens of transport costs, because our agricultural producers primarily are operating in rural and remote Australia where the tyranny of distance and those transport costs impact on them disproportionately to the rest of Australia. We are going to lessen the burden of those transport costs with our tax reform package. So nobody can stand in this place and say that we are going to add burden to the cost of production in Australia.Yes, the member for Corio and I took the opportunity a couple of weeks ago to visit the devastation in North Queensland and we spoke to representatives of the sugar industry and representatives of the horticulturalists up there. Yes, there is a variation in commodity prices across the world that we cannot control. But what we can do is provide them with a lower interest rate regime, which we have done, with plenty of opposition from the Labor Party. The Labor Party did not want to introduce those changes in Australia that provided low interest rates for rural Australia. We now want to introduce taxation reform that is going to provide further benefits to rural Australia, and it is the Labor Party who are opposing that. The people in rural Australia realise that this government is serious about providing them with a better economic environment from which to operate and compete in the world market. It is only the Labor Party who are opposing it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I acknowledge his very real interest in this matter. The great irony at the moment is that essentially so lacking was the support from New South Wales that without the direct intervention of the Prime Minister we would not even have got to the proving up stage. But the current minister in New South Wales yesterday issued a statement claiming some credit for being the first to sign a document for the proving up statement. No interest whatsoever has been shown. They stood in the way, and yet yesterday the minister wanted to claim credit for signing a piece of paper ahead of the rest of us, a piece of paper that would never have come into existence if it had not been for the drive and the foresight of the Commonwealth government and in particular the Prime Minister.Since coming to government, the fact is that we have been very quick to recognise the obvious benefits that modern rail technology can deliver to a country like Australia, and particularly to regional areas. So in 1997 we invited private sector proposals to develop a high speed train service between Sydney and Canberra because we recognised, as indeed do many in the community, that there are real opportunities in delivering a fast service between here and Sydney, and in the future probably between other major capitals as well.On 4 August last year the Prime Minister announced that the three governments had agreed to proceed with a proving-up process with Speedrail in relation to its proposal to build the Sydney-Canberra high speed train link. The fact is that New South Wales claimed it was not opposed yet would do nothing to endorse this proposal until just before Christmas. It has remained reluctant to become involved despite the obvious benefits to the people of New South Wales. I believe it is a commitment that this government has shown that will be welcomed across the Australian community. In terms of the lack of commitment by New South Wales, the remarks yesterday by the minister in that state mark him, I think, as being capable of considerable hypocrisy. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I have made a number of statements about this and I have been asked a number of questions. I remain of the view that, taken in isolation, the superannuation arrangements for members of parliament throughout Australia are by community standards generous - taken in isolation. It is also the case that, taken in isolation, the remuneration of people holding high political office in this country does not compare favourably, does not compare well, indeed, with the remuneration of people who hold high positions in the media, in business or indeed in many other walks of life.I have expressed the view that I think many people in public life, given the commitment that they make - and this applies to men or women irrespective of their political parties and irrespective of whether they are in state or federal government - work well beyond their remuneration. But I think it is also realistic to say that it will ever be thus, and anybody who imagines that you are ever  going to have the same approach to salaries in public life as exists in commerce, in the media or in sport for that matter are deluding themselves. Most men and women do not go into public life for the money. They go into it because they have certain attitudes and values and beliefs. That is a point of view that is probably not as widely shared in the community as it ought to be, but I think it is nonetheless a fair statement of the situation.I have never ruled out, nor has the government ever ruled out, further examination of parliamentary superannuation arrangements, and in particular the matter to which the honourable member refers. I know it is seen by the public and seen by others as the most prominent and obvious of the criticisms that can be made. I remind the honourable member - I am sure he is aware of this - that the contributions that are made by members of parliament to their retirement arrangements are in percentage terms much higher than the contributions made by many other people. I think that is also something that has to be borne in mind.I will be perfectly candid with the honourable gentleman - he asked the question knowing full well that I have expressed this view before - that I think the absence of the 55 trigger age is a source of natural criticism. But I would ask him and I would ask others who want to look at this thing objectively to not just look at one element of it but to take into account the total remuneration package which is made available. The oft quoted example that I have used has been brought into very sharp relief in recent weeks because of the retirement of the chief executive of one of the major trading banks in Australia. I offer no criticism of that man; I think he did a magnificent job with the Westpac Bank. But it is interesting to compare the remuneration of the chief executive of the Westpac Bank and the remuneration at the National Australia Bank, or indeed other banks, with the remuneration of the man who in my government is charged with the responsibility of the financial system, the federal Treasurer. That observation could have been made, I am prepared to concede, when the former govern  ment was in office as well. I think these things ought to be borne in mind.I understand the interest of the honourable gentleman in these issues. They are important issues, and we have to justify ourselves. I do not offer any criticism of the honourable member for asking the question. I just ask that all honourable members, when they are dealing with these issues, take everything into account and bear in mind that there are people of quality in national life on both sides of politics who make a lifelong commitment to building a better Australia, according to their vision of what represents a better Australia, and, when you compare their remuneration with that of people in the media, in business and in sport, I do not think you can say, as to the best of them, both men and women, Labor, Liberal and National alike, that they are over-remunerated.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his vigorous advocacy of the transport needs of his constituents on the Central Coast. He never ceases to raise these matters with me, and certainly I am committed to doing what I can to help him.The F3 is a vitally important link, of course, and part of the national highway network. It provides a commuter link between Sydney and the Central Coast and - on up the road - to Newcastle and so forth. Some 38,000 cars a day now use that, which must be a massive increase since the freeway was first begun in 1963. It forms the main northbound artery from the city for holiday traffic as well, and this became a particular focus of difficulty during the recent Christmas holidays. Anyone who travelled that freeway in January, as the member would well know, and was caught up in one of several traffic jams up to 20 kilometres long, involving in some cases delays of up to 16 hours, will know how much frustration there was over the whole thing. It would, no doubt, anger the member for Robertson's constituents and others who were caught in those jams to know that they were basically unnecessary. The Commonwealth agreed to fund the variable messaging system that was wanted when it wrote to the New South Wales minister in June of 1997. - That's right. - We did. We put up the money for a signage system and the New South Wales government has not done anything with it. -  - Our commitment to the road cannot be doubted. Well over a billion dollars has been committed to that road over recent years. To deal with this problem of inadequate signage we put up $10 million and we find that, some months down the road, nothing has been done with it. A great deal of that frustration could easily have been avoided.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is that of course I recall it because it was part of the agreement with the Democrats and because it has been on the public record since it was agreed between us. What you failed to point out in your question is that it made no reference to the timing of any initiatives that the government would want to take on this issue. Unlike the Leader of the Opposition, we accept that we have a political responsibility to look after young people.The fact is that you are slipping and sliding because you are under the dictates of the ACTU as usual. The people who suffer as a result of your ineptitude, your weakness as a leader, are the very young people who will be denied opportunities when this exemption is removed. This question betrays the weakness of the Leader of the Opposition who, when it comes to looking after young people, denies young people and simply sings the tune of the ACTU as he normally does.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. I certainly have seen the article in the Daily Telegraph  today which is entitled `A victim of politics'. - I would hope that every Australian sees today's Daily Telegraph  because it puts, in an objective and independent way, the consequences of the Labor Party voting against jobs for young people. - Mr Speaker, you would have to conclude that the point of order betrays the sensitivity of the Labor Party frontbench. They have voted against the job prospects of tens of thousands of young people. They have undermined the security of 170,000 or 180,000 young people. I dare say we can expect a lot more points of order as we on this side put our concerns about this issue.It was quite incredible that not only did they vote against the jobs for young people but also, when the vote was announced in the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition said that it was a great victory. Furthermore, he said, `We are rather chuffed about it.' They vote against young people and they have the gall, the arrogance -  - the insensitivity and the lack of concern for young people to boast about the fact that young people will be denied the opportunity for a job because they do not have the leadership, the strength of leadership, to stand up against the factions -  - As the Sydney Morning Herald  pointed out in its editorial this morning, it is not something which young people whose job security is tied to youth rates would be chuffed about. That is a very fair -  - I think many people are going to ask themselves why it is that the Labor Party is chuffed, to use the words of the Leader of the Opposition, because it has attempted to thwart a very reasonable proposition, namely, a proposition which would not only protect young people's jobs but also provide opportunities for jobs for young people in those industries which no longer have junior wage rates.When you have a policy and no leadership, a vacuum is created, and we are beginning to see the results. It is resulting in an opposition which, when it comes to these important national issues, is simply incapable - constitutionally incapable - of addressing the issues on a reasonable basis, a merits basis.Going back to October 1998, we saw headlines such as `Beazley pleads for unity'; `Beazley pleads for unity as a result of the disunity within his own ranks'. Today we saw the headline `Beazley battles to revive the party'. There were other headlines today. - I certainly will, Mr Speaker, but this is a very relevant point to make. Here we have a very significant issue. Many young people are to be deprived of job opportunities in the future and they are entitled to know what it is within the Labor Party that has driven the Labor Party to this policy of opposition for the sake of opposition. You can trace it to the disunity within their own side, an inability to articulate a clear policy and a failure at the leadership level to stand up to the ACTU and actually do something in the interests of young people. This is typical of the Labor Party - splintering on policy; no leadership. The sad thing is that, as the headline in today's Daily Telegraph  stated, the people who are the victims of these politics are young Australians who will be denied job opportunities as a result.</DOC>

 - The government's policy on youth wages has been a matter of public record certainly since 1996. In 1996, we had a proposal to remove the ban which was to come into effect in respect of junior wage rates. We were unable to secure the removal of that time bomb which we inherited from the Labor Party. I was very concerned that, if we were unable to remove that time bomb ticking away, in June 1997 the operation of that act would come into play and the jobs of many young people would be lost.Therefore, we implored the Democrats to reconsider their opposition to our proposal and, as a consequence of their reconsidering the position, they adopted a compromise agreement with the government. That compromise agreement was that we would have a  review by the Industrial Relations Commission and the government would agree to the abandoning of the policy position that we had put in the legislation and, instead, agree to a deferral for three years. That was our position. - It was exactly our position. The Leader of the Opposition read out parts of the agreement which specified the agreement. There is no more to that agreement. We had everything in that agreement. That is the most comprehensive agreement ever made between a government and a political party in the Senate. Every aspect of our agreement was contained within that agreement.What the Labor Party now say is, `Oh, well, the government subordinated its policy position to the Industrial Relations Commission.' With great respect to the Industrial Relations Commission, from our perspective it would be an odd day that this government would ever subordinate its policy position to the Industrial Relations Commission. Furthermore, back in 1996 we did not know when the next election would be. But it was certainly always clear that our intentions were that, at the next election, we would campaign on this issue - and on this issue we did campaign in 1998. We had an absolute black-and-white policy. We put it to the Australian people.We, unlike you, believe that when the government puts a policy to the Australian people and they vote for it the people are entitled to see the parliament fulfil the promises made by, on this occasion, the government. We have an absolutely clear position on this. We made a commitment to the Australian people. We are very determined to see that commitment fulfilled. I can assure the Leader of the Opposition he will rue the day that, for the weakness of his leadership, he failed to act in the interests of protecting young people and their jobs.</DOC>

 - I am aware of union opposition to this scheme, which has now helped nearly 18,000 young Australians, of whom 42 per cent have gone on to paid employment or further education or training. Unfortunately, union opposition has now stopped contracted Work for the Dole projects at Port Macquarie and Armidale in the electorate of the member for New England, and it has also stopped planned projects at Dorrigo, Grafton and South West Rocks.Thanks to the intransigence of the Australian Workers Union - which has just parachuted Big Bill Ludwig's son into the Senate - 500 young Australians have missed out on the chance to gain valuable work experience and make a contribution to their communities. This tragedy has occurred because the New South Wales government has given the unions a veto over all Work for the Dole projects involving state government agencies or instrumentalities in New South Wales. This has happened even though the five projects in question were supported by local National Parks and Wildlife Service officials. It has happened even though the five projects in question were initially supported by the local union organiser. It has happened because the Carr government is completely subservient to the Sussex Street soviet.I have been asked what needs to be done to ensure this opposition does not jeopardise opportunities for young people in the future. The first thing that needs to be done is that the New South Wales Minister for the Environment, Pam Allen, who is a former women's coordinator of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, needs to spend less time junketeering to Lord Howe Island and more time supporting her own departmental officials.The second thing that needs to happen is that the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, whose union is the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, needs to stop kowtowing to the Sussex Street soviet. Doesn't Bob Carr know it! As he said the other day, `I've had lunch after lunch with union offi  cials, and union leaders are putting their own jobs and their own superannuation before me and the best interests of this state.' -  - I have been asked what needs to be done to ensure this opposition does not jeopardise opportunities for young people in the future. The third thing that needs to be done is that the Leader of the Opposition, who is a member of the Miscellaneous Workers Union, needs to avoid repeating the mistakes of Bob Carr in New South Wales: opportunistic in opposition, followed by broken promises and pedestrian policies in government. -  - That is not my comment; that is the comment of the member for Werriwa, who is also a member of the Australian Services Union.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first two parts of the question is obviously yes. That is a statement of fact. In terms of our approach to the timing of this issue, one of the aspects which we believe is important in the legislation that we are proposing is that it will provide the opportunity for the insertion of  junior wage rates into awards which currently do not have them. We believe that will create many job opportunities throughout the Australian economy.Given that it is the government's clear policy position that that would advantage those young people who are today unemployed, we actually believe that we have a commitment to get on and provide them with those opportunities. That should hardly surprise you. On this side of the House, it is our view that youth unemployment of over 24 per cent is unacceptable. It is our view that we as a government have a responsibility to do all within our power to give young people a chance of a job and as soon as we possibly can.The third point I would make in response to the question is that, if you look at the circumstances of employers, they are now confronted with a state of real uncertainty about the wages bill that they will have to face in June next year. Employers who are considering employing somebody today will also now have to take into account the uncertainty that in June next year they may well face a very significantly increased wages bill. The uncertainty that is I believe already generated as a result of the failure to resolve this issue will in fact be starting to impact on employers' behavioural patterns in employing young people.So I believe on that basis there is a real imperative and responsibility on this parliament to provide certainty to employers, to give them a regime in which it is clear what their wages bill will be, so that they can get on and continue to employ people.I conclude by saying this. The Labor Party is supporting an aspect of this issue which is being advanced by the ACTU - that is, that all 18-year-olds should be paid an adult rate. If you had to impose an adult rate of 18, the wages bill for employers nationally would be increased by the order of $360 million. That is a cloud of uncertainty over the employing intentions of employers. We believe this situation needs to be resolved. The sooner it is, the more jobs there will be for young people. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. My morning was interrupted by an AM  interview this morning when I heard the astounding claim that the government was pretending to have a strong economy. There was an interview with the member for Hotham. I do not want to be accused of taking anything out of context, so let me read the question:Would you agree with the comments of Warren Snowdon that disloyal backbenchers should be sacked?Answer:Look, the problem for us is behind us now.Journalist:But do you agree with that idea?Answer:No, no. The issue for us is a government that is pretending that we have a strong economy . . . Which was a funny answer to a comment from Warren Snowdon about sacking disloyal backbenchers. The opposition now claims that the government is pretending we have a strong economy. Let me refer to the assessment of Stanley Fisher, the First Deputy Managing Director of the IMF, who said this back in November 1998:The Australian economy has done remarkably well and the policy framework has changed amazingly. You have a very coherent monetary policy now; and you're running a fiscal surplus now.Stanley was presumably just pretending. I suppose the Economist  magazine was pretending on 6 March when it said this:Last year Australia was one of the rich world's fastest growing economies with GDP growth of 4.9 per cent while New Zealand sank into recession.Another institution known for pretending on economic matters is the IMF. In its assessment of the Australian economy in November 1998, the IMF `commended authorities for implementing sound macro-economic policies and structural reforms which have built the  foundation for Australia's impressive record of strong growth and low inflation in recent years'. `Directors noted that fiscal consolidation and the inflation targeting framework had contributed to a fall in long-term interest rates.' I suppose the G7 and the OECD are just pretending when they have lower growth rates than Australia - presumably keeping them low so Australia looks good: the G7 on a growth rate of 1.5 per cent; the OECD on a growth rate of 2.6 per cent.This pretence has now gone international. We had Professor Krugman from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology pretending on The Newshour With Jim Lehrer on 8 March 1999:If you were looking for a miracle economy in this crisis, it would be Australia. It is sort of in Asia, should be a victim and yet they have grown five per cent in the last year.That is the assessment of Krugman, the IMF, an analysis with the G7, and the OECD. It is an analysis of Stanley Fisher and it is an analysis of the Economist  magazine. So it is just one gigantic international pretending conspiracy, according to the shadow Treasurer who made this assessment. This apparently is the only correct assessment, the assessment he made on 21 July 1998:And now we face the Asian economic crisis. It's not what I'd call a fireproofed economy . . . the Treasurer has fireproofed the economic car by taking out the petrol.He also said:After three Costello budgets we have slower growth . . . There is only one pretender here and it is a pretender who is pretending to be a shadow Treasurer - the member for Hotham - who is yet to make one speech on the Australian economy since he has held that position.</DOC>

 - We had an agreement with the Democrats, and the agreement was honoured by both the Democrats and by the government. It was also our policy position that we believed there should be an exemption from junior wage rates. That has been the government's policy. That has always been the government policy. And I can assure you that we intend to pursue this policy, because that is the way to best protect young people's wages. The alternative -  - The contest here on the substance of this issue is whether or not there is an alternative to the age based system. That is the basis of the contest. - I am happy to deal with the process, so let me answer that. But, in referring to the process, I also make the point that the government has had a clear policy position and there is a substantial issue at point, and that is whether or not there is an alternative to the age based system we have today. -  - You want to go to the process. I am prepared to take the time to deal with your question, but let me deal with the substance of the issue. The question is: is there an alternative to the age based system? When you were in government, there were repeated efforts to obtain some viable, practical alternative which was non-discriminatory. At no stage has such an alternative been found. - The reason we have had four or five points of order is that when you expose the real issue at heart here the fact of the matter is that you had no practical alternative to the existing system -  - And that is why it is grossly irresponsible, it is reckless indeed, with the lives of young people that you should abandon the existing system but provide no practical system that can give people a reassurance that they will continue to have the jobs that they have today.Let me go to what you want to talk about, which is process. We will go to process for a moment. The fact of the matter is that when we entered into the agreement with the Democrats no-one had a timetable as to the next election at the end of 1996. We said, `We have a policy position. We have compromised our policy position to obtain a deferral for three years, but we will continue to advocate the first proposition we put, namely, that the exemption should remain in the legislation.' And we have been true to our policy position. We have been consistent and we put it to the Australian people in the last election. That is an open and transparent process, and we have had the strength of our position to be prepared to stand up and protect the jobs of young people. You have put on a display -  - of weakness, an inability to defend the rights of young people to have a job. - I have finished. Thank you, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. I know her commitment to ensuring that students have equal rights on campus with the rights they enjoy off campus. This government is strongly committed to giving students choice in the associations to which they belong and in the university services they purchase. The basic right to freedom of association has been routinely denied to students on university campuses for far too long in this country. It has had a quite significant effect on the quality of student life on campus. I think every member of this House knows that a very small proportion of students are active in university elections, because they know that they can have very little effect on the services that are provided on campus because those services at present are compulsorily funded.The government's commitment to voluntary student unionism will put something like $100  million back in the pockets of students. It will mean that large numbers of students will have something like $300 extra that they will decide how to spend when they become university students. The government has no doubt whatever that this will lead to a more vibrant student life and will lead to much more responsive university services. Part-time students have been classically undersupported in university services over the years because of the nature of this compulsory fee. The abolition of the compulsory fee will ensure that the needs of all students are at last properly addressed. -  - I am aware of alternative positions to this. I notice that in the Labor Party's 1998 election platform the Labor Party said, firstly, that it strongly opposes voluntary student unionism and, secondly, and I would have to say hypocritically, that it believes up-front undergraduate fees are undesirable in Labor's Australia. What utter confusion, because the only compulsory up-front fee that students are met with on university campuses at the moment is the fee that the Labor Party supports, and the only reason why the Labor Party supports this fee is that it is a fee supported by its union mates. It is a party that comprises 100 per cent union members when only 14 per cent of the Australian population actually belong to trade unions. It is a sectional party putting sectional views. This government has faith in young Australians and will legislate accordingly.</DOC>

 - What the honourable member seems to fail to understand is that the government has a policy. We think this is an important policy and we intend to pursue this policy. Yes, we were prepared to agree to the commission looking at the issue as a means of deferring the time bomb going off in 1997 to the year 2000 to give us an opportunity to advance the case, to mount the political campaign and, as circumstances turned out, to allow us to put this issue to the Australian people in the 1998 election. But, if you think that we were ever going to qualify our position on the basis of discussions with the Democrats, you have got another think coming. The fact is that we have a position. We think it is an important position. As much as we were prepared in a constructive way to negotiate with the Democrats, you must have rocks in your head if you thought we would abandon our position to the position being adopted by the Democrats.We are determined to look after young people. The fact of the matter is that, with 52 per cent of your frontbench out of the trade union movement, as usual you are doing what the trade unions say. Do you know what the consequences of this are? They were very well put this morning by Julie Owens, who is the HR manager at McDonald's. She was asked about the practical consequences. They ought to know, because they employ a lot of young people. I say to McDonald's that I reckon basically they do a pretty good job. I know there are tens of thousands of young  people who have had a start to their working career by working for McDonald's getting that experience, and good luck to them. Our position is that we would like more kids to have the same chance. Your position is that you will deny those young people a chance. What did Julie Owens say this morning when asked, `What would you do if you had this big increase in wages?' She said:What we would do immediately, we would have to stop recruiting people virtually immediately and assess the situation. The existing staff I think would get fewer hours. We would have to look very seriously at doing business a little bit differently to remove some of the labour from the stores, so maybe replacing it with capital.That is Labor's position: take away the jobs of young people and let's put the machines into McDonald's. As far as we are concerned, young people are entitled to a job in this country, and I tell you what: we will do all that we possibly can to secure them that opportunity.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question and the keen interest that he takes in ensuring that Australia has an equitable and fair social security safety net. Yesterday the House of Representatives passed legislation to close a loophole which has had the effect of treating New Zealand citizens differently from other migrants. As a result of this loophole, it has been possible for New Zealanders to qualify for a large range of social security benefits without effectively serving the waiting period that has been required of people from other countries.The anomaly stems from the fact that New Zealanders are not required to obtain a permanent visa before remaining permanently in Australia. So, under these new arrangements, people will be required to serve a full 104-week waiting period and they will have to serve that time in Australia. Under the  old arrangements it was possible for people to serve quite a bit of that waiting period in their own country, and that was obviously unfair. So the new rules will apply to all new residents and will provide that the waiting period start on the day that the person becomes an Australian resident and end after the person has been an Australian resident and in this country for 104 weeks. All countries and all arriving migrants will be treated the same.I am pleased to also inform the House that the New Zealand government has agreed to these new arrangements. The legislation will now go to the Senate and I trust that it will give it a speedy passage because it will save Australian taxpayers around $35 million in benefits that have been claimed because people did not have to serve the waiting period in this country.</DOC>

 - I think this is - what is it? - the third time that the agreement has been put up in a question today. I boxed it yesterday; the Democrats were boxing it. This agreement is getting a new lease of life. I say, in respect of that agreement, that the then Leader of the Democrats, now the member for Dickson, was prepared -  -  - No, in fairness to her, she was prepared to sit down - she, I believe, genuinely acknowledged that the government, in going into the 1996 election campaign, had a policy of industrial relations reform - and discuss the issues on the merits. I say that fairly. We have had our disagreements, and I must say her movement to the Labor Party rather lowered the esteem in which I held her. But, leaving that reflection on her judgment, the fact is we in the government, by and large, were happy with that agreement.Why were we happy with it? Because it was a very significant advance in workplace relations. It has always been our view that this is an area where legislative reform is important, but it is also important that employers and employees evolve better workplace relations over time. That is why we as a government are committed to an evolutionary policy on workplace reform. That has been a very successful policy. For example, the number of disputes is down to a record low.But that agreement was a whole agreement that contained the comprehensive matters which were discussed and was a full agreement and, on that basis, I think it advanced the cause. But there is also no doubt that this issue was unresolved at the time. This parliament has a responsibility to resolve the issue, and I say let us vote for jobs for young people.</DOC>

 - It is nice to get the sixth solid question asked in this question time compared with the failed attack from opposite. - I would like to make the point that there are many small, medium and large winemakers and wine producers in many country electorates - including McEwen and even the electorate of Flinders, quite apart from the electorate of Riverina and elsewhere - which are part of a great exports strategy, and full credit to the Winemakers Federation of Australia, Ian Sutton and others, who have now driven forward our wine exports over 10 years from just $15 million to $900 million of job creating export effort. I might add the additional dimension associated with this is that quite often the wine industry is about providing a lot of youth employment in regional Australia, especially in the picking season for grape and related fruits, in a way which is very positive for regional economic development.I want to salute the wine industry, which has reached the stage where for every 10 bottles of wine consumed in Australia 15 bottles are now being exported. We are exporting to France and to Italy great quality Australian wine. We are exporting to the USA and to Japan. I know their economy presents a lot of opportunity, even though it is in a trough at this time. Our exports of Australian wine to Japan rose last year by 135 per  cent - a great effort by the Australian wine industry.I know Windy Hill in the electorate of the member for McEwen and other great Yarra Valley locations have come from nowhere to everywhere in producing high quality, value added wine exports to the world. - Windy Peak? I get confused with the Bombers. Pillow talk - my wife barracks for the Bombers. -  - I am proud of my wife; I am not proud of the team she barracks for. There is also a very useful export effort opening up with regard to the cut flower industry, again from the electorates of McEwen, Riverina, Mallee and many others - $24 million worth of cut flowers now being exported from Australia. The demand for those Australian flowers has been affected by recent economic difficulties in Asia. We have just had the 12 leading Asian heads of mission here this last couple of days with Minister Downer and I examining all aspects of that. Export growth to the US and the Netherlands is particularly strong. Cut flower exports to the USA and the Netherlands increased 30 per cent last year.I am particularly pleased that exports of proteas such as those grown in Kinglake in the honourable member's electorate doubled last year. The cut flower market is a tremendous market. It is a $30 billion worldwide market and Australian industry is moving rapidly to get an enhanced share of that market, working closely with Foreign Affairs and Trade and Austrade to open up more market access and capture those markets in this lucrative trade. Austrade's Nagoya office recently coordinated an Australian stand at a Japan flower festival that attracted 120,000 visitors over three days. The City of Wagga Wagga is involved right now in a project in China to further advance flowers and related products into the Chinese market. That $24 million will double soon enough. I congratulate our outstanding exporters in cut flowers as well as the wine industry. I congratulate  our exporters in turning the tide against difficult odds at this time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge that she is very much a champion of the need for a fair slice of action in relation to access to things like education, transport and a range of things in rural areas. One of the real problems that we have faced in much of the bush in recent years has been a loss of face-to-face services, particularly in such areas as banking. When it comes to banking, studies have shown that it can have a real impact, a very serious impact, on a small rural community when the last bank pulls out - some studies suggest over $300 per capita in expenditure on an annualised basis.We as a government have been able to do some useful things in that area through, for example, the CreditCare movement. During the last election we also committed ourselves to an expenditure of $70 million over the next few years on rural transaction centres. This is  aimed at setting up in the order of 500 rural transaction centres in country towns around Australia - smaller ones, essentially those with a population of less than 3,000.This program is dependent upon the sale of a further 16 per cent of Telstra. The RTCs will not duplicate or force out existing small businesses but just the opposite: they will seek to be complementary and they will look at banking, post, Medicare Easy Claim, and phone and fax facilities. In the future I suspect, with modern telecommunications being what they are, we will be able to use them for other things such as telemedicine and extension of education services.In short, they can be very valuable. I think they can make a real difference. The problem is that Labor is prepared to put all of this at risk. It is intent upon essentially denying us the opportunity to give the Australian people a social bonus in rural Australia worth close to $700 million. This will deny people in rural Australia a further $250 million from the Natural Heritage Trust. It will deny them $150 million over three years to extend untimed local calls to those people who live outside standard zones. -  - The member for Melbourne would know a lot about living in remote parts of the country. Perhaps he would rather be like the spokesman opposite for regional services. My opposite number, during the up session, issued a defensive press statement asking, `Where is Cheryl?' -  - And the answer was, `Out in regional Australia, where she often is.' But when she was asked in her own electorate where she had been recently she said, `I have only paid one visit to regional Australia.' - Oh, two trips to regional Australia. We are talking about an extra $81 million for the RTIF - a very valuable program in remote areas of Australia. The team that you are now part of, My Opposite Number, wants to deny that to people who need those telecommunications in rural areas. -  - That is $36 million over three years to enable local call access to the Internet. -  - The member for Dickson is warned. - And so it goes on. There is $25 million for extending mobile phone coverage. These are very important and urgently needed programs in remote and rural Australia. If you had the slightest interest in doing the right thing by rural Australia in these times you would stop opposing the measure that enables us to deliver them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. I recognise the interest he shows in the issue of East Timor. There are today in some of our newspapers reports of severe shortages of rice and other essential supplies in East Timor. Our ambassador, John McCarthy, who visited  there very recently, confirms that this is the case. The honourable member will be pleased to know that I have instructed two AusAID personnel to travel to East Timor this week to investigate the immediate humanitarian needs and to recommend to the Australian government how Australia can best assist. We are fully prepared to provide assistance. I would say that we are yet to see any evidence to support claims, which are fairly widespread, of a deliberate Indonesian government policy to withhold essential supplies for East Timor.These problems in East Timor on the ground are another reason why it is so important to calm tensions in East Timor so that people there do not suffer further hardship. I am pleased that a number of reconciliation processes have been set up to try to calm tensions, including the Association of East Timorese for Peace, Xanana Gusmao's direct dialogue with pro-integrationists, Komnasham's Peace and Stability Commission and, as I noticed in the newspapers this morning, Mr Beazley's reconciliation committee.The amount of bitterness is still very substantial in East Timor and it is very important that everything be done to try to achieve reconciliation. That extends beyond the shores of East Timor, right over there into the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I cannot give the Leader of the Opposition a particularised response in respect of the trucking industry, but I can say more generally that, where industry sectors do not have junior wage rates, by and large - and it is a generalisation - there are very few young people who actually have jobs in those industries. Secondly, the government's proposal is that the insertion of junior wage rates should be a matter for the Industrial Relations Commission. This is incredible hypocrisy from the Labor Party. They are always saying, `You ought to enhance the powers of the commission, you ought to trust the commission to look after people's interests,' and when we do so they get up and complain that we have made that provision.The Industrial Relations Commission is, in our view - maybe not in yours - perfectly capable of looking after the interests of existing employees in any industry where they decide to introduce junior wage rates. It has been able to do so in the past. We believe in the commission having the capacity to do so in the future, protecting young people who are currently employed and also, more importantly - something which you are not interested in - actually giving young people the chance of a job which is currently denied by you and the ACTU.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his question. I know of his concern for older people in the community. Indeed, recently when I was with him in his electorate I saw the care and the interest which he displays for his constituents. This goes to a much broader question, that is, to the question of an ageing Australia whereby more and more of Australia's population  is going to be over the age of 65 and living into their 80s and 90s. There is a shrinking population base of younger people who will form the taxation base as we go forward into the next century.Accordingly, this government - and it is my responsibility, together with the Attorney-General - has removed the compulsory age limit of 65 for statutory office holders. This is the third such signal, the other two being the removal from our draft public service legislation of the compulsory retirement age of 65 and the putting in place of a pension deferment system whereby, from 1 July last year, any pensioners who choose to defer their pension for up to five years can in fact receive a tax-free, lump sum payment of $21,000 for that deferment.This government is very serious about seeing that older Australians have the opportunity to work longer. That deferment scheme is for full-time work, that is, at least 20 hours a week. Importantly, we want to see older Australians working longer so that we can preserve that taxation base and, indeed, involve people with the wisdom and the experience that we are currently being denied. One very worrying statistic is that Australian men between the ages of 55 and 59 are the fastest declining participants from the work force in the OECD. That is a great concern to this government. -  - Mr Speaker, you have heard of the concerns that we have for young workers, but we also have concern for older workers. If this is to be a truly civil society, Mr Prime Minister, then it is very important that this country benefits from the wisdom of older Australians. -  - If this lot over here want to disparage the wisdom and the experience of older Australians, they do so at their electorate peril!</DOC>

But can I close my contribution at question time today -  - It has been a 10 out of 10 performance, as one of my colleagues has very kindly suggested. All I say to the Labor Party, particularly to the new members, is that I was a new member myself after the second election in 1985. - That is a very wise ruling, Mr Speaker. I had not realised back then that it would be 11 years before we would get into office. I say to the new members that you can listen to the ones who sit on the front bench and lead your party, but understand that, in the end, these issues are decided on their merits and the merit of this issue is give young people a job. It is time the Labor Party understood. Put aside the ACTU. Show a bit of leadership and give young people the chance of a job.</DOC>

 - I have previously informed the House of the Carr Labor government's refusal to negotiate regional forest agreements with the Commonwealth and its refusal to supply ecological and economic data to  support its unilateral withdrawal of vast areas of forest from sustainable logging and to substantiate its consequent harvest projections. That situation remains unchanged, and there is no progress in those negotiations. It therefore follows that not one lost forest job in New South Wales and not one small business closure in the forest regions of New South Wales results from any action attributable to the Commonwealth government. The Commonwealth government is yet to come to any agreement with the New South Wales government.Honourable members will also recall that, as a result of this breach of agreement by the Carr government, I was left with no choice but to suspend the Commonwealth funding to the joint Forestry Industry Structural Adjustment Program, otherwise known as FISAP. I was confronted with the position of being asked to pay out the vendor finance before they had signed the transfer. Quite simply, the Commonwealth government is not going to fund unilateral Carr government actions upon which we have not been consulted and over which we have no control.The job losses and small business closures which will arise out of these New South Wales government decisions are clearly caused by, and are solely the responsibility of, the New South Wales government. When I discussed these matters with Minister Yeadon, he told me, `We will fund the business component of FISAP ourselves.' He later further wrote to me and said, `We have made no assumptions about the availability of Commonwealth funding in our arrangements.' - Mr Speaker, I was also asked whether people were being paid out for the jobs they have lost through these unilateral actions. - Thank you. Later he wrote to me - this is the minister in New South Wales, Mr Yeadon - and said, `We have made no assumptions about the availability of Commonwealth funding to assist in this exit payment.' The New South Wales government is now hiding behind public officials who have written to the applicants for business exit assistance. I quote from that letter:As the Commonwealth government holds the primary responsibility for business exit assistance funding, I regret to advise you that the Forestry Structural Adjustment Unit is unable to process your application at this time.Let me tell you again that the fact is that the New South Wales government - having driven people out of their employment and taken away their businesses; having been told that, because they have not concluded these agreements, they are not to get Commonwealth funding; and having said to us that they did not need it - are now getting their public servants to write to people and say, `Sorry, mate. We haven't got any money for you.' That is an outrageous situation and it stands in stark contrast to the statements made by the coalition opposition in New South Wales, who have promised to immediately reinstate negotiations on regional forest agreements so that people who do get unfortunately affected can be paid out.</DOC>

 - I have not seen those remarks of Senator Murray. -  - He may have been, but we have been looking at the employment numbers that came out today, and what excellent numbers they are. They are a reflection of the sound economic policy put in place by this government. - Let me conclude by saying that the senator is obviously mistaken. He is entitled to make a mistake. However, what he should be encouraged to do is read the discussion paper that the government put out in June 1998 before the election which spelt out our approach to this issue. Let me read it briefly because it puts an end to this silly argument about process. I can tell you that most parents are worried about whether their kids get a job. As far as agreements are concerned, this forms part of the agreement we had with the Australian people. We said this:The policy of the present Government has, since coming to office, been to continue this exemption on a permanent basis. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Bill as originally introduced into the Parliament in 1996, reflected this position. However, following discussions with the Australian Democrats when the Bill was before the Senate, the Government agreed as a temporary measure to limit the extension to a further three years, and to put in place a mechanism for the . . . Commission to review the feasibility of abolishing junior wage rates. This reflected a compromise position only agreed to by the Government as a  way of avoiding the immediate removal of the exemption. The Government's policy objective -  - The member for Hotham interjects `Whatever it takes'. I reckon it is about time that a government was prepared to walk the extra mile, to make the extra effort to give young people a chance of a job. I am proud that when it comes to giving young people the chance of job we are prepared to do whatever it takes to provide and preserve jobs for young people. I table the document. It shows you that this government's position has been crystal clear. Unlike you, we have a policy because we have the leadership, the determination and a sense of direction to look after the interests of young people.</DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable gentleman's question is yes, I can. I am delighted, as I would hope all members of this House are delighted, with the employment figures that were announced this morning by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In the past month, another 33,000 jobs were created and unemployment is now at 7.4 per cent, the lowest figure it has been since September 1990. Youth unemployment has fallen to 23½ per cent, and that is the lowest figure for youth unemployment since 1991. I am especially delighted to say that almost 80,000 jobs have been created over this summer. A total of 406,000 jobs have been created since the coalition came to power just three years ago. The number of unemployed has fallen below 700,000 for the first time since December 1990.That is the good news. The bad news is that the Labor Party has stopped it getting better. The bad news is that the Labor Party, faced with a historic opportunity to join us to drive home the advantage of a strengthening economy, has decided to stand against further  reforms. When you are doing well is the last time to relax the reform effort. The Australian economy is in a very strong and healthy condition. So far from that being an occasion for this government to down tools on the reform process, we believe that is the time to accelerate the reform process. We intend to accelerate the reform process through our historic taxation reform program which will lay the foundation for continuing strength in the Australian economy.But, more specifically on the labour market, we do have the opportunity to go further. If we were to preserve youth wages as part of the system, if we were to sweep away the job destroying consequences of the existing unfair dismissal laws, if we were to further free the Australian labour market, we could look forward over the next three years to even lower levels of unemployment. It is within our grasp.You cannot have a better conjunction of circumstances. You have got a strong economy, you have got a government determined to undertake the necessary reforms and you have got growing public support for those reforms. But standing against that coalition for the future is the party of the past - the Australian Labor Party, a party which is hogtied to its trade union roots and which only looks at these things in terms of the institutional rigidities of a system that belongs to the 1960s or the 1970s and not to the 21st century.I appeal to those in the Australian Labor Party to put aside your outdated ideology and think of the employment future of young Australians. If you think of the employment future of young Australians you will withdraw your opposition to our unfair dismissal laws and you will join us in creating an even brighter future for young Australians into the 21st century.</DOC>

It also specified the matters which were not agreed and which would then subsequently be debated in the Senate and where we would vote separately. If the Leader of the Opposition cared to read the Senate Hansard  -  - It was not one of them because it was one of the agreed matters. This might be hard for you to understand, but our policy has always been that we are in favour of young people having jobs. This is truly pathetic. Mr Speaker, I have had two out of two.

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. The  major impediment to achieving taxation reform in Australia is the Australian Labor Party - just as the major impediment to private health insurance rebates was the Australian Labor Party; just as the major impediment to fixing the budget deficit was the Australian Labor Party; just as the major impediment to lower interest rates was the Australian Labor Party; and just as the major impediment to economic reform generally is the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party is now a totally negative political force. There is nothing it stands for, it only now stands against - and it stands against nearly everything.We welcome the fact that the Australian Labor Party now says that it is ready to vote on the government's tax bills before 30 June. The government is ready to vote on those tax bills before 30 June, which by my calculation means that 65 of the 76 senators are now ready to vote on those bills. Members of the House of Representatives will know that the House of Representatives passed those bills on 2 December last year. Four Senate committees have had them already for four months - 16 months of inquiry, when the Australian Labor Party said that, regardless of the outcome of the inquiry, it would vote against the legislation and when the government is committed to putting it through. This has been an expensive matter for Australia and it has delayed the conduct of these bills.Mr Speaker, you do have to tie the Labor Party down when it makes these offers to vote. Members of the House of Representatives will recall that, as recently as August 1997, the Labor Party was saying that if the government won an election on tax it would pass the tax bills in the Senate. The ABC radio news of 25 August 1997 carried this story:The Opposition Leader, Kim Beazley's office, says if the Coalition wins a mandate at the next election to introduce the tax Labor won't seek to block the passage of the GST - The Courier-Mail  of 26 August 1997 said:If John Howard goes to the next election with a clearly and honestly described GST tax proposal and he wins the election, Labor will regard that as a mandate and not seek to block the introduction of a GST. Kim Beazley, in the Age  of 24 September 1997, said:If people vote for a GST, then they will get a GST and that's the end of it.They were assurances that were given - and they were also given in this House to me and in the newspaper by the Australian Labor Party - that a fairly won election, if the government had received an election mandate on the basis of tax, would see it implemented. - Mr Speaker, I see one of the princes royal is interjecting. - The princes royal of Batman and Reid. John Brumby - one of Labor's leading thinkers! - at a press conference on 1 February 1999 said:What you are going to see from Labor, you are going to see no hidden agenda, no secret deals, no back room tricks, every single policy will be out there up front in the election campaign. If we are elected we obviously would have a mandate to implement that. Any opposition which defied that mandate would be grossly irresponsible, derelict in its responsibility to the parliament and the people.How humiliating to be condemned out of the mouth of John Brumby. This is also the view which was put by Bob Carr on the ABC's Stateline  on 9 October 1998. For the new members of the Labor Party, this is what the Labor Party used to believe in when it had principles. Bob Carr said:My view is that a government with a majority in any lower house ought to be able to implement its program not subject to frustration by upper house, state or federal, and be judged by the people three or four years down the track.There you have Labor's present and Labor's future, Mr Brumby, all talking about mandates. You had Mr Beazley talking that way in 1997, but we all know that he can only hold his party together by negativitism, by opposition, by mindless obstructionism. I would recommend to the Leader of the Opposition that he remember his New Year's resolution. He put out a New Year's resolution on 31 December 1998 for this year. Do  you know what his resolution was, Mr Speaker? To be interesting and constructive. We would recommend it to him.</DOC>

 - The government has fully implemented the agreement that we had with the Democrats, which I must say was a pretty good agreement. I pay tribute to the member for Dickson who, as the leader of the Democrats, then was prepared to be reasonable, was prepared to deal with the government of the day and was prepared to acknowledge that the government had a mandate for the reforms which we had advocated before the 1996 election. We say to the Labor Party that the attitude that your sole frontbencher then adopted should be the same attitude that you now adopt.Not only did we have an agreement with the Democrats that we implement it in full but we went to the last election and said to the Australian people, `If you vote for us, then we will legislate to look after the jobs of young people.' We actually spelt out, in black and white on page 25 of this excellent policy, More Jobs, Better Pay. It is a very good description of what has been happing in the time that we have been in. We said this:A coalition government will legislate to permanently retain existing age-based youth wages and protect the jobs of the 420,000 young people currently employed on that basis and require the commission to ensure that all awards include junior wage rates where appropriate.That is the agreement we had with the Australian people. We believe in keeping our agreements. Not only that, but we had a clear policy. We had one policy. What did the Labor Party have at the same time? They had two policies in the space of seven days. On 4  September their policy - and I quote from the Sydney Morning Herald  - was:In short, the spokesman said Labor opposes in principle wage rates determined by age.So on 4 September they were totally opposed -  - I certainly am, Mr Speaker. The following week they changed their policy and they said they would wait for the commission. That is interesting. When the matter was in the Senate this week the Democrats said that the government's legislation should not be considered by the Senate until it had been to the commission, and where did the Labor Party vote on the deferral? They voted with us. They didn't vote against our position, they voted with us, against the Democrats. What hypocrisy. Three positions - as many positions as there are trade union leaders sitting on the front bench.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The figures today  are good figures. They are a great tribute to the Prime Minister, and the leadership that he has given. They are a great tribute to the expertise of the Treasurer. They are also a tribute to those people who won marginal seats, to see this government return and continue with the excellent economic management that it has put in place and which has seen some of the best figures that we have seen since 1990. I know members on this side will welcome that and, of course, we see the glum faces on the other side.One of the reasons why the numbers were pretty good is that we are doing better with younger people, and there is no doubt about that. We are doing better with younger people partly because we have in place a system where younger people can get a job on an age based junior rate. The consequences of Labor continually saying no to jobs for young people is that the gains that we have made are to be taken away in the middle of next year at the insistence of Mr Beazley who instructs his Labor colleagues in the Senate to vote no to every sensible measure to create jobs.On the opposition front bench we have a troika - the member for Hotham, the member for Brand and the member for Batman - against reform and against job prospects. As the Prime Minister said, things are going pretty well in the Australian economy and now is the time to take the opportunity to do better and make the structural reforms. We still have 70,000 young people unemployed. This is no time for opposition for the sake of opposition. Now is the time to drive ahead and give these people the opportunities that an economy like Australia really deserves.What is the response we get from the opposition? It is the old ploy in politics: when you're having a bad week, go on the attack. And what a bad week it has been - `Close ranks, please.' `A restless ALP.' `Beazley hits out at leadership jibes.' `Labor leaderless and rudderless.' `Brereton blamed for ALP disunity.'</DOC>

 - That measure which the member referred to in his question was added in the negotiations with the Democrats, and I am pleased that it was. The reason I am pleased that it was is that we are prepared to work very hard to ensure that we preserve junior wage rates.The issue at stake for the parliament is whether or not we provide an across-the-board blanket exemption. That is the issue. It is not a debate about the transition. The issue is whether or not you think the system now works. We believe it does; you are opposed to it. We are in favour of jobs; you are against it. We work hard on unfair dismissal to create jobs; you are opposed to it. We are trying to look after young people; you are opposed to it. We try to manage the economy better; you are opposed to it. The fact of the matter is that we are for jobs; you are against it. And a genuinely strong leader, who had a sense of the national interest, would stand up to the divisions on his own side and stand for something, stand for young people. How many questions is this? - I have had four today, I had 10 yesterday. Fourteen out of 14; we will keep the tally going.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is an interesting  question because some within the Labor Party would say this is a great article of faith for Labor MPs - that this is a matter going to the core of Labor philosophy. So you are entitled to ask: what are the state Labor governments doing? What they are doing is important because they are actually responsible for the issue, unlike a Labor opposition that has no responsibility and therefore, it seems, no sensitivity to the issue.If you look at New South Wales, for example, they have an anti-age discriminatory provision. They also have an exemption for it, but the minister can remove the exemption by proclamation. In other words, Jeff Shaw, the minister, could at any day remove junior wage rates. Why hasn't he? He has not because he has given an undertaking that he would not do so unless there was a satisfactory alternative. That is a perfectly reasonable position. There is no satisfactory alternative. He is not going into this election saying, `We are going to abolish junior wage rates.' Why would he when there is no alternative?Queensland is basically in the same sort of situation. They have an exemption. They have a Labor government. Has the Labor government there said, `This question of discrimination is so important that we are going to abolish young people's jobs as a result'? No, they have not - a state Labor government. I compliment two state Labor governments for at least having the commonsense to see that young people will lose their jobs if this measure goes through.Has there been a search for an alternative? This issue has been around for years. You can go all the way back to 1990, when the Labor minister's council - in other words, the state and federal ministers - discussed the issue, through to 1994. From 1994 to 1997 the Industrial Relations Commission conducted a working party to find an alternative - a non-discriminatory suitable alternative. They found no such alternative. There was no agreement to a practical alternative.The fact of the matter is that this is a failure of leadership, and the consequences of it are that young people will be Labor's victims as they join the unemployment queues. This is an important issue. We have  had a consistent position. I compliment the state premiers. It is about time that the Leader of the Opposition took a cue from some of his state counterparts.</DOC>

 - Thank you Mr Speaker. I thank the member for Groom for his question. Yesterday on Sydney radio, Michael Costa, who is the head of the New South Wales Labor Council, described Work for the Dole as a mickey mouse program. Funnily enough, this is the same term that has been used against the Work for the Dole program by both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Batman. Mr Costa also called for a return to the labour market programs of the former government, which again is just like the union echoes opposite.The question then arises: why might the unions and their supporters be so intent on restoring these programs? Under the labour market programs of the former government, large amounts of money were given to employ training liaison officers - in other words, taxpayer funded jobs for the boys within the union movement. - I was also asked: what role did the trade union movement have in previous labour market programs? Between 1992 and 1996, when the House of Lords opposite was in charge of the employment portfolio, $1.7 million was given to the unions to employ these liaison officers and $238,000 was given to the -  - I was asked what role did the trade union movement have in previous labour market programs. $165,000 was given to the ACTU, and I wonder whether the former minister, the member for Hotham, declared a conflict of interest then. - ' - $265,000 was given to the Australian Workers Union, which has just parachuted Ludwig Junior into the Senate to create another great Labor union dynasty. -  - I am answering the question. - So we can understand why Mr Costa called for a return of these labour market programs, because under them $140,000 was given to the Australian Metal Workers Union -  -  - The union is currently employing Andrew Scott to urge the Leader of the Opposition of the imperative to go to the left. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. This is a government which supports young Australians. It supports their right to get a job, it supports their right to freedom of association and it supports their right to freedom of choice on university campuses. This government will continue to push strongly for voluntary student unionism. I see that the unrepresentative leaders of some student associations will be campaigning and  demonstrating against the government's policy of freedom of association. In Melbourne today I understand they are planning a demonstration on the steps of the Victorian Parliament House. - It will be very interesting to see what percentage, Prime Minister, of Victoria's 182,000 students actually support the continuation of the compulsory student fee. Universities are intended to be bastions of freedom - freedom of speech, freedom of association and academic freedom. But the member for Sturt has drawn my attention to a letter sent by the administrators of the Adelaide University Union to the President of the Adelaide University Liberal Club. The letter reads as follows:The administrators are concerned that the material supporting voluntary student unionism was against the interests of the organisation to which the Liberal Club is affiliated, namely, the University Union through the Clubs Association. As a former board member, you would understand that the administrators have a duty to protect the interests of the organisation for which they are acting as caretakers. On 2 March 1999 the Adelaide University Union administrators resolved 'that distribution of pro-voluntary student unionism material will not be permitted within or around the union premises or at union sponsored events.'I table this letter.The administrators of the university union at the University of Adelaide are not only determined to force students to pay this compulsory union fee; but they are going to prevent them complaining about this compulsion and advocating an alternative system. This is a Stalinist invasion of the rights of these students, and the government's legislation for voluntary student unionism will protect the right of students to freedom of choice on campus - to choice of the association to which they belong - and their right to freedom of speech.</DOC>

My response is to indicate that of course the Commonwealth is always willing -  - to discuss in a constructive waywith the -  - with the relevant state authorities - in this case relevant ministers - their transport needs. In relation to the F3, I made the point very strongly yesterday that the great problem in New South Wales has been that, even when we have put forward resources to meet needs, they are not taken seriously enough in that state for the state government to get on and use the resources in a way that would help the people in that state.The simple fact of the matter is that, when the election in New South Wales is out of the way, I have no doubt that the government of that state will want to enter into meaningful  dialogue about the future road needs - including the F3 - in that state.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question on this matter. The member is right to be interested in the issue, because I understand there is a motion of disallowance in the Senate relating to certain regulations that were designed to facilitate the entry to Australia of parents nominated by family members in Australia in circumstances where they were prepared to commit themselves to keeping their parents in Australia.I was interested in the remarks of some of the members opposite in relation to this matter, because my recollection is that for a long time the Labor Party supported the view that parents, if they were to be sponsored for entry into Australia, would not be accessing welfare benefits in this country to which they had not contributed through the tax system. There has been maintained over a long period of time a bipartisan approach to the 10-year preclusion period for eligibility to the pension. But what the Labor Party seems to be happy to acquiesce in, judging by the comments that have been made, is the notion that, even though they might be precluded from a pension, they should be able to access other benefits shortly after arrival in Australia. - They are saying, `No.' Let me come to this. The fact is that most parents who do come to Australia at the moment under the provisions which have been in place over a long period of time tend to come from countries where there are no social welfare systems in place. The review that was carried out in relation to parents last  year demonstrated amply that access to special benefits - within six months when you were in office and, under the new preclusion periods, after two years - was obtained by a large proportion of parents entering Australia, simply because those people who had sponsored them and given assurances of support walked away from those commitments shortly after they arrived in Australia. And, if they weren't seeking access to special benefits, they were seeking access to unemployment benefits, because they were of working age.That is the reality. In response to that reality, we introduced a cap, simply because we could not afford to continue to have such a large proportion of the program, particularly for family reunion, dominated by older people. The Labor Party pretends that they are concerned about the aging of the Australian population and the cost that it is going to impose upon the Australian community as a whole. They put that out when they talk about population policy issues, and yet the fact is that what they want to do is to maximise the number of older people entering Australia who have paid no taxes to contribute to pensions in Australia, although they would have them claiming them. That is the end outcome.What we sought to do was to put in place a new visa class which had enhanced provisions for bonds and payment of medical charges. Interestingly, the cost of medical charges on average for older people entering the Australian community is $20,500, yet we are asking for a contribution of merely $5,000 towards those costs that would be undoubtedly required.These measures that we have been putting in place were in response to requests from family members who wanted to get access in Australia to their parents. In many cases this was, as I know, to help them with child minding and so on which would enable two people to go into the work force - in many cases a benefit for the families. That is what they were seeking. What we put in place was a visa class to enable that to happen and 2,000 people have applied for that visa class. The fact is you are seeking to disallow it on  the spurious argument that that would be allowing them to jump the queue.Let me make it very clear, because I do not want you to be under any illusions in relation to this matter, that I will be proposing to the government that, if this measure is knocked off, we limit under the capping arrangements quite substantially the provisions for access through the category which involves very significant welfare dependence. The cap is likely to be around 500 and I will make it abundantly clear to those people who were anxious to look after their parents in Australia under these arrangements that the opportunity was lost because the Labor Party saw fit to vote with the Democrats on this measure.</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Lilley asks a score of questions, most of which are inaccurate. Let me first deal with his question on the number of overpayments as a result of administrative error. Only 1.6  per cent of debts recovered are as a result of administrative error. So what is this nonsense about errors because people are not able to get through on the phone system? The reality is that most people on most days are able to call the call centres and get through in a reasonable period. There are occasions when there are peak loads, as Senator Newman referred to in the Senate the other day, when it is difficult for people to get through. But that is nothing particularly new.The opposition was well aware of that fact when they wrote their policy document for the last election. I know they like to read quite a few books - or do not like to read one another's books - but I would have thought that the shadow minister would have read at least one book - the opposition's own policy on the issue of Centrelink and social security service delivery because it is made abundantly clear in that policy, which I just happen to have brought into the House, that they were well aware of the fact that there were delays in peak times when people were unable to get through to Centrelink call centres.At the last election Labor proposed a rescue plan for Centrelink. Labor was going to introduce a rescue plan for Centrelink because there were times when there were peak loads and the call centres were unable to deal with the number of people ringing. So I looked through what this rescue plan actually involved. You would think that, if there was a problem in Centrelink and a need for extra staff or extra resources, the Labor Party would have told us something about where this was all coming from. I looked at the costings for the Centrelink rescue plan. In the year 1998-1999, the total cost of this rescue plan was zero; in 1999-2000 the total cost was zero; in 2000-2001 the extra resources for this rescue plan - zero; and in 2001-2002 - zero.The four-year total cost of these extra resources that Labor were going to pour into the call centres was a grand total of zero. Labor were going to do nothing. They were keeping in place the efficiency dividends which everyone expected would result from the amalgamation of the old DSS and CES. Everybody expected that there would be  savings. Labor was going to keep them. They were complaining about the system but they intended to do absolutely nothing about it. So when the member for Lilley complains about delays in the call centres, he should talk to his constituents and tell them that Labor intended to do nothing about it.By contrast, we have doubled the number of employees in the call centres, opened seven new call centres and extended the hours of operation of the call centres by more than one hour every day. We do not close Centrelink offices for half a day a week as happened under the opposition. Indeed, the services provided by this government are a vast improvement on what was offered under Labor.When we talk about what is provided, let us remember that this is the government that is delivering real resources to the call centres, providing a massively increased capacity to deal with the many calls that come in because, as Senator Newman said in the other place, the centres are popular. People do like to call them because they provide a wonderful opportunity to transact business in the simplest possible way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and recognise his interest in this issue, particularly in the issue of employment opportunities for young Australians in rural Australia. On a day like today, when we see a record low level of unemployment at 7.4 per cent with 33,000 new jobs being created, it should be noted that, yes, the National Farmers Federation are concerned about the state of play as far as job opportunities for young people in rural Australia are concerned. They noted in a press  release that the unfair dismissal laws in particular are holding back job creation. Farmers are reluctant to look beyond their families for labour when there is a risk that the employee might misuse the system after working with the farmer for a short period of time.We should also recognise, on the day when we see the lowest level of unemployment in over a decade, that it is the Labor Party that is opposed to the changes that we wanted to introduce to unfair dismissal; it is the Labor Party that is opposed to the youth employment bill that is going to provide the flexibility for young job seekers to gain employment in rural Australia. This week we have heard debated in this place the actions of the unions in New South Wales that have seen the torpedoing of Work for the Dole projects - and one of them just happened to be in my electorate - where 20 young people could not get access to a Work for the Dole program.These actions being taken by the Labor Party across Australia and in particular in New South Wales are seeing opportunities lost for young job seekers across Australia. It is time that the people of Australia recognised, as has been pointed out today, that the greatest impediment to jobs growth in Australia, particularly for young job seekers in rural Australia, is the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I did see something to that effect in one of the newspapers this morning. Of course, as I have already told the House, there is no error whatsoever in the costings of the government's package, nor has one been identified. I also made the point  earlier - when I think it was the Leader of the Opposition who asked about this matter - that the Insurance Council of Australia wanted more beneficial treatment in relation to unearned premium reserve and in relation to payouts in respect of events before 1 July 2000. That is, they wanted to be able to claim input tax credits in relation to events before the application of the legislation. Why the Labor Party would support such a proposition I don't know, except to illustrate the point that the Labor Party stands for nothing but populist oppositionism.The NRMA will, like all other businesses, be subject to supervision from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. If the NRMA seeks to take price rises on the basis of a tax system that does not apply then it, as a corporation - if it were to say that is what it is doing - would be engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct in breach of the Trade Practices Act, and the remedies that lie under that act for misleading and deceptive conduct would lie against that company as long as they lie against any other company.</DOC>

 - First of all, I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest in this important issue. This government has a very proud record on arms control and disarmament ranging from our salvation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and our activities promoting disarmament in Iraq, through to the ratification by this government of the Ottawa Convention on Landmines.We are certainly not resting on our laurels and we are deeply concerned about biological weapons. Both the Prime Minister and I announced last year an initiative to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention by  accelerating negotiations on a verification protocol. This is designed to ensure that countries do not cheat on their biological weapons convention obligations.The honourable member will be interested to know that today I convened the national consultative group on the Biological Weapons Convention, which represents the biotechnology industry, academia, and the scientific and defence communities. This is a forum to exchange information on the negotiations on a verification protocol on biological weapons, and it is just another example of the government's commitment to community consultations in the negotiation of treaties. In conclusion, let me say that we as a government are aware that 30 kilograms of anthrax could kill 100,000 people in a 10-kilometre square radius. We have to be active on this issue. We have to do what we can to ensure that the Biological Weapons Convention works.</DOC>

 - After the election, with the cabinet reshuffle, as is obvious, I took up responsibilities for employment. The maritime section had previously been with Transport, and it was deemed by the Prime Minister to be appropriate for it to return to Transport. I believe it is true that we have in my office retained responsibility for those legal actions. - The reason is obvious. It is fairly obvious that the action is against me, and people on my staff have been closely associated with the case. I think it does, however, provide me with the opportunity to say that, as a result of the dispute, not only has the share price of the Patricks organisation tripled but productivity is over 100 per cent. - No, enough's enough.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I know it has been a matter of concern for quite a while for members in the North Coast region of New South Wales and in particular, of course, to the member for Richmond, the Hon. Larry Anthony. And well they might be concerned, because it has now been more than three years since the federal government made a commitment to jointly fund the upgrade of this piece of road. We made it because that upgrade is desperately needed. Tragically, there have been some eight deaths already on that stretch of road this year. By bypassing the Burringbar Range, the new motorway will provide a shorter and more direct route than the present notoriously dangerous section of road. It will improve safety and reduce travel times in northern New South Wales, and it  will be particularly valuable at peak holiday seasons.The honourable member asked what impediments there are to the rapid construction of this road. I can think of two major impediments straight off. The first is that the current New South Wales Labor government has displayed a remarkable lack of commitment to this, and the second is the once federal Labor member for that area, Neville Newell. I note that he is particularly keen now to become a state member of parliament. He wants to become the member for Tweed. But at the time that he was a federal member, at the time that he was in this place, he was after a few green votes and was utterly opposed to the upgrading of this stretch of road. In those days he did not want to see it go ahead.The tragedy of this piece of upgrading is that it was due for completion by now. It should have been completed this year. Here we are in March 1999, and we have only just got the New South Wales government calling for preliminary tenders for this road. You have Premier Carr claiming that he is fast-tracking this upgrading. All that can be said is that he has been fast-tracking it to nowhere for the past three years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his question. There was a lot said by Mr Keating at the weekend but one statement was unequivocally true. According to the Canberra Times , Mr Paul Keating expressed his deepest contrition for the infamous recession we had to have. For the first time, I think, in nine years, we had a senior Labor figure admit to the way in which the Labor Party ran the country into the recession and the damage that it did to ordinary Australians who were thrown out of work as a result. Mr Keating said:There was a lacerating recession which bore down heavily on people who deserved better, many of whom had accommodated the economic changes, seized the new economic opportunities, who had put their faith in us.After nine years it is appropriate that Mr Keating apologise on behalf of the Labor Party for putting Australia into recession. As I said in the House when we last met, it was a recession which cost Australia dearly. It is only now after nine years that we have got unemployment back to 7½ per cent after Labor took it to 11.3 per cent in that lacerating recession.I think it is appropriate that Mr Keating apologise, but I also think it appropriate that the minister responsible for employment at the time apologise. There was no show without a cabinet. It was not just Mr Keating who was in charge of the 1990 recession. His then employment minister was none other than the Leader of the Opposition, who was responsible for an unemployment rate of 11.3 per cent. As Mr Keating said:There were a couple of moments of drift and some policy mistakes . . .  I do not think the Leader of the Opposition can ever stand up and talk about an economic plan for Australia until he first apologises for the damage he did as employment minister. If Mr Keating has shown the way, it is time that Mr Beazley followed. In addition to that, members of the House would have seen Michael Warby in the Financial Review  today make the point, quite rightly:Paul Keating PM was the worst fiscal manager of the Commonwealth budget since the Second World War, possibly since federation . . . The government is working on producing a surplus budget for 1999-2000. The record of Paul Keating PM and his defenders on the other side of the parliament was, in three budgets, a cumulative deficit of $40 billion - $40 billion.But, again, I say this: no Prime Minister failed the fiscal test without the active assistance of a finance minister. And the finance minister - who turns his back whenever he is embarrassed to face the music - responsible for a federal fiscal deficit of $40 billion in three years was none other than the Leader of the Opposition. What a record! An all time Australian record for unemployment, an all time Australian record on federal fiscal deficits, standing shoulder to shoulder with Paul Keating as he produced a lacerating recession, and the Labor Party wants to make him their leader.He gave a speech to CEDA last week to try to set out his economic policy. He posed 19 questions and gave no answers. We are reliably informed that there were six businessmen who paid to hear it, and the Labor frontbench was rolled out to fill out the audience at the CEDA speech, led by the glimmer twins who managed to get their photos on the TV news. No wonder there were only six; in fact, we might actually be surprised there were six. $40 billion deficit, 11.3 per cent - Mr Keating has apologised, why doesn't the Leader of the Opposition?</DOC>

 - The honourable member for Lilley is out to get his picture on the television screens again I notice. - He is becoming somewhat famous for chasing the TV cameras around the countryside. I notice that he was even prepared to endure the Leader of the Opposition's speech to get his picture on the television cameras. This morning, he chased the TV cameras out to Tuggeranong just so that he could somehow or other get some kind of exposure. We read at the weekend how he comes into the House of Representatives three times every morning so that he can get more doorstops. - The reality is that the government is proposing and has put before the House a tax reform package which provides real benefits to all Australians. It provides benefits to those who live in mobile home parks, those who live in caravan parks, those who live in other rented accommodation and those who live in houses, and the benefits that are being provided are comprehensive. There are real pension rises and there are real increases in other benefits, including rental assistance. Has the honourable member for Lilley yet got it through his head that amongst the many benefits that will increase will be rent assistance? So if there is to be an increase in rentals in some areas, that will be covered by the increased rent assistance that this government is offering as a part of its comprehensive package. The reality is that those who live in mobile home parks will share with other Australians in the visionary tax measures that this government is putting before the Australian people, which contrast remarkably with the vacant policy proposals put forward by the opposition at the last election and by the Leader of the Opposition in his 19 questions that he put to the people in Melbourne recently.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question. There have been some proposals in recent times about unemployment. Of course, the only truly concrete and substantial proposals in respect of unemployment are the proposals that the government has had before this chamber. For example, our proposal to protect the jobs of young people - that is a real measure not only to protect jobs but also to create jobs; our measure for unfair dismissals, to give small business a fair go and encourage them to go out and employ more people - 50,000 jobs as a result; the work we are doing to strengthen the Australian economy - tax reform, fiscal policy. These are the things that really count to provide people with real jobs.I was interested to see a statement in the last week by the Leader of the Opposition - his so-called proposal on unemployment - remembering that he is the person who has been orchestrating the opposition to all the real measures that really would help. But he had something to say about unemployment. It  does not take long to read what he had to say about unemployment - it was in one sentence of 35 words. It was the so-called jobs bonus.We have obviously been having a look at that proposal. It was contained in a speech that had 17 questions. You would think that, when you have been Leader of the Opposition for three years, it is about time you actually have a few concrete proposals. Why was it that we saw this speech? He had had a bad week the week before, so the advisers said, `We'd better put a few ideas in the speech on Tuesday because it is being elevated as a test to his leadership.' Well, it was a test he failed.Take this jobs bonus proposal, for example. It is a bonus available after six months. So if you get a job within the six months you are penalised for the fact that you have done well to get a job. For many people who do not get a permanent job but get a part-time job, it is important that they get a foot in the door. If you have an opportunity for a job, I say: take it. It may not be a permanent job but, if you have been unemployed for a period of time, just getting a job and having the discipline of that work and experience gives you something for your CV; it gets you on the way.This was just an ill thought out proposal from the Leader of the Opposition, who has no policy positions and is pushed around by the ACTU. The 52 per cent of his frontbench who are trade union hacks control his position. So what was the outcome? According to the Courier-Mail: `Beazley skips hard choices in his vision'. The Financial Review: `Mr Beazley's narrow vision' and it describes it as `deeply unconvincing'. And the Financial Review comment piece: `A leader short on substance'. It is a long list. - I thought I was asked how the proposal had been received. It was not received well because it was shallow, it was a gimmick and it was not directed to providing a real solution. I think most Australians are going to say that it is passing strange that here is Mr Beazley with an ill thought out proposal in respect of unemployment, yet it is the same Leader of the Opposition that has been opposing sensible measures that really would do something for the unemployed.</DOC>

 - I have already answered that question in substance. The states have been made a very generous offer by the Commonwealth under the housing agreement which would give them secure funding for the next four years. That provides them with considerable capacity to provide for the public housing needs of people in their states.I would remind honourable members opposite that, under the government's proposal, the full revenue coming from the GST also goes to the states. So, if the states want to set a different rental level for the properties that they make available to low income earners, it is entirely within their capacity to do so. Do not come to us with stories about the effects  of these matters. You talk to your Labor colleagues about what they are going to do about rent on their properties. You talk to them about what they are going to do with the GST revenue that is being given to them by the Commonwealth. And remind them also of the increased social security benefits that this government will be providing to pensioners and welfare beneficiaries to ensure that their standard of living is not only maintained but actually improved under the new taxation arrangements. The coalition were the only parties that went to the last federal election with a commitment to raise pensions in real terms. - The question has been fully and completely answered.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question and also for his interest in Work for the Dole projects in his electorate. I am aware of an article in today's Age  suggesting political interference in the allocation of Work for the Dole projects in Victoria. The article suggests that there have been too many projects in coalition seats. The article has an ALP frontbencher, Senator Faulkner, saying that Work for the Dole is being exploited for political purposes. This really is a bit rich. First, the ALP say that Work for the Dole is punishment, now they complain that they are not getting enough of it. Work for the Dole projects are not handed down from on high; community organisations must submit applications. In this area, the government has learned from the mistakes of members opposite. These applications are assessed by departmental officers, who evaluate the needs of local communities, local labour market conditions and the pool of potential participants. Ministers are informed of successful projects only after they have been recommended by an independent national selection committee and approved by a senior departmental officer.I have been asked about reasons for Labor electorates possibly missing out, and the obvious explanation is that local ALP members are not encouraging community groups in their electorates to apply. In particular, I am quoting now from a letter from ALP frontbencher the member for Barton, who has written to a potential Work for the Dole sponsor in his electorate. I quote:The Labor Party's opposition to the work for the dole project is that it does not provide accredited skills. Accordingly, what is happening is that 18 year old unemployable people are going into work for the dole programs and coming out 18½ year old unemployable people.This is an absolute smear against people who are doing the right thing by themselves and their community, and it is dead wrong because 42 per cent of participants in the pilot scheme have gone on to paid work or further education or training. This is a significantly better job outcome and it is a significantly better outcome for taxpayers than comparable Working Nation programs. - Thirty-two went on to paid employment and 10 per cent went on to further education or training. The article in the Age  suggests that the electorates of Batman and Scullin have unfairly missed out on Work for the Dole projects. I am advised by my department that in the labour market region covering these electorates insufficient applications were received to provide places for the number of eligible clients. I would suggest to the members for Batman and Scullin, whom I note are both members of the Miscellaneous Workers Union, that if they  were more focused on local organisations and less focused on the unions they would get more Work for the Dole places, and job seekers in their electorates would be much better off. - They are confidential notes, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I was pleased to see the member for Canberra present at the opening of the Tuggeranong Centrelink office. She  actually brought along a little bit of glimmer to perform in front of the TV cameras for the occasion. But it is perhaps a little unfortunate that the member for Canberra would so blindly follow the member for Lilley and mimic every phrase or press release that he suggested to members that they put out. Last week the member for Lilley tried to encourage backbench members behind him, who might be perhaps attracted to his deputy leadership challenge, to put out a media release about delays. - Mr Speaker, the question was about delays at Tuggeranong Centrelink office, and the member for Canberra put out a media release last week in which she referred to this very issue. - The royal society for the protection of the CPSU has really been busy today. The honourable member for Lilley sent  out a media release to alert all of the media to be there so that he could make some allegations about delays in the Tuggeranong office. So who was it that organised the media show? Actually, it was the member for Lilley. But the reality is that when the member for Canberra put out her media release last week -  - The member for Canberra quite foolishly just mimicked and duplicated the media release put out by the member for Lilley talking about delays in getting appointments at the Tuggeranong office. The reality is that the Tuggeranong office has a very good record at the present time. If anyone needs an appointment at the Tuggeranong Centrelink office they will get it tomorrow, and at other Canberra offices in some cases they can even get it the same day. - The reality is that since this government has been in office there have been substantial advances in the quality of service being provided by Centrelink, and those advances will be improved as a result of new offices like the one at Tuggeranong. You complain about waiting periods. Under Labor, people stayed in queues, lined up day after day after day. - There is now an appointment system in place which enables Centrelink customers to come to their office at a time suitable to them and to Centrelink, unlike under Labor when people queued up out in the street day after day. If they came on a Wednesday they did not get in at all because the offices were closed on Wednesday afternoons. This government has taken decisive steps to improve the service delivery and to cut the waiting times associated with it.At the end of the question the member for Canberra referred to insulting the Centrelink staff. The reality is that the member for Canberra is insulting Centrelink staff and in particular the hardworking staff at Tuggeranong who have gone to such lengths to improve the service in that centre when she is the very member who should be representing them. The member for Canberra is the one who is cultivating aggression and endeavouring to undermine the excellent work that Centrelink is doing. She should be ashamed of herself and not take her lead from the member for Lilley.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to advise the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that last Friday the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts and I announced the government's successful sale of the National Transmission Network for $650 million. I am sure all honourable members  would know that the National Transmission Network transmits radio and television programs around Australia for the ABC and SBS for the various regional telecasters and broadcasters from some 560 sites. The price of $650 million was a remarkable outcome for taxpayers and, like all of such sales, it will serve to reduce government debt and to ensure that the interest payments are reduced as well. Every time interest payments are reduced it allows the government to focus on providing services in those core areas for government of education, social welfare and health, and other areas of importance.The new owner, NTL Australia, has guaranteed that there will be a continuation of all existing services at the current service levels. This means protection for community broadcasters, for emergency service operators and for self-help transmission groups and many of these, as all honourable members would know, are in regional and remote Australia. The new owner has also committed to provide some $5 million for a regional communications partnership to provide for and upgrade infrastructure outside the major cities. NTL has assured the government that it anticipates maintaining employment levels in both management and operation of the networks. Importantly, it recognises the need to maintain staff in regional Australia for maintenance and to quickly and efficiently fix any transmission problems.NTL is a world leader in managing communications infrastructure and as such it will embrace the challenge to managing the change from analog to digital networks. That means that NTL has an opportunity to deliver integrated television, Internet and data communications to all Australians, particularly those in rural and regional Australia. This sale by the government is a win for taxpayers and a win for regional Australia.</DOC>

 - Talk about being hit by a wet lettuce leaf. - There is a total lack of any glimmer of hope for the future. There have been a number of new Centrelink offices now opened around Australia which reflect the new service model being provided by the organisation. Centrelink is proud of those offices and they are naturally keen to display them to the community as a part of the open door of Centrelink in encouraging the participation of people so they can appreciate the excellent work and service that is being provided by the government's one-stop shop model. So it is appropriate that people should be invited from the community to participate at the opening.I was pleased that there was an audience present. I might add that it included the member for Canberra who seems to not be pleased that she has a nice new Centrelink office in her electorate. I am sure there are many members behind me who would be happy to have that kind of facility in their electorate, and we are moving towards providing them as well. 	This opening helped to attract attention to the excellent work that Centrelink staff are doing and the excellent quality of service that is now being provided. It also helped to demonstrate the enormous  improvement that there has been since the sad old days when Labor's Department of Social Security was administering these programs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for a question with some substance at last. - Pensioners will receive in their next pay packet a pension increase, a direct result of this government's policies to improve the living standards of pensioners and other welfare beneficiaries. From the first payment after 20 March, single pensioners will receive an extra $4.10 and married couples an extra $3.50 each. Those are increases which would not have happened under Labor. That is the key thing. They would not have happened under Labor. -  - Whilst Labor did provide for CPI rises, which we have continued, we have also given a second guarantee to pensioners that we will not allow the benefit to fall below 25 per cent of average weekly earnings -  -  - A guarantee that Labor never provided. Pensioners will be grateful for that commitment because, were it not for that double commitment -  -  - As a result of this commitment by the government to provide at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings to pen  sioners, this rise is much more substantial than it otherwise would have been. Pensioners know that it is the coalition government which is good for their incomes and which guarantees them real improvements in the standard of living. We are the only parties, that also made a commitment at the last election to provide a real increase to pensioners and to beneficiaries. It is the coalition parties that are committed to giving pensioners a fair go. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, and I stand by the comments that I made last year during the election campaign. I remember quite clearly the radio debates that we were conducting with the member for Hotham at the time on this particular issue. In fact, already this government's policies have seen the price of petrol in regional Australia fall. In my electorate alone, I am aware that the retail price of petrol has fallen from 79c to 72c. Apply the  equation under our tax reform package to that, and it will fall even further.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bradfield for his question. I know of his deep concern with the issue of drugs and how they are adversely affecting the lives of many young people.I am aware of the publication to which he refers. It is an article entitled `Notes on injecting drugs', with subheadings such as `Mixing up your drugs', `Tools you'll need' and `Getting started'. This article was funded and published by the student union of the University of Technology, Sydney. It appeared in an orientation guide which was funded by a compulsory student union fee of $222 per student. This article is an example of how students can be compelled, and are being compelled at present, by compulsory union fees to fund articles which must be very damaging in the guidance that they give to many young people.We are losing too many of our young Australians to illegal drugs at the present time. We should be advising young people on how to avoid drugs, not giving them advice on how to use them, how to find a vein, the best location for injection, how to mix up drugs and how much to pay for them. I want to say in this context that I am disappointed that the new chancellor at the University of Technology, Sydney, found fit in his inaugural speech the other day to endorse the system  of funding which facilitates these irresponsible articles.The government believes that many students would dissociate themselves from this kind of publication and those students should have a choice whether or not to contribute to it. This government believes in voluntary student unionism; it believes that students should have a choice as to whether or not they fund publications such as this. The legislation that we have introduced into this parliament will be an important safeguard against irresponsible publications of this kind.Let me conclude by saying that this government is firmly opposed to the use of illicit drugs. We condemn the publication of this kind of material in an orientation handbook. And I challenge the Labor Party to withdraw its support for the compulsory fees which fund publications of this kind.</DOC>

 - What I did say a while ago was that our government's policies have seen downward pressure on prices right now. We have continued to maintain that, as a result of the implementation of the tax reform package, there would be no net increase in the price of fuel. - As a result of the tax reform package. We continue to argue that because you will not accept the reduction in the costs of transport that will be applied to that as well, and the other policy areas. You will not accept that.But what we are not hearing is: what is the Labor Party's policy on this? They have not got any policy at all on improving the taxation system in Australia. All they are doing is trying to undermine and block what this government is trying to do to improve the taxation system in Australia. The Labor Party have no policy to improve it at all.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for the question. It gives me the opportunity to draw attention to the fact that some people have a rather narrow perspective of unauthorised arrivals in Australia and wish only to focus on one aspect: that is, the sometime clandestine arrivals that we see on our shores. I think it is important to recognise that the unauthorised arrivals that occur in Australia come in some respects by boat, but those numbers have been declining. More frequently, they are a result of people coming here on tourist visas or working while they are lawfully in Australia and becoming unlawful as a result.In relation to dealing with unauthorised arrivals by boat, it is important to focus on the objective of the people seeking to come here. We know that some people who come  have protection visa claims in mind. We know that others who come have other purposes in mind. There was a boat arrival just before Christmas at Cobourg Peninsula, where 52 people arrived. One woman drowned, sadly, and numbers of others put their lives at risk. But they were led to believe by people smugglers that there were opportunities here to work on the Olympics site, and there were also suggestions that there may be a form of amnesty associated with political change here in Australia.If you are going to address these matters, you need to have a comprehensive approach in place. We have that in seeking to interdict vessels before they arrive in Australia, and we are remarkably successful in relation to that. I think we have had something like 102 arrivals over the last four years, of which only three have come without us formally interdicting them before they reached our shores. It is also important to have intelligence measures in place, which we have implemented in the last budget in relation to people who come by air. We have officers in overseas posts checking visa issuants and dealing with those matters in an appropriate way. We need to have in place measures to address the very significant people smuggling that is happening not only here but also abroad.We also need to have in place a system which ensures that if people have entered Australia they can be removed quickly and promptly if they have no bona fide claims to be here. The only way in which you can do that is with the sort of cooperation that we gave the former government when they were in office. We supported the changes they wanted to judicial review in the introduction of part 8 of the migration system. We supported other legislation to ensure that Vietnamese asylum seekers whose claims had been considered elsewhere were removed by legislation rather than by making further applications in Australia.The courts of the land have taken an expansive view of the refugee convention, and the convention itself is being abused by large numbers of asylum seekers. We have seen claims now approaching 700 during the course of a year, up very considerably from  the sorts of claims that you were experiencing when you were in office when you thought these matters needed to be addressed. We would have thought that, rather than trying to make a cheap political shot over a weekend, you would be giving considered attention to the sorts of reforms that would maintain a comprehensive approach in place, and you would be giving support to our legislative changes to deal with the problems associated with judicial review.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question, because I know of the concern that she has for older people in her electorate. I know that she is concerned that the reforms that this government brought in are being overseen by the department, this review and me. The fact is that the people are a bit smarter than the Labor Party ever gave them credit for. In 1997 when these reforms were brought in they were clearly needed. Despite the dishonest, rancorous, misleading  campaign lodged by the Labor Party, this review has shown that the people saw there was a need for the reforms to be brought into place.Anecdotal evidence has been sought from the focus groups. Some 500 people have taken part in 17 locations in remote and rural Australia. I have had the first six-monthly report from these focus groups, which will give a very good lead to the next six-monthly report that Professor Gray will deliver to me in July. The bottom line is that these reforms were clearly seen to be needed by the people involved in aged care and we will continue to make sure that we deliver excellent care for older Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Labor's obstruction of the further privatisation of Telstra flies in the face of the opposition leader's own comments on the obstruction role of the Senate. I find it very hard to know how the member can oppose the privatisation of Telstra in light of his leader's recent comments on what is the proper role of the Senate in regard to key pieces of legislation.But, leaving that aside, the best thing that the Labor Party can do for rural and regional Australia is to pass the legislation presently before the Senate, because there is $671 million available for rural and regional Aus  tralia on that privatisation. It will go to telecommunications and regional environmental repair work. In one hit, in a single overnight action, we can significantly upgrade and even revolutionise the infrastructure for regional Australia. That is what it boils down to. Of course, there is not going to be a significant privatisation without expert advice of a kind. But I can assure you - knowing the Minister for Finance and Administration and the Treasurer - it will be the absolute and barest minimum, as our record in government shows. Labor has the balance of power. It has abrogated its power, yet its leader pontificates about the responsible role of the Senate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. There is a lot to be said about what the government is doing in implementing its reforms, because small business is terribly important. The small business community have been creating more jobs. The more help you give them in a reasonable way, the more jobs you will see. I compliment the member for Dunkley. He is the member for all the people in Dunkley but he is a great advocate for small business in Dunkley and right across the Mornington Peninsula. It is very important that they have a strong voice in the parliament, and he has done that.It is a copybook classic case of good policy making: we had the Reid committee. We announced the results of the Reid committee. We introduced the legislation and we passed the legislation. We have set up a disputes mediation adviser and we have given more funds to the ACCC. The ACCC is taking complaints on the unconscionable conduct provisions. I believe there is a test case already under way. We also have small business ACCC specialists in each state to help small business. This is a classic case where we said we would look after small business, where we had a clear policy and  where we have ploughed ahead with the implementation of that policy for the benefit of small business. This Prime Minister and this government are unashamedly pro small business.</DOC>

 - I have learnt from long and bitter experience never to accept an interpretation of another document given to me by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Let me say that the taxation package will make an enormously positive contribution to the Australian economy. It will add to the growth prospects of the Australian economy, and I am glad that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has mentioned wages growth, because one of the proud boasts of the government I lead is that real wages have risen in a non-inflationary fashion. - Under my government, real wages have risen. Under the coalition government, Australian workers are better off, not worse off - as they were under 13 years of your government. They have had real wage rises. - I pass from the real wage rises to the issue of compensation for pensioners, which was very germane to the honourable gentleman's question. I would remind him that under our arrangements everybody will be 1½ per cent ahead of the CPI impact - not 1½ per cent behind, not equal, not half a per cent ahead, but 1½ per cent ahead. I say that also for the benefit of the honourable member for Cowper, who reminded me of that this morning.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bradfield who, along with many members on both sides of the House, has displayed an interest in policies to fight the drug menace within the community. Last Thursday I had the chance in Melbourne to announce the details of $20 million of the $290 million allocated to the Tough on Drugs strategy. This $20 million went to community organisations providing treatment, rehabilitation services and support for people affected by drugs. It is money that will go to more than 50 voluntary and community agencies and it supplements about $30 million allocated in a similar fashion, details of which were announced several months ago by my colleague the Minister for Health and Aged Care.The great key to the Tough on Drugs strategy lies in the partnership between voluntary and community agencies, churches, schools, parents, local communities, health professionals, law enforcement officials and governments. The government is committed  to this partnership and to working harder than ever to tackle the drug problem on all fronts.It is important that what the federal government does in this area is supplemented and matched by state governments. I am pleased to note, on both sides of the political divide in Australia, recent initiatives at a state level that are extremely encouraging. The Queensland government and the Queensland Premier have taken a number of very positive initiatives. One of those is the establishment of a school drug education strategic plan to ensure that no student leaves school without understanding the dangers of illicit drugs. I congratulate the Queensland government and the Queensland Premier on that particular initiative. I also congratulate the Queensland government on boosting the methadone program in that state by some $1.3 million. Moving to New South Wales and on to the other side of the political divide, I was particularly pleased to note the announcement made yesterday by the Leader of the New South Wales Opposition, Mrs Kerry Chikarovski -  -  - I see. Apparently it is all right to say something nice about a Labor Premier but it is not possible to say something complimentary about a New South Wales opposition leader. It shows how absolutely factional this mob really is.Let me go on to say that she made a commitment to provide around 4,000 extra rehabilitation bed places a year for non-government organisations at a cost of $34 million. Through the cacophony of negative reactions from Labor members opposite, let me remind those opposite that, if implemented, this proposal will overcome a very critical shortage of rehabilitation services in that state. I understand 4,000 is the largest offer of rehabilitation places made at any state level in relation to this particular problem. In the bipartisan spirit, I congratulate the Queensland Labor Premier and I congratulate the New South Wales Liberal opposition leader for their respective initiatives.</DOC>

 - I would have thought the answer was self-evident: members of the Casey electorate have good representation. -  - My political future is fine, sport, unlike yours. I would worry about yours if I were you. -  - What the honourable member seems not to understand is that this was the second round of a two-round process. The first round was in August last year. The second round was in March this year. In fact, I specifically intervened in the first round of projects last year to ensure that one project in her electorate got funded that would not have been funded otherwise.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Longman for his question. As most members would know, this government has put in place a very profound series of structural changes to the Australian economy which are now reaping benefits for wage and salary earners. It was this government which took a budget deficit of $10 billion and put the Australian budget into surplus. This is the second year of surplus budgeting. It was this government that entered into a new monetary  agreement with the Reserve Bank of Australia which has given Australia credibility in relation to monetary policy and has given us historically low margins on Australian 10-year bond rates. It is in a context of a productive economy with labour market changes and competition policy that we are now beginning to see benefits for Australians generally. Whereas the stock markets of Singapore and Hong Kong today are about 20 per cent or 25 per cent below their levels of January 1997, the stock market in Australia is about 20 per cent above its level in January 1997 with the Australian All Ordinaries going through the historic 3,000 mark earlier today.Australia is now becoming one of the great share owning democracies of the world: 32 per cent of adults in Australia have direct shareholdings - greater than Canada, greater than the UK and second only in the world to the United States. One of the big changes as a result of structural change in the Australian economy is the fact that under this government productivity has increased by a quantum step. Compared with Labor where productivity growth was about 1½ per cent per year, productivity growth under this government has been 2.8 per cent per annum. What this means is that this government has been able to sustain increases in real wages. I think this is a very important point particularly for the Labor Party to understand. Labor policy was to depress real wages. The essential object of the accords was to make real wages lower. That is where Labor differs from the coalition. We want to make wages higher. It is our policy to have higher real wages based on increased productivity. John Edwards, a Labor Party economist and biographer to Paul Keating - Labor Party icon and one time pig dealer - said:I think this expansion is going to be much more durable and it will be much more durable because productivity is three times as high over this expansion as it was in the eighties.In this financial year, 1998-99, the government forecast a growth rate of 3¼ per cent. I think I can say with some surety that we will exceed our forecast. To the end of calendar year 1998, the Australian economy grew at 4.7 per cent through the year. It has always been our belief that calendar year 1999 would  be a trough with a resumption of growth in the year 2000. That is certainly still our thinking, but it will be a trough off a much higher base. We do not believe that we will be sustaining world record growth rates through calendar year 1999. But, if the Australian economy should slow in 1999-2000 to levels in the two per cent, we would be slowing to the maximum growth rate of the OECD and a growth rate in excess of the G7 average.It would be exceptional for Australia in the midst of an Asian downturn to slow its growth to the averages of the developed world and to an average in excess of the G7. For Australia, a slowing in growth will mean that we will only be exceeding average industrialised growth rates by a smaller margin than we currently are.There are no grounds for complacency. The government believes that it is important to keep the budget in surplus. The government wants to continue with its debt reduction program. With the privatisation of Telstra, this government can extinguish Labor's debt. We stand on the threshold of an opportunity to extinguish all of the debt that Labor ran up over its period of government. We could take Australia into the next century Commonwealth government debt free. What that would mean is that none of the taxes of tomorrow would have to go to servicing the Labor debt of yesterday. The kids of tomorrow would get an opportunity to have their taxes going on their schools and hospitals and roads rather than on the failures of the Beazley-Keating Labor years. What an opportunity for Australia. What an opportunity for us to grasp. What an opportunity for economic growth in the future. That is the benefit which good economic management brings.</DOC>

 - The situation remains - and I know that the Leader of the Opposition does not like it - that there has been a spectacular growth in real wages under this government. That means that under this government wage and salary earners have been greatly enriched. Under this government wage and salary earners have had a double bonanza. Firstly, they have had real wage rises. In other words, their incomes have risen based on productivity improvements and not based on an unsustained wages blow-out. Secondly, and of equal importance, they have had the benefit of reductions in interest rates. - The man who knew so little about interrelationships that he left us with a $10½ billion deficit. A man who knew so much -  - Before I move further into the question of the CPI, let me just again remind the Leader of the Opposition that when you had control of the treasury bench Australian workers were made worse off. They were made worse off because you drove  interest rates to a record high. You drove unemployment to a record high. You left us with a record high national debt. - The comparison is very stark. I know it is very painful for those opposite that the professed champion of the worker left the worker worse off and you have had to watch the worker being made better off for three years by the policies of this government. - I have almost forgotten what the question was, but I think it had something to do with the adequacy of compensation. Let me say that, if you have a compensation plan that leaves you always 1½ per cent ahead of CPI increases, it is not a bad compensation plan.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question, and I note that he represents his exporters strongly. Next Friday, there will be the official opening by the Prime Minister of extensions to the magnificent Roxby Downs mines - a very big engineering feat and challenge. I congratulate all involved and wish them well with their export effort. -  - Hypocritically you did, because you had a three-mine uranium policy -  - which you then closed a blind eye to. - Backflip Beazley, out of your CEDA speech last week, if you are going to intervene. I was taunted by the Leader of the Opposition. I wanted to give his speech some currency - because it has had none - where he referred to trade liberalisation and rejected the Simon Crean line on tariffs.The government has taken a number of steps to withstand the move towards backsliding on trade liberalisation around the world. Bilaterally we have proceeded with a number of key meetings including, most recently, with US interlocutors and the Japanese minister for trade - the MITI Minister - Minister Yosano, who met with the Prime Minister and other ministers yesterday. At the regional level, we have proceeded through the APEC and CER groupings and, at the multilateral level, through the World Trade Organisation.I would emphasise that we have lodged an objection with regard to the proposed 390 per cent tariff which Japan is imposing in relation to certain rice imports into that country. I find  it curious that the United States went missing in action on rice and decided not to proceed with the lodging of an objection, notwithstanding their attack on this proposal just a couple of months ago.I am also concerned about the ground swell of protectionist sentiment within the US and the US Congress, and I have been for several months. We have a number of key issues in this regard. The first is on rice: to prosecute that issue to a fair outcome, most notably with Japan. The second is with regard to prime lamb: to prosecute that issue in the United States where there are moves afoot to block a $100 million export trade of prime lamb from Australia to the USA. I have asked Ambassador Peacock to take additional steps in relation to both those issues, and in respect of the third issue, that of steel and the need to withstand the demands for anti-dumping measures being taken unfairly against BHP and other steel producers here in Australia.The federal government will stand up for our exporters at every turn. There will be no white flag brigade from this side of the House with regard to our trading efforts. We will continue to work through these issues to ensure that we get fair market access - because, clearly, there is no such thing as a level playing field, and we are doing all we can to withstand that circumstance.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I notice that claims have been made by Mr Carmody on behalf of the Australian Food and Grocery Council in relation to compensation for pensioners and the application of GST. I note in passing that they were made in the context of Mr Carmody arguing that there was no argument for zero rating food and saying that taking food out of GST provided very inadequate compensation for low income earners. I note that he said that, for every dollar in compensation it provides to low income earners, it will provide a benefit of about $5 - that is, five times as much - to the top 80 per cent of income earners.What the government has done is to engage in a much better targeted measure to ensure that pensioners in particular are better off under tax reform. At the moment, pensions are indexed to CPI in March and September. Under the government's proposal, from 1 July, in advance of any movement in prices as measured by the CPI - that is, before there is any movement in prices - pensions will be increased by four per cent. That is in advance. There has never been indexation in advance before. Indexation has always been done in arrears in March and September.Secondly, what the government says is that it will continue the indexations in March and September to ensure that there is a real increase - that is, that pensions are always 1½ per cent in advance of prices. On the forecasts which are in the ANTS package, it is that indexation which drives the increase factored into the ANTS package - ANTS being a new tax system - right across the forward estimates, because the CPI and the indexation, not to CPI but in above of CPI -  - He yells out MTAWE - which is an old Indian hunting call, I believe. - MTAWE, MTAWE, MTAWE! So there is an indexation in advance, and it goes right across the forward estimates as in a new tax system. The Labor Party then says, `What about if wages run in advance of prices?' If wages run in advance of prices, this government has protected pensioners as well. This is the only government in Australian federal history which has legislated to fix pensions to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. Was this done by the Labor Party? - Was it done in 1983? - Was it done in 1984? - Was it done in 1985? - Was it done in 1986? - Was it done in 1987? - Was it done in 1988? - Never. It was never legislated for one day. They were in office for 13 years and the legislation existed for not one day. If it were the case that wages increased in advance of prices, under this government's legislation pensioners would get another real increase. They get a real increase in advance of the CPI and a real increase if wages increase under the legislative guarantee. So you are protected not once, you are protected twice. -  - Let me ask this question. The members of the House will want to know the answer to this question. -  - When indirect taxes were last increased in 1993, when the wholesale sales tax went from 10 per cent to 12 per cent and 20 per cent to 22 per cent and 30 per cent to 32 per cent, when leaded petrol was increased 5c and when unleaded petrol was increased 7c, when personal income tax cuts were abolished, how much compensation was paid to pensioners? - What increase did the Australian Labor Party put into pensions when wholesale sales tax was increased from 10 per cent to 12 per cent? - What increase did the Australian Labor Party put when wholesale sales tax was increased from 20 per cent to 22 per cent? - What increase did the Australian Labor Party put when wholesale sales tax was increased from 30 per cent to 32 per cent? - What increase did the Australian Labor Party put when it increased petrol by 5c? - I finish by saying that not only is this the first time that pensions have been increased in advance of CPI, not only is there a double guarantee with a legislated 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, but this is the only time that  a Commonwealth government has actually fully and overcompensated for tax changes. It was never done in the past. It was never done by the Australian Labor Party. Any attempt by the Australian Labor Party to oppose this tax reform package - let us call it for what it is - is to oppose a real increase in pensions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Page for his question and acknowledge his interest in the competitive nature of our farm sector, particularly in New South Wales. A number of things have been happening recently that have a profound impact on the cost of hiring workers on farms in New South Wales. The first two relate to the refusal of the federal Labor Party to pass changes to our unfair dismissal laws in this place and also their refusal to support the youth wages bill in the other chamber in this place. They continue to oppose reforms in this place that will benefit the rural sector, particularly New South Wales.On top of that, the New South Wales Labor government refuses to do anything about the workers compensation arrangements in New South Wales. This financial year in New South Wales, workers compensation premiums on average are 2.8 per cent but, for the rural sector, they are 10.36 per cent - a disproportionate disadvantage to rural New South Wales. If the Labor Party in New South Wales and the Labor Party in the federal parliament were genuine about generating opportunities for work in the rural sector, particularly in New South Wales, they would do something about these things.If the New South Wales Labor government did something about the workers compensa  tion arrangements in New South Wales, they would generate almost 6,000 new jobs in the rural sector in New South Wales. Just the same as if federal Labor stopped opposing every single measure that this government puts forward, we would generate a lot more jobs in rural New South Wales and rural Australia.You have the situation where you have a government here that has taken the tough decisions with economic reform - doing away with Labor's $10 billion deficit, providing a surplus and getting interest rates to the lowest they have been for 30 years - which are providing great benefits to rural Australia. We want to reform the industrial relations regime in this country to provide greater opportunity for jobs for rural workers in New South Wales. The state Labor government is doing exactly the same thing as federal Labor in opposing every benefit that could flow to rural New South Wales and rural Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am not aware whether the Deputy Prime Minister said that, but it was a fairly enlightened statement, so probably he did. - He did, did he? I have no doubt that if he did say that - with his deep and abiding interest in and understanding of rural Australia - it would have been entirely correct. In relation to rice marketing, the government has put forward, after discussions with the rice growers and the New South Wales agreement, a proposal for a single export desk and for improvements to the domestic crop which will lead to better returns for rice growers. The honourable member then asked me why this activates competition payments. It does it for this reason: it activates it under a competition principles agreement signed by the Australian Labor Party in 1995.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. In March last year the government did order a full investigation into the matter of the inappropriate disciplinary action taken at the Holsworthy Correctional Centre, which is in the member for Hughes's electorate. Some military personnel who had been taken on tours claimed that they had been physically assaulted and forcibly imprisoned. These attitude adjustment tours, as they had been known, had been happening since at least 1991 and were meant to deter potential offenders from becoming offenders under the Defence Force Discipline Act. Investigations found that the tours had become a short, structured form of punishment rather than anything else and that  personnel were being treated more as inmates. This action was quite clearly outside of the checks and balances of the Defence Force Discipline Act.I want to advise the House and the member for Hughes that this practice has been stopped permanently. Our investigation in 1998 sent a very clear message that the government and Defence do not tolerate actions that are outside of the defence disciplinary system.Following this, other claims of inappropriate disciplinary action at another Army unit at Holsworthy have come to light. The military police have been examining these since September of last year. They include claims of assault and unfair and unlawful process. I have asked the Chief of Army to ensure all that these allegations are thoroughly assessed and any necessary action is taken. He expects that he will have a full report by the end of April to present to myself and the government.I do not want to prejudge the results of that investigation, but I do commend the Army for having the initiative to begin this investigation that flows from the initial investigation that commenced in March of last year. Where activities clearly fall outside the high standard that we require of our Defence Force, Defence will take prompt and appropriate action.Can I also say to the member for Hughes that members from 3 RAR from Holsworthy last week were in fact part of the Sandakan to Ranau pilgrimage. I must say that they put on an exemplary performance in parade and also with their catafalque party.</DOC>

 - One never gets a question from the other side without it being prompted by the relevant union. Of course, what we now have is the National Union of Students cranking up the defence of its own selfish, narrow interests.This government is strongly committed to voluntary student unionism and the right of students to decide whether or not they will fund certain services. When students are satisfied with those services, they will fund them, and the campaign which is currently being run on a number of campuses -  - The campaign which is currently being run on some university campuses would suggest that certain services will be unfunded once voluntary student unionism comes in and implies that students do not value these services. That is simply not the case. We have found in Western Australia with voluntary student unionism that many students do value many of the services provided. There are, of course, students who do not feel that they are adequately serviced by the pattern of service provision on campuses at the present time. Unless university unions make an effort to provide services to those students, naturally they will not attract funding from those students. The university sector is now moving into an era of student choice. - The question is about voluntary student unionism. -  - I do not intend to divulge conversations between myself and others members of the government, but I make the general point about voluntary student unionism that one should never assume that funding for student services will cease to flow once voluntary student unionism is in place. If those services are meeting the needs of students, they will be funded by students.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to inform the honourable member for McPherson that the government is on track to save $1 billion over the seven-year life of IT contracts in the government sector. Recently, I announced the IT outsourcing for the Australian Taxation Office and that represented a saving over a five-year contract of $100 million, or $55,000 each day of those five years. The government's policy in this area is that we recognise that this tool for delivering services to the community can be provided by the private sector, it can be done efficiently, it can be done cost effectively and it can be utilised by the government to develop this industry which is in a growth area.By way of example of that development of the IT industry, the contract that was let to the Australian Taxation Office brought with  it a commitment in contract for strategic investment of some $27 million. It brought with it in the contract total exports which will exceed $65 million. It is a consortium which is headed by EDS Australia. Some $280 million worth of products and services will be sourced from within Australia in that contract. Over $100 million of work will flow to the Australian IT industry. Some 26.2 per cent of the contract will be subcontracted to small and medium Australian enterprises, and 138 new jobs will be created, 86 of which will be in regional Australia.This again demonstrates that the government takes a very simple approach to good management. That good management represents looking in the Yellow Pages and seeing if this tool in providing services can be provided by the private sector, doing proper market testing, going through competitive tendering, getting savings - which I am confident, when this particular program is finished, will actually equal $1 billion for the taxpayers of Australia - and giving the industry a chance to grow, as it is growing in this country. There is a huge future for the IT industry in Australia and the government is using its purchasing power to ensure that small and medium enterprises in Australia are given the opportunity to grow not just in providing services for government but in providing other services in Australia, exports and the regional development that is tied up with it.Each time we do this, we get complaints from the Labor Party. The Labor Party would do well to have a look at what Tony Blair is doing in England. Only recently, New Labour in England outsourced its national savings agency - a £1 billion operation for Siemens business services. That indicates a ringing endorsement of what is occurring in this country. Job creation, savings for taxpayers, growth of a growth industry and regional development are all of the ingredients that, providing good economic management, give benefits to all Australians. It is another success story for this government.</DOC>

 - Weren't you in the House yesterday? I referred in fact to the comments of the new chancellor of UTS yesterday. It would be valuable perhaps to hear his comments on the orientation handbook that was put out by the student association at his university this year providing directions for students on how to inject themselves with heroin.Many students on university campuses are disgusted at the way in which their compulsorily acquired fees are used to promote extremist causes and causes which border on advising students how to evade the law. We have seen that recently with student articles in relation to the avoidance of charges for drunken driving. We have seen articles which advise students on how to shoplift. Students on campuses are demanding the right to have a say in how their moneys are spent.Universities are supposed to be the bastions of freedom. They are supposed to stand for academic freedom. They are supposed to stand for freedom of speech. They are supposed to stand for freedom of thought. If the universities themselves will not implement the basic human right of freedom of association, this government will bring forward legislation, and has done so, to ensure that all students have the right to join or not to join the association of their choice.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his erudite  question. -  - You must be on performance enhancing drugs today. - We'll take a Fine Cotton swab on them after this. - I am happy to withdraw it about the member for Hotham. International investors are looking for some key features in Australia when thinking about investing in our financial markets. The first quality they are looking for is depth and liquidity in our financial markets. As the Treasurer enunciated a little earlier in question time, the Australian Stock Exchange is now the second largest equities market in the Asian region after Tokyo.What the Treasurer did not mention in passing was that the daily turnover of the Australian Stock Exchange has more than doubled in the last five years. The Sydney Futures Exchange is the largest, the number one, exchange in Asia, with over 28 million contracts a day traded, compared with Tokyo, 26 million contracts a day, and Singapore, 24 million contracts a day.Secondly, international investors are looking for low cost infrastructure. When you look at the cost of rentals across the region, a CBD apartment in Sydney is around $2,000 a month; in Singapore, $2,500 a month; in Tokyo, over $5,000 a month; and in Hong Kong, over $7,500 a month. We are also internationally competitive in our provision of educational services and telecommunications and, in salaries, we are highly competitive with the major financial centres of the region.Thirdly, international investors are looking for a strong domestic economy. As the Treasurer enunciated, we have 4.7 per cent growth - the highest of the G7, higher than the OECD average and even faster than the United States. Also, we have low inflation and we have strong domestic demand.The fourth factor they are looking for is a determination to continue with the reform process. This is particularly important when it comes to taxation reform. The abolition of financial institutions duty, debits tax and the stamp duty on transfer of shares will abolish $3 billion a year on financial services activity. Professor Peter Swan, whose modelling was correct in relation to previous reductions in stamp duty on the transfer of shares, gave evidence to a Senate committee only last week that the abolition of stamp duty on the transfer of shares will deliver an increase in the Australian stock market value of $54 billion, a 10 per cent increase. That is the savings of ordinary, average Australians as well as international investors.The fundamental point is that we have to continue with our determination in taxation reform. We cannot continue to have an economy operating like a Ferrari running on a dirt road taxation system. This side of the parliament is determined to get the bitumen trucks out there and lay a good foundation for the future. If the opposition does not like it, it says more about the opposition than it does about our commitment to reform.</DOC>

 - You can see that the student unions -  - The argument that the member uses is nothing other than the same old argument the trade unions have always used to support the closed shop. -  - The community argument that somehow or other student unions are in the same position as local governments and therefore entitled to tax all their members is not a valid argument and has never been accepted as a valid argument in relation to trade unions. It is not a valid argument in relation to private associations. Whoever puts forward this argument, wherever they may be and whoever they may be, is putting forward a mistaken argument. Student associations are not taxing agencies. This government is not going to allow them to tax. They can only obtain their finances as a result of voluntary contributions.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for Gilmore for her question. I particularly have noted the honourable member's concern for Aung San Suu Kyi and her husband's bid to get a visa to visit Burma at a time when he is suffering from the greatest of ill health. The honourable member for Gilmore has gone out of her way to express the view that Dr Aris should be given a visa to visit Burma to be able to visit his wife in circumstances where his health has deteriorated very severely. The honourable member for Gilmore deserves to be congratulated for the effort she has made on this issue. I notice she made a very good speech yesterday in the parliament on this very matter.The Australian government has made representations to the so-called SPDC, the governing authority in Burma. Our ambassador spoke to the home affairs minister in Burma last month saying that we would like to see a visa issued to Dr Aris. The Burmese authorities have so far said that they would not be prepared to issue that visa and suggested that Aung San Suu Kyi should leave the country and go to another part of the world, presumably Britain, to see her ill husband. Understandably, Aung San Suu Kyi is concerned that, if she leaves the country, she will not be allowed back in, so that is obviously for her a very serious consideration.It remains the view of the Australian government that the SPDC in Burma should do the humanitarian thing and grant Dr Aris a visa. There is no downside for the Burmese government to do that. It would be a humanitarian and decent thing to do. The man is seriously ill. He wants to see his wife in the circumstances that he is in. She wants to see him and she should be able to see him and he her. The Australian government calls on Burma to take a much more humanitarian approach to this issue.</DOC>

 - Let me repeat myself -  - I think everyone on this side of the House knows that -  - You do not just rely on the statements that are made out of context by those on the other side of the House. Let me repeat myself: student associations are not taxing agencies. The government does not allow them to tax. The government does not support that argument for compulsory student unionism. This government has therefore introduced legislation -  -  - that will guarantee to all students the right of freedom of association and the right to choose the associations to which they will contribute their money.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question and for the interest that he takes in the government's moves to try to help the rural communities better manage their risks. I am aware of the comments that have been made by the Australian Bankers Association chief executive, Tony Aveling, and I welcome his support for these important government initiatives.Recently we launched the Farm Management Deposit Scheme - which was the delivery of another election commitment of our government - which is a fully commercial tax linked deposit scheme that guarantees freedom of choice. The FMD Scheme is an exceptional risk management tool which allows farmers to set aside with their choice of financial institution pre-tax income earned during the good years. So there is complete flexibility as far as choice is concerned, and they can use whatever financial institution they like.There were interesting comments made by the Chief Executive Officer of the Bankers Association. ABA chief executive Tony Aveling said:The scheme will allow farmers to set aside income in a tax effective manner in good years so that funds are available in downturns due to factors such as drought or depressed commodity prices.In another article in the media, the Commonwealth Bank yesterday launched its farm  management deposit product, offering interest rates of up to 4.95 per cent on deposits between $100 and $300,000 and no transaction or account keeping fees - similar to an on-call investment account. The government is closing deposits to the old scheme early next month.It is good news for rural Australia. Our government is providing risk management tools to assist farmers to manage the difficult circumstances - whether they be climatic or commodity prices - through the difficult cycles that they face. The Farm Management Deposit Scheme, which has been introduced by the government, is yet another one of those tools that we are using to assist the farm community in times of difficulties.</DOC>

 - I say to the Leader of the Opposition that, in trying to assess reaction to this or indeed anything else the government does, I suggest you go beyond the commentaries of Canberra based journalists. - Can I simply repeat to the Leader of the Opposition what I said to him when I wrote to him yesterday upon sending him a copy of the draft preamble - that I would appreciate any comments that he wants to make and that those should be available by 30 April. I will consider his comments. I will consider the comments of the Leader of the Australian Democrats. But even more importantly, I will consider the comments of the men and women of Australia.I think the comments of the men and women of Australia are very illuminating on this subject. I think the comments of the men and women of Australia are not necessarily the same as some of the comments that have emanated from some of the pens and some of the mouths of those who presume to speak for the entirety of the Australian nation on these matters.It is inevitable with something of this character that, no matter who is in government and who writes it, you will not have a unanimity of opinion. I would make two observations about the reaction of the Australian Labor Party. I would remind the Australian Labor Party that when it was in government and it presumed to write a new pledge for Australian citizens, I do not remember any process of consultation with the opposition at the time. There was a total indifference to the attitude of those who sat opposite. What is at the heart of the very negative reaction of the leader of the Australian Labor Party is that -  - deep down they still cannot come to terms with the fact that they are not writing the preamble. Deep down, they cannot come to terms with the fact that there was a change of government. There was a change of government in 1996, and the attitude of the Australian people on that occasion was confirmed again last year.The Labor Party have this problem that they have to oppose everything that the govern  ment does. They oppose our tax plan even though it was endorsed by the Australian people. They oppose the protection of junior wage rates. They oppose industrial relations reform. They oppose the privatisation of Telstra. It is an automatic mantra: if the Liberal Party says yes, the Labor Party says no. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, who sits opposite and will continue to sit opposite while he maintains that kind of attitude, that that sort of negative carping, small-minded opposition is not what the Australian public want. They have a greater generosity of spirit. They want a bit of leadership from the Leader of the Opposition and the mainstream of the Australian public expects more of an opposition leader and expects him to rise to the occasion instead of taking such a small-minded, negative approach.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. The government's tax reform plan for Australia continues to win widespread support. In the Age  today one of the newly supportive people of the government's tax reform policy wrote this:. . . Beazley needs to do two things. Firstly, he should declare support for the Government's GST, providing legislative measures are introduced that give ongoing compensation to low-income earners and those on pensions. Secondly, he should support the full privatisation of Telstra . . .That was advice from a Mr Bob Hogg, the former National Secretary of the ALP. Bob Hogg, the Labor Party campaign director during the Hawke years, also said this in his advice to Mr Beazley -  - The Opposition Leader always yells the loudest when he is going the worst and then he breaks into exaggerated laughter as if he is not actually hurt by this. Bob Hogg said this:To set the scene, Beazley needs to move to 'a foreign country' those old, irrelevant party policies whose time has passed. If he doesn't, then Labor will remain on the back foot, defending the old shibboleths of the Telstra and anti-GST policies . . .I could not have put it better myself. Here we have a Labor Party that is caught in the last decade being advised by its own national secretary that it is hanging on to the policies of a foreign country and being given this advice: Labor has been `played on a break by the independent Senator Brian Harradine, who is using the ALP's numbers and oppositionist mentality to create a position of singular authority.' Mr Bob Hogg says Kim Beazley has an `oppositionist mentality'. He says that he should move his policies to a foreign country. He says that he has to support the GST. He says that he has to support the full privatisation of Telstra.You might wonder, given the oppositionist mentality of the ALP, that we were rather surprised to see the following in Laurie Oakes's report in this week's Bulletin: `Simon Crean is drying out.' This is a real dry out this is. This is Simon Crean at his dry best - opposing tax reform, opposing privatisation. But that was what Laurie Oakes said. In fairness to the member for Hotham, I will read what the member for Hotham said. The member for Hotham said about himself that he recognises the importance of dryness, but also of boldness and fairness. There he is, the member for Hotham - a little bit of boldness, a little bit of fairness, a little bit of dryness. It is what they call `chardonnay socialism' - a little bit of boldness, a little bit of dryness, a little bit of fairness. We are so glad to see the member for Hotham drying out and may he sober up to good policies very quickly.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question and I think it is an important one. It gives me the opportunity to say to the House that the point that is really involved here is the question of garnering the maximum amount of public support for the reference -  -  - The existing situation is that we do not have a preamble in our Constitution. The existing preamble is part of the enabling act of the British parliament to which the Australian Constitution is a schedule. The purpose of the exercise is to insert for the first time a preamble in our Constitution. There is no reference in the existing preamble within the British enabling act to the indigenous people of this country.I think it is the desire of everybody, if there is to be a new preamble, a real preamble to our Constitution, to have an appropriate reference to the indigenous people. But, in order to have an appropriate reference, you need to have words that will gather the maximum degree of support. I believe that the worst possible outcome for the indigenous people would be to continue the present situation where there is no reference to them at all. Those who argue that this or that formulation of words is not satisfactory run the risk of achieving the outcome that there is absolutely no advance at all.As I have said before, and I will repeat it: if you push references too far, although you may satisfy one group in the Australian community, you will end up dissatisfying another group. The indigenous people of Australia are entitled to their point of view, but so are other sections of the Australian community who hold very strong views about a particular formulation of words. The words that have been chosen are words that  accurately reflect an historical truth: they are dignified, they are sensitive and they are entirely appropriate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. In fact, it is the first question we have had on the issue of junior wage rates since the parliament sat prior to the last sitting week, and that is quite an interesting contrast. - As a matter of fact, I think I hold the record; I had 14 in a row. -  - Fourteen out of 14 was my result. But I make that point because the Leader of the Opposition, soon after having had his 14 out of 14 questions, went to ground and then turned up at some international trade union congress at the invitation of the shoppies' union. What is interesting about that is that, before this international audience, he said that one party needs to be serious about junior wage rates, and he went on then to extol a new and alternative position for the Labor Party. I was not surprised at it.The shoppies' union is a big union and it has a big influence in the Labor Party, and the Leader of the Opposition basically aligned the Labor Party with the shoppies' position. He does not want to be too aligned to any position because he has been saying that we pre-empt his -  -  - Exactly. - He does not want to have a position because he has been attacking us on the issue for having a position. So this is the position he has, but he does not want to announce that it is his position because the shoppies -  -  - The absurdity of the position now being pushed by the Leader of the Opposition is that he is supporting the shoppies. The shoppies' position is that the adult wage should be moved from 21 to 18, and that below 18 we should have an age based system. For those who are over 18, obviously there would be a significant increase in the wages bill for employers across the country of around $360 million. So a lot of people who are over 18 are going to lose their jobs. For people under 18, Labor's position now is the shoppies' position - an age based system. It would also mean a significant increase in wages because the shoppies are pushing for a 25 per cent increase for, say, a 16-year-old.But the critical point is that the shoppies' position is for an age based system below 18. To achieve an age based system for 18 and under, you would need to legislate to provide for a permanent exemption from the anti-discrimination provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. There is a means to obtain a permanent exemption for an age based system; the means to obtain that policy is to vote for our legislation.So Labor's position now is that they are supporting a proposition that could only be achieved if they were to vote for our legislation. Yet they have just voted against that legislation. When they voted against the legislation they now need to fulfil their policy, the Leader of the Opposition said that he was `chuffed'. Then he went to this crowd, the international trade unions, and said, `We have to have a serious position.' So he is seriously chuffed that he has voted against the  one measure he needs now to implement his policy.Mr Speaker, this is a bizarre and absurd outcome. It just shows you that, when you have no capacity for leadership, no policy position, you get yourself backed into a position in the way the Labor Party has done. Simon Crean's advice is that the Labor Party needs product differentiation. Actually, on this issue there is product differentiation.We have a policy that supports young people hanging on to the jobs they have and getting jobs in the future. The Labor Party have no policy position. They are simply being pushed around by the shoppies and other unions - and the people who will pay the price of their political opportunism are the very young people whom they should be supporting.</DOC>

 - I invite the House to recall, seeing that the Leader of the Opposition reminds me of it with his question, the many and various positions that the Leader of the Opposition himself has had on the preamble. His first position was that you should run a hundred miles away from having a preamble. His second position was that maybe it would not be a bad idea. His third position was that he would entertain a preamble only if it met certain criteria. His fourth position was that he had produced a preamble and why had I not produced one. His fifth proposition was that in some way the very idea of voting  on a preamble is related to the issue of whether or not Australia should become a republic.My views on the existing arrangements within Australia for the head of state are well known. I do not resile from them, and it will take more than an attempted piece of derision from the Leader of the Opposition at question time to alter my view on the fact that we have a constitutional arrangement that has made this country one of the most envied democracies in the world. But that, of course, belongs to the debate that the Australian people will undertake. I have declared now for over a year that there will be a free and open vote within the Liberal and National parties on that issue.Quite separately from the question of whether or not Australia becomes a republic, I believe there is a strong case for giving to the Constitution of this country a preamble. I believe there is a strong case for giving it a preamble which is not borrowed in a slavish way from the preamble of the Constitution of other countries. I heard the member for Holt interviewed on radio this morning. I had my morning walk through the cool Canberra air interrupted by the dulcet tones of the member for Holt being interviewed by Radio National. They asked, `What is wrong with the preamble?' Immediately he said, `Well, it does not have some of the language that the American Constitution has.' Why is it that we have to always borrow that particular language? -  - Let me say to those who sit opposite - and I certainly invoke the observation of my deputy, the Treasurer - that the more voluble excitement that comes from the person who sits opposite me, the less consistent with that -  - They are two quite separate issues, and that is why the government is providing two separate referendum questions. That is why there will be two separate ballot papers. It is entirely appropriate that some Australians will vote yes and yes to the two questions. Some Australians will vote no and no. Some Australians will vote yes and no, and some Australians will vote no and yes.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - In 1992 the then Labor government put out a national forest policy statement, the purpose of which was to create regional forest agreements which could guarantee certainty to conservationists by way of a comprehensive reserve system and certainty to the industry by way of guaranteeing them that the remaining forest would be available for harvesting and therefore encourage investment and the jobs that followed. That particular proposal was supported by all sides of politics. However, when that government was defeated in 1996, not one regional forest agreement had been even advanced in negotiation, let alone signed. It is evidence of the real commitment that that side of politics had to what was a very sensible process.This government has since also introduced regional forest agreement legislation in relation to agreements between governments which we know to be not sound that would guarantee if people took governments at their word and invested their money and a future government changed those rules then compen  sation could be paid. That legislation is now in the Senate, but there is now considerable concern arising in the trade union movement as to the commitment that the opposition has to a process that was originally their invention. Consequently, the national secretary for forests of the CFMEU put out a press release some time ago in which, amongst other things, he said:'If an amendment to insert a disallowance mechanism was successful, [in the RFA legislation] the ALP would have regressed back to its mistaken way of 1994/95, when it tore itself apart over forest issues,' Mr Smith said.'It is a pity that some in the ALP wish to again politicise forest issues, it seems some ALP parliamentarians have failed to learn from their past mistakes.'That is a pretty fair message. But he did not stop there. He chose to write to the opposition spokesman, the member for Reid, pleading with him not to be taken over by the more trendy elements of his party and to stick with the people that come with their label of the Labor Party. This is what he said:On the issue of disallowance, I again repeat the Union's position that it does not support this proposal as we believe that it is a proposal which would again take the Parliamentary Labor Party down the road of tearing itself apart over forest issues.The issue of a disallowance mechanism was never raised with the Union during the previous Labor Government's development of the National Forest Policy Statement. The issue was also never raised during the Labor Government's stop-start implementation of the NFPS. Again the issue was never raised when, after the 1995 blockade . . . We just had the Leader of the Opposition talking about consultation. You certainly did not give any to your own union when you went running off with the trendies. He went on to say:Clearly the concept of a disallowance mechanism has only been developed in recent times and seems to be in response to those who wish to politicise the process and the current public controversy in Western Australia.The reality of it is that I am giving you a message you refuse to hear from the people who have paid to put you into office and support you with, of course, their preselection.Finally, and in obvious total disgust, the CFMEU has put out another press release stating:The Construction Forestry Mining Energy Union's Forestry Division has called for ALP leader Kim Beazley to intervene in the growing controversy over the Regional Forest Agreement Bill.He is saying that he would like the Leader of the Opposition to show some leadership. He would like him to listen to the working people of the forest industry in terms of asking for a simple thing: a guarantee of certainty. The press release goes on:Mr Smith said that any view that the Union would sacrifice the WA Regional Forest Agreement in exchange for a tick for NSW, Victoria and Tasmania was 'insulting and erroneous.'That is what he thinks of you. Further down he says:'We have copped Regional Forest Agreements with the loss of resources because we have accepted the process and need to have that process based on proper criteria. We are not going to have future RFAs become part of a Senatorial political football match.'He says in conclusion:'I want to make it quite clear that if people in the ALP expect this Union to turn a blind eye to this issue of disallowance, they are sadly mistaken.'I would like the trade unionists in this room today to know how their supporters take this issue. They think it is an absolute joke. They are talking about people losing their houses when some of these small towns close down with no other resource available. They are laughing their heads off on the basis that they think -  -  - Well, if you want to laugh at me for putting a case for working people, you can laugh as often as you like. We also have labelling laws that say that you are supposed to provide true and proper labelling. On this performance, I think it is a breach of the law to go to the people calling yourself `the Labor Party'.</DOC>

 - The code of conduct of the Liberal Party says first and foremost that we should give a hearing to all citizens of Australia and, what is more, the code of conduct of the Liberal Party says that you do not have to sign a piece of paper that puts the Labor Party above your own constituency as all of you have done. That is the first point. The second point is that I got a request through my office handled by one of my staff to give an interview to a respected United States industrialist. I did so and, what is more, I listened intently to what he had to say.I might add that during the time that I have given interviews to people, I have had people coming in representing the interests of convicted criminals, as I am sure many of us have had on other issues of that nature. I give everyone a hearing. But, having done so, I then decide what steps I might take on the merits of their representations to put forward a representation to other ministers.Having heard Mr Voss, I did not make any further representations to anybody, verbally or written, because I did not support the proposition that he put to me. It was not my responsibility as a minister. I therefore considered the matter closed. However, when Senator Minchin made the remarks he did, I was obliged to tell him immediately that he had made an error inadvertently and I stand by that. But, more than anything, there is a good reason Senator Minchin did not know. I did not see it appropriate to put any representations to him on the matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Indi for his question, and I acknowledge his commitment to quality education in all sectors for the young people in his electorate. This government has taken decisive action to build up standards of education in Australia. We have now put in place a national literacy plan. We have abolished the former government's new schools policy giving choice of school to low income families, and the funding for government schools in Australia this year is some $258 million more than it was in the last year of the Labor government.This contrasts dramatically with the policy vacuum that exists in relation to education on the other side of the House. We all recall the policy that the Labor Party put forward during the election campaign which, as the member for Werriwa said so eloquently at the time, was stuffed up. We now know that the Leader of the Opposition has returned to the scene of the crime in his so-called vision speech last week, attempting to outline just what the Labor Party did stand for in relation to education. Anybody who looked at that speech would have realised it was a vacuous empty speech with nothing to say about major education issues.I was interested to see that it was not just the government that reached that assessment about that speech; the Australian Council of State School Organisations also reached that assessment. Anyone who has followed the education debate in recent times knows that the Australian Council of State School Organisations has not been a consistent supporter of the government. In fact, it is an organisation which has traditionally aligned itself with the Labor Party. Yet immediately after the Leader of the Opposition's disastrous attempt to outline a vision for Australia, it issued a press release headed `Beazley education vision lacks substance'. The Council of State School Organisations described the Leader of the Opposition's speech as `deeply disappointing', `unconvincing', `contained little of substance and raised problems' and made `vague remarks'.This comment shows that there is a policy vacuum on the other side of the House which the Leader of the Opposition is absolutely incapable of filling. He has chosen, as we know, the perfect spokesman for the policy vacuum in the member for Dobell, who has nothing to say to the House on issues of substance. In that, he is the true follower of the Leader of the Opposition. Let me just conclude by pointing out what the Australian Council of State School Organisations felt it was necessary to ask the Leader of the Opposition to do:If Mr Beazley was to be taken seriously on education, he must issue as a matter of urgency a much more comprehensive statement of his vision which deals with the major current issues and which  proposes a serious way forward backed by clear funding commitments, otherwise his wish to be the education Prime Minister will be dismissed as unconvincing.That is an organisation that has traditionally been a supporter of the Labor Party. That is an authoritative condemnation of the policy vacuum which exists under the weak leadership of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the views that have been expressed in relation to this matter by both the Queensland Premier and the Queensland Treasurer. I know it is part of the folk lore and part of the ordinary combat of Australian politics for state premiers to go into bat for their own states, no matter what the relative justice or otherwise may be of their case.I say to the member for Oxley and to others interested in this issue that, under the taxation arrangements, the states of Australia will enjoy, all of them, unprecedented access to higher levels of revenue. It is the greatest deal offered to the Australian states since Federation. It is a deal that will underwrite the financial basis of the provision of schools, of roads, of hospitals, of police services and all of those bread and butter issues, those bread and butter requirements. Those who repudiate that are not examining the detail. All of the attempts that have been made over the years to do something permanent and lasting about Commonwealth-state financial relations pale  into insignificance compared with the generosity of what the states are being offered under this plan.No premier in his or her right mind would reject this offer. I say to the Queensland Premier and the Queensland Treasurer: `You are adopting a very provincial, poorly structured position. You are ignoring the long-term benefits that will flow to the state of Queensland. If you are interested in the long-term benefit of the state of Queensland, you will support the GST package.' So the Queensland Premier, the member for Oxley or any other member, indeed anybody else who is supporting the stance taken by the Queensland Premier, should be urging senators from the state of Queensland, including Labor Party senators, to vote for the government's tax plan because Queensland will be a big winner from the government's taxation plan. Queensland, along with all other states, will derive enormous benefit. If the premiers of the states of Australia do not play their role in securing Senate support for the government's tax plan, they will be betraying the citizens of their own states, they will be selling short the interests of the services of those states and they will be letting down the aspirations of the people they were elected to represent.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. I appreciate his great concerns about this dispute and the impact on his local community. Of course, my office and my department have been closely monitoring developments. The dispute is wholly within the jurisdiction of the Queensland state industrial relations laws and, therefore, of the Queensland government. But it is of serious  concern. It has a major impact on regional Australia, on foreign investment in Australia and Northern Queensland and on thousands of jobs for families in the Townsville community - more than a thousand direct jobs in construction and a multiplier effect of about 3,000 jobs in the community.The dispute is a demarcation dispute between five unions and is principally a battle between the AWU and the CFMEU and the old BLF, with the CFMEU-BLF trying to force itself into a workplace where it is not a party to a registered agreement. It is incredible that in this day and age union officials exercise the liberty to gamble with the jobs and living standards of 3,000 workers and families and to jeopardise the largest Korean investment in Australia - $530 million in stage 1 and $500 million in stage 2. The dispute is now entering its fourth week. It has been characterised by a picket line of intimidation, including reports of racist and sexist intimidation. At least half of the workers want to return to work, but they are intimidated by the CFMEU-BLF picket line from doing so.This is an illegal strike under Queensland state law, and the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission has twice made orders, including a return to work and disbanding of the picket line. The unions have defied the orders of the IRC in Queensland. The dispute shows you how out of touch the CFMEU is with the reality and the aspirations of people in Townsville. Of course, this is the same union that paid out $79,467.25 to the Queensland Labor Party federal campaign in the last election, which explains the failure of the federal Labor Party to take any interest in this dispute. This dispute is sending a very negative message to investors in Queensland. The Beattie government ought to require the observance of its own law and require the observance of that law, in particular, by its union mates.It is typically hypocritical of the Labor Party that they in one breath defend the commission but, when there are clear orders by the commission declaring action to be illegal, they fail to support them and to require the observance of the law, as has occurred on this occasion. The dispute also,  I think, suggests that we do need to further reform workplace relations laws, including a requirement for mandatory secret ballots and immediate enforcement of orders of the civil courts against illegal strikes. These are measures that the Labor Party opposes. So I challenge the Leader of the Opposition to condemn this dispute. He ought to explain to the people of Townsville why Labor Party policy is for unions to have more power for more strikes and demarcation disputes. I challenge the Labor Party to repeal its partisan message of solidarity for CFMEU industrial tactics in Queensland which they issued only very recently. Its failure to do so is just another sign of weak leadership from the Leader of the Opposition.I conclude by noting that, whilst the CFMEU is out of touch with reality and the consequences of its actions for workers, today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the latest industrial relations disputes figures for the calendar year 1998. They show the lowest level of working days lost per thousand employees since 1913 - a record low level of industrial disputes - which shows that, with sensible reform, you get fewer disputes and a better deal for workers.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question and for his strong commitment to voluntary student unionism. I would like to bring to the House's attention a valu  able statement in support of voluntary unionism that I have recently come across. The author of this statement - recalling his days as a student activist I think - wrote:. . . Students were amazed at the way in which staid vice-chancellors continued to make them support a political machine taken over by extremists who made no attempt to hide the fact of their control, and who were, in many ways, linked to extremist organisations in the world off-campus . . . Why the establishment seemed so unwilling to permit freedom of association for students, either on the campuses or nationally . . . remains a mystery to many.Who was this student activist with such strong feelings which he put into print first in 1976 and then again in the 1980s? It was none other than Michael Danby, the member for Melbourne Ports. It is almost beginning to look as though there might be three thinkers on the other side of the House. - This was just a chapter in a book, but it is a start. The chapter was headed `Compulsory student unions: Australia's forgotten closed shop'. To his credit, the member for Melbourne Ports wrote the strongest possible condemnation of forced student unionism, and he went on to say what was required of VSU. He said:. . . the power of the AUS, for all of its bash-merchants, could have been dissolved virtually overnight . . . What was required was . . . simply a removal of coercive power from a body which had no entitlement to it.You could not get a clearer statement of principle than that. I was also interested to read in this article that the member for Melbourne Ports relied on a comment from the member for Higgins - well known to this House as one of Australia's strongest supporters of voluntary student unionism. Indeed, the member for Higgins said at the time:The AUS . . . does not affect the livelihood of the vast bulk of students. The whole compulsory unionism debate about AUS is designed to hoodwink students and university administrators into supporting the extremist . . . leadership.That statement, I believe, was made by the member for Higgins in 1979. So he has been a very strong supporter of voluntary student  unionism for the last 20 years. I am quite sure that the member for Melbourne Ports -  -  - I would like to conclude by congratulating the member for Melbourne Ports on mounting a principled argument in favour of voluntary student unionism, and I feel quite sure that he will be demonstrating his strength of character and his commitment to principle by crossing the floor of the House and voting for the government's voluntary student unionism legislation.</DOC>

 - I thought by now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would be aware of my longstanding practice of never relying on quotes from him as to either what I have said or what other people have said. But can I just say it again for the benefit of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and for the benefit of all members of the House -  -  - Much as you may not like it and much as you may be ashamed of it, our record of lifting the real incomes of not only workers but also pensioners is infinitely superior to yours. Under our government, pensioners have been made better off. Under  our government, the average working men and women of this country have also been made better off via real income gains and reductions in interest rates, and those same groups in the Australian community will be made much better off by our proposed reforms to the Australian taxation system. And if you are interested in the welfare of Australian pensioners, you will vote for our plan, you will stop your obstruction in the Senate, you will take the advice of Bob Hogg and a growing number of people who have a long-term concern for the Australian Labor Party, stop your knee-jerk opposition and vote in favour of our taxation package. - I've finished.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question; from a Bishop to a Bishop, it is almost a conclave. It is after 13 years of neglect by the Labor Party of the health and care for older Australians in rural and remote Australia that this government has had to put a lot of effort -  - Mr Speaker, I take exception to that comment that was just made by the opposition. It was a reference made to a relative of mine - I do not wish to go into the personal aspect of it - but I will not wear it. - The reason I take singular exception to that comment is that my aunt has passed away in the period since I first mentioned her with respect to a particular question. I do not find it amusing at all.We are dealing again with aged care and with people who require that aged care to live in dignity and to have the care that they require. The comments that come out of the opposition are simply in keeping with the treatment that they gave to old people when they were in government. Quite simply, we have had to fix it up. We have introduced an almost three-fold increase in multipurpose service centres which are an amalgamation of services given to older Australians. This means that older Australians can get services such as acute care, residential care and assistance with staying at home in a way that the Labor Party was never prepared to give them. I have just announced an increase in funding for these multipurpose centres of $1.8 million. This will allow us to have 42 such centres operating with another 24 on the drawing board. This increases funding for this important way of delivering services to $17.48 million. This important boost to the assistance given to older Australians is made with their care and concern at heart - that is something which is paramount in the mind of this government.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, as you would be aware, I have already requested from you an opportunity to add to my answer. I became aware of Senator Minchin's remarks in the Senate yesterday, and my reference to `immediate response' was in relation to that. If, in fact - because there was so much screaming and shouting from members opposite - I misled the House in my choice of words, I apologise. The fact is that I do not read the Senate Hansard . I was not aware of his remarks until yesterday, when a staff member drew it to my attention. I immediately prepared the appropriate letter which Senator Minchin has tabled in the other place and, of course, that is the statement I stand by.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question and for the interest he takes in the Job Network. I am pleased to say that meaningful data, hard evidence, is now becoming available about the performance of the intensive assistance program within the Job Network and that 250,000 disadvantaged job seekers are currently being assisted under this program and that 60,000 intensive assist  ance participants have been helped into real jobs, paid employment, by the Job Network. By contrast, only 45 per cent of people helped by contracted case management under the former government got real jobs.This is the important distinction - under intensive assistance 95 per cent are going into paid employment and under contracted case management only 45 per cent went into paid employment. The rest of them went into taxpayer funded labour market programs, and this created the unemployment treadmill that the member for Melbourne referred to when he said that some unemployed people under the former government's programs were `forced to undertake inappropriate and even demoralising training'. This truth from the member for Melbourne has not stopped the member for Batman in today's paper faithfully defending Working Nation - more paternalism from the born to rule mob opposite.But what has happened in the last few days is that we have finally had a policy from the Leader of the Opposition. Perhaps he has been goaded into action by the members for Werriwa and Melbourne and, more recently, by Bob Hogg. In a speech which Alan Ramsey said showed that he is more concerned about his leadership than most of us would have imagined, the Leader of the Opposition posed 17 questions and he gave one answer. I have been asked about alternative policies. His one answer was to pay long-term job seekers an employment bonus. He did not say what it was. He did not say who would get it. He simply said that it was a serious policy.There are some big problems with the Leader of the Opposition's employment bonus. It would discourage short-term job seekers from taking work. It would penalise people who take casual and part-time work. It would give a windfall bonus to people who would get jobs anyway. The Collins class submarine was a better idea than this. The Jindalee radar was a better idea than this. But this is about as good as you get from the inbred Labor aristocracy opposite.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. The Australian government regrets President Milosevic's further intransigence which has brought about NATO's authorisation of air strikes. Responsibility for that situation lies squarely with Mr Milosevic, who at every stage has thwarted peace efforts. He has rejected the Rambouillet accord. He has violated the October agreement with atrocities against Kosovo civilians. His forces are responsible for an escalating humanitarian crisis, with 20,000 refugees and 200,000 displaced people. Mr Milosevic and the Serbian leadership should now be in no doubt of the international community's resolve to end the suffering in Kosovo.On 20 March Australians were advised to leave the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia immediately. The government authorised departure of all Australia-based staff and dependents. There are an estimated 5,000 Australians in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The majority of them are dual nationals who would prefer to remain for personal and family reasons. In Australia my department is on stand-by to answer calls about the wellbeing of Australians.As far as any further Australian involvement is concerned, as the honourable member asked, the Australian Defence Force units will not be involved. There is a small number of Australian Defence Force personnel on exchange with British and American units in the region, and they could be deployed with their units.</DOC>

 - They are clearly unsettled on the other side of the House by the discovery of the fact that on their back benches they indeed have some who are strong supporters of voluntary student unionism. -  - They are a divided party. The Labor Party, as we know, is the only political party in Australia which supports a compulsory up-front fee for most students. They are utterly hypocritical in what they say about student fees. They come into this House and complain about the fact that the government has provided students with the fairest student loan scheme in the world. Only the Labor  Party insists that every student in Australia should pay a compulsory fee. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his very real interest, one which I share with him, in relation to, frankly, the quite vexed issue of the supply of doctors and health services in rural and remote areas of the country, particularly remote areas. It has been a great pleasure to be able to announce the outcome of the work of quite a few people, including my good friend and colleague the minister for health, that we are providing $4½ million for the Royal Flying Doctor Service to set up a base in Dubbo. That will become the third base in New South Wales along with Sydney and Broken Hill. We are putting $2½ million towards the capital and we will be providing $500,000 per annum for running costs.That new base will be of major benefit to people living in some quite remote areas, some of whom simply do not have the access to doctors that the rest of us take for granted. Indeed, in terms of time, it will mean that many people have access to an evacuation time of 40 minutes to Dubbo as opposed to anything up to an hour and a half to Sydney. As those with a medical background will know, the golden hour can often be critical for people facing real medical emergencies. This base will provide emergency transfers,  primary care clinics, remote consultations and second-tier transport. I believe it will also help us use the resources of the Royal Flying Doctor Service far more effectively by cutting the number of flying hours relative to the delivery of their services.I have no doubt that this will be widely welcomed in the future, certainly in terms of its immediate announcement. It has been extremely well received. I know that all members in this place will be interested to know that at the moment people in remote towns such as Brewarrina, Collarenebri and Goodooga - places where people live and produce to the great benefit of the nation, and often do so under circumstances of considerable deprivation and difficulty - simply do not have access to a local doctor at all despite the real efforts that this government is putting in place and despite the real improvement in the number of doctors in rural and remote areas we are now witnessing as a result of our efforts. Many of these people will now have access to medical services in a way that they simply did not have before. It reflects our very real commitment to the people of the bush.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Yesterday I informed the House of growing support for the government's tax policy coming from the former national secretary of the ALP, Mr Hogg.Yesterday, one of the world's foremost indirect tax experts, Professor Cnossen, Professor of Economics at Erasmus University and a judge of the Dutch tax court, delivered a significant paper in Australia. The professor has advised 25 governments on the design and implementation of GST. He stated in his paper yesterday:Research and experience . . . proves that the best GST is a GST with a single rate applicable to all goods and services. A zero rate on food is largely ineffective in mitigating the GST burden on the poor.The professor also noted that the nations of Europe which had introduced VATs in the 1960s and 1970s now widely recognised that dual rates were wrong and that a single rate would be best on grounds of fairness, efficiency and simplicity. The professor said:Later converts to the GST and countries with modern tax systems have single rate GSTs . . . What the professor was saying was that Australia can have one of the best models for indirect tax in the world as long as we have a single rate with few exemptions.Adding to the measures that the professor referred to yesterday was a speech from the Commissioner of Taxation who yesterday said that he wanted to inject into the public debate that - any attempt to draw a line around food will lead to costly disputation . . .The Commissioner of Taxation warned that to exempt food from the GST would mean that 370,000 businesses would get into the business of trying to distinguish between GST and non-GST purchases and sales.The commissioner adverted to the UK system where hot meat pies are rated zero  unless they are warmed at the customer's request or reheated from cold. A more recent ruling in the UK which tried to have a different rate for food was that a meat pie sold before 3 p.m. is taxable as snack food but, if it is sold after 3 p.m., it is classified as a grocery and is sold tax free.Countries around the world that have tried to work out what is and what is not food have engaged in temperature tests, and the Commissioner of Taxation said that a temperature test makes frozen yoghurt taxable and refrigerated yoghurt tax free. They have tried to engage in timing tests. They have tried to engage in volume tests in the UK where a gingerbread man with chocolate is taxable unless the chocolate is only used to paint the eyes on the gingerbread man. If it is only used to put the eyes on it is not taxable. Restaurants face a particular problem in excluding food. Those that have tried to engage in a fresh food test have oysters served natural tax free and oysters kilpatrick served as taxable. That is another one of the rulings.The House would be well advised to take notice of both the professor and the Commissioner of Taxation. The government has the most modern, up-to-date model in relation to GST. That was the policy that was put to the Australian people; that is the policy that the Senate should enact.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Tomorrow in Melbourne Australia will be hosting and chairing a meeting of the Manila Framework Group. The Manila Framework Group is a group that was set up in response to the Asian financial crisis to put together rules which would be preventive in the future and would help countries deal their way through financial crises. Australia has taken a lead in relation to the international financial architecture, and we will be hosting this conference in Melbourne tomorrow, at which I will be making the opening speech.Last year the Prime Minister set up a task force on international financial reform, which I chaired, which has reported to the government. One of the recommendations that that task force made was that countries should engage in transparency reports to promote openness and understanding of their financial regulation and to benchmark themselves against international best practice. Tomorrow in Melbourne I will be releasing the first transparency report in the world. Australia has led the way, and I will be releasing this transparency report which will be regarded by the IMF as a model for other countries to adopt and to follow.Australia's transparency report is aimed at developing best practice in our own economy in relation to financial regulation and promoting amongst our near neighbours a model which they could adopt in order to try to promote fiscal transparency in their policies as well. The IMF regards Australia's charter of budget honesty as the best international model for openness in fiscal policy. With the release of the transparency report in Melbourne tomorrow, we will again lead the  world in promoting openness and understanding of policy.As a result of the Asian financial crisis and because the Australian economy has come through this crisis in such strong health, Australia is now well placed to lead in the region and to take these steps to promote international reform. It is a leadership role which Australia has won the right to exercise and which it now has the duty to exercise. We will be leading in this way in Melbourne tomorrow.</DOC>

 - Every answer that the Prime Minister gives is, of course, correct and a comprehensive response to the issues raised. The government is providing several guarantees to pensioners, including a four per cent rise in pensions up-front on 1 July 2000 and a second guarantee that the pension will remain 1.5 per cent above the CPI rise, whatever that figure may be. Pensioners will be very much better off under this government in the future as they have been in the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The figures released yesterday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show how the Workplace Relations Act is transforming the nature of industrial relations in Australia for the better and particularly for the benefit of employees. We saw yesterday that, for the second successive year, Australia has recorded the lowest number of working days lost per thousand employees to industrial disputes since 1913 - 1997 was the best, and 1998 is now the new record for Australia since figures were first collected back in 1913.This is a tremendous tribute to the effectiveness of the legislation and it really shows you that when you have a better system most people want to take a cooperative, sensible attitude to issues at work for the interests of both employees and employers. Also, it is not just the lowest number of disputes per thousand employees; it is the second lowest actual number of disputes since 1939 - 1997 is still the record, but 1998 is the second lowest  actual number of disputes. So the reduction is very comprehensive right across the board.When we first put up the Workplace Relations Act many of our critics were saying, `You might have fewer disputes, but you will have longer disputes. They will be more protracted disputes.' In fact, the opposite has been shown to be the case. So the nature of the disputes is also worth looking at. And, of course, the high levels of industrial disputes tend to be in those sectors which are highly unionised and, of course, that is often characterised by a failure of the Labor Party to speak out against disputes which cost the Australian community so dearly.The other thing that is worth noting is that these figures do not include the bans and limitations type of industrial action. Yet we do know from anecdotal evidence that the extent of those is not what it once was either. One of the reasons for that is that we have introduced a ban on the payment of strike pay during industrial action. There is no doubt that this has affected people's behaviour. That is good for the economy as a whole, and it is also good for employees. The strike pay ban, the secondary boycott provisions that we introduced and the other compliance measures were all opposed by Labor. If Labor were ever to be re-elected, they would of course repeal all the measures which have seen such a dramatic improvement in the state of industrial relations in Australia.Lastly, to conclude, when we advanced our policy before the 1996 election the Labor Party said, `Instead of industrial peace you will have industrial war.' And the headlines told the story: `We will go to war for pay rises, says Kelty', back in February 1996; `Kelty warns Howard: it is war over wages'; in the Canberra Times, `Union chief predicts IR war: Kelty sets his sights'; and, of course, `Crean backs wage war threat'. It is interesting to see what the acting Leader of the Opposition had to say. When asked about the prospect of industrial strife if the coalition was elected he said,`I think they are statements of reality. You'll get interest rates up and inflation up.' `That is a recipe for economic chaos,' he predicted.War did not break out. Peace has broken out. These are very good figures for Australian workers. The only crowd who stands in the way of the continuation of this is none other than the Labor Party, who presided over very high rates of industrial action in this country which undermined productivity and undermined the security of thousands of Australian workers.</DOC>

 - Yesterday I reminded the House of the Labor Party's sham attempt to placate the forest industry by issuing the National Forest Policy Statement in 1992 and how it failed to produce even one RFA in four years. The Howard government has finalised three RFAs and is well advanced with a further nine. Those completed have  already shown positive investment results. However, all major investment is still on hold awaiting the passing of the RFA legislation through the Senate, as all interest groups know that this legislative guarantee is essential for long-term investment. -  - I am advised that the Tasmanian forestry industry needs investment approaching $4 billion to guarantee its future, but no-one would invest such funds without a legislative guarantee. However, I read in today's West Australian  that the Labor caucus has decided to move an amendment to the RFA legislation to make all RFAs subject to disallowance in the Senate. My office has received advice from the Senate Clerk's office that such a process would effectively negate all the guarantees proposed in the RFA legislation and, in fact, there would be more security if no legislation existed at all. The Labor Party knows that, and this proposal of theirs is designed to destroy the legislation completely.There is plenty of evidence that other sections of the community do not want that, and I am now in possession of a copy of a letter from the Australian Workers Union which they did not send to me, so someone over there better say who did. That letter asks the Leader of the Opposition to end the uncertainty by not proceeding with the ALP's proposed disallowance motion. It also says that there is increasing disenchantment with the Labor Party within the union, as it appears to place the legitimate concerns of ordinary working people behind those of Green activists. All of this has been rejected by the Leader of the Opposition who is, of course, putting his job ahead of those of workers. A  lot of people seem worried at the moment about people giving advice to ministers; let me assure the House I am getting plenty on this issue from the Labor Party. You can tell why - because they are in total disarray on it. That is further evidenced by the West Australian article which quotes what certain people said in the caucus. We know, of course, who would have passed that information on. In conclusion, there is ample evidence in the media that I have rejected emotionalism and opportunism on this issue, be it from Labor, Green or Liberal voters. That is called a principled position. The window on principle has been wide open in the Labor caucus from the day they elected Kim Beazley their leader.</DOC>

 - It is interesting that the opposite number in this regard is, of course, the person who facilitated the passage of Labor's increases in the indirect tax mix mess that they put up after the 1993 election - the Dawkins budget. There was no compensation then for pensioners. There was certainly no compensation for those people in rural Australia who were most affected by the increases in fuel tax -  - I submit that the point is relevant because, in fact, their changes to the indirect tax mix did cost jobs whereas the assumption is made by -  - The point really is that whilst those measures cost jobs, the assumptions made by Dixon are inappropriate. Apart  from the fact that we are not hearing from the opposition the full story on this work that has been done - which does point to the prospect for increased jobs in totality - the assumptions in relation to rural industries and regional areas are made on incorrect foundations. For example, there seems to be an assumption that making Australian rural and regional export industries more competitive means that we will therefore produce too much of them, we will flood global markets, the price will come down and somehow there will be fewer jobs. I do not believe that that is realistic at all. I think the assumptions made about elasticity of demand and supply and prices here are inappropriate.In reality, global economic strength, international seasonal circumstances where agricultural products are concerned, the corrupt world markets that we sometimes face as a result of activities in Europe and America: these factors will have more impact on global supply and demand and price than taxation reforms here at home in Australia. The reality is that a more competitive tax system will boost exports, boost economic growth and boost jobs. That applies to rural and regional Australia as much as anywhere else.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question, and recognise the interest she shows in these broader international issues. These attacks by NATO on Yugoslavia are, of course, deeply regrettable, but the Australian government supports the NATO air strikes against military targets in Yugoslavia. We do regret that this action has become necessary, but there is only one person who is responsible for what has happened - that is, President Milosevic, the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The international community cannot simply stand by and watch as President Milosevic's forces continue to perpetrate the sort of human rights abuses that have recently been perpetrated in Kosovo. It is an unreasonable proposition to expect NATO leaders to sit on their hands in that situation and do nothing.Let me make it clear that our argument here is an argument with President Milosevic, with his government and with the instrument of his government, his armed forces. It is not an argument with the Serbian people as a whole. The tragic situation rests squarely with President Milosevic himself.I note that President Yeltsin and others in the Russian government have recently made remarks that Russia could take military measures if the conflict grows. From the Australian government's perspective, we think that Russia should play a constructive role. For Russia to play a constructive role, President Yeltsin and other members of the Russian government, including Prime Minister Primakov, should pressure Mr Milosevic to halt his aggression and terror in Kosovo and sign up to the accord which has been negotiated at Rambouillet in France.Finally, let me say something about those Australian citizens, many of whom have dual nationality, who are in Yugoslavia. I understand from my department that at the moment the borders of Yugoslavia still remain open, so those Australians planning to depart and who are in a position to do so should leave by the safest means available to them. Australians choosing to remain are encouraged to take the maximum protection to ensure their safety and welfare and should avoid military installations at all costs because it is the military installations which are going to be the targets of the NATO attacks.In terms of consular services for those who are remaining, the welfare and safety of our locally engaged staff in Belgrade are obviously paramount. We have authorised them temporarily to close the embassy at short notice, should the situation warrant it. They are very dedicated people. They are prepared to provide consular assistance to Australians, but we want them to put their own safety and welfare before their professional commitment.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to get a question, having put in an hour's extra preparation today for this, the 204th question time since the government changed; and you guys have learned nothing in terms of tactics over that period of time. - In fact, there have been 2,040 questions. The criticism is a bit curious considering that the Winemakers Federation of Australia's own opinion is that all sectors of the industry - the very important wine export industry - will be better off. - The wine industry commissioned their own modelling of the tax package from the Centre of International Economic Studies at the University of South Australia, and from ACIL Consulting. Mr Brian Croser, President of the Winemakers Federation, told a select committee hearing in Adelaide that the results of the modelling showed that under our tax package - the coalition's better tax system tax reform package - everyone wins in relation to the wine industry. I quote:Under an ad valorem system, which is a continuation of the current system, the non-premium wine sector benefits more than the premium wine sector, but both sectors benefit under a GST plus, in effect, wine equalisation tax arrangements.We are about helping export industry. We are about helping to give them a competitive  basis, which we will do under our system, so that they can push forward with their export effort to the world. We are about modern industry truly putting in place competitive taxation arrangements which will ensure extra jobs, not fewer jobs, and more pay for the workers with those extra jobs compared to your treatment of workers' pay during the years that you were in government.I salute the great Australian wine industry. I salute the fact that last year they increased their exports to Japan by 135 per cent. I salute the fact that their exports are now valued at over $900 million. The additional steps which we will take with tax reform will ensure a very bright future for the great Australian wine industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I am sure all members are dismayed at the extent of the damage that has been caused in Western Australia. Fortunately there has been no loss of life, but there has been considerable damage from the cyclone and flooding in Western Australia. As has been reported to the House earlier today, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, along with the member for Kalgoorlie, are visiting those areas at the present time.Mr Haase has been very active in representing the needs of the people of his area in this time of tragedy. Centrelink has been quick to move to assist the people who are in need. I am told that in Exmouth there are some 780 homes, of which 112 have been destroyed. In all, around two-thirds of all the housing in the town has been seriously damaged or destroyed. So there is considerable need for prompt assistance.Centrelink has 10 staff at the Noalimba centre in Bateman to care for those who have been evacuated from the Moora area and to offer assistance to the victims. They are also  providing counselling. Centrelink counsellors are available both there and to assist the people at Exmouth to deal with the emergency and to provide emergency assistance as required. Centrelink Carnarvon is the local office for the Exmouth people. It is fully operational. It is attending to the needs of the people, ensuring that emergency assistance is available promptly to all of those who need it.There have been a number of emergencies around Australia over recent weeks. I would like to pay tribute to the Centrelink staff who have kept their offices open, often in very difficult circumstances, to meet the needs of and to care for people in these emergency situations. In Cairns, North Queensland, in Gympie in the electorate of the honourable member for Fairfax, coming in across the floods, many Centrelink staff have left their own homes behind to make sure that essential government services were provided. These people are real heroes, just as are those who are involved in rescue. I would like to congratulate the Centrelink staff who have put so much effort into Moora and Exmouth to make sure that the victims of these tragedies are receiving their benefits and the sort of care and assistance that they need at this time.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  -  - Mr Speaker, as you know and as every other member of the House knows, the TCF program brought forward by the government made a very significant contribution to that industry. The implementation of that program has now been put in place by Senator Minchin and I believe it will be an outstanding success.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Barker for his question and for his very strong support for the Work for the Dole projects in Mount Gambier in his electorate. This week the government has called for applications for the third round of Work for the Dole projects. These projects will start between August and next February and they should involve 15,000 young Australians. This is on top of the 20,000 young Australians who have already been involved in this magnificent program. It is important for members of the House to appreciate that Work for the Dole projects are not handed down from on high. They are allocated by my department in response to applications from the community.MPs can play an important role in Work for the Dole by encouraging community organisations in their electorates to apply. The Leader of the Opposition has recently been complaining that Work for the Dole is too small to do any good. Members opposite should take their leader seriously and encourage organisations in their electorates to apply for Work for the Dole projects. The Leader of the Opposition should tell the Australian Workers Union to lift the veto on Work for the Dole projects on the north coast of New South  Wales. So should the member for Lilley and so should the member for Wills because they are members of the Australian Workers Union. - And another member of the Australian Workers Union leaps to his feet. - The Leader of the Opposition could have contributed to the Work for the Dole program by telling the Australian Workers Union to lift the veto and he had a perfectly good opportunity this morning when he addressed the Australian Workers Union national conference. He would not have done it because he is worried that pretty soon he is going to need the vote of Senator-elect Ludwig Junior.</DOC>

 - I really have no respect for the track record of the questioner on this matter when he voted to increase fuel excise tax in respect of a Dawkins budget. He has no credibility on this matter. The government will reduce, by $3½ billion, diesel fuel excise tax including diesel fuel excise on the transport of super fuel across Australia by road and rail. A full factoring in of that contribution to the reduction of transport costs in country Australia has been missing from so much of the analysis of the tax package. -  - I stand fair and square for this $3½ million tax reduction in transport fuel taxes and the sooner it comes in the better.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Ballarat for his question. I know he is interested in the pork industry particularly in his electorate. It is not a question about one former Prime Minister's interest in the pork industry either, unfortunately. This is a good news story. As members would be aware, the Australian pork industry has suffered from tough times in the last year or so. Basically that started as a result of the former Labor government removing all import barriers as far as pork was concerned and putting no adjustment provisions in place to assist that industry. Our government has responded to the difficulties that are being faced and confronted by the Australian pork industry by announcing a multi-pronged $24 million package of assistance and adjustment to the pork industry of Australia. It is working.The key components of the package include a $9 million National Pork Industry Development Program, $1 million under FarmBis for national skills enhancement, $6 million exit assistance package, an $8 million Pigmeat Processing Grants Program. In regard to the $8 million Pigmeat Processing Grants Program, last week we announced $6.8 million worth of grants to the processing side of the industry, including processing in the electorate of the member for Ballarat. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. It is important because as of next week we are going to see the first shipment of Australian chilled pork into Singapore thanks to the good work of the Deputy Prime Minister and the  Minister for Trade in opening up that marketplace. We are sending a trial shipment there next week. We are one of the first countries to meet Singapore's stringent inspection standards for chilled pork. Another development has been that, with the outbreak of disease in Malaysia, Singapore has closed off its borders to pork from Malaysia. The Singaporean market is worth about 100,000 tonnes of pork a year. What the government is doing in improving the capacity, the viability and the competitiveness of Australia's pork industry is absolutely the correct thing to do to help develop a modern export oriented pork industry in Australia. We are proving that with the marketplaces that are being opened up all over the world.</DOC>

 - I can report information that would be pleasing to the Deputy Prime Minister - that is, that financial exports have more than doubled over the last five years. In part, that is attributable to the Asian financial crisis which has led to South-East Asian countries requesting Australian support in relation to corporate restructuring, accounting and legal services, debt recovery, financial forecasting and merger and acquisition activity. I can also report that Australian regulatory authorities such as the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the RBA, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the ACCC and APRA are all playing a role in the region. They are up there providing regulatory advice and services to the region in assisting the region to rebuild the regulatory framework that will help it recover from the Asian financial crisis.We must build on these existing relationships. I am very pleased to observe that AMP has announced a strategic link with the Unit Trust of India. The Unit Trust of India is no minnow in the provision of financial services. It has $US15 billion in funds under management. It has 50 million customer accounts and it manages more than six offshore funds. AMP and the Unit Trust of India have indicated that they are developing a $US500 million infrastructure fund that will assist with the construction of power generation facilities, transport, oil, gas and telecommunications facilities in India. This follows on the successful activities of other financial institutions in the Asian region such as Macquarie Bank, the Australia-New Zealand Banking Corporation, AMP, NAB, GIO, QBE, Westpac and many others.If we are seeking to be a financial centre for the region, it is important that we provide the world with access to the Asian region without the risks of the region. That can be best facilitated by actively participating in the region and encouraging Australian financial institutions to be more involved in the financial recovery of Asia.</DOC>

 - I must say that the honourable member seems to have an abysmal lack of understanding of some of these fairly basic issues. He asks whether or not the corporations power could be used for people to opt out of state awards. - Quite frankly, big deal! You do not even understand how the system works today. Quite frankly, the shadow minister shows no capacity to even understand basic issues about how the system operates. -  - The point I make, Mr Speaker -  -  - The point I make is that, if you are a body corporate today and you are subject to state industrial laws but you wish to use the federal system for agreement making, there is nothing to stop you. That happens today. That was part of the Workplace Relations Act. In terms of the policy position of the New South Wales state opposition, there have been various statements by members of the state opposition in New South Wales over the years. The statements they make are a matter for them. Our policy position has been to have a simpler system by encouraging harmonisation between the two systems.The question today of the member for Brisbane is like his inane press release of yesterday. It was inane. Even ACTU President Jennie George said, `On the face of it, Mr Reith's proposal to allow the commission to make common rule awards which applied to all workers in an industry may be helpful.' Leigh Hubbard - he is not exactly on our side, is he? - also said, `On the face of it, it sounds good.' He qualified the statement, but at least he was prepared to say, `Well, here's an idea. Let's talk about it.' Andrew Murray, a senator for the Democrats, was quoted in the AAP as saying:. . . some parts of the plan could be supported.. . .              . . .             . . .Senator Murray also agreed with Mr Reith that the system could cover the entire community.He then went on to make some positive comments. If you are going to be a frontbencher, whether on this side or the other side, you do have to have a capacity to understand the issues and to have a considered response to sensible proposals. It is not just a problem for you that you are a former trade union official. The fact is that you do not even understand how the system  operates today. It is no wonder you have no policies and it is no wonder you are such a pushover for the trade union leadership.</DOC>

 - This government is committed to carers in ensuring that they receive the support they need in caring for people with disabilities, particularly elderly Australians and children. In every budget since this government has come to office, there have been initiatives to provide benefits for carers and care recipients. In particular, the $280 million staying at home package announced in April 1998 provided tremendous benefits to carers. The assistance to the carers amendment bill will help another 14,000 Australian carers and result in a simpler and more consistent system for assessing entitlements. These changes reflect the government's commitment to providing a better deal for carers and to ensuring that they have support in undertaking their important task.The government proposes that the carers allowance combine two existing payments - the child disability allowance for carers of children up to 16 years and the domiciliary nursing care benefit for carers of adults 16 years of age or older. These benefits will take effect from July 1999. There will be no income test, and they will not be subject to taxation. So these are real benefits. There will also be greater flexibility in ensuring that the benefits continue during periods when people are temporarily in hospital. I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question and for her continuing interest in the needs of carers and those people in her community with disabilities, those people who need some support to ensure that in spite of their disability they are able to live in the community with the best possible care.</DOC>

 - He is so unpredictable, isn't he! He is so unpredictable one would never have dreamt for a moment that I would have got that question. It has got me totally unprepared! The Leader of the Opposition asked me whether we are going to change our policy on the sale of Telstra. The answer is a resounding no. We are not going to change our policy. The reason we are not going to change our policy is that we took it to the Australian people last October and they voted for it. By the same token, we are not going to change our policy on reforming the Australian taxation system, because we took that policy to the Australian people last October and they voted for it as well.So far as the New South Wales electorate is concerned, I will rest my case on the words of Mr Bob Carr when he said that it was fought overwhelmingly on state issues. I would make the observation that you would have to have a very, very selective piece of electoral amnesia to imagine that the Leader of the Opposition in the federal Labor Party could draw any comfort at all from the result on Saturday. They had their opportunity in New South Wales.Let me refer to this parliament. The last time there was a federal contest in New South Wales my colleague the Minister for Sport  and Tourism was resoundingly returned. The honourable member for Robertson, Mr Lloyd, was resoundingly returned. The honourable member for Hughes, Danna Vale, was resoundingly returned. The honourable member for Parramatta, Ross Cameron, was resoundingly returned. The honourable member for Macquarie, Kerry Bartlett, was resoundingly returned. There are so many of them I have forgotten all the names. I am very happy that the last time the Leader of the Opposition and I went head to head in New South Wales he got done like a dinner. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for that question. With the indulgence of your good self, Mr Speaker, before I answer that question, because it was asked by the member for Kalgoorlie, can I say that when I visited his electorate on Thursday, accompanied by the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier of Western Australia, how immensely impressed and moved I was - and I know the Leader of the Opposition would have been likewise - by the tremendous spirit and attitude of the people of Exmouth and the people of his electorate who have suffered very extensively from cyclone damage.I was able to announce the establishment of a special trust fund of $10 million, contributed equally by the Commonwealth and the Western Australian governments as well as a number of ex-gratia measures similar to what was invoked at the time of the floods in Katherine over and above the normal disaster relief arrangements. I want to compliment the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for the tremendous work that he has done in rallying the locals and making certain that their  position was put in a very direct and very effective manner not only to me but also to the Western Australian government. It was a splendid example of people pulling together in a time of great adversity - a wonderful Australian tradition.It is true that last Friday I had the opportunity at a very large dinner in Melbourne to announce a number of major changes to the taxation law that are going to result in tens of millions of dollars of further contributions to charities in Australia each year. These measures are part of the government's long-term philosophical approach in this area of building a new social coalition, a coalition between the government, business, the welfare sector and individuals. What the government has done by these measures is provide to both corporations and to wealthy individuals in Australia more incentives to give to needy causes and to needy organisations.It is our calculation that they will generate an additional $75 million a year - and that is putting it conservatively - in donations to eligible bodies. They comprise a series of income tax deductions for the market value of donations of property worth more than $5,000, regardless of when the property was purchased or acquired, and a capital gains tax exemption for testamentary gifts of property to bodies eligible to receive tax deductible donations. Eligible not-for-profit organisations can expect a $15 million boost in donations as a result of that particular measure alone.There will also be greater incentives for donations of property under the Cultural Gifts Program. Donations will be exempt from capital gains tax, and donors will be able to apportion their tax deductions for donations over a period of up to five years.We are going to create a new category of private charitable funds. These funds will not be required, in order to get the benefit of existing tax deductions, to seek donations from the public at large. This will provide businesses and more affluent families and individuals greater freedom to set up trusts for philanthropic purposes. It is expected that this measure alone will increase donations by a further $15 million a year.These taxation measures flow from the recommendations of a taxation working group, chaired by Mr David Gonski of Wentworth Associates. This working group was set up after the round-table meeting with business and community leaders in March 1998, and I am very grateful for the work of Mr Gonski and the members of that working group.I am pleased to report to the parliament that the announcement I made to the dinner on Friday night has had a very, very positive response. For example, the Salvation Army has welcomed the tax breaks to boost business and personal philanthropy; the army said that the package of measures would make a dramatic difference to its work. They are not my words. They are not the words of a government propagandist. They are the words of one of the most respected bodies in the Australian community, the Salvation Army, when it said that the measures would make a dramatic difference to its work.The Salvation Army went on to say, `It will encourage asset rich but income poor people to give to us without having to pay capital gains tax on their real estate, shares or other assets.' In other words, this is the social coalition at work: the government provides the tax break, the corporate sector responds and the needy in the community get the benefit of that assistance.Those words of support were echoed by the Australian Foundation for Culture and the Humanities. Its executive director, Winsome McCaughey, said yesterday, `The Prime Minister's announcement sets new directions for philanthropy and sponsorship that will lead to a significant boost for the cultural sector.' She said:Mr Howard's announcement is important for two reasons: it sends a powerful message to business that supporting the community and culture sectors can add value to a corporate bottom line when enriching society; and secondly, it removes some big disincentives that inhibit private sector support for community and cultural projects.Finally, the government's announcement has been very warmly welcomed by ACOSS:The Australian Council of Social Service has welcomed the Prime Minister's promise to give tax breaks to business for donations to charity. The  President, Michael Raper, said that he supported the initiatives, which included capital gains tax exemptions . . . Also, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry's chief executive, Mark Paterson, said, `The proposals should encourage more philanthropy in the business community.' I have been greatly encouraged by the reaction not only of the welfare sector but of the community generally.What I announced on Friday night is part of a careful long-term strategy of the government to build a stronger and better social coalition. I made it clear on Friday night, and I make it clear again, that the government does not intend by any of these initiatives to wind back the income support that it provides in the Australian community. The moneys that will come under these initiatives will be over and above what the government provides by way of income support; they will be value adding to what is already there in the community. This will be new money for the charitable sector, new support under the government's long-term concept of an effective social coalition within the Australian community.</DOC>

 - What a desperate and silly question. You always know that you can come in here on a Monday and get the most irrelevant of questions in terms of what is the real concern of the Australian people. The one thing the Leader of the Opposition does not have is his finger on the pulse of what is concerning the Australian people. He will look at all sorts of gimmicks and silly questions instead of getting down to the real issues.Of course I will not rule out the sale of Telstra, because I want to get rid of Labor's  debt. I recognise, just as is recognised by everybody on this side of the House, that for the past three years we have been addressing the debt left to us by Labor, and the sale of Telstra will make a significant contribution to that debt.I recently had a call, which is normal, from ACOSS. They visited me, as I am sure they visited many of my ministerial colleagues. The one thing I mentioned to them - and I note that they took it on board - was that, if they want to get the sorts of things that their particular constituency is constantly calling for - and, in many cases, with good reason - if they want to see the Commonwealth budget directed towards the welfare area, towards housing, education and those core areas in which governments would like to have a responsibility, if they give us a chance, if this parliament gives us a chance to clear the debt, there are several billion dollars available each year ad infinitum that can be directed towards the real needs of the Australian people.If we can clear Labor's debt, we can reorganise and reprioritise how the money is spent in any budget towards those most in need in this community. So we are going to press on with the sale of Telstra for that purpose. We are going to press on for a number of other reasons too which have been stated here in this House constantly.As to the second question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, quite clearly what this government intends to do by way of a social bonus has been on the table for some considerable time. There are $671 million worth of benefits to the community, particularly in regional Australia. I note that the member for Perth has been running around saying that there is less in the way of social bonus than there is in the way of benefits to the brokers. Of course, he conveniently embarrasses himself by saying that the commission on selling the whole of Telstra is less than the bonus we have indicated is available from the sale of 16 per cent.It is quite clear what we will give back to the Australian community, particularly in the area of telecommunications in regional and remote Australia. That has been on the table for some time. There is not the slightest doubt  that this nation will benefit significantly, as will all members of the Australian community, if the Senate finally wakes up to itself and gives us the opportunity to sell Telstra.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. Obviously, support is growing amongst supporters - former supporters - of Mr Beazley for him to pass the government's tax reform package. I inform the House that the former national secretary of the ALP, Mr Bob Hogg, wrote in the Melbourne Age  on 24 March 1999:On the policy front, Beazley needs to do two things - firstly, he should declare support for the government's GST and, secondly, he should declare support for the full privatisation of Telstra. - As somebody interjects, I gave that answer last week, but last week I hadn't seen an article in the Melbourne Age  on 26 March 1999 by Mr Neil O'Keefe, who said this:Now we have the GST saga -  -  - Listen carefully, because he is one of the backbenchers breathing down your necks:Now we have the GST saga. Put aside your view of the policy and whether it should be passed by the Senate. Even if it does get through, it is 14 years since a consumption tax was first seriously proposed by the federal Treasurer in 1985.We remember who the federal Treasurer was in 1985. We remember who supported him in the cabinet - none other than the current Leader of the Opposition. Then Mr O'Keefe went on to say this:Australia doesn't for much longer have the luxury of this sort of procrastination in major policy and infrastructure decisions. Quite right. Rather than going around and attacking Mr O'Keefe after question time, the front bench ought to be going around for a bit of instruction from Mr O'Keefe.We can tell from the questions that have been asked already today that the Labor Party has a high opinion of Mr Bob Carr - Mr Bob Carr, the recently re-elected New South Wales Premier, somebody who has experience of government. What does Mr Carr say on the issue? Mr Carr said on Stateline on 9 October 1998:My view is that a government with a majority in any lower house ought to be able to implement its program not subject to frustration by an upper house, state or federal, and be judged by the people three or four years down the track.Well might we recommend Mr Carr to the Leader of the Opposition. -  - We have the Leader of the Opposition interjecting right now. He would be well advised to read Glenn Milne's column today, which said this:`Kim's bogged down in the marshes on the GST', says one ALP strategist. `They think they're making headway but they're becoming obsessed with minutiae.'  Elements of the New South Wales Right now want Beazley to do the same with GST - admit that Labor lost the battle -  -  - These are the great figures of the New South Wales Right, Mr Speaker. - The member for Kingsford-Smith, for starters, I will name. The column continues:. . . admit that Labor lost the battle to stop the tax and offer Howard a compromise in order to make the final package fairer.So we've got the national secretary of the ALP, we've got one of your own backbenchers, we've got the New South Wales Premier and we've got the strategists from the New South Wales ALP. But the one I like the best was a former federal minister who served with the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Gary -  - Yes, it was Mr Gary Johns, actually. - Yes, it was Mr Gary Johns, who wrote a piece called `Stumbling block':In threatening Senate obstruction, the Opposition had better get used to the idea they are not running the country.Mr Gary Johns had this to say, and I think it is probably the best comment I have heard on the Leader of the Opposition:Beazley's statement after the election that Howard had no mandate other than for good government was unbecoming an aspirant for PM. It smacked of the sore loser - accepted practice in the Asian sham democracies, but not here.You've got Bob Hawke, you've got Gary Johns, you've got the New South Wales thinkers of the Right, you've got Bob Carr and you've got Neil O'Keefe. We know precisely what is going on here. The Labor Party is desperately hoping that tax reform will go through so that they can take advantage of it. If this was a Labor Party that was serious about defeating tax reform, the Leader of the Opposition would be giving a pledge now that if this tax reform went through the Senate he would repeal it. That is what he would be doing. But he doesn't say that - oh no. He says, `We'll fight it to the death - and then as soon as it is passed we will take every advantage of it.' It may be acceptable in a sham Asian democracy, but not here.</DOC>

 - Once again, this is a very much expected question, as I look at the ALP figures. The ALP figures for the state seat of Albury were 17 per cent, in the state seat of Dubbo they were 20 per cent, and Monaro 31 per cent, and we will win that. -  - As a matter of passing reference, the seat of Wagga was won by the coalition. Labor is now down to just one in four of the votes and they used to hold that seat a few years ago. Let us make it very clear - as Malcolm Mackerras did in a summary piece today - that, all things considered, the National Party stood up very well in the state election results. Why is that so? At the end of the day, One Nation won zero seats in the lower house in New South Wales and the National Party won over 14 seats, and in the federal election it was much the same.As a matter of fact, if you take out the head-to-head figures of the National Party versus One Nation, it is quite interesting. We got 34 per cent of the vote on Saturday in the seats where we were both contesting and One Nation got 12 per cent. We polled more than One Nation state-wide, even though we contested fewer than one-quarter of the seats. -  - There is a bit of noise here today. At the end of the day, the federal Labor Party made no contribution to Bob Carr's win. -  - You were not even invited to participate at any length in the campaign. - We beat the Labor Party in the bush; we beat One Nation. Today in the Senate I understand another hopeless report is coming down from some committee saying that the $3.5 billion of fuel tax cuts being delivered by tax reform - which I stand up for and which we will deliver - you will oppose. It is about time country New South Wales - indeed rural and regional Australia - sees through your opposition to the $3.5 billion of transport fuel tax cuts that we will deliver.Federal issues had little enough to do with the state election outcome. You said that; the Prime Minister said that; I said that; and George Souris said that overall federal issues did not play much part. - I am very happy to defend the fact that in terms of the outcome of the New South Wales elections, your part was infinitely small and contributed nothing to Carr's win.</DOC>

 - This is a very important issue which would have the interest of members on both sides of the House. I join with you, Mr Speaker, in welcoming the US delegation, including congressman Bill Archer and Carol Crawford, who is one of the members of the US International Trade Commission who signed on the recommendation of three out of six with regard to prime lamb. This is a very critical issue and the federal government is standing up for the Australian prime lamb industry at every stage.I sent Ambassador Andrew Peacock in to present directly at the hearings of the commission which took place in Washington a few weeks ago. He presented evidence, along with Jim Bolger, the former New Zealand Prime Minister, as to why our prime lamb exports are not the cause of the difficulties being faced by the US producers.We have gone about developing a market and providing close liaison with supermarket chains and US consumers organisations to produce and fine tune a product which has won a lot of acceptance across the United States in an area which is not traditionally a big market for lamb product.We have done that and have now built a $100 million market - and I thank the member for Wannon for his interest. About 10 per cent of the total production of Australian  prime lamb is now flowing through to the United States under free fair trade. It is unsubsidised product out of Australia which we are marketing and exporting successfully to the United States. So full marks to the Australian prime lamb industry in opening up this market. What has now happened is that the US International Trade Commission has made a recommendation to the Clinton administration, which has 60 days to respond to that recommendation.The Australian government is very concerned about the recommendations in respect of tariffs and quotas on Australian lamb and some other elements of the recommendations which would mark a very severe restriction on that export. If the recommendation of three of the commissioners, including the one that happens to be present in the gallery this day, were to be carried, that would see the existing trade continue to be able to proceed at about current levels, but there would be no ability to grow the trade or work with the US prime lamb industry - the Australian prime lamb industry has indicated their preparedness to do so - to expand the overall market and create the win-win situation which is the best way forward.The Australian government is standing as one with the Australian prime lamb industry. It is very strong in the state of Victoria particularly - where the members for Wannon, Mallee, Ballarat and others come from - and also across so many of the states of Australia. This is a new wave market, carved out by an industry which has done the hard work and liaises with the supermarket chains directly.I will go to Washington in May, and I am scheduled to meet with the US trade representative, Charlene Barchevsky, to further directly pursue this matter. The government is considering a number of other options to add momentum to our legitimate case in standing up for our legitimate export interests.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Sadly, though, it does not properly represent all aspects of the ACA's latest performance monitoring bulletin which shows a good national performance by Telstra except, unfortunately, for Tasmania. - No, there is a disappointing result in Tasmania. However, you do have to keep in context that the number of connections in rural Tasmania is very small, so even some very poor performances can distort the figures. -  - You scoff, but do you want a scientific, rational examination, an interpretation of this report, or do you just want to make some cheap political points? Why do I ask such a rhetorical question - we know the answer! The government expects Telstra to act urgently to restore service quality levels in Tasmania to the national performance level. When the current Telstra legislation does pass the Senate, the government, through the ACA, will have greater power to act directly to require Telstra to respond to specific concerns and areas of fault such as Tasmania. The report shows that Telstra's fault clearance performance improved in all categories nationally and in urban, rural and remote areas. Telstra's new service connections nationally generally main  tained the level of the previous quarter with some variations across urban, rural and remote areas.There is some satisfaction to be taken from the report, but never complacency. In regard to Tasmania, there is work to be done by Telstra, and we will require it of them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question because, of all the members here, he represents a very substantial military involvement in his electorate - the barracks at Lavarack and also the other military facilities that lie within his area.Yesterday I announced the government's decision to deploy the Australian built guided missile frigate HMAS Melbourne to the Gulf to support the United Nations sanctions against Iraq. The Melbourne and a crew of approximately 210 naval personnel will depart in late April. They will join the multi-nation Maritime Interception Force for a three-month period commencing in late May. They will be responsible for intercepting cargo being transported to the Gulf in contravention of the sanctions. The Australian Defence Force has contributed naval support to the MIF on eight occasions since it was established in August 1990. In fact, it was HMAS Melbourne which conducted the last deployment in 1996.The government is committed to the United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iraq. The MIF role in enforcing these resolutions is an important element in ensuring that Saddam Hussein is not able to threaten regional or international security. It is in Australia's national interests and in the interests of international stability that we continue to administer these sanctions until Iraq fully complies with the United Nations conditions.There is no connection between this deployment to the Gulf and the current NATO action in the Balkans. Planning for the Gulf deployment has been going on for at least  three months. In the meantime, HMAS Melbourne is due to arrive in the Gulf in late May.I noted yesterday the comments made by the Leader of the Opposition in supporting this deployment. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his comments, and I am sure that all members of the House will join me in wishing the crew of Melbourne a safe mission and a safe return to Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare for his question. The ERI - the education resources index - was in fact reviewed in 1997 and it was a full and comprehensive review of the index which looked at the strengths and weaknesses. Last year, 1998, the government conducted a series of pilots to investigate alternative funding mechanisms for schools. The government is now considering the reports of those two reviews, and decisions on the basis of those reports will be announced at an appropriate time.</DOC>

 - It is not a joking matter. I do not think it is of any credit to the opposition that they think that these are matters for cheap political point scoring, but I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. I can help him with a rather pessimistic answer to the question by saying that the Australian government is alarmed by the reports that we have received about the rapidly worsening humanitarian situation in Kosovo. It is estimated now that there are as many as half a million displaced ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, including some 50,000 people who have been displaced just in the last few days, and there are many thousands of refugees turning up now in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia and across other borders as well.There are indications that the Yugoslav forces and paramilitaries have burned homes and forced people to flee. There are very disturbing reports of widespread murders of civilians. The Australian government acknowledges the extreme conditions facing internally displaced persons in Kosovo and the increasing flows and needs of refugees in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia and in Albania.The Australian government stands ready to contribute generously to this humanitarian disaster. Officials from my department and AusAID are in contact with humanitarian organisations including Care Australia, World Vision, the Red Cross and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to determine the most effective means of assistance. As plans of action become available, Australia will give highest priority to assistance targeting the health and shelter needs of refugees and internally displaced persons.</DOC>

Suffice it to say that we are always willing to cooperate with state governments when major road upgrading programs are needed, consistent with what we can afford.

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. The fourth meeting of the Manila Framework Group was held in Melbourne over the weekend. It was attended by three of the G7 economies - the US, Canada and Japan - by China and by all of the crisis affected Asian economies. It was a productive meeting in discussing regional financial architecture and what can be done in particular to build institutions in the region which will secure a return to strong growth.One of the matters that the group commented on was the need to develop transparency in policy and to report openly to foreign investors' policy problems and how legal institutions underpin financial investment and economic policy. To that end, the Australian government released a transparency report  explaining the basis for fiscal monetary policy in Australia, investment policy and benchmarking ourselves against world's best practice in reporting requirements, accounting standards and corporate governance.It is the first transparency report which has ever been published in the world. It was a recommendation that was made by the Prime Minister's international financial task force that Australia move beyond the general statements with something practical which would be a model and an example for countries in the region. It has been welcomed by the International Monetary Fund, and the IMF has said that it will use this report as a tool in helping other countries develop more transparent economic policy.Together with other things - such as the charter of budget honesty, which is now world's best practice in relation to economic reporting and acknowledged as such by the IMF, and the financial sector reforms arising from the Wallis inquiry, which are described by the IMF as `path-breaking reform' - this indicates where Australia leads the world in the conduct of policy. And it no doubt contributes to the fact that, in a region which is now in near total recession, Australia is not only growing but growing faster than the OECD, the G7 and most of the industrialised world.In addition to that, some of the countries attending made reports on what they considered to be prospects for the forthcoming year. The Japanese representative reiterated Japan's commitment to maintaining stimulus to domestic demand and reported progress in financial sector reform. China reported that fiscal stimulus would sustain growth at strong levels in 1999, and reports in relation to the US indicated that, notwithstanding slowing in the US economy, there would be robust growth continuing.This is a key arrangement for the region and for Australia. It is a practical contribution that we are making in relation to the international financial architecture, and it provides a concrete step to advancing Australia's leadership role in many of the arrangements, which it has won the right to do as a result of its  economic performance over the last three years.</DOC>

I really think the member for Lilley is a little bit confused in relation to the veterans' entitlement. If he would like to come around to my room with an issue, I would be very happy to look at the issue that he raises, because I have always thought that on both sides of this parliament there was support for the Veterans' Entitlements Act to err on the side of generosity. And I would have thought that would have had the support of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, because I am fully aware of his interest in the care of older Australians and in the facilities that are provided for them. The first thing I want to say is that what we inherited from the Labor Party was a mess. They had withdrawn capital funding from facilities. They had commissioned the Gregory report, which they never even responded to. They opposed our reforms on capital funding. And the good news is -   and I can say this because the Prime Minister personally had such a hand in putting these reforms in place - that those reforms are working.Indeed, there is a good report in the Sydney Morning Herald saying that in the last fortnight a company, Development Capital of Australia, has just purchased for $7.5 million two nursing homes - one in Queensland and one in New South Wales - both of which will form part of an unlisted property trust which they anticipate will have a yield indexed to CPI of 9½ to 10 per cent. The reason they believe that there is such a good yield to be had from this investment - and I quote the general manager, Mr Vaux - is:'The low-risk profile of the trust's income will be underpinned by the fact that nursing home revenue is substantially sourced by the Federal Government and paid monthly in advance.'The point that is important to make there is that the involvement of the private sector in the area, giving good care under the scrutiny and under the checks and balances that this government has put in place, means that this good, sound investment will result in more Australians having good, sound quality care in facilities when they need it.It is important to remember that the statistics are these: there are 2.2 million Australians over the age of 65 and at any time there are only 135,000 people in residential care, and on those 135,000 people we spend annually $3 billion in recurrent expenditure. This government has put its money where its rhetoric lay. We have injected more capital. We have put more money into recurrent funding. We have put in place a capital stream of income which is allowing more activity to take place in upgrading facilities so that the horrors that the Labor Party let exist will no longer exist under this government.</DOC>

We have repeated several times from this side of the House that, on 1 July 2000, they will receive a four per cent up-front increase in all pension entitlements right through to benefits, including child education assistance.

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his thoughtful question with regard to the existence of this trade war, by degrees, between the US and Europe. I know he has pursued this and other trade issues with a great deal of diligence. Both the issues nominated by the member are connected to the implementation of the WTO legal rulings and are very important to the credibility of the World Trade Organisation system. Rules in this area require clarification and Australia is active in the World Trade Organisation in seeking to resolve this problem.With regard to the bananas case, there is a disagreement about WTO consistency in the measures that Europe has put in place in response to the WTO findings. With regard to the beef hormones case, the indications are that Europe will not be able to implement by May this year the WTO findings on an import ban on beef treated with hormonal growth promotents. In both cases, the US has set in train processes, under its domestic trade legislation, to apply retaliatory measures which need to comply with certain conditions. But the knock-on effect with regard to these cases and other disputes at this time - including between the United States and Japan with regard to steel legislation, which is through the lower house but not through the Senate in the US - would be quite disastrous for Australian steel producers and Australian steel exports directly or indirectly.Let me simply say there is probably more to come. In fact, the suggestion is that the United States will ban the Concorde aircraft from landing at New York and Washington, as part of an escalation for a reciprocal ban on some hush kit-fitted Boeing aircraft from using European airports. The sooner we have a Millennium Round launched out of the Seattle ministerial meeting scheduled for November this year, the sooner we will have these problems addressed in a comprehensive way and the sooner we will have a win-win situation to address the problem that there is no such thing as a level playing field. We need to do something about that sooner rather than later.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowan for his question and acknowledge that he is a Vietnam veteran himself and bears the scars of war. I also acknowledge the service of our Deputy Prime Minister, who is also a veteran of the Vietnam War. I think all in this House should be grateful that we have had people willing to put their lives on the line in defence of the freedom of others. But I am not surprised at someone from the opposition coming forward with a question like this. I would have thought that what the member would have been asking was, `Why didn't Labor put out the End of War List when they had 13 years in government to do it?' -  - Not only -  -  - This was the government that completed the End of War List for Vietnam. We have the Leader of the Opposition who, as Minister for Defence for a number of years in a Labor government, could have put out the End of War List. Now we have got someone on his backbench trying to destabilise his leadership; that is what we have got. -  - But I am not surprised that it was the Labor Party which was never ever going to complete the End of War List for Vietnam. That goes right back to the defence minister in the early seventies -  - The government takes very seriously the issue of the End of War List, and that is why it was this government that completed that list, notwithstanding that the Labor Party had 13 years and did nothing about it. The End of War List was completed by the government and I am always happy to talk to any veterans' group about the issue, as I have said quite openly.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question. The government is anticipating a record number of Australian students studying at universities in the Asia- Pacific region this year. Recently I announced a grant of $1.2 million in funding for 266 Australian students to study overseas under the University Mobility in Asia and the Pacific program. This program provides financial support to Australian universities to develop international university student exchanges. It allows two-way student exchanges, allowing Australian students to experience one or more semesters of study for their degrees at a university in the Asia-Pacific region.There are a wide range of fields in which Australian students will be studying under this program. They include architecture, economics, business studies, communication, engineering, urban planning and environmental management. The program is going to give Australian students a chance to develop very important and valuable contacts and career opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region because it provides the opportunity to live and study there for an extended period. Certainly these students are going to gain a great deal of valuable experience. The program has been endorsed by APEC as a valuable vehicle for human resource development in the region.For the information of honourable members, the countries included in the program are China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and Thailand. This program is an important initiative to raise Australia's profile and boost Australia's future ability to trade and  conduct business with our neighbours in the region and the beneficiaries will be not only students but also Australia in the future.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. I would like to inform the House that last Friday I had the opportunity of meeting with a forum of chief executive officers representing the food industry of Australia and farm organisations to discuss a series of issues revolving around government policy. Of all those government policies, that which took the majority of the discussion and the attention was taxation reform. Coming out of the meeting there was a very clear message from those chief executive officers from food organisations across Australia, food processors and retailers, and the farm sector. It was one of absolute support for the government's tax reform package, particularly that food should not be exempt from GST.This message came through quite clearly from industry, and those companies who represent a very diverse cross-section of the food industries in Australia are very supportive of the government's position on this. They included the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Food and Grocery  Council, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, the Restaurant and Caterers Association and the Australian Fresh Fruit Growers Association.It is very clear that we must have a policy that is unambiguous and uncomplicated without any red tape as far as Australia's taxation system is concerned. This was the message left with us in that forum of food retailers and manufacturers last week. They also left a message that, if the Australian Labor Party want to be constructive in this debate, they should be listening to and supporting the view of their former national secretary, Bob Hogg, and should support the government's tax reform package.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. Yesterday the honourable member for Cowan raised the  award of the Medal of Gallantry to six veterans who felt that their service had been inappropriately recognised. I have said consistently that I am always prepared to meet veterans and listen to their views, and I said that also in the House yesterday.This issue has arisen because, when the Australian government moved from the imperial system of awards and honours to an Australian one, the differentials in imperial award levels could not be translated exactly into the Australian system. The decision that the government had taken based on official advice on a number of occasions was that the Australian awards to the six veterans originally designated in the End of War List should stand. Therefore, the matter was not formally under review by the government.In light of the continuing representations, including from the RSL, the Vietnam Veterans Association and most recently by the member for Cowan, the government has decided to establish a small panel to review the issue and make recommendations. -  - I have in mind that the panel might comprise, amongst others and subject to availability, the former secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the national president of the RSL and the national president of the Vietnam Veterans Association. I am well aware of the strength of people's feelings on this issue. It is an extremely sensitive one and the government does not wish in any way to devalue the service given by these six, nor any of the other hundreds of veterans who have also received awards.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. It affords me an opportunity to quietly restate the commitment of the coalition government to the policies on which we were elected last October. The Leader of the Opposition can extrapolate as much as he likes in relation to federal and state elections. The truth of the matter is, as he knows as a student of Australian politics, that there is a long history in this country, particularly out of the state of New South Wales, of people voting radically differently at state and federal levels.Those of us who were here in the 1970s will remember that, in 1975, 1977 and 1980, the Fraser government received overwhelming support in the state of New South Wales. They will also remember that that support coincided -  - There was that very clear pattern established. Invoking some more contemporary political history, the Leader of the Opposition will be aware that, in the most  recent South Australian state election, the Labor Party enjoyed a substantial swing in its favour; yet, in the federal election in South Australia in October last year, the Liberal Party won nine out of the 12 seats. Some of our more triumphant marginal seat victories, particularly those of the honourable members for Makin, Adelaide and Hindmarsh, were in fact achieved in the state of South Australia.There is no validity in the proposition that you can extrapolate anything from transferring a vote at a state level to a federal level, particularly when the issues that determine state elections are quite different from those that determine federal elections. The brutal political reality for the Leader of the Opposition is that the last time he and I went head to head on privatisation, the government won. The last time we went head to head on taxation, the government won.I would simply say to those who sit opposite that we have no intention of abandoning our plans to make available the rest of Telstra to all of the Australian people. We want this nation to be the greatest share owning democracy in the Western world. We intend to pursue that legislation because, out of the proceeds of the further sale of Telstra, we will be able to provide additional services to the Australian bush. Those who oppose the sale of Telstra oppose enhancing services to the Australian bush. Finally, I make the prediction that, at some time during the next four years, the re-elected Labor government in New South Wales will revisit the issue of electricity privatisation in that state. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. I am aware that a press release was issued earlier today by ACOSS talking about an unprecedented church and community alliance calling for tax change. I note at the outset that, although it says there is a church call for tax change, in the main it is church agencies, certainly not the bishops themselves. I think it has been made entirely clear by both the Anglican bishops and the Catholic bishops that the churches themselves say that there is no position of the Church in relation to these issues.Unfortunately, the statement does not contain any analysis. It does not have any analysis of the tax package, nor does it advance one inch an analysis of the benefits which are going to be provided to Australia, particularly to low income earners, as a result of the government's tax changes. It does not take any further the analysis that was done by ACOSS with the help, I believe, of the Melbourne Institute, presented to the Senate inquiry which, on their own analysis, showed that every single demographic would be better off as a result of the government's tax changes - age pensioner single, age pensioner couple, single in the work force, couple in the work force, couple with children, sole parent with children. Members of the House will recall that, after ACOSS released its own analysis showing that people would be better off, it then called for further work to try to identify somebody who would be worse off.Support for a broad based goods and services tax comes from all of the groups in the food industry - the Australian Food and Grocery Council, the Restaurant and Catering Association, the Association of Retail Grocers, Woolworths - all of which make the point that food, however defined, would require enormous compliance costs if it were taken out of a broad based goods and services tax. In fact, the Labor Party supports the government on this. The Labor Party's position, which was reaffirmed yesterday, is that it does not believe that food should be taken  out of the goods and services tax. The Labor Party made it entirely clear yesterday that it is going to vote against excluding food from the goods and services tax. The fact that it says that does not necessarily mean that that is what it will do, but it was said as recently as yesterday.The government has been supported in relation to this view by the international experts, and I have informed the House of probably one of the world experts on this - the Dutch professor who has been an international analyst in relation to this. The government is supported by all the economists who have appeared before the Senate inquiry, including those who were called by the Labor Party - economists Dixon, Harding and Warren. It has been supported by the Food Council - which made the bona fide point that zero rating food would give $5 of benefit to the top 80 per cent of income earners for every $1 of benefit to low income earners - which makes the point that it is fairer and it reduces compliance costs.If you exclude food from GST, you are going to have tax inspectors running around trying to see whether the chocolate on a gingerbread man is bigger than the eyes, trying to determine whether it is food or a snack. You are going to have tax inspectors putting thermometers into pies to see whether they are fresh or takeaway. The government is supported by the economists, international experience, the Commissioner of Taxation and, of course, the Australian people, as expressed in their votes at the last federal election.I finish by saying that it is all very well to say you should drive a $5 billion hole through the government's tax reform, but I note that nowhere in that press release was there any suggestion as to where you could get $5 billion from to make it up. To drive the budget back into deficit would, of course, cost jobs and cost interest rates in this country. The great news is that tomorrow the government will be introducing legislation to increase all family assistance in Australia. We are doing that in two ways - through payments for families that are not in the tax system and through increased tax-free thres  holds for families that are in the tax system. Under the legislation which the government is going to introduce tomorrow, a single income family with two children will get the normal $6,000 tax-free threshold plus an additional $5,000 because it is a single income family plus $2,000 dollars for each of two children, making another $4,000, which will make for a two child, single income family a tax-free threshold of $15,000 - no tax on your first $15,000. - Again opposed by Labor, these family benefits will go through to benefit families as a result of tax reform. Why can't the Australian Senate get on and see the wisdom of that policy?</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes. For the first time in a long time the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has correctly quoted something that I had said. It is the case that I have a high regard for the Salvation Army. I have a high regard for Anglicare. I have a high regard for the Catholic Church. I have a high regard for a lot of the organisations. But I happen to believe that on this issue they are in error, and I will explain why I believe they are in error.The Treasurer has already explained the paucity of the material contained in the statement. I have read the statement, and the statement calls for the government to punch a $5 billion hole in the tax package and it says, `Other organisations have worked out how you might be able to fill it.' I welcome the participation of all of these organisations in the taxation debate, but I think it is very important to recall the words - I think about seven or eight months ago after the government's taxation package was released - of the Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne, George Pell. He said, `There is no such thing as a Catholic position on something like taxation reform.' And I think that whenever any of us start invoking the name of the church - whether it is the Catholic Church, the Anglican Church, the Uniting Church, the Baptist Church or the Salvation Army - we ought to remember that there is no such thing as a Catholic position on taxation reform. -  - Indeed, there are views of Catholics on tax reform, just as there are views of Anglicans and Baptists and views of agnostics and so forth. So it falls to us as the representatives of the Australian people to make a judgment. I think their analysis is wrong. I do not believe for a moment that if you took food out you would have a more equitable system. If you took food out you would be delivering very significant benefits to high income earners. If you take out fresh food but you seek to include restaurant meals you create enormous anomalies and enormous inequities. -  - If you exclude restaurant meals you are making a very, very significant gesture. You are giving a bonanza to the well off in the community. It is far better, as the Commissioner of Taxation pointed out, to have a broadly based indirect tax that includes everything and then through the compensation system you provide special assistance to low income earners.I think it is also worth pointing out to those who appended their names and the names of their organisations to the statement that was released this morning that a large number of food items will, in fact, fall in price as a consequence of the decision that has been taken by the government. And, overall, the package that we have released and which has been endorsed by the Australian public contains major benefits for the low income people of this community. The Treasurer has already pointed out the massive family benefits that accrue under the taxation package. Pensioners and low income earners will be significantly advantaged by the package. The package contains a guarantee to protect the safety net and the incomes of pensioners within the Australian community. - Up-front there will be a four per cent rise in pensions. - It will always be 1½ per cent ahead. - Nothing that the Labor Party can say or do can alter the fact that under our package pensioners will always be 1½ percent ahead in real terms in relation to the cost of living adjustment. -  - The government's taxation plan represents the most comprehensive and thoroughgoing review of the Australian taxation system carried out by any government of any political stripe in this country. We are the first government since Federation to put forward such a detailed and comprehensive plan for economic reform to the Australian people. We took it to the Austral  ian people. We laid it out before the Australian people. We did not disguise any of the details. We did not hold anything back. The Australian people voted for the plan and we intend to implement the decision of the Australian people. And those who sit opposite and those who belong to the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats in the Senate who are posturing about voting against this legislation will not only be voting against the will of the Australian people, as expressed at the last election, they will also be voting to reject a $13 billion tax cut for the Australian people. They will be voting to reject family benefit. They will be voting to reject pension guarantees. They will be voting to reject a $3½ billion cut in the cost of diesel fuel for rural Australia. They will be voting to reject the removal of a $4½ billion tax impost on Australian exporters. They will be voting to reject the removal of $10½ billion of tax relief for the Australian business community. In other words, they will be voting against a plan and a charter that will deliver to this country in the 21st century an unrivalled opportunity to drive home the massive economic endowments we now have.As a result of the policies of this government, this country at the moment is better poised internationally than it has been for decades. And so far from that being a time when you stop the reform process, it is a time when the reform process should be driven home more resolutely. That is why we put the plan to the Australian people and that is why, on behalf of the government, I make it absolutely plain we have no intention of retreating one iota on our taxation reform plan.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I note at the outset that she, of course, comes from the beef state. Queensland is the home of the major part of  the beef exporting industry of this country. No sector in any part of the country benefits more from our tax reform proposals than the far-flung beef industry in Queensland. So the member has a real interest, particularly when we are faced with some pretty spurious and second-rate contributions to the debate about our reform proposals. The fact is that the government's response to the claims that the member refers to is to point out that they are driven by ill-advised politics; not by any commitment to sound policy. It is plain that the ALP and the Democrats - with the assistance of the Greens - clearly want to maintain Labor's taxation regime for transport fuel in this country. Labor's transport fuel taxation regime was amongst the highest in the world and the highest in the world when it comes to comparable countries such as Canada and America - agriculturally-oriented, exporting nations with vast differences. It all proves that, in the end, for all of their new-found rhetoric about their new-found concern for rural and regional Australia, they do not give a fig about it. They want to deny rural Australia $3,500 million worth of benefits through taxation reform, particularly in the area of fuel. The fact of the matter is that the whole community will clearly benefit from lower transport costs. The cost of goods will be reduced. There will be a boosting of the efficiency and the competitiveness of our exports - so it goes on.Let us come to some specific claims. There are some specific claims by the Australia Institute in the report that these tax reforms will lead to increased deaths from pollution and crashes. This is based on a very simplistic assumption that cheaper fuel will mean more trucks driving further. The claims fail to recognise the enormous advances in vehicle technology and in engine design in both cars and trucks. It denies completely the reality that from 1997 -  -  - The more they dislike the answers, the more the truth is exposed, the more we hear some background static from the other side. And the more we ought to ignore it, because it reflects the fact that we are onto reality. Statistics do not lie. From  1987 to 1997 the number of road deaths involving heavy trucks in Australia dropped by 44 per cent from 243 to 169. While you had more trucks on the road covering greater distances, hauling more freight and reflecting more economic activity - road deaths came down. The claims also fail to recognise the success that road safety campaigns are having. They fail to recognise that tighter emission controls being put in place by the government will bring down total emissions. In fact, particulate emissions for heavy vehicles and trucks will come down by around 70 per cent.Some further interesting observations have been made today by the National Farmers Federation. They point out that reality disproves the committee's conclusions. They point out -  -  - Oh yes, we want to shoot the messengers! How about you shoot some of your own messengers when they deliver messages that you do not like - like Mr Hogg, perhaps? They do not like being exposed for wanting to deny rural and regional Australia some very major benefits. The NFF has pointed out that, in fact, you have seen a substantial reduction in fuel costs in this country, because of reducing crude prices in recent years. What has happened to fuel usage? It has actually come down. And the committee has failed, they say, to take into account that, as you get a reduction in sales tax under the tax reform policy, you will actually see an upgrading of a vehicle fleet and a reduction in its age. More efficient trucks will mean very real environmental outcomes. So, in a whole range of ways, the views being put to us out of that Senate committee by the majority ought to be, I think, taken with more than a grain of salt. - Mr Speaker, I am more than happy to table the NFF's press report.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. This is an important issue. I have sought further information regarding this matter. I am advised that the Queenstown Hospital PABX system experienced an outage - in other words, it did not work. It started at 9.00 a.m. on Sunday, 28 March. Telstra has advised that the fault was fixed by 6.00 p.m. on Sunday night, but subsequently a second apparently unrelated fault occurred which was only fixed at 3.20 p.m. the following day, on the Monday, when they received spare parts. Telstra has advised that staff resources was not the issue. However, local management had difficulty in finding staff, in contacting them. This matter is being investigated and the government will be requiring, naturally, the same explanation that Telstra's management will want. -  - However, the hospital responded superbly to the problem and they put in place a contingency plan to maintain communication which was praised by the Tasmanian Minister for Health and Human Services, Minister Judy Jackson. What the hospital did was advise the community by radio to ring 000 for emergencies or otherwise the hospital's mobile number and they diverted calls through Hobart to the ambulance  officer on duty. Telstra is required by the government - indeed, at its own initiative in any event - to investigate this matter fully and determine why such a delay occurred and how it should not occur in the future. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. The Howard government has taken unprecedented steps in assisting people to maintain healthy marriages and relationships. Despite the best efforts of all concerned, many  marriages regrettably do break down. With a view to achieving greater balance and equity in family law matters, the government has today announced a new regime for the treatment of superannuation on marriage breakdown. The changes will enable parties for the first time to divide superannuation between them and superannuation trustees will be required to act on the parties' decision. This will widen the choice available to parties for the separation of property on marriage breakdown. The parties will also be able to settle their affairs quickly and inexpensively using non-judicial dispute resolution services, including the recently foreshadowed property arbitration services. But where the parties are unable to agree, the court will have power to order that superannuation be divided.The inflexibilities of the current situation are in nobody's interests, particularly not in the interests of the two parties to the marriage breakdown. Typically the non-working spouse, usually the female partner, is left with no access to retirement savings built up during the marriage and the working partner, usually the male, is obliged to trade off other property and then maybe is left without current financial resources until retirement. This is a no-win situation. The changes will enable provision to be made for retirement for both parties, an option that is not currently available under current law. Today I have released a discussion paper `Property and  family law - options for change'. This, along with the government superannuation reforms, is further evidence of the government's commitment to fairness, balance and equity in family law matters.</DOC>

 - The honourable member will know very well that it is the role of Telstra's board and management to determine the location, placing of staff, as well as equipment and the like. We expect at all times Telstra to be full and frank and open about their business decisions and to be sensitive to any employees who might be affected by change and the like. This has always been conveyed to Telstra and certainly will not change in the future. But what interests me most about the member's question is that there is an assumption that Telstra performed better in days gone past when in full government ownership, whereas we know it could have taken up to six weeks to have phones connected even if the lines were in place. The best way to bring about the resolution of the issues regarding Queenstown Hospital and elsewhere is to have full competition.I notice with interest that Senator Brian Harradine has said that the major contributor to differences and the level of services between urban and rural is the lack of competition in rural areas. That is what the government's whole policy is aimed at - that is, opening it up to competition so that, whether it be a hospital or whether it be a private residence, there are greater levels of service. We can further facilitate and indeed enhance that by way of community service obligations, universal service obligations and other re  quirements as we have with the first part privatisation of Telstra in legislative form.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth and assure him that the reports are indeed correct. The government is determined to clamp down on those people who should be seeking work and who are required to seek work but who attempt to avoid their obligations and social responsibility through taking advantage of any loopholes that might happen to exist in the law. I mentioned to the House a week or so ago legislation that had passed the House of Representatives and which was going to the Senate which dealt with New Zealand migrants coming to Australia and indeed some other groups of people. This same legislation includes a number of other measures which will be important in preserving the integrity of our welfare system.For instance, for some time now the law has penalised people moving from areas of  high employment to areas of low employment whilst they are on welfare benefits. People have been able to avoid that requirement by cancelling their benefits and then moving to the sun belt and applying again. This legislation will close that loophole. There have also been people who have been applying for a job outside of their area who get that job but, when it is offered to them, they turn it down and remain on benefits. That loophole will also be closed. People who refuse a job that has been offered to them will have their benefits affected.Most people who receive benefits do so legitimately and receive benefits for which they are entitled. But if people want to have a life on the beach and enjoy the sunshine, they cannot expect the taxpayers to fund that sort of a lifestyle. This government will be closing those sorts of loopholes. I am somewhat disappointed that members opposite have indicated some opposition to elements of this legislation. I hope that they rethink their negativity and that there will be some glimmer of hope that they may support the legislation when it goes to the Senate.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, the question from the honourable member for Lilley is virtually the same as one that was asked of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs yesterday, and answered in that context. There are benefits provided to veterans by this government and, indeed, by governments since the promises and commitments were made to veterans following the return of soldiers from war. - Mr Speaker, the question was about legislation that is currently before the  House. I introduced that legislation to the House, so I am certainly aware of what its context is. It does, in some regards, deal with veterans' benefits differently from benefits to other people such as those on Newstart. - In some ways, the social security benefits are different from the benefits provided to veterans, and the conditions that apply are different. In some areas, they are more generous; in some areas, less generous. Governments make decisions about the priorities which should be applied when additional resources are available to assist in providing benefits to those in need in the community.The honourable member for Lilley is one of those people in the Labor Party who seeks to go backwards to try to find some kinds of new roots for the Labor Party. Some members opposite, I notice, are trying to find new directions for the Labor Party. -  - The member for Lilley a couple of days ago issued a media release in which he went back to the 18th century Russian soldier Potemkin to endeavour to get some kind of background to the Labor Party's new future.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. His electorate contains, of course, many rural and remote facilities. Of the 7,000 new aged care places that I have announced today, 40 per cent of them will go to rural and remote parts of Australia. The 7,000 new places that we are announcing amount to an investment of a further $67 million by this government in aged care places for older Australians who need that residential care.In addition to funding for residential places, there are an additional 4,300 places for community aged care packages, which allows us to have the flexibility for older Australians who wish to remain in their own homes, which they have clearly indicated is their preference. There are 2,500 residential care places, and there are a number of places for restructuring - again, to enable people to meet the accreditation process that we have set in place.All this stands in direct contrast to what the Labor Party left us. The Labor Party left us 10,000 places short. They did not even meet their own benchmark. They set it in 1986 and, by 1996, they had left us 10,000 places short, effectively withdrawing $1.5 billion in funding from the whole of the aged care sector. I have used this graph before, and it is extremely good. -  - Mr Speaker, it is such a good chart that I think I will table it. The point is that sometimes, to get the message across to the lot across the other side, they need graphics to help them along. That graph certainly shows them 10,000 places short, and we are fixing them up. I would simply say that, once again, this is an area where the Labor Party left an appalling legacy, and we are fixing it up.</DOC>

 - I do not know where the member for Adelaide gets his figures in relation to the $20 difference between an ordinary pensioner and a veteran with a veteran entitlement for a disability pension, so I really cannot take that into account in my answer. Our Australian veterans already receive the most generous compensation schemes in the world, and I do not think even the opposition disputes that - that we have one of the most generous repatriation systems in the world.The fact of the matter is that the legislation protects veterans by ensuring that any other compensation payment made to a veteran that is taken into account for disability pension purposes will not affect their income support payment. So, in relation to the member's  question, I think he should go back and have a look again.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question and for the close interest that she takes in the success of the Job Network. Any new and successful scheme like the Job Network can be expected to attract the interest of academics and commentators. I am aware of recent research by Melbourne University's Don Harding, who said that the Job Network was a very significant advance on the old CES. But he did call for the government to go further down this particular reform path. Mr Harding wants the government to create employment accounts. The idea is that job seekers would pay part of  their benefits into these accounts and use them to buy employment services.This is a government which is very open to new ideas, but I can assure the House that we have no intention of creating any such accounts. But the Harding proposal has strong echoes of a plan by the member for Werriwa in his recent research to create income security accounts which everyone could draw down on or pay back, depending upon their economic circumstances. But that is not the only alternative approach. While the member for Werriwa wants a more radical free-market approach, we have the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Batman calling for a return to the paternalism of Working Nation.In an article last Friday, the member for Werriwa said, `This is, of course, the saddest sight in public life - a smart person giving up on the hope of new answers to longstanding problems.' Ostensibly the member for Werriwa was referring to Bob Carr, but we all know that he was really talking about the Leader of the Opposition. I call upon the Leader of the Opposition to end this policy anarchy and repudiate the member for Werriwa.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Menzies for his question and for his strong support for Work for the Dole projects. I am aware of a proposal to place 140 Work for the Dole participants in up to 25 ACT schools, which has not proceeded because of opposition from the local union movement. I am aware of another proposal to place 24 carefully selected and supervised Work for the Dole participants in ACT child-care centres which also attracted significant union opposition. But it is going ahead and operating well because it has the support of the vast majority of the parents concerned. Union opposition to Work for the Dole is pretty surprising, given the member for Werriwa's support for forcing welfare recipients to act as parent educators or risk losing the dole. It is also surprising given that under the former government's Working Nation program hundreds and hundreds of unemployed people were placed in schools and child-care centres on programs.I have been asked about recent statements in support of Work for the Dole. None other than the man of the hour, the Premier of New South Wales, said recently:Let's think of the girl working in the school on the north coast working for the dole because she wants to be there in a classroom with kindergarten kids.I thank the Premier of New South Wales for his endorsement of Work for the Dole. Presumably this is yet another split within the Labor Party. I call on the unsuccessful Leader of the Opposition to reprimand the successful Premier for breaking ranks on this issue.</DOC>

 - The government is proceeding at a great pace to get regional forest agreements in place throughout Australia for  the purpose of guaranteeing certainty to industry and encouraging their investment to create and guarantee the jobs of many working people in rural and regional Australia into the foreseeable future. Consequently, the government has put forward, with the support of all industry sectors, regional forest agreement legislation so that those agreements that are met between premiers and the Prime Minister will have the backing of legislation.It is of concern to me, nevertheless, that the Labor Party has again today backed down on one of its own policy initiatives - the national forest policy statement. We heard them daily backing down on their privatisation policy when they were in government. One wonders if now they are so convinced that privatisation does not work whether they are going to buy back the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas, which they sold so they could spend the money. The Labor Party has now announced that it is their intention to propose amendments to the regional forest agreement legislation in direct contradiction to all industry requests, including the trade union movement. They want this legislation. The Tasmanian government wants the legislation and have passed their own regional forest agreement legislation. They want it for certainty, and the proposals put forward by the Labor opposition on this issue would completely negate the purpose of the legislation.The government will not accept such amendments. It must be known by those opposite who have been getting their names published in the Age newspaper wanting their constituency to know that they are really unhappy about this matter that, on the other hand, in typical Labor style, having signed the piece of paper they are going to vote for something their own constituency does not want. So much for those members of parliament opposite in terms of representing their own constituency. This is a situation where the Leader of the Opposition had to branch stack his own caucus committee to get the result he has delivered on behalf of the left wing in terms of amending the regional forest agreement legislation. It was all in the Age newspaper. Your people are leaking like a  sieve on this issue. They really have it in for you. -  - In every way the Labor Party knows that what they are doing is wrong. They want to destroy the very process that they put in place, the regional forest agreement process. In closing, let me point out that in their press release they talked about -  -  -  - In their press release they talk about how everything should be done as it was in New South Wales and how transparent that was. In New South Wales, out of four regional forest agreements, the New South Wales government has yet to have a written public consultation process. If that is transparent, I will go he! They have refused to publicise the methodology and the data that they are using to write contracts on sawmill entitlement, yet their own Auditor-General says that that is wrong. There are no secrets in Western Australia - you have only to read the media coverage. There are no secrets; it is all on the record.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden Monaro for his question because the member for Eden Monaro has taken an interest in regional migration and has been actively promoting opportunities within his own electorate for people who are anxious to enter Australia and to take up some of the opportunities that this government has implemented.I was also glad to see that the shadow minister, the honourable member for Bowman, had taken some interest in these matters - he commented in the press yesterday and put forward some constructive proposals. I am glad to hear of his interest because I pursued that same route when I was a shadow minister. I pressed very strongly on this issue because it was one that his colleagues had not taken any interest in before. Since being in government I have been responsible for implementing a wide range of initiatives which I would like to tell him about. - I think you might need to know something about it as well. Obviously in relation to this matter there is an increasing awareness in the opposition of the measures that the government has implemented. We put in place the state and territory nominated independence scheme which enables states and territories to nominate skilled migrant applications for identified skills shortages. We have enhanced the regional sponsored -  -  - Not enough, I might say. One state is very actively involved in it, and  I am encouraging the others to also be involved in it. - We have enhanced the regional sponsored migration scheme which allows employers in regional Australia to nominate overseas personnel for permanent entry where they are unable to recruit suitable skilled personnel locally. We have the skill matching scheme which is working very effectively in helping to identify migrants who have applied in the skilled categories who are prepared to move to regional Australia to fill identified skills shortages. We have the regional linked category which enables family members who have already settled in regional Australia to sponsor family members. We have the regional established business in Australia scheme, and I have the working party, which has been looking at skilled migration, examining further options.This is an area in which we are very actively involved and in which I welcome the opposition's interest. But what I am particularly interested in is the proposal to link access to benefits to people residing in particular regional areas of Australia after they enter Australia and the suggestion that benefits might be able to be denied to people who move from a particular regional location if they do so within a period of five years. This is from the same party that said we should not have provisions which would exclude access to benefits for people who had been in Australia for two years. But it is a very interesting proposal, and I am certainly prepared, in concert with my colleagues, to have a look at it and see how it might be able to be used. I am glad to hear of your interest in this matter and I am glad that you are striking out in new directions with positive initiatives that we might be able to follow up.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Robertson for that question. But it is very instructive that, when you get a question on economic reform, you get groans from the other side of the House. I am delighted to say to the honourable member for Robertson, whose constituents have enjoyed the fruits of the government's economic stewardship of this nation over the last three years, that this government has had a remarkable record of achievement so far as economic management is concerned. That oft quoted observation of Paul Krugman to the effect that Australia has been the miracle economy of the Western World says it all.Over the last three years, we have pursued a policy that has been very successful. We set about cutting the budget deficit that we inherited from the Labor Party. We have delivered the lowest interest rates in 30 years. We have delivered very low levels of inflation. We have presided over high levels of business investment. We have presided over extensive micro-economic and macro-economic reform. And we have also presided over very significant changes to the industrial relations system that have delivered significant reductions in the level of unemployment.The honourable member for Robertson asks me: what has been the major source of opposition? The major source of opposition to the economic reform agenda of the coalition government has been, of course, the Australian Labor Party. The Leader of the Opposition in his question asked me whether I had read something that Colleen McCullough had said;  well I hadn't, but I can tell you that I have read something that one of his colleagues has said. It appears in a Bulletin magazine article this morning written by Laurie Oakes under the heading `Carr drives home lessons for Beazley'. The article states:Della Bosca is said to be convinced that federal Labor should cut and run on the GST.Very revealingly, the article says that one of New South Wales Labor's leading lights goes on to say:They're sick of us rabbiting on about GSTs on coffins and running shoes . . . They want us to stop taking a 100% negative stance and start talking about how we're going to make the tax system fairer.They are not the words of a coalition member; they are the words of a member of the Australian Labor Party. They say very effectively what a growing number of Australians think - that the Labor Party has been peddling essentially in negative, destructive, backward-looking attitudes and policies ever since it went into opposition in 1996. The Labor Party's response to virtually every initiative of the coalition is to say no, or to oppose it. Instead of supporting sensible initiatives to improve the economic and industrial strength of Australia even more, the Labor Party has fought them tooth and nail.When we brought down our first budget, the Leader of the Opposition on 22 July said that `they cut too hard in their first budget'. Those opposite have opposed the privatisation of Telstra; they oppose the entrenching of youth wages in the industrial relations system; they have opposed our attempts to further reform the unfair dismissal laws. They have opposed just about every major economic reform that this government has produced over the last three years.Despite that opposition, we have been able to deliver economic achievements that nobody believed possible just three years ago. Despite the opposition of the Labor Party, despite the negative attitude of the Leader of the Opposition and his frontbench colleagues, we have delivered an Australian economy that the great bulk of Australians are very proud of and the great bulk of Australians are benefiting from.What has been the response of the Labor Party? The response of the Labor Party is to be negative, to be carping, to be backward looking, to not give any credit where credit is due, to believe that the only attitude that the Australian public appreciate is a negative attitude. Let me say to the Leader of the Opposition that the dogs in your own party are barking on this. They are now starting to say that you have been too negative. The Leader of the Opposition ought to listen to Mr Della Bosca. The Leader of the Opposition ought to listen to the person who says that they want us to stop taking a 100 per cent negative stance and start talking about how we are going to make not only the tax system fairer but the Australian economy better. You have been indicted by your own side for your negative attitude, and a growing number of Australians regard you as the Dr No of Australian politics.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. What the honourable member conveniently ignores or refuses to accept is that this government put in place in legislative form the customer service guarantee. We are currently strengthening the customer service guarantee. We will give the Australian Communications Authority the power to act directly to require Telstra to respond to specific problems like the Tasmanian problem identified by the ACA in its quarterly report. So if the current Telstra legislation passes through the Senate, the government has more power to direct the telecommunications carrier. Moreover, the best thing that the opposition can do to assist regional services and infrastructure is to pass the legislation for further privatisation of Telstra.$671 million has been set aside by way of social bonus for regional and rural customers. We will get that radical upgrade of infrastructure in a way that is not possible otherwise. It is the Labor Party opposing for the sake of opposing which is preventing rural customers getting a significant upgrade in both infrastructure and service by way of Telstra, all underwritten by legislative protection inserted by the government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. I think we on this side of the House would welcome the support of any member of parliament who wanted to engage in tax reform for the sake of the country. If the Labor Party is reconsidering its position and will now look at tax reform constructively, it will not be our attitude to say, `Well, you were wrong, and you have now been humiliated into a turnabout.' It will be our attitude to welcome a positive contribution from Labor to the  development of a better tax system in Australia.We hold that out to the Labor Party because obviously having locked themselves into opposing tax reform and now having taken the heat for being negative for negativity's sake, it would be good if they had an exit strategy. We saw reported in today's Bulletin by Mr Laurie Oakes that Della Bosca, who is one of the Labor Party's chief strategists, now wants the Labor Party to come out and stop being negative. The article states:'People want to hear what our attitude is to the income tax system,' says one of NSW Labor's leading lights.It is in plural; there are more than one of them - `Labor's leading lights':'They're sick of us rabbiting on about GSTs on coffins and running shoes and all that crap. They want us to stop taking a 100% negative stance . . . Another one of the ALP strategists says that Della Bosca is said to be convinced federal Labor should cut and run on the GST. On this occasion, I think we could say Della is right.The Leader of the Opposition has been locked into this negative stance by the Victorian ALP, just as he was locked into a negative stance by the member for Jagajaga opposing the private health insurance rebate while members of the Labor Party were running around desperately saying, `We hope it gets up on somebody else's vote.' He has been locked into a negative position by the member for Hotham, another one of the genii from the Victorian ALP who has locked them in against tax reform. Now the New South Wales ALP is coming out and calling it as it is. Glenn Milne wrote on Monday:Elements of the New South Wales Right now want Beazley to admit that Labor's lost the battle. Kim's bogged down in the marshes on the GST, said one ALP strategist.I wondered why that was in Glenn Milne's column on Monday. He interviewed Della Bosca on Sunday. It is in Glenn's column on Monday. Laurie writes his column on Sunday, and Della is in Laurie's column for Wednesday. Bob Hogg says this in the Age :On the policy front Beazley needs to do two things. First, he should declare support for the  government's GST. Second, he should support the full privatisation of Telstra.So we have the state secretary of the New South Wales ALP, the federal secretary of the New South Wales ALP, and Labor's major Premier, Bob Carr, saying:My view is that a government with a majority in any lower house ought to be able to implement its program not subject to frustration by upper house, state or federal . . . To which we say, `Amen, Bob.' Here is a Labor leader who is used to governing, who wants to govern, and what is his advice to the Leader of the Opposition - the Leader of the Opposition who has now given up any hope of ever having responsibility for anything and of being in government?We used to try the tactic of turning around and talking to ourselves to pretend that we were not getting a bucket, too. We used to do it all the time. When we were getting a bucket, the deputy would turn to the leader and say, `Keep talking and pretend you're not listening; keep up the conversation.' It is the latest mark of a leader who is condemning himself to permanent oppositionism. Listen to Neil O'Keefe, another one of Labor's thinkers. - The member for Burke, one of Labor's thinkers, wrote in the Age  on 26 March 1999:. . . it is 14 years since a consumption tax was first seriously -  - You try to give these blokes a go and they object. I withdraw that - he is not one of Labor's thinkers, and I do not rely on what he said in the Age . In 1992, Paul Keating said:I say to the opposition, the Labor Party would not obstruct the passage of the GST legislation in the Senate. I want to make it totally clear that a vote for Hewson is a vote for the GST.In the Courier-Mail  on 26 August 1997, Kim Beazley said:If John Howard goes to the next election with a clear and honestly described GST tax proposal and he wins the election, Labor will regard that as a mandate and not seek to block it.That is what he said on 26 August 1997. He gets backed into this position by the Victorian ALP, he gets locked into opposing private health insurance by the member for Jagajaga and he gets locked into opposing tax reform by the member for Hotham - the member for Hotham who now claims that he is drying out; the member for Hotham who was last seen trying to chase Toorak tractors out of the Melbourne suburbs. That was his great contribution to the last election campaign. This is an opposition that opposes for the sake of opposition. It has no policy and it ought to reconsider.</DOC>

 - This government's excellent initiatives to assist families can be taken in a number of ways - by way of additional tax-free thresholds, or paid through Centrelink as a fortnightly payment or through Medicare offices. So there is a range of ways that this government's measures to benefit families will be delivered to Australian families. - I remind the House that Labor was in government for 13 very, very long years. They had 13 years to introduce a family tax initiative and they did not do it. They are now telling us that if they were given another chance they would introduce a credit, but who knows what it would be  worth? The reality is that the last time Labor promised tax cuts to families they actually put taxes up. The last time they went to an election promising tax cuts, the cuts were abandoned immediately after the election and we had the biggest regime of tax increases in the history of our nation, all introduced without any compensation to families whatsoever.Anyone who believes any proposal put forward by the opposition has a very short memory indeed. This government actually has the legislation before the House to introduce substantial benefits for Australian families. If you weren't opposing for opposing's sake, you would be passing that legislation and passing the benefits on to Australian families.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question on this very difficult but very important issue. I admire the way she has shown great courage in handling this issue in a correct policy sense. The new reactor will be a state-of-the-art facility for the continuation of valuable scientific research. It means Australia's nuclear medicine capabilities will be among the best in the world. That is a view supported by the Australian Medical Association. Unlike Labor, which opposed this just for the sake of opposing proper and correct policy, we have the real interests of the nation at heart, including the nuclear medicine interests of the nation. A letter, dated 11 May 1998, says:On the new reactor, I am afraid that the realities of politics in an election year, and in particular our need to win Hughes, have led us to a position of opposing a new reactor at the Lucas Heights site - as difficult as that may be to justify in objective safety-focused terms.Well might the member for Holt blush, because he signed that letter to Helen Garnett,  who is one of the truly great scientists of this country. He went on to say:There is certainly no desire, however, to stand in the way of developing a new capacity elsewhere if an appropriate site could be found, but that of course is not going to be an easy exercise to accomplish. I'm sorry that I could not have been more helpful on this one.What a disgrace you were in terms of correct policy settings and prosecuting responsible policy as Deputy Leader of the Opposition at that particular time. We know your embarrassment. You could not persuade your frontbench on that particular issue.Let me point out that the new nuclear reactor will ensure that Australia has a reliable supply of radioisotopes for diagnostic and therapeutic medicine. ANSTO manufactures 80 per cent of the radioisotopes used by the country's nuclear medicine facilities, and that is helping our export efforts. The reactor will create some 800 jobs in the electorate of the member for Hughes - who, I might add, was so strong in her policy stand that she was the only sitting Liberal to increase her majority at the last election.Could I add one other thing: it will boost the $2.5 million export trade to the countries of Oceania and elsewhere which rely on our nuclear exports. The truth of the matter is that the opposition is naked with regard to responsible policy settings, no more so than with regard to Lucas Heights. I support the project, but I guess I oppose Lucas Heights in one respect in that it is so safe that I would even volunteer Boree Creek as a possible location for the boutique, beautiful, safe nuclear reactor. I am backing Lucas Heights. I might add that we have had Baywatch and now we have Lucas Heights. I would urge the people of Sydney to think carefully about these issues and, if they want to pass on Baywatch, I will even volunteer the `beachettes' of the Boree creek for Baywatch!</DOC>

 - That is an intriguing question. It is intriguing on several fronts. It certainly does not encourage anybody to believe that the Labor Party is going to be anything other than 100 per cent negative. I seem to remember that the man who asked me that question was the Deputy Prime Minister in a government that had 13 years to do something for single income families, and actually made their situation infinitely worse.  -  - You had 13 years and you actually worsened the position of single income families in this country. When we brought in the family tax initiative in 1996, half of your backbench complained about the benefits that we gave to single income families. - The reality is that the Labor Party had 13 years to improve the tax inequity so far as single income families in this country are concerned. This is the first administration for 15 years that has been willing to do something to better the position of single income families. Half your own members sneered at our proposal in 1996. You said that it was an attempt by me to drive women back to the kitchen. You bitterly attacked our proposals to help single income families, and now you have the audacity to get up in this parliament and to say, in effect, that we should go even further in relation to single income families. The Leader of the Opposition had 13 years to fix the position for single income families. With the former Prime Minister in 1993 you made all families worse off when you increased indirect taxes without providing any compensation. I remind the parliament that in 1996 we went to the Australian people with a program that introduced -  - The history of the taxation treatment of families in this country is highlighted by the fact that in 1996, for the first time in a generation, a side of politics was prepared to reverse the growing tax inequity against families with children, and most particularly single income families with young children. That was based on a very simple philosophical proposition; that is, that we should not only recognise the cost incurred by parents in raising children but we should also promote as far as possible the maximum degree of choice for parents as to whether one or both parents were in the work force when they had young children. It is our view that that ought, as far as possible, be a matter of choice, not a matter of taxation or government dicta. That is why we sought in  1996 to make things a little easier for single income families. We have in fact made them even better in the taxation plan. I am very proud of that particular part of the plan.At every stage we have been opposed by the Australian Labor Party. I simply say to the Leader of the Opposition: if you and the Democrats persist in opposing our legislation, you are putting at risk the greatest family tax bonanza for Australian families in a generation. That is what you are doing. You are putting it at risk. You had 13 years to help Australian families, you had 13 years to give the women of Australia more choice -  - In asking the question, it has entirely escaped the reasoning of the Leader of the Opposition that, under the policies he pursued, there were no benefits for single income families at all. There were no additional benefits for single income families. You sought to create a situation where the choice was not available except for the very well off in the community. Once again it is an example of how, when you were in government, although you proudly said that you represented the workers of Australia -  -  - Mr Speaker, when they were in government they denied the low income people of the community, they denied the low income earners of the families of Australia -  - It is a new definition of `outrage' when you attack the Labor Party. It is an outrage to be reminded of the fact that when the Labor Party was in office the position of working class families deteriorated markedly.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to inform the honourable member for Moreton and all members of the House of a $4 billion improvement in the Commonwealth government's financial performance for the year 1997-98. This will result in the first ever operating surplus as measured by the government's annual consolidated financial statements. As distinct from the May budget, the CFS measures the financial performance of the general government sector as well as that of public trading enterprises like Australia Post and public financial enterprises like the Reserve Bank.The CFS for the 1977-98 year has produced a surplus of $1.5 billion before abnormals, and that is a substantial improvement on the $2.5 billion deficit which was generated in the previous year. When the sale of the first tranche of Telstra and other abnormals are taken into account the surplus climbs to a record $7.5 billion. This outstanding result has been used to reduce Labor's debt by nearly 10 per cent. This has reduced our annual interest bill by nearly $2 billion. This result demonstrates the coalition government's commitment to the fiscal discipline needed to insulate Australia from the Asian crisis, to  maintain international confidence and to maintain low interest rates.The CFS, produced on an accrual basis for the fourth year running, records that Labor's debt was reduced in the 1997-98 year by $11.5 billion or nine per cent of the whole of government level. In the general government sector, which of course excludes public trading enterprises and the public financial enterprises, debt repayment reached a massive $13.9 billion. In other words, the coalition's prudent fiscal policy is now paying dividends - lower debt and smaller debt repayments. And our debt levels and our debt payments can be made even smaller if Labor stops its obstruction and permits the sale of the next tranche of Telstra. It is worth reminding the members opposite once again of what the former ALP Secretary Bob Hogg said just one week ago. He said:On the policy front, Beazley needs to do two things - firstly, he should declare support for the government's GST and, secondly, he should declare support for the full privatisation of Telstra.And if the Leader of the Opposition does not want to listen to the former Secretary of the ALP I remind him of a person he has high regard for. And only yesterday he indicated that high regard in this House by saying:. . . congratulations to John Della Bosca, who headed up an expert machine which understood the electorate they were dealing with and pitched policy exactly right to their concerns.If this man of the moment, this great strategist that you praised so fulsomely yesterday in the House, understands the electorate, then you should take notice of what he told you only in the last few days. You should listen to John Della Bosca when he says to you that you should support a new tax system. You should listen to Bob Hogg when he tells you should support the sale of Telstra. You should get with it and start recognising what is good for the Australian people instead of simply being obstructionist and opposing for opposition's sake.</DOC>

 - As I am sure all honourable members are aware, the negotiations between the Commonwealth and the states in relation to the housing agreement are current, and it is quite common in these circumstances for a range of claims to be made by those seeking an increase in the offer from the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth has made a very generous offer to the states which will secure their funding and increase the amount of money available to them for their housing needs. That is a very generous offer, and I think the states should accept it and get on with the job of providing community housing.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. There are a number of claims being made that voluntary student unionism will lead to a cessation of student services but, unfortunately, those making those claims forget that we already have an example of how VSU is operating in Australia in the state of Western Australia. In Western Australia, student services is vibrant and student organisations are strong. - The House does not need to take my word for this. I will quote the words of the guild president of Murdoch University. - The guild president of Murdoch University said this about the effect of  voluntary student unionism in Western Australia:The Murdoch guild has worked through VSU and is now in a financial and political position to provide excellent representation and services to Murdoch students.The members for Swan, Fremantle and Perth are graduates of the University of Western Australia. They will be interested to know that the University of Western Australia Guild claims in the orientation handbook for this year that the guild, under VSU, `has grown into one of the biggest and most vibrant student run organisations in the country.' - I am, of course, just dealing with the broad principles of policy in this area. -  - The member for Canning, who I know has an interest in this area, will be interested to hear that her alma mater, Curtin University, has a variety of student services to offer students -  - The Curtin University, operating under the VSU regime, offers a wide range of services to students on that campus. These services include catering, university policy assistance and student finances, student advocacy, study skills, legal advice, tax service, accident insurance, tertiary sports, a share house register and I could go on and on. What this demonstrates is that under VSU a very wide range of student services is available to the -  - Mr Speaker, there is a reason, I think, for the sensitivity that we are seeing on the other side of the House. The question asked me whether I was aware of the attitudes of the leaders of student unions under the compulsory unionism regime. I am aware -  - A case study has been drawn to my attention in the book called Beazley  by Peter Fitzsimons, who describes the actions of the Leader of the Opposition when he was the student guild president of the University of Western Australia. In this book, Peter Fitzsimons says:Early in his term . . . he decided that the guild would have to increase its annual subscription fees in order to meet its budget, and be able to fund some of the campaign promises that Kim, for one, had gained power on.He was for high taxes then as he is now. Peter Fitzsimons goes on to say:There was a predictable outcry from a number of students who simply did not want their own tight budgets to be stretched any further. Too bad.That is how Peter Fitzsimons describes the Leader of the Opposition's attitude - `too bad'. But it gets worse because, in this book, Mr Beazley, the Leader of the Opposition, justifies his attitude and he explains to Peter Fitzsimons:I had  to manoeuvre to get the people in sports councils to come in and back that . . . to make sure they got enough money out of it so they would be prepared to go and vote for us. I thought it quite justifiable.There you have it. There is a basic difference in values between this side of the House and the opposition because the opposition believes -  - What this quotation from the Leader of the Opposition illustrates is that there is a complete difference of values between this side of the House and the other side of the chamber. On that side of the chamber, they believe it is appropriate to compulsorily take students' money to serve their narrow political ends; whereas on this side of the chamber, we believe that student unions should be responsible to students and not the other way around.</DOC>

 - I am aware that there is some difficulty that the student union at Edith Cowan University has run into on financial grounds. I am also aware that the Monash University Gippsland's student union operating under compulsory student unionism, has had its operations ceased by Monash University on the ground that it has run into financial difficulties. So here we have a simple illustration of the fact that some student unions are well managed and manage their financial services and finances well and other student unions run into difficulties, and it does not bear at all on the issue of voluntary student unionism.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have seen claims to that effect and, surprisingly enough, they came from the shadow minister for regional development, infrastructure, transport and regional services. She actually said that it was the Prime Minister's government that has pulled so many services out of the bush and it is his government that is going to make matters worse by selling Telstra. I thought that it might be worth actually making a couple of points in relation to our commitment to services in regional Australia. The list is actually a very long one. Come, for example, to the issue of Medicare offices. Not one existing office in rural and regional Australia  has been closed. But, we have opened 582 Medicare Easyclaim offices -  -  - of which more than 400 are in regional areas, including Tathra, Holbrook, Balranald, Denman, Condobolin, Orbost, Beechworth, Barcaldine, Boggabri, Kilcoy, Monto, Chinchilla, Miles, Ceduna, Tom Price, Corrigin, Kojonup, Smithton, Carrington, Triabunna -  -  - Triabunna is an interesting area, because if you were still in government Triabunna would not have a regional forest agreement, and they would not have any forestry jobs either. -  - But then, Mr Speaker, there is Centrelink. Since March 1996, there has been a significant increase in Centrelink's presence in rural and regional Australia. New customer service centres -  -  - I was just referring to some of the centres that now have a Centrelink presence out in rural Australia: Deniliquin, Charlestown, Robina, Dalby, Yeppoon, Lightning Ridge, Leeton, Glen Innes and Mt Barker. In addition, there are 14 new call centres in regional areas employing about 1,500 people: Coffs Harbour, Toowoomba, Port Macquarie, Bendigo and Palmerston. One hundred new Centrelink Outreach Agents and services across regional Australia are in the pipeline.There have been some wild claims made about post offices. Since March 1996, there are 157 new post offices in rural and remote Australia. A really interesting one is  Creditcare - 52 towns in rural or remote communities have received permanent access to financial services: Cardwell, Dimbulah, Dirranbandi, Hebel, Surat, Werris Creek, Walla Walla, Rosedale - it goes on and on - Ashford and Bulahdelah. Rural women's health -  -  - They don't want to hear this. It is the proof that they have been seriously misrepresenting our commitment to rural and regional services. For health, $8 million over four years is to be provided for a `fly-in-fly-out' female GP service for rural and remote areas; $41.6 million over the next four years to establish 30 new regional health centres; and a rural and remote pharmacy work force development program. TradeStart offices - the Deputy Prime Minister has really been very active in this area - in Coffs Harbour, Tamworth, Gosford, Bathurst, Nowra, Wagga, Wangaratta, Ballarat, Cairns, Rockhampton, Bundaberg, Toowoomba, Albany, Geraldton, Mount Gambier, Launceston; I sound like the Deputy Prime Minister. Community legal programs - there are four centres in rural and regional Australia.But, Mr Speaker, the real hypocrisy of all of this is that, not content to deny what we have done, they want to prevent us from implementing a further $670 million worth of vitally needed programs for rural Australia - over five years, 500 rural transaction centres. We are talking about another $250 million for the Natural Heritage Trust. We are talking about a very big commitment to untimed local calls and extended zones in remote areas; filling in the black spots for people who do not have television reception; and $81 million extra for the RTIF.All of these are programs that Labor wants to stop. Not content with wanting to obstruct our economic reform programs, not content with blocking tax reform, not content with seeking to deny rural and regional Australia a $3,500 million reduction in the cost of fuel and not content with grossly misrepresenting what we have done, they want to stand in the way of some vitally important programs for rural and regional Australia. I believe that that is well known in rural and regional Australia.  It paints you as not only negative but also in a position where the only policy decision you seem to be able to take seriously is which of several memory lanes you might choose to go back down.</DOC>

 - Yesterday the honourable member for Lilley asked a question not  dissimilar to the one today. In both instances his figures are absolutely wrong. A person in the position referred to in this latest instance or the one he referred to yesterday need lose no pension whatsoever because under the arrangements there is, firstly, a $10,000 exemption from the payment and, in addition, a further free area of $2,000 per month. So taking those measures into account, the person need not lose any benefit at all. What the government is proposing to do is that, under the current arrangements, people who receive a periodic compensation payment for non-economic loss are treated differently from those who get a lump sum, and so the arrangement -  - What the government is proposing in this legislation is to introduce fairness into the compensation arrangements. It may be interesting to the member for Lilley, who was here in this place in 1993, because in 1993 the Labor government introduced proposals which were far tougher than what the government is proposing at the present time. In fact, the member for Bowman, who was the minister who brought that legislation into the House, said at the time:The government has acted and will continue to act to ensure that people who receive compensation payments use them for their support, at least for a reasonable period of time, before calling on the taxpayer funded social security system.You proposed to introduce a 50 per cent preclusion rule for all payments. - The opposition's proposals when they were in government were going to apply these measures to all compensation payments, not just non-economic loss. So what we are seeing here is a classic example of opposition for opposition's sake, not a glimmer of principle - opposition for opposition's sake.</DOC>

 - This is again another example of opposition for opposition's sake. The government proposed to introduce measures to ensure that those people who had seasonal or intermittent work and earned very large amounts of income could not then immediately seek unemployment benefits and Newstart allowances. Ironically, the opposition supported this legislation when it went through the Senate in the first place. Yesterday they changed their mind and voted down key regulations to introduce this measure.Most people on casual wages are not affected by this measure; it is only those on very high incomes. Labor were sensible in  their initial preparedness to support the measure. But, once the union heavies found out about it, they bowed to their masters. From their perspective, somebody who earns $100,000 in a six-month contract ought to immediately be able to blow the money and rely on the taxpayers for their income. That is a completely unacceptable position for this government. It is clear that the opposition are once again just opposing for opposition's sake. Their position is entirely unprincipled. It is time they supported people in real need to ensure that the taxpayers' money supports those who are in real need rather than subsidising the lifestyles of those who earn high incomes over a short period.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question addressed to the Prime Minister. I can inform the honourable member that the government is prepared to look at effective employer sanctions. -  - Well, I am interested in the view that is being offered because you had 13 years to do something about this. -  - 13 years in which -  - I have been in this House longer than most of you; in fact, all of you. I can well recall the number of times that these issues have been raised. It is being raised now only because this government is effectively dealing with the issue of people who are unlawfully in Australia. The fact is that when you were in office the only program you engaged in was the program of employer awareness. -  - I simply make the point, because there is no need for hypocrisy in relation to these matters. You put in place employer awareness programs which were designed to apprise employers of their responsibilities. That was in place when we came into office. In relation to the numbers of locations that were made when you were in office, they fell to the order of 4,000 or 5,000. We have increased those locations in the several years that we have been in office to over 12,000.We are the people who have been prepared to look at the issue of effective employer sanctions. What I have announced is that there will be a discussion paper released quite shortly. That discussion paper will have a reference group in relation to it which will bring forward recommendations as to whether or not the regime of employer sanctions ought to be entertained. That is an appropriate response and one which we did not see from any of you when you were in office, when you were not prepared to address the issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. There is no doubt that the age based system that we have and which we are very keen to see retained not only has secured jobs for young people but also has given them an opportunity to go on to other opportunities. A big survey that Australian retailers did recently showed that 69 per cent of their young, casual or part-time employees moved on to other careers. In other words, it gave them a CV. It gave them that chance in their first work opportunity to go on to other possibilities.This has been highlighted in a letter which has been copied to me, the original of which went to both the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Democrats. This is from Peter Hiscock, who runs the very successful Sovereign Hill at Ballarat, one of Australia's great tourist attractions. This is what he said in his letter to both the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Democrats:Each December we take on 30-40 students, put them through a training program and then they work in a variety of locations and occupations throughout the Park.He went on to say how many of those young people got jobs in other industries. He said:Sovereign Hill's experience in the employment of young people is no different to so many other businesses in the tourism and hospitality sector. The removal of junior rates can have only two consequences - a lower intake of young people to fit a finite budget or their replacement by more experienced people.Those are the words of somebody who employs young people, who knows what it means to young people to have a job and who is genuinely concerned as an employer to do the right thing by our young people. We can only hope that the Labor Party might finally put aside their ideology on this issue and  understand how absolutely critical it is that this legislation is secured for protecting young people's jobs and providing more jobs in the future.I am not confident of the Labor Party's attitude, and that is because they have been opposed to the changes that we are making. They seem to be opposed to them for the sake of opposition. They have now the absurd position that the private policy they have got, which they have not yet announced, would in fact require the passage of our legislation to be implemented. It is absolutely crazy and bizarre that you should now accept privately that we have got to have some aged based system, and yet you are not prepared to stand up for young people and secure their jobs. You are in a state of just being negative for the sake of it. - It has been going on for years. Bob Hogg said before the last election:Labor took a very negative campaign attitude in 1993.He made the point:I think it would be hard for anyone to qualify that period from 1993 to 1996 as good government.They went into the 1998 election with nothing but a negative policy. They now have a negative policy about the prospects of young people getting a job. Why is it? It is because you have got a weak leader not prepared to stand up for young people and their jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question, and recognise his interest in and, indeed, the concern he has about this issue. The Australian government is alarmed by the continuing reports of a rapidly worsening humanitarian situation in Kosovo. It is worth the House's while to reflect on the fact that approximately half a million ethnic Albanians, a quarter of Kosovo's population, have fled their homes, including around 100,000 in recent days. I am sure that all Australians are appalled by these events.The Australian government will make an immediate contribution of $2 million to humanitarian organisations working in the region. We will provide the support to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, to Care Australia, to the Australian Red Cross and to World Vision Australia. The activities of these agencies will target the priorities which were identified last night in Geneva by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. Those priorities are, for those refugees, shelter, transport and health services.Having said that we will provide $2 million, the honourable member might like to know that the government will, though, continue to monitor closely developments in Kosovo and the countries surrounding Kosovo, and we will provide more support if we feel that that is appropriate and necessary.</DOC>

 - We still have old Labor on the other side of the House with no ideas, getting out there, resorting to the old tactics of scaring the old people, including our veterans. Shame on all of you over there. They deserve better than ever having you back in power again. - We are getting on with the job. But, if you will pass the tax reform package, our veterans will be better off. They will have higher thresholds which will give a pension to some veterans who are denied access to one today. Many of our  veterans who are unable to access a pension today because of other income will be able to gain access to a pension for the first time because of our higher thresholds. We have Labor on the other side who, when they introduced higher taxes -  - When the coalition gets its tax reform legislation through, the veterans will be better off. It requires support and some leadership from the other side of the House. It is about time that the Leader of the Opposition listened to some of the advice he is getting lately.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to advise the House that in 1999 we have seen the highest average number of questions asked per day since records were kept: indeed, 19.8 questions every question time, and the lowest time for answers since 1982 of 3.6 minutes. So when it gets stretched out and tests the patience of at least members on this side - and, I suspect, quite a few on that side - it is because of the points of order, frivolous and objectionable as they may be.Let us compare this record-breaking performance with 1995, Labor's last year in government, when an average of 12.7 questions were asked - fully seven fewer than now - and the average answers were almost two minutes more than they are now. And  1995 was one of Labor's better years. In 1992, only 10.8 answers were allowed; and in 1993, 10.5, which is almost exactly half of what this government affords the House. I hope that even the most partisan member of the opposition recognises that the system is working better. It must be in the interests of new members to know that Labor in government behaved quite differently from the way it is claimed that the present government has been assessed as behaving.We abolished Labor's roster system. Do all new members realise that, under the management of the Leader of the Opposition as the then Leader of the House, ministers and the Prime Minister of the day attended only two days a week? We abolished that. The Prime Minister of this government attends, unlike his predecessor, every day. But interestingly, the number of questions directed to the Prime Minister has decreased; last year it was 30 per cent of the number of questions, while this year it is only 19 per cent.So those opposite have eased off the Prime Minister, and they have eased off the Treasurer too. They have gone from 11 per cent of questions last year down to nine per cent this year. The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business - unfortunately for the opposition - has attracted 15 per cent of questions this year compared with nine per cent last year. Who will ever forget the 14 questions in a row that he attracted a short while ago? -  - Where was the Leader of the Opposition during the Labor years when accountability for performance of the House was so restricted? We have introduced reforms that give all members - and this would be of particular interest to new members of the opposition - greater speaking times and opportunities on behalf of their constituents. We have reformed the House. Your Leader of the Opposition stood in the way of such reform. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question and for the interest she takes, as do many members of this House, in the issue. Let me begin by saying that the Australian government is well prepared to play its part in helping the United Nations with getting on with the consultation process in East Timor. This is a very important moment in history, and we believe it is appropriate that Australia should do all it can to try to ensure that that process is successful.As members will know, we have already committed $10 million to the UN trust fund. We were the first country to put money into that fund. We have pledged a further $10 million of in kind logistical support to the United Nations, in particular to help them get their advance team on the ground. We have said that we would make an important contri  bution also through the civilian police advisory role. We are looking at the moment at providing in the vicinity of 50 officers from the Australian Federal Police. Two Australian Electoral Commission officials are also being seconded to the United Nations headquarters this week to assist in electoral planning. We have also made considerable diplomatic efforts to help the United Nations to achieve what has been achieved over the last few weeks.As both the Prime Minister and I have said on a number of occasions, though, we have no illusions about how tough the road ahead is going to be. It will be an extremely difficult thing to work through the tensions that exist in East Timor - the rivalries, the jealousies, the history of conflict - to a successful ballot, which we very much hope and expect to take place on 8 August. In a difficult and sensitive time, our judgment as a government has been that it is important to work with and try to persuade Indonesia as a friend and as a neighbour, not to do so uncritically but to try to do so in a way that will be effective.Honourable members will have seen reports today of the activities of the opposition on this issue. I suppose it is tempting on these occasions to make party political attacks on your political opponents when they get themselves into positions of embarrassment and difficulty. But I would make this point: the member for Kingsford-Smith has a reputation amongst those who are interested in foreign affairs in this country for being boorish and unproductive, a man who unquestionably has been about as populist as a politician could be. The fact is that the member for Kingsford-Smith not only has embarrassed his party but has been very unhelpful to Australia at this extremely sensitive and difficult time. But he has been helpful in one respect: he has demonstrated to members on both sides of this House that if you play the political game like that, including with Indonesia, you play yourself out of the game. You have no influence, no efficacy and no capacity to try to get a successful outcome for the people of East Timor.In conclusion, let me say that all members of parliament, be they opposition or govern  ment, have responsibilities. It is important that all members of parliament understand that they have responsibilities to the whole of this nation and there is a line that should be drawn at party politics, and on this issue the opposition has overstepped that line.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith for that question because it enables me to touch upon some of the things dealt with by the foreign minister and also on what is undoubtedly the most important foreign relations challenge this country has had for a number of years. I think that would be a view shared by the two gentlemen who sit in the second back row of the opposition back bench, the new member for Griffith and the member for Holt, the former foreign minister in the Labor government.The reality is that Australia at the present time is endeavouring to bring influence to bear on the Indonesian government in a very difficult situation. Of course I have seen those reports. Like any other member of this parliament, I am disturbed and distressed and concerned about not only the reports of, but the actuality of loss of life and intimidation and bloodshed, whether it occurs in East Timor or whether it occurs anywhere else. I think all of us feel that way.I would be the last person to pretend that Indonesia is practising model democracy in East Timor. I think we all understand that.  But I think we also understand that Australia really has three choices. Firstly, we can do what we are doing now - that is, trying to bring our influence to bear. Secondly, we can embrace the absurd fantasy of pretending that we can embark upon military action. We keep hearing people talking about participating in a peacekeeping role. You cannot participate in a peacekeeping role unless you are invited in because, by definition, it is not a peacekeeping role unless you receive an invitation from the host country. Thirdly, we could throw up our arms in horror, say that the Indonesian government is not a government with which we wish to deal, walk away, sever our military ties, sever our aid ties and give up any capacity to exercise diplomatic influence.We have chosen the first course, and we are doing it conscientiously. We do it against a background of the reality that when the former government was in office it followed policies fairly consistently which, to say the least, were extremely understanding of the Indonesian position and certainly more understanding of the Indonesian position than perhaps was the view that I expressed when I wrote to President Habibie in December of last year. That was the first and most decisive signal from an Australian government that it believed that a fundamental shift of Indonesian policy in relation to East Timor was necessary. Let it be remembered, and I say this very deliberately, Mr Speaker, that it was the action of the coalition government that I lead that did more than anything else to constitute the catalyst for the change in Indonesian policy. That was not done -  -  - I know that the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith finds this difficult, but that was our action. I would remind the member for Kingsford-Smith in his more unctuous moments that I do not recall any ringing speeches for policy changes when he was a member of the Keating government. I do not remember the member for Kingsford-Smith declaring his undying commitment to human rights when he supported Paul Keating as Prime Minister. Of all the relationships that the former government  and the former Prime Minister had with foreign heads of government, none was more understanding, none was more accommodating and none indicated a greater desire to please on all occasions, no matter what the circumstances were, than the relationship between him and the former President of Indonesia.Everyone knows how important the relationship between our two countries is, and it is the responsibility of successive governments. Let me say that I have not joined in some of the criticism of former Labor prime ministers which has been indulged in by some commentators on this issue. I happen to believe that the actions that were taken by Mr Whitlam when he was Prime Minister were understandable and, in the circumstances, struck the right balance at the time so far as our foreign relations were concerned. If you looked through the comments and observations that I made in the various positions I held in opposition, I do not think you would find that I took an opportunistic position regarding the attitude of either the Hawke or Keating governments in relation to their relations with Indonesia because it has always been a difficult, sensitive relationship.Of course Indonesia is a different society from Australia. Of course it is not a democracy. But it is also true that it has made steps towards democracy under Dr Habibie's leadership that we would not have thought imaginable a year ago. Dr Habibie deserves to be given more credit around the world than he has been given for the change he has brought about. He deserves to be given more credit for the commitment that he has made through his foreign minister for the conduct of a ballot that will provide an opportunity for the people of East Timor to exercise a free choice. I notice the member for Holt nodding in assent to what I have said.I do not pretend for a moment that the situation in East Timor is anything other than very fragile indeed. It is easy for an opposition spokesman to ask the sort of question that the member for Kingsford-Smith asked. I have no doubt that he will go on behaving in that sort of manner from now until 8 August. Let me say that I believe the pros  pects for an orderly, peaceful and relatively democratic outcome are greater now than they have been for a long time. That does not mean that, in the words of the foreign minister, it will be anything other than a near miracle if all of the eventualities that we want to unfold do in fact unfold.I believe that the Australian government has used the influence that this country has with Indonesia - built up, might I say, under governments of different political persuasions - since Indonesia secured her independence in the mid-1940s. We are using that influence intelligently and sensibly. We are playing the card that is best likely to get the best outcome in East Timor. It is not a time for cheap opportunism by foreign affairs spokesmen for the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question. This government has given a very high priority to providing opportunities to the 70 per cent of school leavers who do not go straight from school to university. We have also taken effective action to address the skills shortages that this country faces in many areas. One of the major responses of this government has been to build up the apprenticeship system. I am pleased to announce to the House that New Apprenticeships are at record levels. The latest statistics for December last year show that there were some 206,400 Australians in New Apprenticeships, which is 70,000 more than were in New Apprenticeships in the Labor Party's last year of office - 70,000 additional opportunities for Australians in the apprenticeship system under this government.There have been comments from the other side, the typical misleading kinds of comments that you get from them, that these are not high skill apprenticeships. Nothing could be further from the truth - 70 per cent of all  those in the New Apprenticeship system are training at the higher skill levels. Indeed, 80 per cent of the younger people are training at the higher skill levels. It is very pleasing to see that, after the devastation of the traditional apprenticeship areas wrought by the Labor Party's economic mismanagement, apprenticeships in the traditional areas are now beginning to rise again and indeed are several per cent higher than they were in 1995, the Labor Party's last year in office.Over the last week, during the Senate estimates process, we have seen the most extraordinary campaign of distortion about the apprenticeship system from Senator Carr. Senator Carr, true to form, has been making charges again and again of fraud within the apprenticeship system. In February, Senator Carr raised six cases which he said were cases of fraud. All of these cases have been investigated and not one of them substantiated a case of fraud against the Commonwealth. We have now seen a whole range of new accusations from Senator Carr.Let me say this: if any valid accusation is raised, this government will address it. But what we have got is simply a campaign of distortion, untruths, coming from the Labor Party. This foreshadows what we will see over the next week in response to the budget. We will see continuing distortion, continuing misrepresentation, because if there is one thing the Labor Party cannot face up to it is the fact that it is this government which has revived apprenticeship and training opportunities for young Australians and which is genuinely committed to improving education and training standards in this country.</DOC>

 - I would have thought the last report that the Leader of the Opposition would quote against me at the moment would be the recent economic assessment by the Reserve Bank of Australia, because that economic assessment produced some of the most robust headlines that I have seen about the performance of the Australian economy for a long time. That report made it very plain that the Australian economy is now performing better than it has for any period in the last 30 years. It made it plain that we are enjoying unprecedented low levels of interest, that we are enjoying unprecedented low levels of inflation, that business investment is strong, and that we have stared down the Asian economic downturn in a way that not even the most optimistic in the Australian community would have thought likely barely 12 months ago.The other point that the report makes is that this has been the result of reforms taken on earlier occasions. Those reforms, and all of the other reforms that the government has undertaken, have helped to bring the budget back into surplus from the deficit of $10½ billion that we inherited three years ago. The message out of that is that if today's strength is the result of yesterday's reform, then tomorrow's strength will be the result of today's reform. That is why tax reform is absolutely essential to the future strength of the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to report to the member for Corangamite and also to the  House that the RFA, which was signed by me and Western Australian Premier, Mr Court, last week, did produce a very fair and balanced outcome in Western Australia. It provides for 151,000 hectares of new reserves. It provides a $59 million industry package for timber and tourism. The WA timber industry has the basis to create 500 new processing jobs. The RFA and industry package underpins this. Under this government, four regional forest agreements have now been signed - two in Victoria, one in Tasmania and one in Western Australia. All of them have exhibited a balance between the desire of this government to respond to proper mainstream environmental concerns but equally to protect jobs. -  - I hear the Leader of the Opposition interjecting about attitudes in Western Australia. I have got a few documents in front of me. I have got one that is headed `CFMEU slams Beazley'. The CFMEU - I do not know that there are too many of them in the Colac branch of the Liberal Party. `CFMEU slams Beazley'. It is really not bad. This is what it says:The Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley has been bitterly attacked by the CFMEU's Forestry Division over his support for the new Western Australian ALP Forest Policy. On the weekend the Western Australian ALP State Conference passed a motion supporting the prohibition of logging in old growth forests . . . This is what Mr Michael O'Connor, the National Assistant Secretary of the CFMEU, had to say:'Beazley's comments were a betrayal of tens of thousands of workers throughout Australia employed in the Forest and Forest products Industry.'I could not have put it better myself. Of course, it gets even better when you find a statement issued by the Western Australian branch of the Australian Workers Union. You are getting even closer to the heartlands of what the Labor Party used to believe in. This is what Mr Daly had to say:'On behalf of two thousand timber workers and their families, I take a great deal of comfort from the position adopted by the Federal Government,' . . .  This is not the Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce in Western Australia; this is not the secretary of some branch of the Liberal Party in a blue-ribbon electorate in Perth; this is a statement by Mr Tim Daly, who is the Secretary of the Western Australian branch of the Australian Workers Union. But not content with saying that he likes us, he goes on, and he has this to say:'As much as I can take comfort from the Government's position I am disappointed with the attitude of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party.And he gets to the nub of the issue:The Labor Party purports to represent the interest of blue collar workers but it is prepared to support a disallowance motion in the Senate in relation to RFA's which will perpetuate the uncertainty that the legislation was intended to end.But, to bring us really up to date, I am advised from a very, very reliable source that there was a meeting in Colac last night, I think in or near the electorate of the member for Corangamite. It was a meeting of timber workers and their families, members of the community and contractors. At that meeting a resolution was carried condemning the statement by Mr Beazley which supports the ill-conceived Western Australian ALP forest policy. That meeting unanimously called on Mr Beazley to retract his statement and reconfirm his support for the National Forest Policy Statement for `our jobs, our community and our industry'. They are the words of ordinary Australians and their families who feel bitterly disillusioned by the narrow sectional attitude taken by the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party has abandoned timber workers and their families. The Australian Labor Party is now bound hand and foot, through the actions of Dr Gallop and the actions of the Leader of the Opposition, to the extremist attitudes of the green movement in Western Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for his very timely question. Later today, as all members know, the Treasurer will deliver yet another budget based on sound economic policy and responsible management. Tonight's budget will be responsible not only in substance but also in form. The 1999 budget will be the first that has been presented in an accrual framework. That is the framework that measures income and expenses when they are accrued not just when the money comes in or goes out.The accrual framework is universally accepted as a superior financial and management practice. Even Labor accepts its benefit. They were always going to do it. In 1992 the then finance minister, the former member for Gellibrand, indicated that Labor would be adopting an accrual accounting process. He described it as a more realistic picture and said it would be in place by June 1995. Of course, we know nothing happened. Three years later the then finance minister and now Leader of the Opposition again sang the praises of accrual accounting and said that Labor would introduce it.Shortly after the coalition came to government in 1996, we announced that we would introduce the accrual framework - and now we have made it happen. So what are the benefits? An accrual system will provide Australians with the true cost of government for the very first time. It will show what the government produces, what it costs and how efficiently it is done. It will provide better accountability by showing that you are able to measure what has been achieved against agreed objectives. It will lead to better decisions. Those decisions will flow from the transparency of resource usage. It will provide better information to agencies and to ministers. They will know the full cost of the goods and services that they provide and they can compare that full cost and that true cost with alternative suppliers. It will lead to better results because agencies will be required to provide the full picture, as Ralph Willis said, of both planned financial performance and planned deliverables. In tonight's budget, the portfolio budget papers will provide figures for 1998 and 1999 in both languages - that is,  in both cash and accrual. That will enable a comparison of budget forecasts and the actual results. There will also be a reconciliation table in Budget Paper No. 1.The government is proud of this landmark change. Just as our charter of budget honesty was world's leading edge reform, budgets that are presented and framed on an accrual basis catapult Australia to world's best reporting of fiscal policy. - I was referring to some hand-written notes, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - I am happy to inform the honourable member that at no time was I informed by my department of the erosion of compensation for pensioners, so I guess that means that the question amounts to absolutely nothing - like most others that are asked by the opposition on the tax package. I can say unequivocally that the government's very fair and equitable tax package compensates pensioners with a four per cent one-off, day one provision to pensioners -  - One-off up front - and then keeps it at 1½ per cent in real terms above any inflationary factor. That comes off the base that this government had the guts to introduce - that is, a proper formula for pensioners to link pensions to 25 per cent of  MTAWE, male total average weekly earnings. This is the government that operates on a fair and equitable basis for pensioners and for all others in the tax system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I have announced a comprehensive review into Australia's system of blood supply. Australia has one of the safest and most widely respected systems of blood supply in the world, but there are a number of emerging issues that make it timely for us to review our systems of blood donation.	 There is a threat of emerging infectious agents. There are product shortages. There are changes to testing procedures and determinations of donors.The most awkward is the threat of emerging infectious agents. There is now a new variant of CJD or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This is an incurable neurological disorder, and of the 39 cases that have now been reported in the UK a quarter were reported in the December quarter of 1998. This is believed to have been contracted from BSE in cows. BSE is not a problem in Australia and Australia is self-sufficient in blood, so we do not have to be concerned about this new variant ourselves, but it is a particular concern to other countries. There is also evidence of a new type of hepatitis, now called hepatitis G, that appears able to be transmitted by blood. Countries overseas are looking at their recall procedures and so it is timely for Australia to review this in a calm and independent manner.There are a number of very well-documented cases overseas as to what happens when this goes wrong. Germany had manufacturing failures which led to the transmission of hepatitis A; Ireland had a number of women of child-bearing age contract hepatitis C through problems with donor selection and manufacturing problems; and Canada had a  number of cases of HIV because they delayed introduction of testing into their blood supply.Product shortages are another chronic problem in the blood supply system in Australia. One particular uncommon illness is Guillain Barre syndrome and intravenous immunoglobulin has been used to treat this. I am very keen to ensure that Australia maintains its self-sufficiency, whilst at the same time we have to look at how our monopoly supplier, CSL, can meet Australia's own needs as well as increase its international profile, and how we can look to the longer term to see that those product shortages do not take place.On the issue of testing procedures, there are new procedures for hepatitis C such as nucleic acid amplification or, for the variant of CJD, a more controversial procedure called leucodepletion where you take the white blood cells out of the blood. These procedures involve very greatly increased cost for marginally increased safety and are decisions that should be made independently by technical experts. Because Australia has a federation, and blood supply is something that is dominated by states and territories, I am also concerned that these testing procedures might be introduced uniformly.Finally, with exclusion of donors, given that Canada has announced that it is considering whether or not to exclude people who have spent periods of time in the UK since 1980 - although it has not made a decision on that - it is also timely that Australia should look at this.The response of the opposition to the announcement of this review was predictable but disappointing. The opposition spokesperson on health made three claims, every one of which is untrue. The first claim is that somehow funding for the Australian Red Cross was at risk. This is entirely without foundation and false. Secondly, she said that this will do nothing for people with Guillain Barre syndrome, who are having to wait many months because of the shortages. In fact, it is completely independent of this. The Australian health ministers advisory committee has just completed a working party report on this and states and territories will be working to  implement that with, hopefully, an increase in plasma supplies in the very near future. Finally, she raised the spectre of this having something to do with competition policy and charging for blood. It remains the Commonwealth's firm position that blood should be free to the patient.The review is being chaired by Sir Ninian Stephen. It has on it Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, Professor Bob Beale, who is the international president of the Society for Blood Transfusion, and Professor Judith Whitworth, the Commonwealth's Chief Medical Officer. I believe this review will set us up for the future so that we can maintain our respected position internationally in blood supply.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question because it gives me an opportunity to raise a number of issues in relation to bank fees. The first point is that the $10 billion figure cited in the KPMG report is made up of a number of factors, and they include Treasury activities of the individual banks. The second point is that 25 per cent of the $10 billion is fees and charges from offshore - Australian exports, which is good news for Australia. The third point is in relation to the alleged figure of $10 billion. That represents just three per cent of the total income of financial institutions. What I should point out is that the Labor Party -  -  - When it comes to Australian financial institutions and Australian banks in particular, the Labor Party has form. It is in the best interests of the people of Australia that the Labor Party stays well away from banks. We know only too well the history of banking and the Labor Party in South Australia where $18 billion was lost. We know the history of the Labor Party and banking in Victoria where $12 billion was lost. We can only speculate on the relationship between the Labor Party and other financial institutions. Our response is the front page of the Asian Wall Street Journal : `Australia evades contagion amid solid banking system'. That is a response. Or the response on the front page of the Wall Street Journal : `Sitting pretty: strong banking system helps Australia prosper as neighbours struggle'.When it comes to hypocrisy, the Labor Party is the very best. I want to remind Labor Party members that, when it comes to bank fees and charges, they are absolute hypocrites. On 11 July 1995, the Treasurer at the time, Ralph Willis, announced:. . . I will direct the new Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to formally monitor and regularly report on the financial services industry in relation to retail transaction accounts for a period of three years.That was the Labor Party on 11 July 1995. Five days before the 1996 election, Ralph Willis again stated:A Labor Government will write to the Chairperson of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission . . . requesting the Commission to formally monitor fees and charges on bank retail transaction accounts.Ask me the question again.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for New England for his question. These matters are being pursued on a variety of fronts, including the working visit I will make next week and beyond to several countries to  pursue the matter of wool and our exports of wool to China - a half billion dollar market - to try to put in place a prototype contract to further facilitate that and to go into negotiations in respect of China's entry to the World Trade Organisation, something which the government supports but not at any price. We seek to bridge the gap to come to a positive conclusion hopefully in relation to those WTO accession negotiations as far as Australia is concerned.Also, a major focus in the US will be prime lamb. We will be doing battle in conjunction with the Australian prime lamb industry - which has established a $100 million export market in that direction - to see that the US, which preaches free trade to the world, and we all agree with that direction, does not bring in a major restraint on trade in an unfair way in relation to prime lamb exports to a new market established by our producers. - The fourth subject I was about to turn to - which is very important for Wollongong, I accept - is the matter of steel and the triangular situation involving Japan and the US, the fallout between those two countries and the impact that could have on Australian steel producers. Minister Nick Minchin and I met recently with BHP and others in respect of that issue, and I will be pursuing that as part of the visit.Of course, Australia will be doing more than that, including bilateral visits associated with this next round of activity in France, Switzerland, Belgium, Hungary, Russia, Korea, China and the USA over 16 days. We will be pursuing, on the multilateral, regional and bilateral levels at every opportunity, improved market access which will generate more jobs here in Australia. I notice there are a couple of non-lockupers in the press gallery today. I pay tribute to one of them: welcome back, Fred, from Europe. You have raised the standard of coverage of trade in the Bulletin. -  - No, he has not. It is good to see more focus on trade issues in a sensible way in the media. I conclude by saying to the House that the very best thing  we will do next is in the budget tonight, which will help our exporters provide solid sparkle to country Australia and indeed to all Australians as we build for the next millennium with a budget in surplus. Well done to the Treasurer.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am delighted to be able to inform the House that the number of doctors in rural Australia has been going up. In fact in 1997 and 1998, the number of doctors accessing Medicare provider numbers in rural Australia was up nearly seven per cent, reversing a 30-year historical trend. The reason for this is very simple: it relates to the provider number legislation that was passed through this parliament in 1996 against the staunch opposition of the Labor Party. Nonetheless, this is now providing very  substantially increased locum services to country doctors and an increased number of full-time doctors in country Australia.We had 450 medical students last Christmas in rural Australia on John Flynn scholarships. This Christmas we will have 600 medical students experiencing rural practice as part of their medical training. We are very optimistic that over time this will lead to a greater number of doctors in rural Australia, as one of the factors that is very important in getting doctors into the country after graduation is positive experiences of country practice during their training.I am also pleased to inform the House that recently I travelled through rural New South Wales with the Deputy Leader of the National Party. As a result of that trip, I made yet another offer to the states to work jointly with them, because the Commonwealth does not have all the levers here. The states are the people who register the doctors; the Commonwealth does not. Western Australia took us up on that offer, and we had something of a breakthrough in that Western Australia has decided to have geographical registration of doctors. For new overseas doctors coming into Australia, their registration will be conditional on them working in a geographic area. So rather than point fingers at the Commonwealth - as the states have done - and say that it is our problem, Western Australia for the first time has been prepared to say that it is both of our problems and work with us.What this means is that doctors from the UK, Ireland, South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore, Canada and New Zealand who have passed their specialist general practice postgraduate qualifications can now come and work in Australia without passing the Australian Medical Council examination. This will mean that many more doctors who may have been worried about the hurdles to practise in Australia will be eligible to come to this country. Other states have shown a good deal of interest, and I am optimistic that in fact all states and territories will follow the Western Australian lead.Again, in spite of this breakthrough, it is enormously disappointing but nonetheless predictable that we get the usual carping,  negative, opportunistic response from the Labor Party. The Labor Party's acting shadow minister at the time, Senator Chris Evans, said that this was a quick fix. You bet it is a quick fix, because we have a crisis at the moment. The only thing he could suggest was bonded scholarships, which would maybe help in the year 2010. I can tell you that we have no intention of waiting until 2010 to improve the lot of doctors in rural Australia. We are doing it straightaway.Senator Evans also went on and said that this discriminates against the large number of overseas trained doctors who are already permanent residents in Australia. That is absolute rubbish and shows his lack of understanding of this difficult and complex issue. The very simple point is that doctors from overseas who are already in Australia and who have postgraduate qualifications from those countries will be eligible in just the same way as a doctor from overseas will be. This is groundbreaking stuff. I expect it will contribute to the increase that has already happened in the last two years - a significant achievement that has not been able to be achieved for generations.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge that, with his background in transport, he has a real interest in this. The Black Spot Program is a very valuable one, albeit one that the Labor Party chose to axe. We reintroduced it in 1996, and we announced during the last election that we would not only continue it but also substantially increase funding for it. That reflects our understanding of the fact that there is a great deal that we can do to help in the area of road safety in this country. - As I was saying, the coalition recognises the impact that the Black Spot Program can have not only in mere economic terms but, much more importantly, in saving lives. I am sure that is something that we would all be prepared to support, and it leaves hanging in the air the mystery of why the ALP was prepared to scrap such a valuable program. Under us it is now in our fourth year of funding and, by 2002, more than $225 million will have been allocated to eliminate dangerous spots around Australia - importantly, in both rural and urban areas.Earlier today some announcements were made in relation to New South Wales and some $12 million worth of black spots programs by Senator Sandy Macdonald, who is the Chairman of the New South Wales Black Spots Community Consultative Panel. In the member for Cook's own electorate, a total of $320,000 is being spent to address three black spots in the Sutherland shire. In the Prime Minister's electorate of Bennelong, there are five projects needing attention - over $700,000 worth of programs. In the Deputy Prime Minister's electorate, there are $¼ million worth of programs to develop an approach to correct a particular problem in Lamington. Lest the opposition claim that this program is not being fairly allocated, I point out that considerable resources are being  devoted to, or deployed in, areas such as Wollongong, Wyong, Blacktown and Marrickville, to name just a few.It is quite obvious that, although they were prepared to scrap the program, we are prepared to recognise that saving lives is something we ought to do wherever we can, regardless of political representation. We support this valuable program, and I believe that it would be a very useful thing indeed if the opposition were to acknowledge that this is something of great value that they ought to support.</DOC>

 - I noted with interest the honourable member's question. As all honourable members would know, the government has indicated its intentions to sell Australian Defence Industries. That is a very diverse group. It has a number of operations - in fact, I think it has about 19 sites around the country, including the ones that the honourable member referred to.The government, in all of its assets sales, is very conscious of a number of elements that must be kept in place in the interests of Australia. In industry, that component is extremely important, and in all bids that come in - and I anticipate that we will have bids in in respect of the sale by 30 June - we will have great regard to the fact that there is a need to maintain the industry that is associated with Australian Defence Industries and that  is very much centred on defence industries. We will have great regard also for the employees that are part of Australian Defence Industries at this point in time. In the course of proceeding down the road of getting out of businesses that there is no market value in, government will have regard for the employees in all parts of the operations of the particular asset, including the numerous assets, sites and operations of Australian Defence Industries, including those sites which the honourable member referred to.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and her interest in matters related to defence. She has a very important defence facility in her own electorate and chairs the Liberal and National parties' backbench committee. In keeping with the Liberal and National parties' commitment to listen to the ex-service community and consult with them on what they see as anomalies, I announced last week that we had ordered an independent review of the appropriateness of the repatriation benefits and medals for the Australian Defence Force in South-East Asia between 1955 and 1975. The review will result in a written report that will cover the areas specifically related to the Royal Australian Air Force at Ubon, the Royal Australian Air Force at Butterworth in Malaya, the service in Malaya during the period of the confrontation with Indonesia and also service with the naval component of the Far East Strategic Reserve.The issue of recognition of the naval component of the Far East Strategic Reserve has generated a significant amount of interest. Members on both sides of the House have been lobbied and petitioned by members of the Far East Strategic Reserve. I advise the House that I expect the report to be completed by the end of October. I maintain our com  mitment to continue to listen to the ex-service community and also to review potential anomalies if they are raised with us. We have put mechanisms in place. In our first term in government we did look at several perceived anomalies. We were able to extend repatriation benefits to many of those areas which were previously not recognised, including medals, and this is a further review which will be done by an independent inquirer. I expect that review by the end of October.</DOC>

 - I am overwhelmed by the attack. The budget forecasts growth in 1999-2000 of around three per cent. Three per cent growth in 1999-2000, while down somewhat on this year, will be stronger than Europe, the United States, the OECD and G7. Consumption will be strong in the forthcoming year, and that is principally because of low interest rates. For the average Australian with the average mortgage, since this government was elected, interest rates have fallen by four per cent. That is a saving of about $320 a month, and I am sure that in the early days many people took the opportunity to reduce the term of their mortgages. But, now there is a bit more money around, obviously retail spending is strong, and that is keeping the Australian economy strong at a time of slow world growth. I think all members of the House would be pleased about that. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. The government is forecasting in 1999-2000 a budget surplus of the order of $5.4 billion. The $5.4 billion surplus will be used to repay Australian Commonwealth debt. In the last five Labor Party budgets, Commonwealth debt grew by $80 billion. We would have to run budget surpluses or asset sales of $80 billion to get back to where we were before the last five Labor budgets. The budget deficit in the year before this government was elected was $10.3 billion, and the then Minister for Finance is the now Leader of the Opposition.During the course of the 1996 election, the then finance minister, now Leader of the Opposition, claimed that the budget was in surplus; the outcome was a deficit of $10,300 million. In two budgets whilst he was finance minister, the now Leader of the Opposition produced a budget deficit of $10.3 billion and a budget deficit of $13.1 billion. In two years he cumulated budget deficits of $23 billion. In those two years when he served as finance minister, the Leader of the Opposition accumulated 25 per cent of Commonwealth debt - in two years.The government set itself the task of bringing the budget back into balance, of producing a surplus whilst there was economic growth and of paying down Labor's debt. It is important that we do pay down Labor's debt and run a surplus budget at a time when Australia has a current account deficit of 5½ per cent or 5¼ per cent. It is important that we make sure that we run a strong budget policy to protect confidence in the Australian economy. The government will not be running down savings in the next year. We will be repaying debt, we will be building savings - and that is a strong insurance for the current account deficit.</DOC>

 - The budget has forecast that in the next financial year, 1999-2000, we will consolidate the strong employment gains that have been made in the last year. In the last year in Australia, 180,000 new jobs were created -  - 180,000 new jobs were created - in the midst of an Asian recession. One of the things in Australia that you could always count on in the 1980s and 1990s was a booming Asia. What that meant was that, whatever we did to muck up our own economy - and we did a lot in the eighties and nineties - we were getting growth out of Asia for the Australian economy. That changed in the last two years. Asia went into recession. We had to do it ourselves - and we had to do it notwithstanding an Asian recession. We grew, we created jobs and we are going to consolidate those jobs. To make big new inroads into unemployment, what Australia needs is a program of substantive structural reform: a new tax system, new industrial relations and a reforming government. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. The government is forecasting in 1998-99 - that is, the current financial year - growth of around 4¼ per cent. This will be one of the fastest growth rates in the developed world and certainly one of the fastest growth rates in the region. The government is forecasting that growth will slow somewhat in 1999-2000 to about three per cent. Three per cent growth will be stronger than Europe, North America, the G7 and the OECD. These strong growth rates have occurred at a time when Asia was in recession.When our government was elected, when the budget was $10.3 billion in deficit, when interest rates were four per cent higher than they are now, we said that we needed to strengthen the Australian economy and, if we strengthened the Australian economy, we would be able to withstand pressures from outside. It was that policy, that reform process, that was put in place three years ago which gave confidence and stability to the Australian economy now, just as it is the reforms that are put in place now that will enable us to meet the challenges of the future.When this government was turning the $10.3 billion Beazley deficit into a surplus, we were opposed every step of the way by Labor. Labor opposed every step of the way this government's policy of putting the budget back into surplus. -  - Labor opposed every step of the way our measures to put the budget back into surplus. On Monday of this week, I was listening to AM  and I nearly choked on my Weeties, because the Leader of the Opposition was asked what would he do in the budget on Tuesday night. He said, `Well, I would have a bigger surplus than the government.' Then the reporter said, `Well, what will their surplus be?' And he said, `I don't know, but mine would be bigger.' This was the Leader of the Opposition who fought every measure to bring the budget back into surplus. And all along he was actually in favour of surplus budgets. He was just fooling us. Now he does the same thing in relation to  tax reform. He says he is so opposed to tax reform that, if he ever gets elected, he is going to keep it. He is going to fight us every single step of the way on tax reform and try to sneak into government and take the advantage of it.Why did the government put the budget back into surplus? To protect the economy. Why did Labor oppose it? Because Labor said if we put the budget back into surplus it would lead to an economic downturn. - Oh, you didn't. The shadow Treasurer, the member for Hotham, on cue. On 21 July 1998 he said:After three Costello budgets we have slower growth, and now we face the Asian economic crisis. It's not what I'd call a fireproofed economy . . . The Treasurer has fireproofed the economic car by taking out the petrol.And listen to what he said in July 1998:We do risk an economic crisis of major proportions, and the Asian impact will not be, as the Treasurer once stated, hardly measurable.The economy was then growing at 4¾ per cent.

 - The government has made entirely clear what the impact of its tax changes were. We said that it would have a 1.9 per cent effect on the CPI. As I recall, on the day before the election the Labor Party ran advertisements saying that secret Treasury documents would show that the effect was five times as great - on the day before the  election. So we were expecting the Labor Party to produce some Treasury document which had a CPI impact five times 1.9 -  - Oh, good, this will give me time to work it out. - Five times 1.9 is 9.5 per cent, and I thank the honourable member for Flinders for telling me. I know that the frontbench shadow spokesman on transport believes in truth in advertising and used to, in another guise, rail against political parties that would not practise it. The Labor Party having advertised, we would have expected a document to appear backing up the advertising, showing a 9.5 per cent CPI effect. Yet the two modellers that were commissioned by the Democrats and the Labor Party - Harding and Warren - went right through the package, and I think they said that the inflation effect would be two per cent. We said it would be 1.9 per cent. The Labor Party claimed on the eve of the election that it would be 9.5 per cent. Mr Speaker, WTG!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Lifetime health cover is an important structural reform that will bring stability to the private health sector and also give some stability to the public health sector. It is part of a comprehensive series of reforms that include the 30 per cent rebate on private health cover, changes to reinsurance arrangements and changes to prudential arrangements that we have been undertaking over a period of two years.Very simply, it rewards young people with lower premiums for getting in early. It rewards all members of health funds, because premiums will be lower in the future than they would be had we done nothing by an estimated eight to 10 per cent. It will take some pressure off public hospitals by providing stability to both sectors. And it is fair and equitable in that it does not change the basic fundamentals on which community rating has always existed; that is, you cannot discriminate on the basis of age, health status and claims history. The only discrimination, in effect, is for those people who delay until later in life taking out private health insurance. We propose to start it on 1 July in the year 2000, 13 months away. That will give us plenty of time to explain the changes and will give a one-year period of grace so that all Australians will have the chance to come into private health insurance under the present arrangements. Also, anyone over 65 years of age or who was born before 1 July 1934 will effectively be grandfathered for life, and at any point in the future they can join a health fund as if they were 30 years of age.I understand the Leader of the Opposition is concerned about what might happen to people who leave for a period of time or lose their job. This was considered, and health funds will be able to give a period of grace for two years for any person who may leave a fund to travel overseas, study or who may lose their job. Of course, funds may have discretion beyond that on an individual basis. This is an important reform, one that is long overdue. I commend it to the House.</DOC>

If you want to know what the surplus in 2000-01 is, I suggest you come down here in May 2000 and listen to the next budget. The member made a point earlier, asking rhetorically, `If your GST is so good, why won't it create new jobs in the next year?' The GST will not be introduced in the next year. It will be introduced in 2000-01. The period 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 is this budget year. We are forecasting a surplus of $5.4 billion.

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I think the single most memorable thing that will come out of last night's budget is the fact of our commitment to medical research. I suspect that long in the future when people look back at this part of history the 19th century will be remembered as a century of industry, the 20th century will be remembered as a century of technology and communications and the 21st century will be a century of healing.What we can do now with the understanding of the human genome was unimaginable when I was in medical school 20 years ago. The discoveries over the next decade or two many people believe will cause biotechnology to be as significant to the world economy as information technology is today. There are only eight countries in the world that have any capacity to be a part of this - in North America and Western Europe; and Australia. We are on the cusp of a great future wealth for this country through biotechnology. But, unless we react quickly, we lose our capacity to be part of what is the world's next great industry.When we came to government in 1996, the NHMRC's base funding was $110 million. Far from cutting it, we have actually tripled it over the period 1996 to 2004. The NHMRC's base funding will go from $110 million to $330 million in constant dollar terms - a tripling that is completely unprecedented in any other country anywhere in the world. The Leader of the Opposition talks about smoke and mirrors. The real smoke and mirrors were in the absolute dishonesty in Labor's budgets in their last term of government, when they pretended to be increasing the NHMRC's funding but actually made it short-term hot money that did not extend beyond the forward estimates. In 1997 and 1998, so that we could continue to keep funding medical research, I had to take money out of radiology and pathology to prop up the holes you had left by pretending that you had actually increased funding whereas you had put short-term hot money in to try and con the medical research community. They will not be conned. They know this is a genuine change. They know it is historic and it is one that will determine Australia's economic future.</DOC>

 - There is no compensation mechanism that self-destructs. There is a compensation mechanism which, as I asserted during the election campaign - and nothing that was contained in the Senate hearings altered this fact - that the pension would always be guaranteed 1½ per cent in real terms above increases in the cost of living. It is no blinding revelation out of the Senate hearings that this government was the first government in the history of Australia to legislate that pensions would always be 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. That was an additional measure that the Labor Party had 13 years to introduce but they never introduced it. We were the first government to legislate it -  - Four questions and they are off the budget. No wonder you are off the budget. You are the bloke who kept saying you believed in surpluses. In May of this year there should be a budget -  -  - The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about the GST - about the tax reform package. He asked me about compensation. I repeat that what we said during the election campaign was that the compensation for pensioners would always be in real terms 1½ per cent above the CPI. That was the commitment I took to the Australian people, that was the basis on which the government was elected and that has been the underpinning of the taxation package so far as compensation is concerned.It is also an undeniable fact that we were the first government in the history of Australia to provide a legislative guarantee that the pension in this country would be a certain percentage of male average weekly earnings. There has never been any secret about that. There has never been any denial of the fact that you have not only the guarantee of compensation but also, running parallel to that, the guarantee that the pension would always be 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings. We have honoured our promises in full.I take the opportunity, in the context of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition because it relates to commitments I made in the last election campaign, to say that one of the proudest features of last night's budget was that every single promise I made on behalf of the coalition is being implemented in full in this budget. That document entitled Keeping our promises for a stronger Australia sets an absolute Australian record for speed, totality and faithfulness. A party that went to the Australian electorate with a courageous and comprehensive program not only has had the courage and the capacity to win on that program but has the integrity to honour it in full.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, knowing her very real interest in these matters - an interest shared by a lot of people on this side of the House. The government's regional Australia strategy is about understanding and addressing the needs of regional Australians. The budget reflects a coordinated, across-government approach to providing rural and regional Australia with, on the one hand, the services they need to keep their communities intact and, on the other hand, the tools they need to maximise the performance of existing industries and to enhance to the greatest degree possible their chances of attracting new economic opportunities and therefore new job opportunities.There is really quite an endless list of the initiatives that have been put together across the government. They are, in my view, well summarised in the statement Regional Australia: Meeting the Challenges. I commend it to the House, and I know that people will find it of very great interest. I could not hope to list everything that is in it, but particularly in the area of rural health, which is acknowledged right across rural Australia as an area of enormous concern, I would like to pay tribute to my good friend and colleague the Minister for Health and Aged Care, who has worked very, very hard in this area.There are some initiatives here which are going to make a tremendous difference, whether it is the 30 new regional health service centres for small centres, which worked very, very well indeed; whether it is the very substantial amount of money for the retention of the best doctors and the easiest doctors you will ever get to attract to rural Australia, the ones who are already there; or whether it is the $8 million or $9 million for enabling female doctors to fly in or fly out. And there is a small one, indicating that it is often not about sheer money but about good policy: $4 million for a system of scholarships to get country kids through our medical schools, because we know that they are the kids who will go back to the bush. You had  all of those years to do something about this. Every year there were fewer and fewer bush kids in our universities studying medicine -  -  - and here there is an enormous opportunity -  -  - without involving a huge amount of money, to simply put in place sound strategies for the future that can make a very real difference. I can go on and on in the area of health. But there is a whole range of other areas. Face-to-face services: we have committed an initial $9 million to get Rural Transaction Centres off the ground. That has been very well received. Rural apprenticeships: $51 million to meet our commitment of 30,000 new places. There is $40 million for regional assistance programs, the area consultative committees, real assistance in the area of isolated children's education, call centres in Maryborough and Port Augusta - both areas facing very real economic and social difficulties at the moment - and Work for the Dole.Interestingly, I reckon that before we won government in 1996 if you moved around rural Australia there were three things that always came to the fore when people asked us to act when we got into government. One was to get interest rates down; the second was to end this overvalued dollar; and the third was that people really will be better off if they do something when we support them when they have not got a job. We have delivered on all three in spades. They are the things that rural and regional Australia said that they wanted as their great priority.I could go on. What we are doing in the area of roads has brought absolute delight to people all over this House, representing many parts of Australia. This is a coordinated, well thought through process of meeting the needs of rural and regional Australia, and it is no wonder that it has been widely welcomed.</DOC>

We found that, fortunately, it did not cost quite as much as we anticipated. We have fully delivered on the commitment for 30,000 places.</DOC>

It delivers on all our commitments in the election campaign to lift standards of literacy and numeracy, to build opportunities for the 70 per cent of young people who leave school and do not go direct from school to university and to address the skill shortages, and it promotes outstanding research on which the jobs of the future will be based.One of the historic decisions of this budget was to put fairness back into funding for non-government schools. Governments provide some $5,000 a year for every government school student. At present the neediest students in non-government schools receive only 56 per cent of this sum. This budget lifts that to 70 per cent. This is a budget that will extend choice to low income families in Australia in a way that no previous measure has done and that gives some educational equity to these families. The government is committed to the right of all families to choose the appropriate school for their child.Government school students are also very big winners in this budget. It is worth noting that the Commonwealth provides only 15 per cent of the funding for government schools. The principal responsibility for funding government schools falls on the states. Of course, the Commonwealth has significantly lifted moneys to the states which are available for education, and the GST will give the states enhanced revenue from government schools. But, even given this, in this budget the government has provided $131 million to raise literacy and numeracy standards, $78 million for teacher professional development, $90 million for Asian languages and, it is worth noting, $238 million above last year's forward estimates for disadvantaged indigenous students. The vast bulk of this money will flow to government schools.In the last 24 hours, we have heard what can only be described as a statistical babble coming from the Australian Education Union and its lap-dog over there on the front bench of the Labor Party - the member for Dobell. We have heard again and again over the last  24 hours from the media this notion that somehow or another, government schools benefit by $10 per pupil. We decided to ring the Australian Education Union and ask them how they calculated that figure. We discovered that they had left out all the commitments to which I have just referred - none of those are relevant to the calculation of this figure. On the same principle, they might have left out our non-government funding, but they included that so they could provide a totally distorted picture of the impact of this government on school funding. -  - The psycho-babbler - the statistical babbler - is rising to his feet now, because they do not like the truth. His only adviser is the Australian Education Union.Let us put the facts on the table. Next year, the year 2000, government schools in this country will be receiving 25 per cent more funding from the Commonwealth government than they received from the Labor Party in its last year of office - $382 million more than the Labor Party provided. Over the next four-year funding period for schools, government schools will receive almost $1 billion more than they are receiving in the current quadrennium of funding. So let it not be said that this government is not committed to quality education for every child. It is, and that quality doesn't just come from money. That quality comes from programs such as the literacy and numeracy programs which establish standards that every child will be assisted to reach. The literacy programs of this government are the greatest equity programs that we have seen in this country for three decades. They are lifting standards of education for every child. This government is committed to a quality education for every young Australian. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise the work that he has done as part of the government in developing this budget. The first and most important element of this budget that absolutely delivers in spades for the rural sector is the continued sound economic management of our government. The $5.4 billion surplus underpins our strategy of a low interest rate regime in Australia, a regime that has delivered, in the life of this government so far, $580 million worth of savings to the farm sector every year in low interest rates. That is the most important thing that this budget delivers, and we aim to keep it there.As the Prime Minister has already indicated this afternoon, we have delivered on all our election commitments from last year, as far as this budget is concerned. We have delivered on all of them. One of the most important commitments we have made is to work in partnership with rural industries in Australia to develop a bio-tech strategy to ensure that we maintain ourselves at the leading edge of  the use of this technology as we move into the 21st century. It is absolutely important that we maintain that leading edge to maintain our competitive technological edge. We have put $17.5 million towards developing and implementing that strategy.We have bolstered, improved and expanded our Supermarket to Asia program that has been so successful over the last three years. We are going to continue and expand it with more programs such as the food and fibre chain program, which will assist Australia's food and fibre industries to build more competitive supply chains into the global export marketplace. We will continue to work in partnership, through the Supermarket to Asia program, with rural industries across Australia. We have announced new funding for the ovine johnes disease campaign to work towards the eradication of that disease in Australia.One of the most significant announcements in this budget, as far as the rural sector is concerned, is our responsible attitude towards the management of our natural resources in Australia. I am talking about the Great Artesian Basin strategy. We are allocating $31.8 million of new money to start implementing that strategy. The Great Artesian Basin covers 22 per cent of Australia's land mass. It contains the same volume as 17,000 Sydney harbours. There are 850 uncapped bores wasting that water in the Basin. We are allocating almost $32 million over the next period of time to cap those bores and make better use of that resource.All this is being done in conjunction and in partnership with the rural industries in Australia. Those rural industries have indicated quite clearly today that they support these government initiatives and they support the direction this government is taking in delivering on our commitments and delivering on our promises at the last election.The National Farmers Federation has welcomed the budget outcome of an underlying surplus of $5.4 billion compared with the forecast. NFF President, Ian Donges, said the government should be congratulated on its economic management. We accept those congratulations. The President of the New  South Wales Farmers Association, Mr Cobb, said today that the federal budget has addressed significant problems faced by Australia's rural industries, while maintaining the underlying low inflation and low interest rate strategy that has helped to curb the rise in farm input costs in recent years. We have the support of our rural industries. We will continue to work in partnership with those rural industries, to take our rural industries to the leading competitive edge as we move into the next century.</DOC>

 - The member for Perth is wrong. He should study the legislation currently before the parliament. If he had any interest in rural and regional Australia, he would get on with allowing the passage of that legislation which provides for a three-step process: 16.6 per cent, benchmarking and then a further decision. It is true that, if at the end of the process that leads to the sale of all of Telstra, it would have the desired effect on the retirement of debt. But, first and foremost, we are delivering in absolute terms for country Australia and for all Australians a budget surplus. -  - You do not like this, but we have actually put $8.2 million of the transaction centres commitment on the budget separate from Telstra, separate from any other factor, to get on with that task. There is more to come when you get on with the job in the Senate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question and for his interest in the Work for the Dole team which is helping with the hail storm clean-up in his part of Sydney. This budget is unambiguously good news for job seekers. There is an additional $220 million for employment services over the next four years. Next year, we estimate that 860,000 job seekers will be assisted, and that is 80,000 more than this year.The budget means more money and more places for job seekers. Within the Job Network, it is estimated that job matching places will be up from 345,000 to 400,000 and Jobsearch training places will be up from 75,000 to 90,000. It is true that intensive assistance numbers are estimated to fall slightly from 325,000 to about 300,000, but there will be more community support program places, more indigenous employment assistance and, above all, more Work for the Dole places.Work for the Dole has been one of the outstanding successes of the Howard government. The latest figures indicate that 11 per cent of participants go on to education or training and 34 per cent have paid employment outcomes. It is better for job seekers and it is better for taxpayers than comparable Working Nation programs under the former government. Briefly, Mission Australia's press release last night stated:We are encouraged - Mission Australia says - by the expansion of work for the dole. Mission Australia has had great success so far in operating more than 50 Work for the Dole programs. In Sydney alone, we have achieved almost 40 per cent success outcome rates. This is on top of Mission Australia placing almost 12,000 people into employment in the first 12 months of Job Network.I am proud of these great organisations that are making a success of Work for the Dole and of Job Network. They deserve the support  of all members of this House, including the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I am fascinated to get a question from the shadow minister in relation to an asset sale. He was part of a government that included the sale of Qantas in three consecutive budgets. They threw it in and nothing happened. The Left fought the Right and they just could not manipulate it through the process. Ultimately they got smart: they asked the then Leader of the Opposition, who is now the Prime Minister, to do what was right for Australia - and he always does what is right for Australia. - So from the party that had three goes with their budgets at bringing home the proceeds - which of course they wanted to waste - from the sale of Qantas, they ask a question about Telstra. Quite clearly, quite consistently, from the time at which we announced the policy on Telstra, the budget reflects that policy. We will sell 16.6 per cent of Telstra when the legislation is passed. That legislation gives us the right to sell 16.6 per cent of Telstra, and we seek legislation to sell the balance of Telstra when  we have an independent inquiry and that independent inquiry indicates that the service levels are of a standard that is acceptable, particularly in respect of rural and regional Australia.So consistently our policy has been reflected in the budget. This is a transparent and accountable government, unlike the government of the past that snuck through three potential sales of Qantas to shore up those deficit budgets. Heaven forbid what the deficits would have been if they actually had to include that sale of Qantas only once back in the eighties.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. This is a very good budget for veterans. It is a very good budget because it consolidates the gains of our first term in government which saw the extension of the gold card to Second World War veterans with qualifying service. It saw the commitment of 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings being extended to the veteran community, including our war widows. This budget also delivers on the commitments the coalition gave to the people of Australia before the last election.This budget will produce in the next 12 months $7.6 billion of expenditure on our veteran community, and that will grow to $8.2 billion by the year 2002-03. This budget for veterans represents a 21 per cent increase in expenditure on the last Labor budget, which I think underpins our commitment to look after our veteran community. In the next 12 months and in coming years, we will see an increase in expenditure on health. In the next 12 months, there will be an increase of $240 million, and that will grow to nearly $710 million by the year 2002-03. We are responding to the ageing veteran population, to whom we have given a commitment to  ensure that their health needs will be met as they grow old.This budget also expands the HomeFront program, which will be extended to all white card holders. That will see an extra 63,000 veterans, war widows and widowers accessing the very successful HomeFront program. We are delivering on $12.6 million of new veteran commemorative programs, including a documentary on Australians at war. There will also be new commemorative activities, including a new Anzac commemorative site at Gallipoli. The Regional War Memorials Upgrade Program has received new money as well. Because of the good economic management of the coalition, we are able to assure the veterans that their future is secure. It is secure in the hands of the National and Liberal parties in coalition in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his question. One of the most  important things you can do for small business is keep interest rates down, keep inflation down. No-one should ever forget that, when Labor was running the economy, we had interest rates of over 20 per cent for small business, and it sent thousands of small businesses broke and gave us a record unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent. So we continue to see good economic management, which is good news for small business.We have also got some particular programs for small business - one of which is the Small Business Enterprise Culture Program starting in July. It is not the money that is important here; it is a means of providing assistance to small business, with management skills to make sure that small business is on top of the issues and to help them manage their business. We think mentoring, for example, is a good idea. When a retired accountant can help out an existing firm, that is good for small business, a practical measure.We are also going to go ahead with our business entry point. The budget has got money for that. That is a great idea too, because that is part of our attack on red tape. If we can cut the level of red tape, that means business can get on with doing what they want to do - which is to run their business instead of filling out forms. - I get the interjection about the tax package. An average firm has 32 relationships in an average year with the Taxation Office. Under the tax package, which the Labor Party is opposed to, that will be reduced from about 32 to four, so that is a massive attack on red tape and definitely worth supporting.Lastly, we are also going on with the other reforms which are so important for small business - for example, reforms to the unfair dismissal law. Not only is this a good deal for small business but, if we can have a better system for small business, they will go out and create more jobs. On the unfair dismissal alone we think there are another 50,000 jobs that could be created. This government is unashamedly pro small business. What is good for small business is good for the country, and this budget has been a tremen  dous boost again to the small businesses around Australia.</DOC>

 - It is not the practice, the policy or the intention of this government to blackmail or even attempt to blackmail anybody. We have been up-front about what we intend to do in these areas. I am glad the Leader of the Opposition asked me that question because it is my recollection that, in the 1993 budget, the former Labor government reduced the right of families with dependent student children up to the age of 25 to continue to get the family allowance. They reduced the age to 18 years, and I do not remember that being told to the Australian people in the 1993 election campaign.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. The ABS labour force statistics were put out this morning. The unemployment rate  moved from 7.4 per cent to 7.5 per cent, so it moved up marginally. They show that a record number of Australians are in work - 8,711,100 people have a job - and obviously that general state of affairs is certainly much better than what it has been all through the 1990s. It flows from the fact that we have had a genuine reform program in place - fiscal policy, labour market policies and the like. But it is also a fact that we would like to do better. Furthermore, we know the changes that are necessary that would provide more employment opportunities than are available today. In answer to the question, the principal barrier to providing further jobs in the Australian economy sits opposite - with 52 per cent of their frontbench being former trade union officials and with the unions having a stranglehold over the `Mr Point of Order' here. - The point I make is that, as Ted Evans once said, the level of unemployment we have is the choice we make. The fact is that we make the choice to create more jobs, and the Labor Party and the trade union officials who sit opposite make another choice. He has the incredible cheek to say this is not relevant to -  - I am of course referring to the issue that most Australians are asking  about today - that is, they are asking, `What else do you need to do, and what is in the way of you doing more to create employment opportunities?' The question said, `What are the impediments to introducing such reforms?' The impediments to introducing those reforms - the legislative reforms, in particular - are a pack of Labor senators under the control of the opposition leader who are opposing sensible measures that would give people the chance of a job. They have been doing that for the whole time that this government has been in office - all the way back to the first big fiscal policy changes we made. Never let anybody forget that, in the 1996 budget, the Labor Party and the ACTU organised a protest against measures which since have created jobs. - Not only did the Labor Party oppose a budget which got interest rates down and which has helped small businesses who have gone out and created jobs; you have been opposing the Workplace Relations Act and all the benefits for small business that were within that legislation. You are today opposing the unfair dismissal -  - When the Leader of the Opposition gets up tonight with his hyperbole about concern for the unemployed, a lot of Australians will be saying, `Why don't you do something to help small business go out and get somebody a job?' It is because you have these ex-ACTU presidents telling you what to do. Why don't you use your numbers to give somebody the chance of a job? - The Leader of the Opposition raises tax reform. You are opposed to tax reform. We want tax reform. Why? Because it will be good for small businesses and, if it is good for our small businesses, they will go out and give people a job. Don't give us crocodile tears about concern for the unemployed. You gave us record unemployment in this country back in the early 1990s, the worst unemployment since the Great Depression, and now you use your numbers, not just on unfair dismissals, but on the youth wages legislation. There is legislation you could be supporting today that would give young people the chance of a job and, just as importantly, protect hundreds of thousands of jobs for young people both now and into the future.The fact of the matter, Mr Speaker, is that the Labor Party is shackled to the trade union movement. As the Farmers Federation said only last year when the Leader of the Opposition made a public declaration that he would not be changing his industrial relations policy one jot or tittle:The ALP's reported new industrial relations policy will take Australia back to the unproductive work  practices of the 1960s and reduce the demand for labour.The fact is that they are hogtied to the ACTU. The challenge for the Leader of the Opposition is not to make another point of order tonight, but to actually throw off the shackles of the ACTU.</DOC>

I said that the Labor Party had only reduced the eligibility in relation to the family allowance for dependent students down to -  - It's not irrelevant. - I suggested that the reduction down to 18 had been introduced by the former Labor government in 1993. I did them a disservice. They in fact introduced it in May 1985, and now 14 years later they are feigning concern about the older dependent children of Australian families.

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. Last Tuesday night when the government introduced its budget it was able to deliver on all of the promises that it made in the October election. The government, having fulfilled all of those commitments, seeks the right to introduce in full all of the commitments it undertook with the Australian people in October of last year, and in particular we seek to implement in full the largest cut in personal income taxes in this country's history.Average Australian wage earners deserve income tax cuts. Only one thing stands between income tax cuts and a go for average earners in Australia, and it is the negative, obstructionist, Labor opposition under the leadership of the current Leader of the Oppo  sition, who believes that the only thing you win a mandate for when you win an election is a mandate to break your promises, not to keep them. After all, that was his experience.During 1992 was the last time that Australia had access to general income tax cuts. Families had access to income tax cuts under our family tax initiative, but the last time that legislation was put in place to cut income tax was in 1992 with the Tax Legislation Amendment Act 1992. Mr Speaker, this is a copy of the act, No. 197 of 1992. The Labor Party went the 1993 election not promising income tax cuts, but with that piece of l-a-w. After the 1993 election the Labor Party, having won an election on the basis of the l-a-w law Tax Legislation Amendment Act of 1992, introduced a bill called the Taxation Deficit Reduction Bill (No. 3) 1993. They changed that l-a-w so that some part of those tax cuts would apply in 1993-94, but the full benefit would apply under section 2(3) of the act as follows:Part 2 commences at the beginning of the financial year fixed by regulations made by the Governor-General for the purposes of this subsection. The financial year must be later than the financial year beginning on 1 July 1994.The Governor-General has been sitting out there at Yarralumla since 1 July 1994 waiting, waiting, waiting - waiting for the Treasurer of the day, waiting for the finance minister of the day to come out and to say to him, `Oh, Governor-General, please let us implement our tax cuts,' which were not a promise; they were l-a-w. They won an election on them in 1993. All they had to do was hop in the Comcar on any one of those days and go out to Yarralumla and ask for them to be put in place. The thing that is interesting about that l-a-w, which is still on the statute books and never applied to one dollar for one day - the member for Dickson knows all about this, don't you; you had quite a lot to say about it at the time - is that it does cut income tax rates generally, but I think it was deficient in one respect. The one thing the Labor Party never had in the l-a-w was an income tax cut for lower income earners. -  - The member for Fraser says, `We had already done that.' You would think the Labor Party would, therefore, having been embarrassed by never delivering on the l-a-w, be supporting income tax cuts now. No, now they have decided that it is unfair to cut income tax rates, even though this government is cutting the lowest marginal rate, a proposal which Labor never had. This is complete hypocrisy, breathtaking hypocrisy. When they took away the l-a-w in that budget they took away $3.5 billion of income tax cuts. Instead of that - on the votes of the Australian Democrats, whose spokesman is now the Labor member for Dickson - they increased all -  -  - Your interjection was? - The member for Dickson says, Mr Speaker, that people should keep their promises. - That was certainly what you were saying at the time. But on the votes of the member for Dickson, not only did the l-a-w never come into effect but all rates of wholesale sales tax were introduced with a $1.3 billion slug on the budget night and another one per cent. What the Labor Party said in 1993 was that winning an election gave you a mandate to break promises. That was the last election that Labor won. What we say on this side of the House is, `Winning an election gives you a mandate to implement them.' That is why - with the member for Dickson saying that people should keep their promises, being elected to keep the Bs honest in the Senate - the Senate ought to give this government the opportunity to make sure it delivers on those commitments. When the Leader of the Opposition stands up tonight, he could look the Australian people squarely in the eye and say why he failed to implement any of the promises he made last time and why they have any basis to believe him ever again. </DOC>

 - The point that I made yesterday, and make again today, is that one of the consequences of this measure is that it will oblige some people to reassess their spending priorities. I quite unapologetically repeat that today. That is the purpose of the measure. This government, unlike our Labor predecessors, believes in private health insurance. The Leader of the Opposition delivers a personal eulogy of private health insurance, but when he was in government he was complicit in reducing the level of private health insurance in this country from 61 per cent down to the low 30s. - It is typical of the Leader of the Opposition that in 1984, when the Labor Party introduced the Medicare system, the level of private health insurance in this country was around 61 per cent; I understand that it had fallen to about 33 per cent by the time of the change of government in March of 1996. This even caused the Leader of the Opposition's friend - the former health minister Graham Richardson - to warn the then government in 1990 that if it did not do something about the bleeding of the private health system it would face a crisis. As a consequence of that warning being ignored, we did inherit on coming to office a crisis in the private health insurance system. We have set about doing something about it. We have introduced a 30 per cent tax rebate. That effectively means that, for 80 per cent of the Australian population, under our taxation proposals if they are passed by the parliament private health insurance will be fully tax deductible. That measure has been widely welcomed throughout the Australian community. It was so widely welcomed within the New South Wales Labor Party that they begged the Leader of the Opposition to pass it last year. They begged the Labor Party here not to go on opposing it.To further buttress that measure, we have introduced lifetime health cover. That is designed to add another reason, another incentive, for people to take out private health insurance. It is easy for the Leader of the Opposition - who watched private health insurance bleed away, who was prepared to sit there and do nothing to help private health insurance - to sneer now at the attempts of this government, but at least we have matched our rhetoric with a commitment. We introduced a tax rebate; the Labor Party voted against it. We have introduced lifetime health cover. It is designed to buttress the other measures that we have introduced. Unlike the Labor Party, which only believes in the public system, we believe in both a public and a private system. And if the private system is weakened, the public system is weakened. If you believe in the maintenance of Medicare, then you must believe in the maintenance of a strong private health insurance system. We have shown our commitment by our actions.  The Labor Party sat by idly for 13 years in government while private health insurance dissipated. It has taken a coalition government to reverse that trend, and I congratulate the Minister for Health and Aged Care for the leadership that he has shown in this area.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. I know that all the very good non-government schools in his electorate will welcome the government's initiatives, as have many others in the community. The government schools in the member's electorate will also greatly welcome the increased funding for government schools in the budget. The Reverend Peter Tannock, the Chairman of the National Catholic Education Commission, which represents 1,700 schools and 650,000 pupils, says of the government's measures:The new scheme supports and promotes freedom of choice in education . . . it will give catholic schools and systems real increases in resources and a secure, long-term funding base.Building on these comments, Father Tom Doyle of the Victorian Catholic Education Commission said that the changes were:. . . a very good and equitable package . . . The new system is fair, open to scrutiny, yet doesn't drain resources away from government schools. In a caring and democratic Australia, it is vital that we recognise every person's right to choice.Mr Fergus Thompson, the Executive Director of the National Council of Independent Schools, said:The new funding arrangements will enhance educational choice for all families and provide improved equity to school funding arrangements.There is a very good comment from the Christian Controlled Parents Schools:The Government is to be congratulated. Low income Australian parents and their families have been given a real chance to exercise genuine choice in the education of their children. I think the reaction was very well summed up by Mr Peter Crimmins, the Executive Officer of the Australian Association of Christian Schools, an organisation which represents over 150 schools and over 40,000 pupils. In a press release entitled `Solid Justice: Real Choice', Mr Crimmins said:Choice in schooling is now a reality for working class Australian families.These comments capture the reality of the government's education policies. They show that these policies are equitable and fair for all Australian families. They form a dramatic contrast, one has to say, with the comments from the member for Dobell and the Australian Education Union. Apart from the statistical babble that we have heard over the last few days, which I exposed in the House yesterday -  -  - You will hear more of this statistical babble, says the Leader of the Opposition. The Australian Education Union made this disgraceful attack on the Catholic education system: `The Catholic bishops,' the Australian Education Union said, `should feel especially ashamed. Never before have they accepted a system of funding not based on educational standards, equity and the common good.' What hypocrisy! We know that the Australian Education Union writes the policy for the Labor Party. I invite the Leader of the Opposition to dissociate himself from these disgraceful remarks by the Australian Education Union. These policies that the government has put in place are increasing funding for government schools. They are increasing equity for non-government school funding. They are fair to all Australians and at last give working-class Australian families the school choice they have long demanded.</DOC>

 - Improving law and order in Australia is a priority of the Australian people, whether they are parents, whether they are children, whether they are elderly, or whoever they are. It has also been a priority for the Howard government. The range of our activities in this area is exemplified by two announcements made this week. In his budget speech, the Treasurer announced that there would be four new Australian Federal Police strike teams to fight international drug-dealing criminals, and today, under our expanding crime prevention program, the Minister for Justice and Customs provided $30,000 to people of Burnie Court in Lyons in the ACT to restore vandalised property and involve young residents in community safety action. You can see, Mr Speaker, that we are operating at the international level, and we are operating at the community level; we are also operating at all levels in between.Additional funding was announced by the Treasurer in the 1999-2000 budget totalling some $169 million for improvement of community safety. The government is establishing Crimtrac at a cost of $50 million to provide  a national information system to assist in policing, $35.4 million is committed to the Australian Customs Service to enhance drug detection capabilities and $41.6 million is committed to the Tough on Drugs initiative to increase the capacity to intercept drugs.We know that, in the last two years of Labor government, the Leader of the Opposition, as Minister for Finance, ran up a $23.4 billion deficit. What people should realise is that while Labor was running up these deficits through their economic incompetence, they were also cutting the budget of the Australian Federal Police. When we came to office, the AFP were down to one mobile drug team, and in the last five years of Labor government staffing was reduced by 400 personnel. In contrast, the government's sound economic management will enable us to improve community safety throughout Australia into the next millennium.</DOC>

 - As it happens I have seen the letter, and I have read the letter. One of the claims that the Insurance Council makes in the letter is that insurers will have to make higher payments to people who are making personal injury claims because income tax cuts will mean that they are entitled to higher compensation. The insurance com  panies say that, as a consequence of lowering income tax rates, people will be entitled to bigger payouts and this will cost insurers more.From the government's point of view, we think that is quite appropriate. If income tax rates are being reduced, compensation beneficiaries should be getting more. We are quite happy to ensure that people get the benefit of income tax cuts. Let me turn it around the other way: when the Labor Party effectively put up income taxes by taking away the l-a-w and that meant that compensation beneficiaries got less because you never delivered your income tax cuts, did the insurers say that they were getting a windfall? Did the insurers say, `Because we have to pay people less in compensation payments because Labor's got income tax rates higher, we should be taking less premiums'? Of course the insurers didn't say that. The insurers were quite happy to take the benefit when Labor was putting up income taxes, and the insurers will have to take the liability when we are bringing them down. That is one of the things about taking risk. As far as the government is concerned, the insurers are well and truly entitled to try and get a better deal as a result of lower income tax rates. - We are quite happy to ensure that people get the benefit. We are quite happy for the insurers to make their claims. I suppose if the insurers can get the Australian Labor Party to back insurers against people who take out insurance policies, we will stick with the people who are taking out the policies any day.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for her concern for aspiring Olympians and Paralympians in her electorate. Today I launched the government's Tough on Drugs in Sport strategy. It is one of the toughest sets of measures in the world. We have looked at improving border control methods and the information exchange between Customs and sporting bodies. We are looking at more effective control of supply and the diversion of various products such as veterinary products. We are also looking at the appropriateness of criminal sanctions for some activities. We are educating athletes on the negative effects of drugs and also on the medical commissions that are available to them for the legitimate use of drugs, should they be truly ill. We are committing $3 million to research. This year we are conducting 5,000 tests, which is 25 per cent more than last year. We are committed to ongoing increases in tests over the next few years. This testing will be out of competition. There will also be more tests with no notice. Then we are pushing very strongly for an international standard consisting of a two-year ban for a first offence and a lifetime ban for a second offence. I have insisted on the IOC procedures at the Sydney Olympic Games being rigorous and transparent. I have met with Jacques Rogge of the IOC, and we have agreed to take a look at those procedures. We are convening an international drugs summit in November to shore up the commitment of governments around the world to a strong antidoping position. We are overall sending this message to athletes right around the world: if you are a cheat and you come to Sydney in the year 2000 or beyond, then you will be caught and you will suffer the personal and national embarrassment of being a drug cheat.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The reality is that under the social bonus we intend to do a great deal in the area of telecommunications for rural and regional Australians. We are proposing another $150 million over three years to extend access to untimed local calls to those people who live outside standard zones; $36 million over three years to enable local call access to the Internet for people in rural and regional areas; and $120 million over five years to provide TV reception and SBS for those who are in television black spots. There are many in this place who represent people who do not have access to television around the country - unbelievable as that may seem to many people in 1999. We are also proposing $20 million to enhance communications for remote and island communities - the Torres Strait islands, Christmas Island, Norfolk Island and so forth - and $25 million to upgrade mobile phone coverage on our national highways.These are all very valuable, and are in addition to some of the things that we have been able to do already through Networking the Nation. As you move around this vast continent of ours, you find that we have been able to do an extraordinary amount over the last couple of years. We have spent over $3½ million for the Victorian Rural Libraries Online project; $3 million for an outback digital network; $1.7 million to kick-start the provision of online learning tools for Tasmanian students from kindergarten to TAFE; and nearly $500 million to Queensland's central west Channel Country. I could go on for a very long time to cover places all over the nation that are benefiting very substantially from what we have been able to do - a very  large number of projects totalling over $93 million. What I particularly want to come to is the very mischievous misrepresentation of our clear position on the social bonus, which is worth $670 million in times coming up. We have had the Leader of the Opposition implying that none of this will happen; none of the good things we have committed ourselves to will happen until Telstra is sold. The reality is that the budget factors in the sale of up to 16.6 per cent of Telstra for the 1999-2000 year. It includes provision for the social bonus from those sale proceeds. Subsequent sales are not scheduled until the years 2001 and 2002.	Labor likes to portray the social bonus as being dependent upon the full sale of Telstra. It is not. Indeed, the only thing standing between rural Australia having these very valuable programs, which are making a real difference and can continue to make a real difference right across the nation, is their intransigence in the face of good policy.</DOC>

 - The fact of the matter is that no-one has rolled over on this. The government's position is perfectly well known. In fact, there is an acknowledgment of the situation in the papers. Just have a good look at them; it is there. - There is no need to at all, but I can if you would like:Revenue from the sale could be placed at risk if the Telstra (Transition to Full Private Ownership) Bill 1998 does not pass parliament.Read the stuff. In the meantime, you who wear no clothes on this, remember your performance over the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. Recognise good policy. Recognise that it is you who are standing in the way of valuable and worthwhile initiatives for rural and regional Australians that can make a real difference. In particular, why don't you move away from the old-fashioned interventionist `government must solve every problem' approach of your spokesman for rural and regional Australia, because it is not very convincing. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question; I know of her concern for residents in nursing home and hostel care in her region. I think it is important to look at the answer in terms of what we inherited from the Labor Party. The Labor Party did nothing about ensuring capital streams of income for nursing homes during its 13 years of office. Indeed, it commissioned a Gregory report to which it never even filed a response - never even answered its own commissioned report. It never had a policy for introducing streams for capital flow, it never had incentives and it never had any accountability for any policy that it put in place.The Howard government realised that this situation simply could not continue, and it addressed it. The bottom line is that we have put in place a capital stream system which  over 10 years will result in $1.4 billion of funding for nursing home care. But, in addition to that, in this current budget we have provided another $25.6 million over four years for assisting capital funding for rural and remote areas, and we have provided another $8.2 million to the already allocated $20 million for restructuring.The bottom line is that all of this is working. In the first year of our reforms, $¾billion of rebuilding, upgrades and renovations have been either begun or completed, and the number of uncertified facilities has gone down from 300 to 90. I know that the Labor Party has a good deal of trouble in recognising this and so I introduced in the House earlier this week some good headlines to help the Opposition understand and come to terms with it. I have a pretty picture here just so that they can understand -  - Mr Speaker, I thank you for that advice; I will simply table the chart.</DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable member's question is: yes, I do stand by that. There are a number of ways in which any government can address underprivilege in areas of Australian society. It is true that general economic conditions in this country are the best they have been for 30 years - easily the best they have been for 30 years. But it is also true that there are areas of Australia, particularly rural Australia, which are still doing it very tough.In relation to how you respond to that, you respond first of all by indicating as a government that you understand that and, amidst the proper pride that this country feels in its general economic performance, you acknowledge that there are particular measures which are of particular benefit to rural Australia. I would imagine that, of all the developments over the last three years, none has been more beneficial to rural Australia than the massive reduction in interest rates that has occurred.Any member on our side of the House - and we have many in both the Liberal and National parties who represent the people of the bush - knows that the reduction in interest rates has been of enormous benefit. I would imagine there is hardly a farmer in Australia who is not a believer in exchange rate policy being conducted by the Reserve Bank in a totally flexible and transparent way. That is another policy that is of enormous benefit to the Australian bush. I have not found any people in rural Australia who are opposed to getting a $3½ billion cut in their fuel bill, which will be one of the consequences of the taxation policy that is going to be introduced by the government.I can go through a long list of measures for which this government has been responsible which have been directly targeted towards addressing the specific needs of rural Australia. Most recently in the budget, as a result of the policy initiatives of the minister for health, the government was able to announce a number of additional measures in relation to relieving the chronic shortage of doctors in rural Australia. It has taken a Liberal health minister, with the assistance of the Deputy Leader of the National Party, to really come to grips with this problem. -  - Mr Speaker, I am profoundly indebted to those who have taken points of order, because it has given me time to recall to memory a number of other government initiatives which have been directed towards the relief of pockets of disadvantage in the Australian bush. Then, dealing as I normally do with these questions in a sequential fashion, I will come to the  issue of scholarships. I will come in due course to that, because I have a total and appropriate response to the second part of the Leader of the Opposition's question.The first part addressed in a very general way the issue of whether this government remained committed to fighting areas of disadvantage in the Australian bush. I am delighted to confirm again that we are committed and that we have followed general economic policies, such as lowering interest rates, cutting taxes, improving competitiveness and running a flexible exchange rate, all of which are designed to help the Australian bush. I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that the budget delivered on our commitment to produce another 30,000 apprenticeships in rural Australia. The historic funding formula announced for independent schools in the budget will be of enormous benefit to many schools. - And I am continually impeded by points of order. The third measure that I called to mind during the penultimate series of points of order by the member for Canberra and the Leader of the Opposition was that there was a major boost in the budget for the education of isolated children.In relation to the question of scholarships, the minister for education has already made it clear that these scholarships did not in any way reduce the cost burden for low income students while they were at university. All  these scholarships did was relieve people from the obligation of repaying their HECS out of future required income. In those circumstances, in giving the response to them, the government came to the conclusion that the money could be better directed elsewhere.</DOC>

 - This question follows very appropriately from the answer that has just been given by the Prime Minister. I compliment the member for Hinkler on the interest he takes in ensuring that students, particularly in regional centres, are able to avail themselves of tertiary study opportunities. This budget has been especially good for families. There is a real social bonus in this budget which helps rural and regional families in a whole host of ways. There are a number of largely unheralded but significant initiatives in the budget which will particularly help country children and children from regional centres to obtain a tertiary education.Often it is difficult for young people in rural communities to overcome the extra costs associated with travelling and the greater distances they have to move to obtain higher education. When this government introduced the youth allowance it provided rent assistance, for the first time, to assist people who have to travel away to undertake their tertiary education. Sometimes families, particularly  country families with low incomes, have been unable to qualify for the youth allowance because of substantial assets. This budget introduces a significant concession which will enable many students to access the student financial supplementary loan system, even though their families may have significant farm or small business assets. We expect around 1,400 additional families will be able to benefit from this very important measure. This will provide real living expenses money for students who have to travel away to attend university - unlike the scholarship scheme referred to previously.In addition, there have been a number of changes made to the actual means test which will make it easier for families to qualify for some of these benefits. The budget will assist these families to qualify, particularly those who have been excluded under the family actual means test because of the independent employment sibling allowance. In the future, people will be able to undertake this employment within the family business or on the family farm and not have it counted under the actual means test. In addition to that, we are simplifying the arrangements for the secondary student boarder concession, again to make it easier for people to qualify for these benefits. These may be relatively unheralded announcements, but they are very important to organisations like the Isolated Children's Parents Association and families who have small business assets or farm assets because their children will now have better access to tertiary education than they have had in the past.</DOC>

Over a comparable period of time, my immediate predecessor incurred expenses of $795,000, and the number of staff employed in the two residences has fallen from 13 to nine under my prime ministership.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Responses to the health initiatives in the budget have been overwhelmingly positive. In regard to our changes in the medical research funding, Professor John Shine of the Australian Association of Medical Research Institutes comments that the budget marks the beginning of a new era for medical research in Australia. Professor John Mattick of the Australian Genome Research Facility says that it is a very positive step in the right direction. The Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association says that it can position Australia as a global player in the biotechnology revolution. The Murdoch Institute's director Professor Bob Williams said that Australia can now hold its head up in the international arena.It is not just spending extra money on medical research that has brought positive comments. Our initiative on lifetime health cover has received comments such as these. The Australian Catholic Health Care Association's chief executive said that the lifetime health cover plan has the best chance of luring young people back into private health insurance. The Australian Council on the Ageing has reacted positively to the  various health initiatives, including private health insurance which rewards long-term membership. The Australian Medical Association, not always complimentary of the government, has said that the measure of lifetime health cover combined with the 30 per cent rebate has set in place a structure to ensure the long-term viability of the private health insurance system. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has said that it will certainly improve the access of more disadvantaged groups to public hospitals and that that has to be a good thing.These groups have supported what we have done with lifetime health cover because they know we have done our homework. They know we have allowed for a two-year period of absence for people to leave and still maintain their certified age of entry. They know we have allowed for suspension of membership in cases of genuine hardship or extended overseas postings where people can still maintain their certified age of entry. They know we have made special arrangements for the Australian Defence Force so that any member of the ADF from 1 July 2000 will be deemed to be 30 years of age whenever they leave the Defence Force. They know that people can upgrade or downgrade their cover and maintain their certified age of entry. They know there are arrangements for people to switch between funds and maintain their certified age of entry. They know we are having discussions with the small number of unregistered health funds to look at their options to actually become registered.You see, Mr Speaker, we saw the opposition coming. We knew they would be carping, negative, opportunistic and nitpicking. We knew they would try to misrepresent the initiative. We knew they would react to this as they have to every other initiative in health because, in the words of Graham Richardson, they do not like the private health sector. Mr Speaker, while I am on my feet, I correct an answer I gave on 8 February. I was asked about psychiatry consultations. I tabled a document from which I was reading at the time. I was informed this morning -  - I have checked with the Speaker and I was asked to do it now, so just stop your stupid interjections. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was just trying to be courteous. It is very hard with the opposition. I was informed this morning by my department that they have become aware that those figures given three months ago are incorrect. I table the letter from the department and I table the correct figures.</DOC>

 - I do not accept those figures. They sound suspiciously like the figures being dishonestly peddled by the Australian Education Union. What those figures do is repeat the constant dishonest mantra of the teacher unions of this country who deliberately omit in any funding comparison the contribution to the funding of government schools by the state governments of Australia. Everyone who knows anything about education in this country ought to understand that the major source of funding of government schools in Australia is the state governments, who are the owners and operators of not only the assets of the -  - We expect better of him rather than to make such a pathetic point of order. What the honourable member sought to do with his question was to imply that, through the total funding decisions of this government, we have deliberately disadvantaged government schools. That is wrong, it is dishonest and it is merely parroting in an obsequious fashion the views of the teacher unions of Australia. Let me tell the House that the major call on the budgets of most state governments - not the only call of course, but one of the major calls - is government education. In the coming financial year the financial assistance grants going to the Australian states will rise by something close to five per cent in real terms. It is therefore stark obvious that all of the governments of the Australian states will have more resources to fund government schools.Let me also remind the member who asked the question, and through him the teacher unions of Australia, that, if the goods and services tax legislation is passed, over time all  of the states of Australia will have more money to fund government schools. That is why they lined up, and why your premier lined up after he got some extra money. He was one of the most enthusiastic to sign. Bob Carr went along and said, `You know, John, I'm against this - where do I sign?' The reason they did that is that every last one of them, Liberal and Labor alike, are going to have lots more money under the GST to pay for government schools.If you were interested in government schools, instead of parodying the lies of the teacher unions, you know what you would be doing? You would be urging your Senate colleagues to pass the legislation so that the state governments of Australia would have more money to fund government schools. It is the state governments that fund government schools. The federal government is principally responsible for the funding of independent schools. That has been the process followed by Labor and Liberal governments alike. It was followed by the Hawke and Keating governments, as it was and is being followed by the Fraser and Howard governments. We engaged in some top-up direct funding in relation to particular programs for government schools. We have provided literacy and numeracy programs. We have provided $90 million for Asian student instruction. We have provided a teacher training program that is fairly available to people in both government and independent schools.To use the words of the secretary of the Christian Schools Association, quoted by the minister for education earlier in question time, I am immensely proud of the fact that the education initiatives in this budget for the first time have given real freedom of choice between government and independent schools to the working class people of Australia. What really sticks in the craw of those who sit opposite is that it has taken a coalition government to give equity to working class Australians so far as choice in government and independent schools is concerned. No amount of the peddling of the dishonest misrepresentation of the teacher unions will alter that fact. We support government and private schools. We support them fairly; we  support them fully. We have delivered like no other government on equity and choice for working class Australians. - </DOC>

He is familiar with them all, Mr Speaker. In fact, I believe Red Rooster counts him as one of its greatest patrons and with income tax cuts he will be able to buy more Red Rooster. - The point I was going on to make is that, like other Australians, the Leader of the Opposition will be getting income tax cuts from 1 July 2000 which will enable him to cope with any price increases in Red Rooster, Kentucky Fried Chicken, or whatever it might be. The basic rule that the government will be following in its legislation is that takeaway products will be taxable. That is the agreement that we have with the Australian Democrats.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to inform the House that last Friday the basis was laid to finally achieve something that this country has needed for a quarter of a century, and that is fundamental reform of the Australian taxation system. Taxation reform will boost economic performance; economic performance will produce more jobs.Under the plan that we will seek the support of the Senate for, and now believe will pass through the Senate, 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers from 1 July next year will be on a top marginal tax rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar. Eighty per cent of Australians - the great bulk of Australian taxpayers - will receive the greatest tax cut they have ever had from any government. The last time the tax scales were adjusted by the Labor Party every single rate of indirect tax was increased. By contrast we have now been in office for over three years and there has been no increase in personal income tax. - Yes. It is a political nightmare for those who have been left in the grandstand of Australia politics. They are spectators. They are not players; they are not participants. They are merely spectators.Not only will it be possible for somebody's income to go from $20,000 to $50,000 a year without going into a higher taxation bracket, not only will 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers have a top marginal rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar, but we will also be honouring the architecture of the new arrangement with the states.For the first time since the end of World War II the Australian states will have access to a growth tax. No longer will we have the farce of annual premiers conferences. We will now deliver to the Australian states a basis over time for a sustained growth in their revenues. What that means, Mr Speaker, is that the Australian states will have a sound financial source of the money they need to provide government schools, roads, hospitals,  police services and all the other things that are needed.This is the best financial deal the Australian states have ever had. Not only are there enormous income tax benefits, not only are there enormous benefits for the states, not only is there a boost to productivity and therefore to jobs, but may I say very proudly that what was announced on Friday is even better for the bush than the earlier package. What was announced on Friday represents the delivery in full of the promises I made to the National Farmers Federation at Longreach two weeks ago when I said that, in any negotiation relating to tax, the interests of Australian farmers would be protected. The bush is a big winner out of last Friday. The bush of Australia not only preserves all the benefits it received, but in addition, because the concessional approach to diesel has been extended to rail transport, it means that there are vast cost savings for wheat growers and also significant cost savings for those in the mining industry.For 25 years governments on both sides have grappled with the challenge of tax reform. The Labor Party in government squibbed it. The Labor Party in opposition has retired to the grandstand. Pryor in the Canberra Times had it right today when he showed the Leader of the Opposition in the grandstand. They are not players; they are not participants. They have been recreant to the national interest, and the great challenge of tax reform was taken up by the coalition, and it will now become a reality as a result of last Friday's agreement.</DOC>

 - We are very pleased to see some interest in tax reform from the  Labor Party at last. The Labor Party apparently has shown no interest in the complexity of the wholesale sales tax system, which they had been running at rates of 12, 22, 32, 41, 45 and 47 per cent for the last three years. In answer to the honourable member's question, as I said earlier, the basic principle agreed with the Australian Democrats is that takeaway food will be taxable. That was a proposition that was put by the Australian Democrats and agreed to by the government. But the Prime Minister could not have said it better when he said, `Where does the Labor Party stand on the great issue of tax reform?' Oh, it stands to its feet. - Having pointed out the basic principle, I then asked the question, where does the Labor Party stand on the question of tax reform, and the Leader of the Opposition got to his feet to make a point of order on the grounds of irrelevance. How well he demonstrated his position! The Labor Party apparently is now resorting to ringing up Australian Democrats pleading with them not to pass the bills. As reported in today's Australian  -  - As I said, under the definitions of food, takeaway food will be taxable. The Australian Labor Party, in its efforts to be relevant, has now been apparently ringing Democrat offices trying to argue that this tax reform should not become part of the Australian legislation. The Democrats were at first worried about this, but they noticed that a number of callers could not pronounce the name -  - As I said, the government has agreed with the Australian Democrats that takeaway food should be taxable. That is the agreement we have come to with them, and that is the definition that has been drawn. The Australian Labor Party spends its time ringing Democrat offices -  - Nonsense! They were ringing up over Natasha Stott Despoja and, as  the Democrats reported, they could not even pronounce the name. - In making those phone calls, allegedly furious about Natasha Stott Despoja, they were mispronouncing her name. Numerous people call her Dr Poyer and one called her Dr Pergola.</DOC>

 - In a news release dated 18 May 1999, Standard and Poors announced that Australia's foreign currency rating had been raised to AA plus. This reversed the downgrading of Australia in 1989, which was presided over by the Australian Labor Party. During its term in office, the Australian Labor Party had Australia downgraded twice - first in 1986 and second in 1989. As a result of this present government's policies, we have now managed to undo the first downgrading, the first piece of damage that the Australian Labor Party left Australia, with long-term borrowing downgradings and causing Australian business higher interest rates.When Standard and Poors made its announcement reversing the effect of that 1989  downgrading, Standard and Poors noted that Australia's favourable economic performance and prospects were `as a result of economic reforms, reinforcing resilience, flexibility, diversity and competitiveness'. Standard and Poors noted that the stable outlook reflects the likelihood that the government's strong demonstrated and ongoing commitment to privatisation and fiscal consolidation will, in improving the government's stock position, provide enhanced flexibility to deal with economic stress in the years ahead. I think all Australians would welcome the fact that Australia's economic performance has now been recognised and that Australia has won, through hard and long economic reform, an advantage which it lost in 1989 because of the poor economic performance of the then government.Let it also be remembered that, when this government determined to pull the Australian budget out of deficit and put it into surplus to strengthen our economy, we were fought every inch of the way by Labor. It was Labor that determined, having created the fiscal deficit and the fiscal mess in Australia, that it would do everything it could to keep it there. We might well observe the same in relation to tax. The Australian Labor Party wants to fight every inch of the way on tax reform and then they say, `Once it is implemented, if we were elected' - what would they do about it? - `we would keep it.' They would keep it! In other words, it is precisely the same strategy that they followed in relation to the budget - they fought every inch of the way to prevent Australia getting a surplus budget and then announced that they have actually been in favour of surpluses all the time.The importance of fiscal responsibility has been borne out both with the stability that has been given to the Australian economy in the last two years and the confidence that is now returning in relation to our economy. We have seen again, with international trade data releases, the pressures that are coming onto the Australian economy as a result of a downturn amongst our trading partners. From 1 April 1999, coking coal producers are receiving prices on average 17 per cent lower in US dollar terms than they were last month.  Steaming coal prices are down by around 13 per cent on average, with iron ore prices down by about 10 per cent on average. As a consequence of that, you saw in today's trade data a fall in relation to exports only partly offset by a fall in relation to imports - an international trade deficit for the month of April, as a result of poor export prices, of around $1.9 billion.In relation to that, the government has forecast for the financial year that it would be expecting a current account deficit of the order of 5½ per cent, with a current account deficit of the order of six per cent in some of the quarters leading up to the end of the financial year. At a time when your export prices are at historical lows, you will get pressure on your trade position. You will particularly get pressure on your trade position if, at a time when your export prices are at historical lows, you have a strong domestic economy - and the Australian economy is still a strong domestic economy, growing at one of the fastest rates in relation to the developed world. - That means that, in relation to economic reform, there is no room for complacency. There is no room for complacency in relation to fiscal policy. That is why this government has put the budget into surplus and why this government has a policy which, if it were not opposed by the Australian Labor Party, would completely eliminate Commonwealth debt by 2002-03. What a magnificent achievement that would be. - The Leader of the Opposition yells at his loudest when he is at his weakest. The reason he is yelling right now at the top of his voice is that he knows that it is his strategy to try to defeat the possibility that Australia has once in a generation to eliminate its debt, just as he tried to defeat the government putting the budget into surplus and just as he is trying to defeat the government in relation to tax reform. - The Australian Labor Party, which used to pride itself on being one of the parties of Australia, is now reduced to phoning up Democrat offices and posing as outraged Democrats to ask the Democrats not to pass the legislation - ringing in and allegedly complaining about `Dr Pergola'. The only other person who was unable to pronounce the name of the Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats on the weekend was the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He had trouble getting that out on the Sunday  program. One might wonder where these telephone callers are being instructed from. It is the same staffers who are brought in on Thursday nights when the Leader of the Opposition delivers his pathetic replies to the budget and who are instructed to sit up there and clap loudly when he finishes. They are the same people who were instructed to ring around the Australian Democrat offices. The Australian Labor Party is on its uppers, down for the count, and it has no relevance.</DOC>

 - The point I have made repeatedly in the House is that, where you have a comprehensive tax base, you reduce complexity. I have made that point a thousand times. It is one of the reasons why we are against an indirect tax system which has rates of 12, 22, 32, 37, 41 and 45 per cent. It is one of the reasons why we disagree with the Labor Party on wholesale sales tax where it says you should tax a toothbrush but not toothpaste. Which one is taxable under the Labor Party? - The point we have made on a number of occasions is that the GST applies to takeaway food. I have made that point in relation to all of the answers so far. A moment's thought will tell you not to proceed with the remainder of your 10 questions, which have been carefully written out for you and which lead to the same position.A 10 per cent single rate which applies to takeaway food is much simpler than Labor's policy. Labor's policy is to have the following indirect taxes: zero, 12, 22, 32, 37, 41 and 45. - It is infinitely simpler than zero, 12, 22, 32, 37, 41 and 45 per cent, which is Australian Labor Party policy. It is infinitely simpler than having in a supermarket one or the other of a toothbrush and toothpaste - I do not remember which - taxable and the other not. It is much simpler than having different rates on detergents, soaps and all of those particular things. It is simpler than having different rates on orange juice. You simplify complexity in two ways: one is by having a single rate and the other is by having a broad base. In relation to indirect tax reform, we have one rate, which is much simpler than six, and we have a significantly broader base, which is much simpler than the classifications that occur under indirect tax at the moment. As a result of that, not only do we raise revenue to fund legitimate social services but, with the exception of the Labor Party, I think all members of the House will say that we are able to radically reduce income taxes, which will give families in this country a much better deal.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. One of the things that the government will be doing as part of the new tax system is broadening the indirect tax base, radically reducing income taxes, increasing family allowances and improving Commonwealth-state relations. As a result of tax reform, people who are receiving pensions and allowances will get a real increase in their income. Those people trying to defeat tax reform - let us say it plainly - are trying to defeat real increases in pensions for the aged. If the tax reform goes through, the aged get real increases in their pensions.If tax reform does not go through, you will still get 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, but you will not get the four per cent supplement on top of it. If tax reform does not go through, you will still get allowances indexed to the CPI, but you will not get the four per cent increase and the two per cent real. From the government's point of view, to be able to reform the tax system and improve the lot of pensioners and allowees shows you what you can do with social policy on a better economic base.What is the alternative to no tax reform? We know that the Australian Labor Party wants the wholesale sales tax of the 1930s and the rates of 10, 12, 17, 22, 32, 41, 45 - you name it, there is a rate of some description. We know that Labor's policy is the same now as it was in 1993. In 1993, because they had a declining - Mr Speaker, he does not like being reminded of his record. - Yes, Mr Speaker, I was asked whether or not there have been times in Australia's history when indirect taxes were increased without compensation. The answer is there have been. - Although the Leader of the Opposition is interjecting again very loudly, the fact is in 1993 the Australian Labor Party increased the rates of all wholesale sales taxes - every single one of them. There was a rate of 10, and the Australian Labor Party took it to 12. There was a rate of 15, and the Australian Labor Party took it to 17. There was a rate of 20, and the Australian Labor Party took it to 22. There was a rate of 30, and the Australian Labor Party took it 32. How much compensation did they introduce? How much compensation did the Australian Labor Party give to pensioners? I see the member for Werriwa is smiling up the back. He knows.How much compensation did the Australian Labor Party give to pensioners when it increased all rates of the regressive wholesale sales tax? Not only did they decide to give no compensation but, just for good measure, they decided to increase income taxes as well. They took away the income tax cuts that they had promised. Actually, they were not a  promise; those income tax cuts were l-a-w. They took them away. They gave no compensation. They increased wholesale sales tax rates. This is the government which is broadening the indirect tax base, increasing compensation, reducing income taxes, giving a new tax system for a new century. Leaderless, directionless, chained to negativity because they cannot put forward a positive idea on anything, guess who is opposing it? None other than the reactionary party of Australian politics, the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I acknowledge the presence of Mr Gorbachev in the House, and I welcome him. Russia, of course, is a country that has a value added tax. - I will not repeat to Mr Gorbachev the interjections from the front bench of the Labor Party, but -  - I was asked a question about the application of GST or value added tax, and I make the point that value added taxes are considered mandatory throughout Europe - France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy. They are widely adopted in nearly every Asian country. But wholesale sales taxes are shared between the Australian Labor Party, Swaziland, the Solomon Islands and Botswana. - The United States does not have wholesale sales tax. The member for Melbourne interjects. I was asked a question -  - of what the GST should apply to in relation to food. As I said yesterday -  - I was asked about the application of a value added tax or a GST in Australia and, as has been the case, the government has agreed on principles with the Australian Democrats, which of course we will be putting into legislation. As I said, we will be taking out any of the rough edges when we put it into legislation and we will be expecting it to be enacted. But in relation to modern developed economies, it is no new thing to have a value added tax or a GST. It is mandatory in Europe. It is adopted all the way through Asia. If this were occurring in some other country - somebody was seriously suggesting that a 1930s wholesale sales tax should be adopted - they would get a fair hearing in Botswana and Swaziland and in the councils of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - This is an entirely predictable and noisy opposition here. I think I almost heard the member for Banks - in a time warp, when I was in Budapest last Thursday night - shouting: `We want Gough.' He is a bit out of date. The member for Dickson had the article from hell on Saturday - the shadow ministry from hell, buried in the Weekend Australian . That is a bit embarrassing. Let us get back to the real business: getting on with the job of trade. We are  getting the job done. We have a policy that counts. We had a budget with a $5.4 billion surplus.I thank the member for Parkes for his question. There have been two developments since the budget that I particularly want to highlight to the House. Firstly, I was able to complete negotiations with China in respect of the accession of China to the World Trade Organisation. These negotiations have been going on for a couple of years and have been very hard yards. But on this occasion in Beijing my team of Australian negotiators were able to secure additional tonnages and a reduction in tariffs in a range of areas, including sugar and wool, in a way which will be very satisfactory for Australian exporters upon the accession of China to the World Trade Organisation. Australia now has a deal in place with China. The sooner China is a member of the World Trade Organisation on proper terms the better for the future trading pattern of the world - a win-win situation overall.Secondly, we have the ANTS package mark II. I congratulate the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Minister for the Environment and Heritage on an outstanding job for the future of all Australians. This package delivers an economic boost to the country areas of Australia, the rural and regional areas, in a way which could have only been tripped by Labor's stance of barricades against our exports. -  - The federal government is removing all diesel excise from rail operation, in case you missed it in the detail, my friends. All diesel excise comes off rail freight operations, and all exports will be GST free.There is no such thing as a level playing field. What we are about is finding a way of tilting the playing field in favour of our exporters and getting the job done. I am just sorry that this country is shackled with an opposition which stands only for push styling and no policy whatsoever.</DOC>

 - I was as interested as anybody in the clause on chickens and, when I inquired of the Democrats why they had a chicken clause, they freely admitted that it was to answer the attacks that I had launched on them. So I think if you want to blame the Democrats for putting that into the clause you will have to go back to me. I think I was asked a question at the press conference about the taxability of chickens, and I think I said that I thought on reflection it could be done in far less scientific ways than I had previously indicated. - Bruce Goodluck would look like a giant compared with you - with a greater intellect too. The general objective of the Democrats' amendments, to which the government will agree, is that takeaway food will be taxable.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The fact is that the negotiations last week constitute a magnificent outcome for the bush. Let me come to some of the specifics. Road transport costs have been slashed by around $1 billion a year - a thousand million dollars a year. Rail transport costs have been slashed by an estimated $160 million a year. All businesses will save 7c a litre on their diesel and petrol. In addition to that, the abolition of the wholesale sales tax mess that the opposition created and want to maintain will mean that trucking  and transport equipment will be cheaper to purchase and cheaper to operate. We will be cleaning up diesel and other engine technology in a way that makes a real contribution to environmental outcomes in our major cities where pollution is something of a problem. The outcome for all heavy vehicles of 20 tonnes or more will be a 23c a litre reduction in their excise, and in rural and regional areas that reduction will apply to all vehicles over 4½ tonnes loaded. In addition, we are looking at another $30 million a year for upgrading key freight roads and bridges, which will allow for a very significant increase in transport efficiencies across the nation.The benefits available now under the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme will be kept in full - although they will be known as diesel fuel credits - and will include bunker oil and light fuel oil. That has major benefits for our shipping industry. All diesel used off-road by primary producers stays excise free. Farmers do extremely well out of this. We are delivering all that we committed ourselves to - and then some over and above it. Marine users such as ferries and charter boats get the full credit; so will bush nursing homes, hospitals, aged people's homes, and so forth. We are providing incentives for the use of alternative fuels like natural gas.The interesting thing about this is that the ALP says in its reincarnated form that it cares about rural and regional Australia. These specific initiatives deliver a huge benefit to rural and regional Australia. Remember that the bush is all about exports. These measures constitute a $4½ billion reduction in the cost of exporting Australian goods and services. That is more jobs and more prosperity for the bush.I would have thought that it would be a remarkable day in Australia for us to have negotiated outcomes on something as important as this when the ALP is totally absent from the debate. They are absent without leave. They are just not present. They are out to lunch. The member for Dickson has, I know, been having an exhausting time getting to understand what the bush is all about and what regional services and regional needs are  all about. As yet we are still waiting for so much as a sleepy comment on it.</DOC>

 - I was asked this question by Peter Charlton on television yesterday. If the question had not been handed across by the tactics committee I do not think the member for Hunter would have asked it, because it was fully answered. As we said at the time on Friday and as I said in answer to Peter Charlton's question on channel Ten's Meet the Press  with Paul Bongiorno yesterday morning, all trucks above 20 tonnes will receive a diesel fuel rebate back to a user charge of 20c per litre. The reason for that is that it is assumed that if you are above 20 tonnes you are involved in long-line haulage.One might well ask: what does the Labor Party rebate back for trucks? The answer is nothing. We get a member who is defending a policy of no rebates standing up and complaining that we are only giving rebates to rural and regional Australia. That is your position. We give it to all large trucks because it is assumed that they are involved in long-line haulage and trucks of 4.5 tonnes to 20 tonnes also get the rebate if they are engaged in rural and regional transport. You ask a question obviously implying a negative. What is your policy? No rebate. No rebate anywhere. That is your actual policy. For somebody who believes there should not be a rebate at all to get up and complain that we are only giving a rebate of 20c to rural and regional Australia is not a terribly consistent policy. It is always worth asking the questions committee what answer they want when they give you the question.Rural and regional Australia is defined as those areas that are outside mainland capital cities or conurbations. The conurbations are as defined in relation to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. The reason for that was that we wanted to make sure that we got additional benefits to rural and regional Australia. We acknowledged a point that was made by the Australian Democrats that they wanted to keep fumes and emissions down in capital cities, large cities and large conurbations. That is the agreement that we have reached to protect rural and regional Australia, help the trucking industry and reduce diesel excise. - The member for Hotham says, `Another dud; another dud' when we have got diesel excise back to 20c and he wants to tax it at 43c.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. After the agreement with the Australian Democrats, health is a big winner under the GST. All mainstream medical services will be GST free; commonly used drugs from pharmacies will be GST free; preventative measures will be GST free; and some alternative therapies will be GST free. All professional relevant medical services provided by a doctor will not be subject to the GST; all hospital services - with a very limited number of exemptions - will be GST free; dental, physio, speech therapy, occupational therapy, podiatry, chiropractic, audiology, audiometry, osteopathy and speech pathology services will all be GST free.One change that we have made is to add traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and naturopathy to the list, and these will have a period of exemption to get registered under state regulations, which will be very much in the public's interest. All schedule 2, 3, 4 and 8 pharmaceutical drugs, plus the special  access scheme will be GST free. The change here is to add schedule 2 drugs to the list. Another change is that goods with a proven public health benefit such as condoms, folate tablets or sunscreen, will be GST free. The government is also making all first aid courses through charitable organisations and ambulance services GST free. All up, this will mean about a 1.8 per cent reduction in health costs. It will mean there are 18 million winners in health from the GST.</DOC>

The reality, if only the spokesman opposite knew it, is that the overwhelming bulk of truck operators -  - The overwhelming bulk of truck operators in this country keep logbooks anyway.

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Of course, as part of the historic agreement that was reached last week between the government and the Australian Democrats to move Australia into the next century as far as the Australian taxation system is concerned, the revised package not only delivers on all the commitments to rural and regional Australia but also includes major benefits for the environment, both in terms of improving air quality in our major cities and in helping cut the growth of greenhouse gas emissions across Australia.Some of the programs included in the agreement include funds to assist in the conversion of commercial vehicles to LPG, a program to provide rebates to households of up to half of the cost of solar power systems, a program to assist in the commercialisation of renewable energy technology and a program of grants to assist people in remote areas to convert from diesel power generators to renewable energy resources. Also included in the revised tax package are major commitments to reducing urban air pollution through measures such as moves to accelerate the introduction of low-sulfur diesel, bringing forward the introduction of new diesel and petrol vehicle fuel standards to bring them in line with international standards, maintaining the price relativities between diesel and compressed natural gas, providing subsidies to accelerate the conversion of buses and other suitable vehicles to LPG and, most importantly, providing rail with a full excise credit to maintain its competitive position.It should be noted that the measure which has been included in this revised package for rail means a $2 a tonne reduction in the freight of grain across Australia, a significant benefit to rural Australia. These measures will have a dramatic impact on improving air quality across Australia. At the same time, we will be delivering in spades on our commitment of providing real benefits to the communities of rural and regional Australia - a far cry from what the Labor Party has been trying to achieve in opposing these measures. I finish my answer by quoting the editorial out of the Daily Telegraph on Saturday which said: A wave of maturity and responsible decision-making swept our national administration last night and Australia will be substantially better for it.. . .              . . .             . . .It is easy to count the real winners of last night's breakthrough in mature and constructive carriage of national affairs.There are 18 million of them - Eighteen million winners, and that decision making was undertaken in a mature and responsible way that excluded the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - In a sense, the honourable member has answered her previous question. It may be that with alternative technologies, such as intelligent transport systems, the trucking industry will be able to provide a modern alternative to logbooks. We are not going to play Big Brother; we are going to work cooperatively. Not only do the Labor Party not want any rebates but they want us to play Big Brother! We have said that, because the trucking industry is already engaged in developing new technologies, we will underwrite a trial of intelligent trucking systems. If in the future that becomes a mechanism by which the industry were able to say to us, `We can develop a more effective, more cost efficient, more user friendly approach to the verification of activities for the purposes of claiming rebates,' I cannot see why in the name of good fortune we would stand in the way of it. But it does not have to be the only way.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question, and I particularly appreciate her interest - which I think reflects the interest of just about all Australians - in the fate of Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace. Like all Australians, the government was angered by the conviction and sentencing of Pratt and Wallace in a Yugoslav court in the last few days. The decision of the court to acquit the original charges against Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace and then to convict them on a separate charge we regard as quite unacceptable. I have said on many occasions, and I think the House realises this, that these two men are innocent men; they are aid workers. We would like the government of President Milosevic, and President Milosevic himself, to treat these two aid workers with at least the humanity with which the aid workers have been treating the people of Yugoslavia; and that is not asking too much.Today I called in the Yugoslav ambassador to reinforce to the Yugoslav government that the Australian government regards the decision by the court as unacceptable and that we would like President Milosevic to exercise an act of clemency and allow the two aid workers to be released. The alternative is that the defence for the two aid workers will appeal the decision of the court and, obviously, in that circumstance, we would hope that the appeal would be upheld.Can I say in conclusion - and I am sure this reflects the view of all members of this House - that our thoughts and our prayers are very much with not just Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace but their families. This is an extraordinarily difficult time for their families, and I must say that I think the families of both men have shown very great courage and very great decency during this difficult time. And they know that not only the Australian people but the Australian government - and, I am sure, all members of this House - are behind them and that we will do everything we possibly can to get justice for Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace and have them released.</DOC>

 - Hardly any of that is true, and it really would be worth while for the Leader of the Opposition - he is engaging in conversation, Mr Speaker, and is not interested in my reply -  -  - to do at least half an hour's homework to understand Commonwealth-state relations. The Leader of the Opposition makes statements like, `This is no longer a growth tax.' Of course it is a growth tax. He makes statements that the states will be worse off. The states will not be worse off. -  - Yelling interjections does not change facts. - Let us make this point clearly: the Leader of the Opposition, on the one hand, wants to get up here and say, `The poor states, they are not getting a growth tax.' On the other hand, he wants to oppose GST. - `Absolutely,' someone says. So what is the growth tax that the states get out of wholesales sales tax? There is none. The Australian Labor Party want to stand here and attack the government as if their policy does not produce problems - and more so. The Australian Labor Party's position is no growth tax for the states. So what would you think the Leader of the Opposition would get up here and ask? He would ask in a question, `Why aren't the states getting a growth tax?' That is your policy: not to give them a growth tax. It is bad enough to have to explain our policy to him; we have to explain his own policy to him in this House.Because the revenue base - the growth tax - does not have all food in it any more, there is a revenue hole of about $3 billion which is being made up totally by the Commonwealth resuming funding for local government - something which local government has sought incidentally - which is made up by states deferring for six months the abolition of FID and which is made up by the states deferring until 2005 the abolition of BAD tax. So they keep their own revenue base, the Commonwealth relieves them of the obligation to fund local government and the Commonwealth says in relation to the balance that it makes up the difference off its own balance sheet, which is why there is a cost on the Commonwealth's own balance sheet. The one group of people that is not worse off as a result of these modifications is the states. - I will go and tell them. - And I will speak to the Tasmanian Treasurer - somebody who was only too keen to put his signature on the deal for GST. Half an hour of disciplined thinking  and work would have revealed all of that to you and the question would have been unnecessary. It would be worth while for him to invest half an hour to try to come to grips with the facts.</DOC>

 - I have some good news for the House. We all like to hear the thud of a morning newspaper hitting our door. The government made a commitment in 1996 that it would guarantee home delivery. For 24 years, there has been uncertainty for the newsagency industry in the light of the operation of the Trade Practices Act. After six months of extensive consultations involving representatives of Australia's four and a half thousand newsagents and 25,000 subagents, and the country's major publishers, including News Ltd, PBL and various other publishers, we have come to an agreement for a course forward that has won the widespread approval of the Australian Newsagents Federation. In fact, yesterday I went to Surfers Paradise to speak with the Australian Newsagents Federation about the proposals put forward. The Australian Newsagents Federation have embraced the proposal that gives them control of the future of their own industry.Essentially, it is about the publishers offering contracts to individual newsagents for periods of between three to five years. Those contracts are guaranteed for three areas and make up three separate subcontracts. The first area relates to retail distribution, the second area relates to distribution to subagents, and the third area relates to delivery to households. Individual newsagents, under some of the proposals from some of the publishers, will be able to trade amongst themselves individual components of their contracts. Therefore, if a newsagent wants to specialise in home delivery, that newsagent is able to purchase another newsagent's home delivery service and thereby provide guarantees. To  ensure that, in areas where there is only one newsagent - particularly regional and rural Australia - home delivery continues, newsagents will not be able to trade the home delivery service to someone else. They must continue to guarantee home delivery.This important initiative brings an end to the uncertainty that has been hitting the newsagency industry for far too long. The greatest challenge to the newsagent industry is technology and how it is going to impact on their businesses, and also the uncertainty of the Trade Practices Act. Now they are given three to five years guaranteed distribution rights associated with each publisher. That is welcomed by the newsagency industry, it is welcomed by the publishers, and it is welcomed by the subagents. We look forward to a new and prosperous future ahead for Australian newsagents.</DOC>

 - I am very pleased to inform the House, in response to the honourable member for Bradfield, that the five principles the government set for tax reform in August of 1997 have been met. It is worth taking a moment to remind the House of those five principles. - The first objective that I set for the government in August 1997 was that there should be no increase in the overall taxation burden. I am happy to report to the House that that commitment has been met in full. I remind the House that since this government has been in office there have been no increases in personal income tax, there have been no increases in company taxation, there have been no increases in indirect taxation. There has been a conversion of a $10½ billion budget deficit into the healthiest surpluses that this country has had for decades.The next commitment that I made to the Australian people was that any new taxation system should involve major reductions in personal income tax, with special regard for the taxation treatment of families. I am happy to report that, under the arrangements announced on Friday, there will be a $12 billion reduction in the level of personal income tax in this country. It involves, I say again, 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers having a top marginal rate of no more than 30c in the dollar.The income tax scales that we inherited provided for a 34c rate. This was the Beazley rate scale. It was 34 cents in the dollar from $20,700 to $38,000. At $38,001 it became 43 cents in the dollar and it remained 43 cents in the dollar until $50,000. Under the rate scales  that have now been locked in, 80 per cent of Australians, whose incomes lie below $50,000, will pay no higher a rate than 30 cents in the dollar. That means that you can pass from $20,000 to $50,000 without going into a higher tax bracket. There has never been incentive for middle Australia remotely approaching that proposition.I go on to remind the parliament that in addition to the $12 billion reduction in personal income tax there are $2 billion of family taxation benefits. That fulfils the commitment that I made that we would reduce the personal income tax scales, which of course in themselves give great benefits to Australian families. But on top of that you have got $2 billion of additional family benefits, which recognise the cost incurred by Australian taxpayers in raising Australian children. So that is a $14 billion injection into the pockets of Australian families and Australian taxpayers. When you put it on top of the $320 a month that they are better off as a result of interest rate reductions and when you bear in mind that Australians' real incomes have risen - because we have higher productivity built on the back of low inflation - you have a wealth situation and a disposable income situation the Australian people have not seen for years.The third promise I made was that consideration would be given to a broad based indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes - and of course that will happen. I remind the House that the hated, dreaded, complicated wholesale sales tax, the one that Labor increased without compensation in 1993, will go in full on 1 July next year. It is part of the agreement. I have very good news for the Australian people: no longer after 1 July next year will any future government of Australia be able to do what the Keating-Beazley government did in 1993, and that is increase the wholesale sales tax without giving the Australian people compensation.The fourth promise that I made to the Australian people was that there would be appropriate compensation for those deserving of special assistance. As the Treasurer pointed out, we have not only maintained the compen  sation - we had compensated for our changes; you did not compensate for your 1993 changes - but we have also significantly increased it. Finally, we have brought about - in fulfilment of the promise I made to the Australian people in August of 1997 - fundamental reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations. We have given the states access to a growth tax. We have restructured Commonwealth-state financial relations in a quite dramatic and enduring fashion.May I say in conclusion what I said to the Australian people last Friday: that the negotiations conducted by the government with the Australian Democrats were conducted in an open and candid fashion. I want to record in this parliament my appreciation for the constructive attitude that was adopted by the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Lees. I want to say to her that, unlike the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Australian Democrats put the national interest first. The Leader of the Australian Democrats declined to join the Leader of the Opposition in the grandstand and watch the game go on; she got on the field, she became a participant and as a result of she achieved outcomes.It will ever be to the shame of the Australian Labor Party that on this great issue of economic reform the Labor Party has done no more than huff and puff and say no instead of participating in the debate, instead of doing what Senator Lees did; and that is to say, `We don't agree with a lot of your policies but we are prepared to be a participant. We know this country needs taxation reform and we know that the only way you can achieve taxation reform is to treat with the government that is in power.'The Australian Democrats entered into an arrangement with my government. That arrangement will be honoured in full. It was an arrangement that I believe will be to the enduring benefit of the Australian people. It will deliver significant improvements in relation to air pollution, which is a matter of major concern in the Australian cities. It has delivered a better outcome to the bush. It has resulted in a strengthening of what was still a fundamentally very fair and generous compensation arrangement. It has underwrit  ten the provision after 1 July next year of taxation scales that will give the greatest burst of incentive to middle Australia of any taxation scales that this country has seen. In other words, the Australian Democrats have put their hands up for the national interest; the Labor Party, to its shame, has skulked away into the grandstand and it deserves to be condemned by the Australian people. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - The definition as read out is the definition which has been put forward by the Australian Democrats and has been agreed with the government in relation to those matters. The thing I find quite surprising, however, is that the Australian Labor Party apparently is now not interested in definitions and yet its own tax system has definitions like the following: the kitchen sink, taxable at 12 per cent. The Labor Party has definitions of moveable toilet pans. - As I said, the definition was the definition that was put forward by the Australian Democrats and agreed with the government. I find it passing strange that a party which exults in definitions should now be worried about them. Under Labor's tax system, moveable toilet pans are defined and taxed, as are seats and covers for moveable toilet pans and goods ordinarily used for toilet pans - which proves how hypocritical they are.</DOC>

 - Today's balance of payments for the March quarter show a current account deficit of $8.9 billion - around six per cent of GDP, as I forecast yesterday. Of course, it is substantially better than the worst current accounts on record, which were: in 1985-86 at 6.5 per cent of GDP, in 1989-90 at 6.6 per cent of GDP and in 1994-95 at 6.6 per cent of GDP. As forecast yesterday, touching six per cent of GDP in this quarter is consistent with the budget forecast of 5½ per cent throughout the year, and indeed the forecast would imply a similar amount in the June quarter with the current account deficit abating somewhat in the next financial year as the export situation picks up. The trade deficit is principally a result of exports which have been static, principally as a result of low prices amongst our trading partners, while the domestic economy has remained strong. As a result imports have risen.Today's current account deficit also shows foreign debt stabilising at around 41 per cent of GDP, and the measure of the cost of servicing net foreign debt at 9.6 per cent is the lowest since September 1984. Notwithstanding that, of course there is no room for complacency in relation to the current account deficit. The current account deficit is high for reasons associated with the external downturn, over which Australia has no control, but it underscores the importance of running a strong economic policy and maintaining confidence in the Australian economy. That has been aided of course by the low inflation and low interest rate policies of the government. For example, when the 1985-86 current account deficit blew out under Labor to 6.5 per cent of GDP, inflation was over nine per cent and variable mortgage interest rates were at 13.5 per cent. Obviously that was placing grave pressure on the Australian economy.In 1989-90 when the deficit blew out to 6.6 per cent of GDP under Labor, inflation was at 8.6 per cent and home variable mortgage interest rates at 17 per cent. In 1994-95, when the current account deficit blew out to 6.6 per cent, inflation was at 3.9 per cent and home mortgage interest rates at 10.5 per cent. Obviously, if you have a situation as we do now, with inflation at 1.2 per cent, home variable mortgage rates at 6.5 per cent and a budget in surplus, you are in a much stronger position to cope with a current account deficit. Nonetheless, this illustrates the importance of good strong economic policy. Just as it was this government's economic policy three years ago to put the budget in surplus - fought all the way by Labor - that strengthened our economy at the time that we most needed it, so too it is the economic reforms of today which will strengthen our economy for the challenges of tomorrow. Those are the reforms which the government intends to put in place.</DOC>

 - As has been made clear by the government's historic agreement with the Australian Democrats, in relation to the definitions of food as put forward by the Australian Democrats, the government agrees with the design principles and has offered to consult with the Australian Democrats to improve them should they so wish. There was a level of irony in that question. Irons, of course, are taxable by the Australian Labor Party at 22 per cent - one of the Australian Labor Party's hidden taxes which will be swept away by this government - just as the Australian Labor Party taxes moveable toilet seats at 12 per cent, and toothpaste but not toothbrushes under the modern Australian Labor Party system which is followed by the countries of Botswana and Swaziland and the economic genii of the Labor Party frontbench.</DOC>

 - One of the many things that the Labor Party is against is a real increase of two per cent in the pension for the retired people of Australia, because one of the important compensation elements in the government's tax package is a real increase in the pension of two per cent, over and above any GST effects. The situation remains that pensions will be increased by four per cent up-front on 1 July 2000. However, the compensation will be revised to provide a two per cent real increase in pensions rather than the 1½ per cent under the original proposal. We will do this by paying the full four per cent  on top of the existing legislative requirement to maintain pensions at no less than 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. And I take the opportunity of reminding the House that it was the coalition government that first legislated to provide that pensions would always be at least 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings.In addition, I am very pleased to say to the self-funded retired people of Australia that the supplementary savings bonus, originally provided for people 60 years and over, will now be available to self-funded retirees at the age of 55. That means that self-funded retirees over 55 on 1 July will receive a savings bonus of up to $2,000. The Labor Party, by voting against this plan, is not only going to oppose a two per cent real increase in the pension but also going to oppose a payment to self-funded retirees 55 years and over of $2,000 by way of a savings supplement on 1 July 2000.I finish my answer to the honourable member for Moreton by reminding him and reminding the parliament that the overriding reason why the government has decided to reform the taxation system is that it will deliver major economic benefits to the entire Australian nation. All the debate about the impact of the package on this or that section of the community, important though it is, is subsidiary to the national economic benefit. The national economic benefit of this plan is undeniable. Australia will be a stronger country; Australia will be a richer country; Australia will generate more jobs; Australia will export better; Australians will receive more incentive through the taxation system. We will sweep away an old-fashioned unworkable taxation system and we will replace it with a taxation system that will give to 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers a level of incentive that they have never enjoyed under any previous Australian government.The commitment of all members of the government to this plan is based upon our commitment to the national economic benefit. It is for the sake of Australia's aggregate economic benefit that we make this reform, and it is because of that that we are determined to implement in full the agreement  concluded between the Treasurer and me and the Australian Democrats last Friday.</DOC>

As long as they are amused in opposition, we are happy - making their little phone calls to Meg, trying to break up the deal, an irrelevant political party ringing up complaining about `Dr Pergola'. - The one thing we can say about the Democrat proposal -  - No. I am sorry, you asked me, as your question will show, about a Democrat proposal. That was your question. The one thing you can say about the Democrats is that they are much more economically responsible than the Labor Party. Talk about fairies at the bottom of the garden! These are gnomes and wizards running around the bottom of the garden. - No, Mr Speaker. - The question I was asked was patently a stunt, with a prop. We answer it in the spirit in which it was given. This gnome on steroids here is running around making all of these points. - The one thing you can say about this system is that it is much simpler than the Australian Labor Party's system of taxes of 12, 22, 32, 41, 45 and 47 per cent.</DOC>

 - The government plans to introduce the largest income tax cut in Australia's history. Let the record show that the Australian Labor Party opposes income tax cuts for middle Australia. The Australian Labor Party huffs and it puffs, but the truth of the matter is that the Australian Labor Party has two objectives: the first is to retain the outdated wholesale sales tax, which has multiple rates and classifications - something that it never advertises - and the second is to deny middle Australia income tax cuts. Under the government's plan, middle Australia - everybody earning up to $50,000 - will pay a marginal tax rate no higher than 30 per cent.When the national wage case came out recently, I heard the Leader of the Opposition remark that a $12 increase would be clawed back by tax and the withdrawal of family allowances. The truth of the matter is that under the current tax system, Labor's tax system, a $12 a week increase on an income of $510 per week, which is what was awarded by the national wage case, would mean that  a single income family with dependent children would lose 50 per cent of the $12 under the clawback of family allowance - because for each additional dollar under Labor rules you lose 50c of family allowance - and 35.5 per cent under Labor's marginal tax rate of 34c.Under the Labor Party tax system, the national wage increase, which awarded a $12 per week increase up to an annual income of $26,590, would leave a single income family with dependent children net gaining, out of that $12, $1.74. That is the Labor Party tax system. Under the government's tax system, which Labor opposes, because we increase the test for family allowance and change the taper rates, the $12 leads to no loss of family allowance and the top marginal rate of the middle income earner is 31.5 per cent, which is a 30 per cent tax rate plus the 1.5 per cent Medicare levy. Under the coalition's tax plan, the $12 a week increase for somebody on an income of $510 per week would lead to a take-home pay, out of that $12, of $8.22 compared to Labor's $1.74 - a difference of $6.48.No wonder the Labor Party is going to such great lengths to try to cover up what its real objectives in relation to tax are. Why is it that the Labor Party is so desperately ringing up the Democrats to try to prevent the Democrats from voting tax reform through the Senate? If the Australian Labor Party thought tax reform was such a bad idea, why would it be ringing up the Democrats asking them not to put it through the Senate? Because the Australian Labor Party knows that, once middle income earners see the difference between Labor Party tax and family allowance differences and what would occur under a new tax system, they would wonder why they had been robbed blind by Labor for so long. That is the truth of the matter. Under the tax changes which this government wants to put in place - greater family allowances and reductions in income tax cuts - it is no wonder it is fighting so hard ringing up those Democrat offices because the last thing it wants is for that to go through and for the Australian public to realise how much Labor was steal  ing from them and how much better things can get under tax reform.</DOC>

 - Of course I have seen the comments of the Leader of the Australian Democrats and the principles that they have put forward in their amendments. As the government has said, we are prepared to consult in relation to them within the principles that have been laid down, and if we can be of assistance in drawing the legislation we will. The thing that constantly amazes me is how the Australian Labor Party has suddenly discovered an interest in classifications. The Australian Labor Party was in office for 13 years and operated a system where chocolate-coated peanuts were taxable -  - I was making the point that, under differential rates of indirect tax, you have multitudes of classifications - a point that never seems to have worried the Australian Labor Party in the past. They were quite happy to preside over a system where chocolate-coated peanuts were taxable and chocolate-coated frozen bananas were exempt. - `What's this got to do with chooks?' he says. - I am talking about classifications. The member for Hotham yells rhetorically, `What's this got to do with chooks?' What it has got to do with chooks is this: apparently the Labor Party thinks that if you put a chocolate-coated peanut on your chook it should be taxable, but if you put a chocolate frozen banana on your chook it should not be.I want to make one other point. Previously, I was talking about irons and I may have inadvertently told the House that an iron was taxable under Labor at 22 per cent. An iron is taxable only at 12 per cent under Labor. Unfortunately, their system is so complicated that even I was forced to make a mistake in explaining it.</DOC>

 - Let me begin by thanking the member for Mallee for his question. I want to pay tribute to the can-do attitude of the Leader of the Democrats who, unlike the Labor Party, recognised in tax reform the benefit for the national interest, for Australian exporters and for the future economic wherewithal of this country. The government continues to deliver the goods for those exporters in a tough trading environment. Now, more than ever, with many of our trading partners still in recession, Australian exporters need a boost along, and this is what the tax package will provide. Exports will be GST free in the most important economic reform for our exporters in over 15 years. There is no such thing as a level playing field. This package tilts the playing field in favour of jobs, additional exports and billions of dollars in cost reductions for agriculture, mining, manufacturing and service exports with the removal of the wholesale sales tax and the other improvements it contains. It is a win-win-win situation: exporters, consumers, the environment and, above all, families, with a $12 billion tax cut. It is time to give a bit of extra detail. -  - I am pleased to inform coalition members, because I know they are interested, even if you are not, that the complete removal of diesel fuel excise from the operation of rail is a huge breakthrough for our exporters. For Queensland, there is $35 million of benefits; for New South Wales, $45 million of benefits; for Victoria, $21 million of benefits to VicRail; for Tasmania and South Australia combined, $9 million of benefits; and for Western Australia, for Westrail, $15 million of benefits. - Interstate, $40 million. The total for rail -  -  - Oh, so the shadow minister for regional services -  - is opposed -  - Is opposed to the abolition -  - Opposed to the abolition of diesel fuel excise on rail. You are a disgrace to your shadow portfolio. - It is difficult to be a disgrace to your shadow portfolio, but you are. - The total figure for rail is $165 million - long overdue, a very big boost. An additional $30 million for the road bridges that John Anderson and others have helped secure will also help. The other arrangements stay in place, but there will also be $60 million a year to help states convert diesel power generation systems to renewable energy systems in remote Australia, where it counts, where we have the interests of people at heart. King Canute over here can object to all of this, but we are getting on with the job of delivery. When the history book is written about this period, it will be recorded that there was a splash of colour from the opposition for a fortnight, while the government got on and delivered for our exporters. - </DOC>

 - The legislation will be made public after it has been drawn and agreed with the Australian Democrats. The agreement between the government and the Australian Democrats, which has been set out and put in writing, reads as follows:The precise definition . . . will be finalised after consultation with the Australian Democrats, to ensure that it meets the design principles . . . The design principles have been put out. The principles that the Australian Democrats sought from the government, and the government agreed to, were that the tax would apply to takeaways and that the tax would apply, as it currently does, to things like confectionery, biscuits, taxable beverages and ice-creams. I know the Australian Labor Party picks up on all of these definitions and refers to their complexity, but these are things currently defined in the wholesale sales tax act. So, if they are critical of the complexity, they are critical of their own system. That is a point I keep coming back to.Another point I keep coming back to is that one of the advantages of getting rid of Labor's discredited wholesale sales tax is that it has rates of 12, 22, 32, 37, 41 and 45 per cent. You would be getting rid of five rates, so even if you were to apply it to the existing definition with one rate it is a reduction in complexity to one-fifth. Then you would apply it on a broad base and get rid of many of the ridiculous definitions that Labor insists on. Here is the Labor Party in its bill defining moveable toilet pans. That is the kind of tax system it defends. The Labor Party gets up here at the dispatch box and wants to go into definitions, but the definitions the Labor Party is insisting on are the most complicated  definitions imaginable. As I said earlier, the design principles are there. The government will be releasing the legislation after it has gone through the process, in accordance with the agreement.</DOC>

 - The answer to the latter question is no, I am not, but let me move to the former, the one of substance that was put before me. It is worth recalling, as rural and regional Australians do, that the team opposite have something that could loosely be called form in relation to tax reform. You would do well to look at what they have done as opposed to what they say in relation to tax reform and go back to the time before the 1993 election when we were told consistently that there was no need for a GST, that they could implement tax cuts and avoid the need for any new taxes. But we found out afterwards, to the great cost of rural and regional Australians, that not only could those opposite not deliver on their proposed tax cuts, not only did they have to raise wholesale sales taxes and fuel taxes - both of which fall disproportionately heavily on rural and regional Australians - but they still could not balance the books. We went on running up our national debt to the extraordinary cost, again, of people in rural and regional areas because of the impact that it had on everything from inflation through to interest rates.We are pursuing tax reform that by any definition, by any understanding of the needs of rural and regional Australia, is desperately needed. It is worth recapping the things that have been said here. Our proposals slash over $1 billion from transport costs in this country. They reduce the level of excise on rail by $160 million a year of real value to exporters such as the grains industry. All businesses say  it will reduce the sales tax on the purchase of their transport equipment and on the parts and so forth that go to maintaining it. There is a whole range of other benefits that have been well recognised.I notice that the trucking industry have made the observation that rural and regional communities will receive a very real benefit. They congratulate the Howard government on its diesel excise announcements. They go on to say that we have been able to deliver a positive outcome in relation to reducing Australia's transport costs and point out that 80 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports emanate from regional Australia and that these reforms will make a very real difference in that area. It is worth contemplating that, if you live in central or western Queensland and you operate a grazing exercise, fully a third of your operating costs are made up of transport costs. This slashes the cost of transport. As the NFF has said, it absolutely slashes unfair tax on distance, which has affected rural Australia so much for so long.That we have been able to achieve this at the same time as we lock in very desirable environmental outcomes I think is something that we can be very proud of and that ought to be supported. Greg Bourne from BP Australia said that the measures contained in the package represent the most comprehensive emissions reduction package announced in Australia, that it is a bold but necessary step for Australia to take and that good policy produces excellent economic outcomes and very sound environmental outcomes. This is something that the Labor Party was never able to achieve in 13 years of government. It is about time that we saw an end to the carping and a willingness to engage in constructive policy debate.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, as I -  -  - I know Labor tax dog food at 22 per cent. Apparently they are now concerned about classification problems, but the Labor Party have been blithely taxing dog food at 22 per cent for a long period of time. But, as I have said on a number of occasions, the principle that the government has agreed to with the Australian Democrats is that food for human consumption, as a general principle, will be GST free. Of course GST free means that you get back all embedded taxes. And I make this point: under Labor's wholesale sales tax system, there is no food that is WST free - none whatsoever. You have embedded WST in all food. Over 13 years the Australian Labor Party never made anything WST free.And then there are carve-outs - much the same as the carve-outs that operate under the Labor Party's WST system - in relation to confectionery, snack products, ice-creams, biscuits and taxable beverages. The objective in relation to that is quite plain. The Australian Democrats would not pass the government's tax reform plan unless food was GST free. The government took the view that 85 per cent of tax reform was better than zero tax reform. But I make this point: what are the Labor Party fighting for when they fight against tax reform? You are fighting for classifications, you are fighting for an indirect tax which has rates of zero, 12, 22, 32, 37, 41, 45. The Labor Party are the kings of classification and, like yesterday, to stand here and say, `Oh, not all trucks are getting diesel fuel rebates,' when the Labor Party policy is no trucks should get a diesel fuel rebate, and to stand here today and say, `Oh, look at these classification problems,' when the Labor Party wants to keep classifications, I have seen hypocrisy in my time -  - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question and for his longstanding dedication to improving educational opportunity for young Australians. The tax reform package that the government is introducing is going to deliver benefits to the whole Australian community. But one of its very great benefits will be that it will make education more affordable to Australia's families, and it is quite clear that the Labor Party does not want this to happen. Under the government's tax reform package, tuition of course will generally be GST free. There will be no GST on school fees. Of course, any school that incurs costs, and every school is incurring costs at the moment -  - The Labor Party supports a tax system which imposes a 22 per cent tax on many of the items that families have to pay for in the course of mounting their children's education. Amongst these are computers, one of the most expensive items, taxed by the Labor Party at 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. That will come down significantly. The price of computers will be down significantly under the government's tax reform package. Of course, benefits to students will be increased by the tax reform package. The youth allowance, the assistance for isolated children, the Australian postgraduate awards and other income support for students will go up four per cent. The Labor Party does not want this benefit to flow through to students.The Labor Party also opposes of course the biggest income tax reduction for Australian families in Australia's history. The average family sending its children to school will be some $40 to $50 per week better off as a result of this package after any price effect from the goods and services tax. So what this package is about is making education more affordable. The actual delivery of education through schools will be some $720 million less over three years than it is under the current arrangements, the arrangements which the Labor Party supports. So what the government has put forward is a tax package which is in Australia's national interest. It is in the interests of Australian families, and the great thing that distinguishes the Australian Democrats from the Australian Labor Party is that they have been prepared to put the national interest first.</DOC>

 - I am glad the Leader of the Opposition asked me about Charlie Bell because I have had a conversation with Charlie Bell about this particular proposal and he certainly did not tell me that they were going to lose 21,000 jobs. I say in response to the Leader of the Opposition that once again he has failed the challenge of national leadership on an important issue of national  interest. We saw it from the beginning of question time yesterday: there was no attempt by the Leader of the Opposition to seize the moment and get a decent debate about taxation reform. All the Leader of the Opposition could do was to try to niggle away at the periphery instead of advancing a decent argument for an alternative tax reform scheme. - Having responded to the very point the Leader of the Opposition made about McDonald's, I now turn to the generic issue of taxation reform. The Leader of the Opposition has now had more than three years to devise a decent alternative taxation policy, but the Leader of the Opposition has been left absolutely stranded in the grandstand of Australian political contest regarding taxation policy. The Australian Democrats have effectively replaced the Labor Party as the real opposition in Australia. The Australian Democrats have enhanced their position. The Australian Democrats have significantly enhanced their position.It was open to the Australian Labor Party to play a constructive role in the taxation debate in this country, but the Labor Party has failed to do it. The Labor Party has essentially huffed and puffed and said no. The Labor Party has not adopted an alternative policy. The Labor Party has failed the national interest test. We advanced taxation reform at the last election in the national interest. We fought for tax reform in difficult circumstances because we believed that tax reform would strengthen the Australian economy. We continue to fight for taxation reform and we have entered into an arrangement with the Australian Democrats to pass our plan with amendments meeting the concerns they have, recognising that if you are to compromise to get something through the parliament you  cannot get everything you originally set out to do.The difference between the Liberal Party, the National Party, the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party on this issue is that we have been prepared to do something for the national interest whereas the Australian Labor Party has simply stood there and endeavoured at every single turn to niggle away at the periphery, to micro-analyse something, but all the while to ignore the national interest.You may get a few cheap laughs at question time, but out there the Australian public are saying that you are failing the test of an alternative government. Out there the Australian public are saying, `Can't we, on an important issue, have a meeting of minds between the political leadership of the nation?' The reaction I have had since last Friday is that the Australian public applaud the fact that the leader of the government and the Australian Democrats are prepared to get together to sink their differences in the national interest. I say to those who sit opposite: you can have your penn'orth of fun at question time, but when the true significance of this debate sinks in, when the Australian people reflect and realise that you have been into negativity, point scoring and niggling away but you have failed to present an alternative plan, the lasting judgment of you will be totally negative and totally condemnatory.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question and for his interest in self-funded retirees, a group in our society who always felt left out during the 13 years under Labor because Labor never cared about those people who put aside and often went without during their working careers so that they could fund their own retirement. Under this government, self-funded retirees have enjoyed considerable benefits and they will also share in the social bonus that comes  from this tax reform package. Self-funded retirees will also benefit from tax reform.As the Prime Minister mentioned earlier, there is a new supplementary bonus for self-funded retirees as a part of the system. This will mean up to $2,000 per person to match dollar for dollar the income that they receive from their savings and investments. In addition, the government will ease the assets and the income tests for eligibility for the age pension. That means that couples with incomes up to $48,000 will become eligible for a part pension for the first time. That is a very significant benefit for, we estimate, around 45,000 extra self-funded retirees.On Friday the government announced that the bonus would be extended to people aged 55 years and over. Treasury estimates that this measure could benefit up to 200,000 extra self-funded retirees. Those are very real extra benefits available for the self-funded retired population in Australia. These benefits will phase out at incomes around $30,000 a year, but by that level these people will be enjoying the new income tax cuts, over $12 billion worth of income tax cuts which will be shared also by self-funded retirees. In addition to the extension of the seniors health card to self-funded retirees, many self-funded retirees will benefit from the 30 per cent subsidy on health insurance premiums, the new fund concessions for long-term memberships and a whole raft of measures to ensure that self-funded retirees are no longer the forgotten people. They are important beneficiaries of these new taxation measures, the new taxation reform for all Australians.</DOC>

 - The first point that has to be established, of course, is that at the moment none of them get any benefit from any rebate at all. We have in place the remains of a taxation regime which sees us in one of the biggest continents in the world with an economy dependent on exports taxing transport fuels at amongst the highest rates in the world. We want to fix that. The first point I would make is that you could not find a comparable nation with comparable land mass to this one that taxes its transport fuels the way we do. For those transport operators who operate exclusively in regional and rural areas, of whom there are a huge number, this will not be an issue. That is point 1. Point 2 is that for those trucks over 20 tonnes loaded weight this will not be an issue either. Point 3 is that those that are over 4.5 tonnes loaded weight in rural and regional areas will be able to claim the rebate.I assume that this is a serious question, and I would like to make some observations about the way we are going in meeting the spirit of the arrangement that we have entered into with the Democrats. Firstly, `regional' would be defined as excluding all mainland capital cities except for Darwin and the large conurbations of Newcastle-Sydney-Wollongong, Melbourne-Geelong and the Gold Coast-Brisbane-Sunshine Coast regions. We are now giving careful consideration to the development of a scheme that delivers the objectives that we have negotiated with the Democrats. Arrangements for claiming diesel fuel credits will be finally determined after consultations, as I said yesterday, with industry and with the Democrats, with the objectives of simplifying record keeping, particularly for low volume operators, while limiting the scope for abuse.It has to be said that overwhelmingly we are talking about a set of arrangements that delivers huge benefits that you apparently are not prepared to entertain for rural and regional Australia in particular and the broader economy in general.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. No-one who makes the effort to have private health cover likes premium increases, but for 42 out of 44 health funds in Australia there has not been a premium increase since 1 March last year - a 15-month period that is unprecedented in recent times. Of the 44 funds in Australia, two increased their premiums earlier this year. That leaves 42. Of those 42, eight have decided not to have a premium increase this year and 34 will. Those 34 funds are having an average premium increase from today of 4.8 per cent. That is one of the lowest increases for at least the last five years. The honourable member asked why premiums are going up. -  - That also ties in to the interjection of the member for Melbourne, who might learn why premiums are going up. There are a number of things driving it. The first is new technology, the second is an ageing of the population, the third is community expectations and the fourth is a continuing shift from the treatment of private patients in public hospitals to private patients in private hospitals. Clearly the opposition has no understanding of the rate at which something like coronary artery stents are moving and how something like this affects prices.To put it all in some perspective, this country's biggest fund is having its premiums go up just under two per cent, 1.98 per cent, and half of fund members in Australia will pay four per cent or less by way of increase. If people are not happy with the increases in their funds, I suggest that they shop around and find one that is cheaper.</DOC>

 - We get asked a question about the current account deficit at 3.07 p.m. He has all these little mickey mouse props which he stands up here with, his little pasta and his plastic, and we get onto the real issues of the Australian economy at 3.07 - if I may say so, long after the question has already been answered. I will add one thing to my previous answer in relation to the current account deficit: the current account deficit will obviously be improved by boosting Australian exports. What more could you do for Australian exports than take $4.5 billion of taxes off them?Which political party says it wants a tax system which puts $4.5 billion of taxes on Australian exporters? The Australian Labor Party. What a shameful thing to do. The Australian Labor Party sits down here and says, `We're worried about the current account deficit - and, by the way, we would like to keep a tax system which puts $4.5 billion of taxes on our exports.' The Australian Labor Party will sit down here and say, `We're worried about diesel fuel for on road - but, by the way, we would like to keep 43c a litre.' The Australian Labor Party will sit down here and say, `We're worried about classifications - but we want an indirect tax system with nought, 12, 22, 32, 37, 41, and 45 per cent.' There have been some bad oppositions in this country, there have been some shockers, but this lot takes the cake!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question and acknowledge his interest in things environmental. Certainly, our government has good credentials in the environmental arena since being elected, with a number of significant and well-funded initiatives with regard to the environment. In the Prime Minister's statement in 1997, `Safeguarding the Future', he announced the establishment of the Australian Greenhouse Office - the first initiative of its kind in the world, with funding of $180 million to address the effects of climate change. The Greenhouse Office administers a number of programs to facilitate the expansion of the renewable energy industry and to promote the use of renewable energy.In the package which was put together by the government and the Democrats at the end of last week there was an agreement that will provide for further significant expansion of the renewable energy industry. For the first time ever in this country, a national scheme will be introduced to assist householders who install photovoltaic rooftop systems, with a grant of up to 50 per cent of the total cost to up to $5½ thousand per household. It is expected that at least 5,000 systems will be installed, saving 6½ thousand tonnes of CO2 per year. The Commonwealth will also introduce an investment program to the equivalent of the net effect of the GST on purchases of green power to assist the further commercialisation of that industry. The Commonwealth will also be providing financial assistance to the states to cross-subsidise remote power costs for domestic users by providing up to 50 per cent of the capital value of renewable remote area power systems.This program has enormous potential to replace existing diesel power plants and to further facilitate the expansion of this most important industry. The significance of the agreement that was established between this government and the Australian Democrats last week should be underlined. It will not only ensure that Australia has a modern taxation  system for the new century but strengthen our environmental credentials well into the future.</DOC>

 - The situation is that the heads of the treasuries of the various states and territories are meeting Mr Evans, the head of the Commonwealth Treasury, in Canberra today. At this stage I do not believe that a Premiers Conference is necessary. In the discussions I have had with premiers to date, I have indicated that, but of course the Commonwealth will keep the need for it under review. Quite frankly, I do not think at this stage a meeting of premiers is necessary because - and I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the opportunity to read from the document that was put out last Friday - as indicated in the agreement:In the Intergovernmental Agreement on the Reform of Commonwealth-State Financial Relations , the Commonwealth agreed to provide financial assistance to the States to cover any temporary shortfall in their budgets resulting from the implementation of tax reform. As a result of the proposed changes to the tax reform package, the Commonwealth will provide increased assistance to balance State and Territory budgets in the transitional years.The states are still major winners out of tax reform and, as my colleague the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out, the removal of the excise on diesel used in rail alone will deliver enormous benefits to state budgets. It will also deliver enormous benefits to the wheat growers of Australia. On this side of the House I have a large number of members who represent wheat growing electorates. We act to deliver benefits to the farmers of Australia.When my colleagues and I campaigned in the last election for the national interest and when we argued that we ought to have tax reform in the national interest, one of the principal elements of that argument for the national interest was an historic reform of the architecture of Commonwealth-state relations to give the states of Australia access to a growth tax. That goal was achieved in the tax plan. That goal remains undiminished by the agreement that was made last Friday.Just as the members of the Australian Labor Party are voting against a two per cent real increase for pensioners, if they vote against the revised plan the members of the Australian Labor Party are voting to deny to the states of Australia over the years ahead the resources to provide more for government schools, the resources to provide more for public hospitals, the resources to provide more for police services and the resources to provide more for roads. As I said last Thursday before the agreement was made, one of the strangest elements of this debate has been the criticism of tax reform by the welfare sector. Those in the welfare sector who condemn the government's plan are condemning a plan that will give a capacity to the states of Australia to provide welfare like none other that has been provided in the past, and that is another reason why this is a good deal for the states and another reason why it is in the national interest of Australia that this plan go through.</DOC>

 - A strong economy is very important for the small business sector. - A weak economy sees thousands of small businesses go broke, which they did when Labor was running the Australian economy. When our small businesses go broke, the disadvantaged, the unemployed, are the first people to bear the disadvantage of a mismanaged Australian economy. - That is why a policy which reforms the tax system, being in the national interest, is also of course in the interest of the small business community. - The fact is that a strong economy, therefore strong small business, is in the national interest. That is why for years and years the small business community have said, `It is time we had some genuine tax reform,' to fix up the tax system that they had under Labor. If you look at the package for small business, it reduces the tax burden on our business community, particularly on small businesses. That gives them a chance to grow and to prosper. It improves the cash flow for small business to ensure they are in a better financial position. We are getting rid of the wholesale sales tax, which is a massive burden on the small business community. You do not believe me? - You ought to believe me, because you once supported a GST. Your hypocrisy is there for all to see. In the Sydney Morning Herald  on the weekend it said:'The GST is also a very, very big [good] thing from a small business's point of view,' Mr Waddingham, who owns a paint shop, said.'We have a lot of products with a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax, and these are going to come down in price - that's about 40 per cent of the goods we sell.' - We also take the opportunity to take five systems of tax collection and bring them down to the one simpler system, the pay-as-you-go system - something the small business community again has called for for years. We are going to reduce income tax, the biggest income tax cut in Australia's history - not only good for small business but good for their customers; therefore, good for the economy as a whole. For all those small businesses out in rural and regional Australia: at long last a bit of relief for that area in respect of transport costs. We are finally turning back the tide to give those small businesses the fair deal that their counterparts in the city areas have. The losers in this whole debate are not the small business community; they are the Labor Party. That is why we see this campaign. As the Sydney Morning Herald  said only yesterday - this is the reality:The significant loser from the GST deal is the Labor Party, specifically its leader, Mr Beazley. For three years Labor has ditched the great economic reforms of the Hawke-Keating governments for a leftist populism that is associated with its prize recruit, Mrs Cheryl Kernot. The adamantine refusal to do anything else but launch attack after attack on the GST has led Labor into a dry policy gully. Mr Beazley now has to do the hard work of restoring the policy integrity of Labor or face the possibility that the few dissident Young Turks in the parliamentary party might usurp his position.In conclusion, this is very good for small business. I also say that it is a great testament to the Prime Minister and his leadership. It is a great testament, because he has long sup  ported the small business community, and in securing major reform we have introduced a reform which will be better for the small business community and the country as a whole.</DOC>

 - The states are, of course, completely protected under the government's tax arrangements. In fact, the Commonwealth has guaranteed that they will receive no less than the financial assistance grants, and they will be delivered a growth tax, something which the Labor Party opposes and something which the Labor Party would never be able to deliver because it has no growth tax that it could actually give to the states. - No wonder the Leader of the Opposition interjects. He has no proposal to give any growth tax to the states. That is the point. The silence means consent.The second point is that in relation to the surplus this government has made building Australia's budget back into surplus a cornerstone of its economic policy. The fact that we can talk about surpluses is an indication as to this government's economic direction. I  remind the Leader of the Opposition that he was a Minister for Finance in two budgets and he accumulated $23 billion of deficit - not one surplus, not one balance ever.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for that question. In answering it, let me inform the House that, according to the ABS national account figures released today, the Australian economy grew by 1.1 per cent in the March quarter to record through the year growth of 4.8 per cent. That is a stunning result and above all it is a great compliment to the hard work and the commitment of all of the Australian people because, when the economy grows, the people benefit. The people benefit through more jobs. The people benefit through stronger economic performance. The people benefit through higher labour productivity, which means real higher wages. The people benefit through lower inflation, which helps to deliver lower interest rates.The accounts show that inflation pressures remain very subdued while productivity grew very strongly, by 1.2 per cent in the quarter, to be 3½ per cent higher over the year. That is why wage and salary earners in this country, the workers of this country, are better off, because their real wages are higher. When you add high real wages to cuts in mortgage interest rates, you have a level of purchasing power which is to the enormous benefit of the Australian community.This is the first occasion for 30 years that the Australian economy has recorded through the year growth of four per cent for eight quarters in a row. The last time such an outcome was achieved was 30 years ago, from the June quarter of 1969 to the March quarter of 1971, when a coalition government was in power. This stunning result, which is of such benefit to the Australian people, has not occurred by accident. It has not occurred through stunts; it has not occurred through accident: it has occurred through the steady  application of sensible economic policy. It is worth recalling the words of the Reserve Bank Bulletin in May of this year, where it said:This combination of strong growth and exceptionally low inflation is quite unlike the experience of the preceding 30 years. That such a performance has been maintained almost two years after the Asian crisis first broke in Thailand is indicative of the extent to which the Australian economy's underlying strength and resilience have been improved over time.These changes have included better arrangements for macroeconomic management but also extensive improvements in the economy's structural features. In other words, what these figures reveal, what the Reserve Bank Bulletin  said, what this stunning performance measured against the record of the last 30 years tells us loudly and clearly, is that today's economic strength is a product of yesterday's policy resolve. Tomorrow's economic strength will not be the product of waving cans of soup around in front of television cameras but it will be the product of good policy, it will be the product of courageous leadership, it will be the product of a government that has a good Treasurer, that has the capacity to provide decent economic advice and decent economic management.This is a great result above all for the people of Australia, because it is the people of Australia who benefit when our economy is strong. It is the people of Australia whose children's job prospects are enhanced by a strong economy and it will be the people of Australia, particularly in future generations, who will benefit from future reform. The message is that, if we want to maintain this rate of economic growth, if we want to be able to say in a few years time that the economy is continuing to grow strongly, we will have the courage as a nation, as a parliament, to embrace necessary economic reform, and that, of course, means fundamentally taxation reform.</DOC>

 - The big news today for the Australian economy is that, in the March quarter, the Australian economy grew at 1.1 per cent, or 4.8 per cent for the year. It is often said in the newspapers and by commentators around the world that the US economy is enjoying unmatched growth and prosperity. The US is growing at an annualised rate of 3.9 per cent, and Australia is growing at 4.8 per cent. Japan contracted in the last year by three per cent, Australia grew by 4.8. Germany grew at 1.3, Australia grew at 4.8. France grew at 2.8, Australia grew at 4.8. In Britain, growth through the year is at 0.6 per cent, Australia is at 4.8. In Italy it was 0.9 per cent, in Australia 4.8. In Canada it was 2.8. The average growth rate in the last year amongst the G7 nations was 1.6 per cent, and in Australia it was 4.8 per cent. The OECD growth rates were at 2.2 per cent, and Australia's at 4.8 per cent. -  - Members of the Labor backbench interject in an angry fashion because they are upset that the Australian economy is growing. The Australian economy is the standout economy in the world, and the Labor Party backbench gets upset. This is a  strategy by the Labor Party: they would rather run down their country in the hope of some political advantage than acknowledge the good work of our exporters, our business and our employees and the importance of the government's economic policy. In the Asian region in the last year, nearly every economy has gone into recession - Korea, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and New Zealand. The one economy in this region that grew in the last year was Australia. It is not only growing, but it is growing at 4.8 per cent.It is no coincidence that what managed to keep confidence in the Australian economy during the period of the last year was the fact that the budget was in surplus. Mr Speaker, can you imagine what would have happened in Australia if we had continued Labor's policy of $10 billion deficits as we sailed into an Asian financial crisis? Can you imagine how exposed the Australian economy would have been if the policies of the failed finance minister, now the Leader of the Opposition, had prevailed?Another thing about today's figures: this was the sixth consecutive quarter of growth above one per cent in Australia - the first time ever that that has occurred in this country. According to reports from New York, the Professor of Economics at MIT, Paul Krugman, told a Carnegie Council lunch this week:I would like to see more Australias around the world. Australia's internal strength and its appropriate policy mix meant that its appearance of vulnerability did not result in any crisis at all.Professor Krugman also said:International investors continued to be confident about Australia, despite a relatively small and short-lived fall in the currency, because of its excellent performance and the transparency that was not evident in the crisis-hit nations.What does he mean by transparency? He means transparency in budget policy - the charter of budget honesty. He means the statement of monetary policy agreed between me and the Reserve Bank governor. He means an open program of corporate law reform. He means the new financial structure which we have put in place as part of the Wallis reforms, described by the IMF as `path breaking  reform'. He means all the hard work in the last three years that set Australia up to weather the Asian financial crisis. As the Prime Minister says, it is the hard work of today which will set us up for the future.Those people run around putting on stunts, holding up tomato soup cans outside the House of Representatives. The greatest contribution that the Leader of the Opposition can make to economic debate is crank calls to Democrat offices and cans of soup outside the House of Representatives. - It is policy. It is policy that counts when it comes to economic management. It is not crank calls to Democrat offices or stunts outside the House of Representatives - or an opposition which is stunt driven, not substance driven.</DOC>

 - The government proposes to simplify Labor's complex wholesale sales tax system - the government proposes to abolish Labor's wholesale sales tax system. Under Labor's wholesale sales tax system of 12, 22 and 36 per cent rates, knitting needles are taxed at 22 per cent and knitting wool is exempt. Sewing needles are taxed at 22 per cent and sewing thread is exempt.The Labor Party thinks you should tax brooms at 12 per cent and rakes at 22 per cent. I asked the Australian Taxation Office: what is the difference between a broom and a rake? It is the number of needles that come out of the head. Once you get over so many teeth, it becomes a broom, according to Labor, and then it goes up to a 22 per cent tax rate. This is the system that Labor is wedded to. Under Labor's system, chocolate is taxed at 12 per cent but chocolate Quik is not taxed. Strawberry Quik is taxed at 22 per cent. What a penalty for being pink. And you call yourselves Lefties.Not only is the coalition going to abolish Labor's wholesale sales tax system, we are going to abolish Labor's financial institutions duties. We are going to abolish Labor's bed taxes. We are going to abolish Labor's stamp duties -  - on shares. We are going to simplify Labor's tax system.Of all the stunts that the Leader of the Opposition has pulled, he was standing outside the House of Representatives - this is the heir to Chifley and Curtin - with tins of tomato soup. This is the heir to Gough Whitlam's `It's Time', with his tins of tomato soup. No substance, only stunts. In none of those does he stand up with his tins of chocolate Quik and say that chocolate Quik should be taxed at 12 per cent and strawberry at 22 per cent. And you call yourselves the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - Of course the government's tax changes will simplify considerably the three wholesale sales tax rates - they will be abolished. The difference that we currently have is that, under Labor's tax system, an antique gold plated fountain pen is tax free, and pens and crayons are  taxed at 22 per cent. What have you got against children?The Labor Party says that household vinyl floor tiles should be taxed at 12 per cent and that marble floor tiles should be tax free. The Labor Party says that works of art should be tax free and a children's painting set taxed at 22 per cent. - I know that the Leader of the Opposition just then alleged that Mr Hooke had said that there were compliance problems squared, and if he has a quote to that effect I would be very interested to see it, because I have the article about Mr Hooke here in the Australian Financial Review . This is one of the reasons why you should never take the Leader of the Opposition's quotes literally. But I give him the benefit of the doubt. If he turns up a quote where Mr Hooke said `compliance squared', which he just alleged to the House, I will give him the benefit of the doubt. But Mr Hooke says this in today's Australian Financial Review :'I certainly reassured [the Government] that I believed tax reform was in the national interest.' Mr Hooke said the Government knew the Food &amp;  Grocery Council's preferred position . . . . but that the deal struck to exclude prepared food from the tax was the 'political reality' and that the industry would now work out the administration requirements to get the new system working.That is what responsible people do. We would take these classifications questions from the Labor Party seriously if they had but one policy to simplify classification issues. But they have not only lived with them but created them over the last 13 years. In relation to classifications issues we say only this: hypocrisy, your name is Labor.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. A longstanding concern of many small businesses in the retail area, particularly in the grocery business, has been the operation of the wholesale sales tax as it affects their competitive position against the majors. The government is concerned about the competition in that industry. We have a parliamentary inquiry looking at the issues so that the small business sector's point of view can be properly heard. That is an important inquiry.However, an inquiry is not needed to understand the disadvantage which small business has suffered as a result of the wholesale sales tax system. In fact, there is an organisation - the National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia - that for many, many years has been campaigning for a fairer tax system so that the small operators at least  have an equal treatment through the tax system compared to the big operators.Whilst we have the Labor Party's silliness over definitions, the fact of the matter is that the competitive disadvantage of small business against big business in the retail grocery business has been estimated by NARGA - the industry association - to be putting them at a disadvantage of around $120 million every year. There will be many Labor politicians who claim to be concerned about small business, but who are doing everything in their power not to correct the disadvantage which has been suffered by the small business community. The NARGA submission says that if you can have a better and fairer tax system:The removal of this anomaly will be a major boost for small business throughout Australia but, in particular in the rural and regional areas. The boost will underpin the ability of small retail businesses to not only maintain existing jobs but to grow their existing employment base.The fact is that in the wholesale sales tax system if you are a big operator then you have vertical integration. You own the chain of production right down to the point of retail distribution, and you actually pay less wholesale sales tax than the small guy who buys through the independent wholesaler. This is a major structural problem with the system. The people who are suffering are the small business community. We have a chance to finally give small business the sort of opportunity which they need. We on this side all know that, if you give small business a go, they will go out and create jobs. That is why we say this package is good for small business. This particular proposal has been called for for years. It does show you the hypocrisy of the Labor Party. When there is a chance to do something to help small business, they vote against it. We are for small business. That is why we are for this package.</DOC>

I make the observation that I have had a constructive conversation with Lyn Allison this morning, I have agreed to meet with her next Monday so that we can continue to talk sensibly and negotiate a way forward, given that she and the Democrats have made themselves relevant to the process of reform and you have completely sidelined yourself.The principles are clearly established. The principle of the matter is that the fuel excise is available on the basis of where the fuel is essentially used because that reflects the purposes for which it is to be rebated. There is nothing complicated about that at all. I really think that you must be deeply regretting the fact that you have made yourself totally irrelevant to the whole process. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I must say that I have enjoyed my trips to his area in recent times, particularly when it came to launching the new initiative for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, with all that that means for rural and regional Australians in far-flung areas.It was whilst I was last there that my attention was drawn to the enormous savings that local industry can enjoy if we are able to reform transportation in this country. Indeed, it was put to me that if we can move ahead with the higher mass limits reforms in this country, worth an estimated $840 million to GDP annually, we can have a real impact on simple things like the cost of transporting stock out of Central Queensland and the major works in Dubbo when you actually couple that with the enormous savings that will flow out of the fuel rebates that we are proposing. We found a typical example would relate to a company that is currently using $1.25 million litres of diesel a year. They will save virtually $300,000 a year just on fuel. Over and above that, they will save a great deal of money on their trucks, on their parts, on their tyres. All of that is money which stays in the Dubbo community, which circulates in the Dubbo community, which generates more job opportunities. I had my attention drawn, too, to the benefits that will flow to a transport operator in Mackay, in the member for Dawson's seat, where we have a company that uses 2½ million litres of diesel a year, and they will save $600,000 a year. Again, that is of enormous and real benefit to  that community. But it is a tragedy that the opposition thinks all of this is just too hard.Whilst I extend my sympathies to the member for Dickson in her battle with fatigue, I have to say it must be difficult indeed for her at the moment watching from the grandstand as the government delivers on tax reform that will benefit the constituency that she says she cares about. Indeed, I note with some interest that not only does she say that she cares about it, but one of the insiders in the ALP was quoted over the weekend as having made this comment:If there is one person who knows instinctively a huge amount about the electorate - in the Labor Party - who has the communication skills and capacity to sense the mood that is running and grab it, she is the best we have got.This is the spokesperson who has dealt herself right out of the game, knowing that if she had not engaged in that political flip-flop last year - dare I call it that political treachery last year - she could have been in there instead of her former Democrat colleague making a real difference for rural and regional Australia. She could have been, and she threw it away. - My point is that for anyone who engages in the debate about rural and regional Australia these issues of tax reform are vitally important.The member for Dickson says she has exhausted herself out there over the last six or seven months listening to every peak body, every community organisation, she can find. They will all have told her in rural and regional Australia that they want tax reform, but she has dealt herself out of the game.  Now she seeks to make herself relevant again on what are relatively minor issues compared to the overwhelming benefit of what we are proposing and what her former colleagues in the Democrats have recognised are necessary in reforms for rural and regional Australia.Really, in the end probably all it confirms is what we already know by the member for Dickson's own admission: she has not ventured into rural and regional Australia very much anyway. When she was Leader of the Democrats she did not think there was much point because there were no votes in it. - The reality is that what we are now seeing is what amounts to the pursuit of, in relative terms, trivia. What we are seeing is that she is paying the bush lip-service. She has effectively bought herself a season ticket in the tax reform grandstand.</DOC>

 - The good news for the member for Robertson is that Australian education will be more affordable under this government's package for lower, simpler, fairer taxes. Thanks to the Australian Democrats, school tuckshops will not charge the GST. Thanks to the Australian Democrats and their help, employment related courses, adult education colleges and community colleges will not attract a GST. Thanks to the help of  the Australian Democrats, this package is a better deal for Australian education.This package means that education will be GST free. This package means that education will no longer be affected by Labor's unfair wholesale sales tax, which means that there will be no wholesale sales tax on scissors, paper, crayons, drawing pads, computer disks, paints, envelopes, computers, diaries, satchels, glue, paste, folders, calculators, sticky tape, exercise books, pens, pencils and batteries. All of these goods will be very considerably cheaper under the government's tax package.Thanks to the government's package, school tuckshops will no longer be affected by the wholesale sales tax, which means that school tuckshops will no longer face the problem of having to decide when a crispbread, which is exempt, becomes a Ryvita, which is taxable - and that is Labor's system. School tuckshops will not have to decide how much salt you have to put on peanuts before they become taxable - which is Labor's system. Tuckshops will not be confronted with the problem of when a box is for a frozen pizza, which is exempt, and when it is for a hot pizza, which is taxable under Labor's system. Tuckshops will no longer have to tax paper bags at 12 per cent but tax them at 22 per cent if they have a pie printed on them. That is Labor's system - and what has the Labor Party got against meat pies?The Australian Education Union is claiming that this package will cost students more. The union should go back and take a course in remedial maths, because this package will reduce the cost of education services by $720 million over three years - or by nearly $200 for every consumer of education in this country. Teachers should not mislead their students, and so I call on members of the Australian Education Union opposite - such as the member for Brisbane, who is a former official of the Queensland Teachers Union - to stop taking orders from the union and to tell the union to lift its game.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question and for his interest in veterans' issues and also war widows. The Liberal Party, the National Party and the Democrats have great news for the veteran community. As of 1 July in the year 2000 veterans will benefit from a one-off four per cent increase in pensions and allowances and also from a two per cent real increase in allowances. The veterans will also benefit from measures in the original package, which included income-free areas being increased by 2.5 per cent, the pensioner tax rebate threshold being increased, and the treatment benefit level will be increased by 2.5 per cent. I am also advised that also means that some veterans who do not qualify for a gold card today will be eligible for a gold card under these tax reform measures. That is on top of the extension as of 1 January this year.We have also agreed to extend the self-funded retirees supplementary bonus to eligible persons aged 55 years as of 1 July next year. The Labor Party want to oppose this. If they were really fair dinkum about the welfare of veterans and war widows, they would have been part of the process of developing better benefits for the veterans and war widows of this community.Veterans will also benefit from an expanded range of professionals who may provide GST-free health services, included appropriately qualified naturopaths, acupuncturists and also herbalists. This is not only good for veterans  and for war widows; it is also good for their families -  - We have to ask ourselves why the Labor Party is not serious about the welfare of veterans and war widows. They are on the sideline; they are not even in the debate. The Democrats, the Liberal Party and the National Party are part of the debate. The Democrats, the Liberal Party and the Democrats are serious about tax reform. The commitment that we gave the farmers at Longreach at the recent cabinet meeting was well received by those out in regional and rural Australia. The veterans who live in rural and regional Australia said that they want tax reform. Many of the Labor supporters are wondering why the Labor Party are not part of the debate. They have dealt themselves out, they are not part of it, and they never have been.</DOC>

 - I find this sort of contrived anger rather tiresome. -  - The fact of the matter is that living in a retirement village is a lifestyle choice. It is the same as choosing to live in a strata unit or in a cottage: it is the choice you make as an individual as to the way you wish to live. The question of living in residential care is a question of whether or not you are judged able to look after yourself according to an ACAT assessment or not. One is a medical judgment; one is a lifestyle choice. When you make a lifestyle choice, you are subject to exactly the same tax as anybody else. When you are in a residential facility, you are in a facility which is GST free. That includes all of the inputs that come in to run that facility, and the inputs taxes are deductible in the hands of the providers. It is a very simple distinction to make, and I do wish you would learn. You are truly the dimmer of the `glimmer twins'.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his particular interest in pensioners. I am delighted to assure him that pensioners can look forward to a much improved standard of living under the new tax system. On our side we have been referring to some of the benefits that are going to be given to pensioners as compensation, but they are much, much more than that. In fact, this tax system will provide a real bonus to pensioners. There will be a significant capacity for them to improve their lifestyle. This is the government that legislated to guarantee that pensioners would always receive no less than 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. That guarantee stays in place.We promised, when we went to the Australian people with the new taxation system, that there would be a four per cent increase in pensions and other benefits from 1 July 2000. Even though basic food has now been taken out of the GST equation, that four per cent guarantee stays in place. So that is an increased benefit to pensioners. We had said previously that we would guarantee that the pension would stay at least 1.5 per cent above whatever the CPI rise might be. That has been improved to two per cent. So there is a further bonus for pensioners in this package. This is not just compensation; it is much more. There is a real pension bonus.What I find remarkable in this whole exercise is that the tax wallflowers opposite, the people who are sitting on the shelf watching it all happen, are actually going to vote against this pension rise. The Labor Party will become the first party in the history of this country to vote against a real increase for pensioners. These are the people who claim they have an interest in the poor and the disadvantaged. They are going to vote down a pension rise. Fortunately, there are enough people of goodwill in this House and in the other place to deliver this real increase in benefits to pensioners - not just compensation; a real bonus for pensioners in the new tax system.</DOC>

 - Because the Australian Democrats sought to extend GST free treatment to those items which are on list S2. We currently operate a different list for S2, and GST-free treatment has been extended to S2. The government's original position was that it should be extended to prescriptions. If you have a problem with the items which are on  schedule S2, you had 13 years to fix it, but you did not. I seek to add to an answer I gave in relation to -  - I will do it after question time. It is about the Labor position on brooms and rakes. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Bradfield for his question. I also thank the member for his advice and active participation in putting this program together. We have had quite a team effort to bring together the government's indigenous employment policy. The member for Leichhardt and the member for Page had some good advice, the member for Herbert was also involved in it and had some very sensible things to say, and we had a very constructive discussion with community leaders at Palm Island. The point is that if you have a strong economy there are more things that you can do for people who are disadvantaged. One of the great things about this government is that we have now seen growth of over one per cent in six consecutive quarters. That is the best result of any government in the history of Federation. It is a fantastic result. And the other person who has stood behind this program is the PM, who enthusiastically endorsed this policy and gave us the authority to go out and put a package which would actually be of assistance to Aboriginal people.We have the money in the budget. That is a start. We also have some constructive ideas to help those who are unemployed. The level of unemployment amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is about three times the national average. If you take into account those people who are in CDEP, the rate of unemployment is about 40 per cent. Obviously that is simply not good enough. We as a government are very committed to doing something about it.We have a greater focus in this program on the private sector. A lot of jobs today held by Aboriginal people are in the public sector - about 70 per cent - so we have given emphasis to real jobs in the private sector, and we think this program is going to help in that regard. We have a wage assistance program. We have a practical incentive for people running CDEPs. We have had a very encouraging response from CEOs of some of Australia's biggest companies who have said that they are going to do more. We had a very constructive meeting with them and we have hopes of much more being done there. We have an improved and targeted training aspect to the program. We have a new voluntary service to the Indigenous Communities Foundation. We have worked with not just the Aboriginal community where they have been involved in all the program but also some of Australia's major voluntary organisations who are giving us some advice. We also have a cadetship program and an indigenous small business fund to give a boost to those indigenous enterprises and people who are prepared to give small business a go and create jobs that way.We are much appreciative of the support and encouragement we have had and of the involvement and participation by people like Joseph Elu, who runs the CDC. We had a meeting with the CEOs, at which one of the big banks was represented, and Joseph said, `For the first time I have sat in a room with a major bank in Australia.' He reckoned that showed that there was a change going on - a change in attitudes to do something better. Evelyn Scott, the head of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, came along to this meeting and another one and was very sup  portive. I publicly thank her for that. When we were at the CEOs meeting she said:I am very excited about this event today. It is an historical event in terms of a meeting such as this to be having some of the biggest corporate companies in this country setting out an initiative, taking up an initiative that has been developed by the government. I am excited about the people that sat around the table here who have committed themselves. And that is what it is all about. It is all about commitment and no doubt I will be stressing that it is a learning process for this, both sides, and there is also a wonderful partnership in the whole place.That was a very positive remark and I thank her for it. I hesitate to introduce any political note into such a statement, but the Aboriginal affairs shadow minister was quoted by the ABC. They said:He has praised Mr Reith for consulting Aboriginal people and preparing a well balanced program.They quoted him saying:It shows that he has turned the ship around and he's heading in the right direction.If we are going to have a stronger economy - and that means more reform like sensible tax reform - then that will be good for our small businesses, whether they are indigenous or otherwise. - If our big companies and our other companies can do better as the result of tax reform, then with a program like this as part of an integrated approach the good news for this country is that we can tackle some difficult issues and tackle them in a constructive way. It is going to mean real jobs for people who for far too long have been disadvantaged.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. As a representative of the majority of South Australia, he is obviously very interested in how this package is going to benefit all his constituents, and indeed it is. Our government's tax reform package delivers in full; in fact, it delivers more than what we committed to deliver at the election last year for Australia's primary producers. It should be noted that Australia's primary producers account for around three per cent of GDP, and that is worth over $25 billion in export income. For those primary producers we are going to remove around $4½ billion worth of embedded costs that they carry the burden of when they are exporting products out of Australia and earning much needed export income for Australia. Just remember, they are Labor's embedded wholesale sales tax rates.Earlier this week there was an announcement made about the exports of food and agricultural products to Asia in the March quarter this year. They happened to be up 14 per cent on the March quarter last year. In the March quarter this year we saw a rise in the exports of meat to Asia of 27 per cent,  of dairy products of 7.5 per cent, of grains of 25 per cent and seafood of five per cent. The most important point to make is that  Australia's primary producers have done that whilst carrying the burden of Labor's embedded wholesale sales tax. Remember Labor's 12 per cent, Labor's 22 per cent, their 32 per cent, their 45 per cent? - The wholesale sales tax system which you are supporting -  - I apologise, Mr Speaker, but it is important to make the point that those export achievements have been done whilst carrying the burden of that embedded taxation system. Imagine what Australia's primary producers can do when we wash it out of the system. They will be able to achieve a lot more and will be a lot more competitive on the international stage.We will also deliver on our commitment to reduced transport costs to rural Australia. We have maintained that commitment in the revised taxation package. The diesel fuel rebate scheme that we promised Australia's primary producers we would deliver will be delivered. The abolition of fuel excise from the rail industry will deliver enormous benefits to primary producers. - The member for Dickson interjects; I should not respond. It is an indication of what can be done in Australia when the government of Australia and some political parties in Australia put the nation's interests first. We have achieved that with the assistance and the professional manner in which the Australian Democrats have participated in this discussion, to the detriment of the Labor Party, who have been left in the grandstand. I will get back to the point about the fuel excise on the rail industry. In New South Wales alone, the saving by the abolition of that fuel excise is going to equate to a $2 a tonne reduction in freight, which is about $18 million off the bottom line of the grains industry in Australia; that is, straight back into the pockets of the producers. This is important policy reform for Australia's primary producers who desperately want it, and they are supporting the government in these measures.The fishing and aquaculture industries in Australia - $1.9 billion worth of industry, $1½ billion worth of exports - will also have their costs reduced by around $100 million a year. This is because we are going to get rid of the embedded wholesale sales tax system which the Labor Party want to protect. They want to keep the 12 per cent, the 22 per cent, the 32 per cent and the 45 per cent, that clumsy, cumbersome system which they instigated in this country. Our commitment is that we will remove the wholesale sales tax system and we are going to achieve that on behalf of Australia's primary producers. We will do it with the mature and professional approach of the Australian Democrats, who are participating in a decision making process to benefit Australia, not just to benefit their political ends. It certainly is something that the Labor Party in Australia - the pink party in Australia, the pink Quik party in Australia - could never achieve.</DOC>

 - I have seen the comments that were made by Mr Kennett and I think they were made in the context of advocating that there be a two-tier rate in relation to food - one of 10 and one of five - with a broader definition of food. I am quite familiar with the proposal, because we actually worked it up in my office over two weeks ago. Both the Prime Minister and I put it to the Australian Democrats on the first day of our negotiations, which I think were two weeks and one day ago. We put the merits of such a proposition to the Australian Democrats. The Australian Democrats did not accept that particular proposal and proceeded to negotiate that issue and others issues with the government. So there is nothing particularly new in that particular proposal. I do not think the Democrats will find any more interest in it than they did when the Prime Minister and I - at our persuasive bests - put it to the Australian Democrats.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his interest in this issue. My attention has been drawn to a speech made by Dr Greenspan in Boston yesterday, in which he said:I am concerned about the recent evident weakening of support for free trade in this country. Should we endeavour to freeze competitive progress in place, we will almost certainly slow economic growth overall and impart substantial harm to those workers who would otherwise seek more effective, longer term job opportunities.That is particularly apposite in the light of the imminent decision of the American administration on the question of the possible imposition of quotas on imports of lamb from Australia and New Zealand. This is of very direct concern to the Australian government.Members on both sides of the House will know that the United States International Trade Commission has recommended restraints on Australian lamb exports to the United States. The government has already expressed its anger about efforts to cut our exports and has campaigned strongly against any restraints. Our lamb exports to the United States are worth $100 million, and this is a very vital issue indeed for Australia's lamb producers.I wrote to President Clinton on 22 May, expressing the concern of the government about the protectionist approach being adopted by the United States. The Deputy Prime Minister has put great effort into this issue, and he campaigned very hard on it during his recent visit to the United States. It has been the subject of personal appearances before the relevant committee by both the Australian Ambassador in Washington and also the New Zealand Ambassador in Washington.Any restraint on imports would be a damaging step in the bilateral trade relationship between Australia and the United States. It would invite questions about the United States' commitment to further liberalisation of agriculture and trade and to a new global  trade round that we hope will be agreed by the World Trade Organisation in Seattle in November.We have demonstrated unequivocally that imports are not the cause of the problems of the United States lamb industry. Their problems are due to low domestic demand and very poor marketing of the United States product. We have even offered to cooperate with United States producers to promote and develop the lamb market in the United States as the only long-term solution for the United States industry. There is absolutely no case for any restraints. If they are imposed, it will amount to punishment being meted out to a successful Australian producer who has been more successful than his competitors in marketing a product to United States consumers. If the Americans impose restraints, they will be making a mockery of the rhetoric so frequently employed to exhort the rest of the world to reduce trade barriers.</DOC>

 - I have seen the comments of the Victorian Premier and I do not agree with them. In fact, I do not think they are constructive and, quite frankly, I do not think they are right. The reason that I support small business is that small businesses are good for this country and they create a lot of jobs. The reason I am in favour of tax reform is that it is very good for small business. In the time I have been the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business and the whole time that I have been in parliament pushing for small businesses they have always said that it is about time they had a fair and a decent tax system. What we are doing for small business is that we have the biggest income tax cuts in Australia's history. That is fantastic for small business.You talk about red tape. The hypocrisy of the Labor Party talking to us about red tape has no boundaries. The fact is that in this tax package - something that seems to have  escaped the Premier's notice - we take five existing tax administrative systems and reduce them to the pay-as-you-go system, which is a much simpler system. In our tax package we are abolishing provisional tax. I do not know what the Premier thinks of provisional tax, but I tell you what: the small business community are cheering that we are getting rid of provisional tax. That is a fantastic boost for small business.In the design of this tax system we are finally giving small business, particularly independent grocers, a fair go against the big operators. They suffer a $120 million disadvantage today; in future, that disadvantage will be obliterated. I do not know what the Premier thinks of that, but I reckon it is about time we had a fair go for small business.I do recognise that the Premier did say that, all things considered, he still accepts the tax package. I say to anybody who accepts the tax package that they need to appreciate all of the benefits in the tax package and the fact  that when you look at the totality of those benefits it is very good for small business. To say that small business is going to go broke is, quite frankly, just plain silly - not much better then the stunts we have had from the Labor Party this week. I do have very firm views about this, because I am strongly supportive of the small business community.The last thing I would say about these comments is this. This country has needed genuine tax reform for over 20 years, and the one person who has provided leadership in this issue - doggedly, persistently, with determination - for over 20 years is none other than the Prime Minister. When that package was agreed last week it was one of the greatest achievements in Australian politics in recent times. Those who support national leadership, those who support the small business community, will take a constructive attitude to this package. It is a great thing for the future of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for her question. One of the high points of the Howard government's first term in office was successfully tackling the difficult and complex problem of uniform national firearms laws. The Prime Minister's leadership and the government's commitment - and, I would add, the support of the opposition - led to a national firearms legislative scheme and to a national firearms buyback scheme. We now have some evidence of the impact of that legislation and of that scheme.The scheme resulted in the removal of some 640,000 firearms from the community. In addition, the Australian Institute of Criminology has recently issued a report which indi  cates that there has been a decrease between 1996 and 1997 in firearms related deaths. The number of deaths in 1996 was 523 and it reduced in 1997 to 438. This is both encouraging and welcome. I point out that the three categories of firearms deaths that are particularly relevant - suicide, accidents and homicide - all had a reduction. We have to treat the AIC's figures with some caution, as we need further time to evaluate fully the impact of the laws, but generations to come will benefit from them.I take the opportunity to remind all states and territories that their compliance with the national firearms agreement reached in 1996 continues to be monitored. Compliance with the agreement is one factor the Commonwealth will take into account when exercising its discretionary power to reimburse the states for expenditure under the buyback scheme. Non-complying jurisdictions will not be reimbursed. The national firearms legislative scheme and the buyback scheme will contribute to a safer Australia for generations to come.</DOC>

 - The reason the rest of Australia shouldn't think that is that it is not. The remarks made by the Premier of Victoria are wrong, and they are rejected by the federal government. Can I just make a couple of observations. I have seen a transcript of the remarks and he said a lot of things. - He said a lot of things about you as well. I can tell you that they were not very complimentary. - The Australian Labor Party has not even entered the debate. They are like a puff of wind somewhere off on the horizon. He went on to make some equally uncomplimentary remarks about the Australian Labor Party. The Victorian Premier has a lot of characteristics and one of those is -  -  - There are some very dim ones, Mr Speaker. The Victorian Premier has many characteristics, and one is that if there is a game in town he likes to be part of it. I think it is fair to say that this week the only game in town has been the debate about taxation. As my colleague the Treasurer observed, the idea of having a differential rate for food was in fact generated by the federal Treasury, was worked upon in the Treasurer's office and was put by the Treasurer and me in the discussions that we had with Senator Lees and Senator Murray something like 10 days ago. After some exhaustive discussion, they indicated very firmly that they were not going to put it. I understand that the fact that we had put it was very extensively reported in a number of newspapers.So I do not think it is the most blindingly inspirational contribution to this debate at this late stage. Jeff cannot stay out of any debate. He really does enjoy making a contribution. All of his contributions are colourful, often right and often very constructive but they are  sometimes very wrong and unhelpful, and on this occasion it falls into the latter category.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question on the Australian economy. I acknowledge his interest in the economy and economic developments, which have been the big issues before the nation this week. The Australian economy continues to perform exceptionally well against the backdrop of an international downturn and an Asian financial crisis. The Australian economy, in the year to the March quarter of this year, grew at 4.8 per cent. That is the result of economic reforms which have been put in place and which have given Australia a transparent policy framework at a time when the region has been in crisis. One of the first things this government did when it came to office was sign an agreement on monetary policy between me and the Governor of the Reserve Bank to lock in low inflation. Of course it was opposed by Labor - the Labor Party which threatened to sue the government for entering into such an agreement. When this government came to office it put into legislation the charter of budget honesty, which was designed to make our accounts transparent and to lock in good fiscal policy. This charter of budget honesty is now recommended by the IMF as the world class fiscal instrument for developing countries and developed countries around the world.When this government came to office it determined to take away the $10 billion deficit that the Labor Party had been hiding and to put this economy into surplus. Can you imagine where our economy would have been if we had still been in deficit during the Asian financial crisis? When this government came to office it decided to put in place a debt reduction program. Over our period of office we have paid off $24 billion of Labor's debt - $24 billion of the $80 billion that was run up by Labor in its last five years of  office. If the Labor Party ceases its mindless obstructionism in relation to the Telstra sale, this government will have the opportunity to eliminate all Commonwealth debt in the next century. Not only did the Labor Party determine to run up the debt but now it wants to stop a government eliminating it. It is bad enough to have created the problem, but to try and block the solutions is doubly negligent. The Labor Party fought the government all the way in relation to its economic reforms. In July last year, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was opining on how the government had taken the petrol out of the economic car. The Labor Party was saying that growth would be slow in Australia because we were running a balanced budget. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said:After three Costello budgets, we have slower growth . . . In July 1998, as the Australian economy was leading the world, here was the economic expertise of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: `we have slower growth'! - `We have' - 4.8! There is terribly slow growth out there! Faster than the United States and Britain and France and Germany and Italy and Canada. Terribly slow growth! Can you imagine if the genii of the Labor Party were running things. He then went on to say, with all of the seriousness with which they hold up tins of tomato out at the front of the House of Representatives, with all the seriousness with which they hold up tomato soup tins at the front of the House of Representatives:And now we face the Asian economic crisis. It is not what I would call a fireproofed economy. The Treasurer has fireproofed the economic car by taking out the petrol. We do risk an economic crisis of major proportions.He told the people of July in 1998. He was as right about that as he was as right about how we needed to maintain deficit budgets, as he was right about the need to keep a regulated labour market, as they are right about the need to keep the 1930s tax system. These are people with all of the perspective of the Scullin government of the 1930s - irrelevant, out of the debate, producing stunts, while the  big cause of economic reform is handled by a government which is prepared to lead.</DOC>

 - That is one of the most confused questions that you will ever come across in this House. As I have said, and I will say it again, a $3 billion shortfall in revenue through the exclusion of food is funded, as far as the states are concerned, by the Commonwealth taking back the funding of local government, which local government sought, by postponing for six months the abolition of financial institutions duty, which then becomes abolished in its entirety - something that the Labor Party opposes - and by putting back to 2005 the abolition of the bank accounts debits tax - again, something that the Labor Party opposes.These questions would have some relevance if the Labor Party would stand at the despatch box and announce its policy. Whilst it has a policy of keeping FID, BAD, stamp duty on share transactions and bed taxes, are we seriously going to take questions on, `Why are you putting back the abolition of indirect taxes?' You want to keep them all. That is your policy. It is like the questions we got about the diesel fuel rebate. `Why are only some trucks getting a rebate back to 20c a litre?' was the question, when it is Labor Party policy to keep all trucks at 43c a litre. It is like the questions about classifications.  The Labor Party asks questions about classifications endlessly. When did it get an interest in classifications under wholesale sales tax? - As I have explained, not only is the shortfall funded through the mechanism of local government FID and BAD, but the government has a proposal to abolish stamp duty on shares and will abolish immediately Labor's bed taxes. I do want to make one other point, and that is this: this government is going to abolish the wholesale sales tax. This government is going to repeal the wholesale sales tax in its entirety. It is going to be fought tooth and nail by the Labor Party because the Labor Party loves wholesale sales tax and it will be a great boast to get rid of that blight from Australia. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question which gives an opportunity to announce some more good news from the government. Work for the Dole is one of the signature programs and outstanding successes of this government. Last week, I released a formal evaluation of the program based on monitoring 9,400 participants and more extensive survey of smaller groups. I am pleased to tell the House that 83 per cent said that their Work for the Dole experience had increased their determination to get a job and 75 per cent said that their experience had increased their self-esteem.The fundamental purpose of this program is to reintegrate the long-term unemployed into the community. It is to restore the social contract. It is to end forever any notion that there might be a human scrap heap of useless people. This program has also had very good employment spin-offs. Using the standard methodology for judging all labour market programs, 34 per cent of Work for the Dole participants were in paid employment three months after leaving the program. A further 11 per cent were in education or training and of the rest 23 per cent had had some employment outcome. - I have been asked about Jobstart. To get into Jobstart, you actually have to have a job. You have to have a job to be part of a Jobstart evaluation, whereas Work for the Dole is for the long-term unemployed. Work for the Dole compares extremely well with brokered labour market programs under the Working Nation program of the former government.A New South Wales Chamber of Commerce survey revealed that the expansion of Work for the Dole was the single most popular measure in the recent Peter Costello budget. The Leader of the Opposition, in his budget reply, suggested that there should be a further doubling of Work for the Dole. So this great program is going from strength to strength and is already generating support all round the community.</DOC>

He comes in here and makes all of these allegations as to what might have been said in heads of Treasury meetings or what may not have been said. He comes in here and says that I said something yesterday. If his question is - after all of the interjections, all of the palaver and all of the bluff - whether what I said yesterday is right, the answer is yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question, and I recognise the interest she shows in international relations and in the important issue of East Timor and our broader relationship with Indonesia. During the Bali summit between Dr Habibie, the President of Indonesia, and the Prime Minister and other ministers in late April, one of the points of agreement reached was that the Indonesian government would allow the Australian government to open a consulate in East Timor. We have been having discussions over the details and the mechanics of the opening of that consulate with the Indonesian government over the last few weeks since the Bali summit. We have found a property which the Australian government will be able to use for a consulate. We finally last week got the approval from the Indonesian government to open the consulate. I am glad to be able to inform the House that today three consular officers from my department have arrived in East Timor and will begin the process of opening and operating our consulate in East Timor. The consul himself will arrive in Dili almost certainly during next week.I think this is an important step. We are the only country in the world that has a consulate in East Timor. It gives the Australian government the opportunity principally to ensure that we are able to fulfil our consular functions for the large number of Australians who are and who soon will be in East Timor. This consulate will be able to help Australian journalists who are on the ground there. It will be able to provide assistance and advice to the Australian civilian police presence as part of the United Nations civilian police operation, and it will be able to provide assistance to Australians in the military liaison team - should there be Australians in the military liaison team; and we would be happy for Australians to participate.This initiative has been possible only because we have maintained a balanced relationship with Indonesia. If we had taken the advice of others - not least the increasingly incredible member for Kingsford-Smith - we would not have a relationship with Indonesia, we would not be able to pursue these sorts of initiatives and we would not be able to provide the sort of security we are able to provide to Australians through having a consulate on the ground. This is an important initiative. We are the only country on earth that has established a consulate in East Timor. I think it is a significant achievement of this government that we were able to do it. The Labor Party had 13 years to take that initiative, 13 years to open a consulate, and never did it.</DOC>

 - I was able to negotiate in very good faith with the Democrats last week. I found it, I have to say, quite a rewarding experience. I would think that the Democrats might have some interesting observations about those who have dealt with them in good faith. The fact of the matter is that we dealt in good faith with the Democrats and I make no apology for that, and I believe that they would reinforce it. And it is not true to say that the standards that we are now bringing forward in relation to engine technology and fuel quality in this country were in some way agreed, planned, locked into place or whatever. The fact of the matter is that in a number of very substantial ways what we are doing to make, I believe, a very substantial difference to the quality of air in our major cities ought to be set out. - The old Leader of the Opposition, since he is apparently such an expert on this out of the blue, ought to find me the evidence that the automotive community had agreed on this, because they certainly had not told the government or anybody else that they had. There are a lot of documents floating around. I understand that in part this National Road Transport Commission document that is being referred to may be of some interest. I am quite happy, if it is desired by those opposite, for it to be tabled.But let me make the observations that, in terms of the key aspects of our package, diesel sulphur content will be down to 500 parts per million by the end of 2000 and negotiations with the oil industry for diesel at this standard to be available in urban areas will continue with an objective of reaching that by the year 2000. The diesel standard will be set at 500 parts per million by the end of 2002 for road transport fuel. A mandatory fuel standard of 50 parts per million will apply from the year 2006. - The key changes to vehicle standards are as follows: introduction of the so-called Euro 3 standard for medium sized diesel vehicles in 2002-03, previously the timetable was 2006 -  - I am quite happy to, Mr Speaker, I haven't quite finished. The intro  duction of Euro 4 standard for all new diesel engines - 2006-07 - and there was no previous implementation date at all for Euro 4 before, which is a very important development; the introduction of Euro 3 standard for all petrol vehicles a year earlier in 2005-06. We negotiated in very good faith. We have a set of outcomes that will make a real difference to air quality in urban areas in Australia. No-one has been duped except you who have not been prepared to enter in good faith into any negotiations. - Here it is.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his questions. Of course, the member for Hinkler is absolutely correct in that the farm community right across  Australia as a whole supports the government's tax reform package in its entirety. The areas where farm families will benefit are very important, and we highlight these. Not only will farm families and farm operations benefit from getting rid of Labor's embedded wholesale sales tax system; to help them become more competitive in the export marketplace we are going to provide improved family payments for farm families, particularly in the electorate of Hinkler. Under our family payments package we will ensure that farm families are treated the same as other Australian families. They will no longer be discriminated against as far as assets tests are concerned. Depending on the ages of the children and the incomes of the parents, struggling farm families can receive family payments up to nearly $5,600 per child per year.We are delivering equity to Australian farm families. We are going to abolish Labor's embedded wholesale sales tax system, which does have an impact on the farm family operation in Australia. In the member's own electorate of Hinkler, which is a very strong sugarcane growing area, Labor's embedded wholesale sales tax system is an added burden to the cane farmers. Their cane harvesting contractors do not get exemption from the wholesale sales tax system. The truck driver transporting the cane to the mill does not get sales tax exemption. The truck driver transporting the product from the mill to the wharf does not get the exemption. So Labor's embedded wholesale sales tax system does disadvantage farm families. The rates of 12, 22, 32 and 45 that we are going to abolish are disadvantaging the farm families in the electorate of Hinkler.Transport costs in Australia under the Labor Party have been a huge impost on rural Australia. We are going to make those much fairer. We are maintaining the full diesel fuel rebate for farmers. We are maintaining the full diesel fuel rebate for cane railways. We are cutting the cost of diesel on road transport in rural Australia by 23c a litre. All these are going to go towards building a stronger rural sector in Australia.Farm families will benefit absolutely from our revised tax reform package by improved family payments and income tax cuts - the $12 billion worth of income tax cuts will also benefit farm families across Australia. We are going to provide major savings to road and rail transport and, most importantly, we are going to abolish Labor's embedded wholesale sales tax system which will benefit without question the rural community and particularly the cane farmers in the electorate of the member for Hinkler.</DOC>

Let it be noted out there - their now spokesman for regional services and transport over there was once on the side of the Democrats. Now she is on the side of the Labor Party - or was. She now appears to be on the side of Senator Bob Brown. One thing we do know is that she is not on the side of rural and regional Australia. - Yes. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. She constantly makes representations on behalf of the forestry workers in her electorate and she is a very hard worker. The forest products industry employs over 82,000 people. Its prices flow through to all downstream activity in business and personal consumption. It is subject to intense competition as an exporter and from imports. For instance, ABARE recently reported that a GST country in Canada is exporting sawn timber to the Australian east coast at as low as $340 a cubic metre and no Australian mill can compete at that price.Export woodchip prices all around Australia were recently negotiated down by the Japanese by 6.7 per cent and it resulted in job losses in Tasmania. The federal Treasury has advised me that under the original ANTS package, which remains substantially unchanged for forestry, the savings to this embattled industry will be as follows: to the forestry and logging sector, $40 million per annum; to the saw milling and dressed timber sector, $120 million per annum; for other wood products, $170 million per annum; to the pulp, paper and paper board industry, $200 million per annum; and to paper containers and such products, $160 million per annum. This totals a whopping $690 million.Whilst the new tax deal has marginally reduced these benefits, it will also add new opportunities such as the increased commitment of $100 million - taking the figure up to $280 million - to investment in clean fuels which will assist in developing fuel production from currently unusable forest residues.In particular, and in response to the member's question about exports, let me refer to the Labor Party's tax cost burden associated with pulp, paper and paper board of $200 million. The consumption of these products, by way of imports, is the major contributor to Australia's $1.5 billion trade deficit in forest products. As a simple example in this particular area, the Australian Paper mill at Maryvale has approximately 100 trucks fully employed servicing its operation. I have contacted the Road Transport Forum which has advised me that a typical truck of that nature pays $1,730 per week in Labor's indirect tax charges. This is a $173,000 per week burden on this one employer's ability to compete. Australia must convert from a vulnerable woodchip exporter to a paper manufacturer and exporter, and Tasmania is the logical location for such an enterprise, producing a world class volume of a minimum of 750,000 tonnes of high quality paper per annum.There is an international interest in such a project, but those who have contacted me have made it clear they are not interested until Australia has an internationally competitive tax system and resource security guaranteed by the government's RFA legislation, which of course is presently in the Senate. This parliament has five Labor representatives and five Labor senators from Tasmania, yet they all oppose both these measures. Anybody who votes in an election has the right to think the people they elect will stand up for them when they so desperately need that type of development in Tasmania. Where are these people when international firms come to the government and say, `We have an opportunity to develop an area of Australia that is in some trouble'? What is the answer we get from the Labor Party representatives of Tasmania? `We are opposed to it. Let the people stay on the dole.' </DOC>

 - Unlike the Leader of the Australian Labor Party, whose tax policy consists of waving cans of tomato soup in front of television cameras - at long last he has found a policy; I suppose I should at least concede that - the Leader of the Australian Democrats has sufficient concern for the national interest of this country to reach a compromise understanding with the government. The Leader of the Opposition talks about tax on education. He did not of course mention the 22 per cent wholesale sales tax on computers, a frequently used instrument of education, apparently something the Leader of the Opposition - oh! - An equal observation could be made in relation to books used in  schools. The fact remains that in the whole of this debate the most remarkable take-out of all, and the one which over time the Australian people will be most conscious of, is that this nation has had for a period of almost two years an intensive debate on the future of Australia's taxation system. Whatever criticisms may be made of the government and the Australian Democrats, at least the members of the government and the Australian Democrats have been willing to apply their energies and their views to finding a solution which they believe is in the best long-term interests of this country. By contrast, the Labor Party has sought on all occasions to obstruct, obfuscate, distort, mislead and deny. At no stage has the Labor Party sought to lay out an alternative taxation plan.There was a time when Australians could expect of their parliamentary oppositions a willingness to lay out an alternative vision for this country. The man who sits opposite me in this parliament has now had over three years to lay out an alternative vision for Australia. He has had eight months since the last election to lay out an alternative taxation reform. He has taken the easy, lazy political option. - I am indeed, Mr Speaker. At the last election the Labor Party had something about reforming the capital gains tax and they could not move away from it too quickly straight after the election. Our view is that it is the responsibility of political parties in this place to advance positive solutions for the long-term challenges of this country. We now have the strongest perform  ing economy in the Western world because this government has been willing to embrace reform. We have had no help from the Australian Labor Party, and over the last 3¼ years the Australian Democrats, by contrast, have taken a constructive national interest approach. The Leader of the Opposition can wave his cans of tomato soup in front on television cameras. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition can wave his bags of salad in this House. The Australian people will remember that when the call went out for an alternative taxation policy there was a resounding silence, a deafening silence, from the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. I know he has an interest in quality education for young people in his electorate. Indeed, he has a great interest in accurate information. I am aware of comments that have been made about the tax package by the Australian Education Union. The Australian Education Union has made the claim that school costs to families will rise by some $200. This is all of a piece with the shonky analysis we have had from the Australian Education Union in relation to the budget. When we examine the analysis of the Australian Education Union and look closely at its figures, what we find is that it has actually totally ignored major impacts of the package on the disposable income of families, it has totally ignored major impacts of the package on the costs of delivering education and it has overstated the impact of the GST on price increases. The Australian Education Union, which is believed implicitly, of course, by the member for Dobell and the Labor Party - they never say anything on education that has not in fact come from the Australian Education Union, and they repeat this figure - has been wrong on every occasion that  it has sought to make a comment on the government's tax reforms.Let us just hit these comments for six and put the facts on the record. The facts are that the tax reform package is going to have an immensely favourable impact on the disposable income of families. The average family is going to be some $40 to $50 per week better off, after the impact of the goods and services tax, and they will have that extra money to spend on clothing and other educational items, including books, that will be available to the family. Indeed, as a result of this change the average family will be some $2,000 a year better off, whereas the Australian Education Union is saying that they will be $200 a year worse off. They will be $2,000 a year better off, after the price impacts of the GST.From 1 July 2000 the youth allowance, assistance for isolated children, the Australian postgraduate awards and other income support for students will increase by four per cent. The cost of a whole range of materials needed for school will go down, because those materials currently contain the flow-through effects of the wholesale sales tax, the tax which the Labor Party supports. So we can anticipate that the price of computers, a major item at the moment for families sending their children to school, will come down under the government's tax reforms. From the point of view of schools themselves, the cost of providing education will be lowered by the tax reform by some $720 million over three years. Above all of that, the goods and services tax and the tax package will provide the states with a growth tax, a tax base that will enable them to meet the growing costs of education over future years.This is a wonderful package for education. The Australian Labor Party, plugged in only to the Australian Education Union, does not recognise this. The Australian Democrats have recognised the value of this package to Australian families and the community. The coalition has long put forward this package because it recognises this fact, and even the Australian Labor Party must now be beginning to get the message that the Australian community sees the benefits of this package  and it supports a majority of parties, the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Australian Democrats, who want to deliver an historic benefit to families and education in this country.</DOC>

 - If the member for Dobell had read the full context of that particular remark of mine, and I do recall making it, he would realise that it was in the context of improving standards of literacy and numeracy in Australian schools. I am delighted therefore to remind the parliament -  - I thank the member for Dobell - in fact, I am profoundly indebted to the member for Dobell - for giving me the opportunity of reminding the parliament of the wonderful things that my colleague the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has done about lifting standards of literacy and numeracy. Not only has the minister insisted for the first time on decent national standards for basic literacy and numeracy in Australian schools but he has also won the support of the government to provide hundreds of millions of dollars to  both government and non-government schools in order to lift the standards of literacy and numeracy within Australian schools. It is also the case that under the funding arrangements delivered by the government's tax reform plan the states of Australia will over time have more money to provide even more assistance to the government schools of this country, for which they are principally responsible. - The reality is that the coalition government has put more resources into lifting standards of literacy and numeracy than any federal government in this nation's history. I am delighted that the member for Dobell should ask me that question. I would say to him and to the parliament that this government is proud of its record in lifting standards of literacy and numeracy. We will continue to devote both the necessary priority and the necessary resources to this and, through taxation reform, the additional resources that will flow to the Australian states to fund their obligation to government schools.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon, who I understand is chairing a very important parliamentary inquiry into the impact of globalisation on the economy. I  wish him and the parliament well in that inquiry. We have good news for Australia. The Asia-Pacific Loan Market Association has decided to open an operation in Australia. This follows on from their existing operations in Hong Kong and Singapore, and is a direct result of our marketing efforts over the last few months in Hong Kong.This is a very important market facilitator because it facilitates the syndicated loan markets across the world. It represents 105 of the largest financial institutions in the Asia-Pacific region which provide billions of dollars for infrastructure and development right across the world. In fact, last year alone the Loan Market Association lent four times the total value of all the shares listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. Over $1,800 billion was lent through loan syndication around the world. Of that, over the last three years $88 billion has been borrowed by Australian borrowers undertaking projects throughout the Asian region.This means jobs for Australians. This is a real result of all the fundamental reforms that we have undertaken over the last three years - the reforms that have delivered a budget surplus, the reforms that have delivered transparency and honesty in the budget and the reforms that have delivered record economic growth of 4.8 per cent over the last year. These are the results of the reforms that we are still undertaking and that we expect to undertake over the next 12 months.It is not just us saying that Australia is a great place to invest. I am also pleased to reannounce, on behalf of the New South Wales government, that Western Union Financial Services has decided to set up its regional headquarters in Sydney. That is going to operate from the beginning of June. That means 120 new jobs for Australians. Edward Furham, President of Western Union Financial Services, recently said:The combination of a high-quality, culturally diverse work force, a large multilingual population and Australia's economic and political stability make Sydney a very attractive city to establish a regional operation centre.We can only continue if we are freed from the shackles in relation to our ongoing reform  program. That particularly relates to taxation reform.The most significant aspect of the result of the negotiations last week between the Prime Minister and this government and the Democrats is that it sends a message to the world that we are continuing with the fundamental reform that is crucial to Australia's future. That is the fundamental part about it. Our commitment to reform is unwavering. That will start to deliver jobs. I quote from Ken Courtis, the Chief Economist of Deutsche Bank Asia, last night on Lateline:If Australia can put its case out clearly to the world that it's reformed taxes, it's reformed its labour market, it's made it easier to start companies, then the dream of having Sydney as one of the major financial centres in the Asia-Pacific region could start to be realised, and then that opens up a whole new series of opportunities to this country.Good news.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. I acknowledge the member for Dunkley's ongoing interest in the improvements that the coalition government is making to the environment. It, unlike the former administration in this country, is making significant inroads. Improving urban air quality and reducing air pollution have been high priorities of our government since coming to office. In fact, this government is doing more than any previous government to address this important environmental issue. We have worked with the states to establish a national standard for ambient air quality. Labor was unable to secure agreement from the states for any national environment protection measures.The question goes to the measures that we have recently announced we are going to undertake. Those measures will allow us to fund new programs. They will allow us to build on existing initiatives and accelerate the introduction of a number of measures. Some of those measures include that we will provide funds to assist in the conversion of commercial vehicles to compressed natural gas or LPG. We will provide incentives to switch to low sulphur diesel fuels through differential excise treatments. We will introduce progressively tighter diesel fuel quality standards in 2002 and 2006, and we will  accelerate introduction of new diesel and petrol vehicles emission standards made possible by the availability of cleaner fuels.We will see vehicles using better engine technology and cleaner fuel. Our government, along with the Australian Democrats, is providing a huge win for Australia for better air quality and a huge win for the Australian environment. The agreement that was reached the between the Prime Minister and the Australian Democrats was interestingly described by the Leader of the Australian Democrats in the Weekend Australian last weekend. It said:While praising Mr Howard as 'pleasant and cooperative', Senator Lees condemned her Greens and Labor critics, saying the Democrats 'did not want to stop the country as some clearly do.'She went on to say:'We achieved more in 13 hours with the Coalition than we ever did in 13 years with Labor,' . . . That says two things about the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party. The first is that it indicates how inefficient the Australian Labor Party were in government if they could not achieve anything with the Democrats in 13 years. The other is that it seems to indicate the inability of the former leadership of the Australian Democrats. This agreement and our government's commitment to the air quality in Australia are without question, and we are going to continue to improve the air quality in Australia.</DOC>

The issue of consultation with industry in relation to emission standards has been something that has been going on for quite some time. - There is a big difference between them indicating what they might be prepared to support and the government adopting a final position.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. My attention has been drawn to a NATSEM study on income distribution which was released today. This report covers the period from 1982 until 1995-96. It shows that children living in couple families where only one of their parents worked faced a $24 a week fall in their average family income. The report also shows that children living in two income families experienced a $43 a week increase in their family incomes over the same period. These conclusions come as no surprise to me, and they come as no surprise to the government. That is because our view is very much in line with the conclusions of this report, and it is because of that that we decided before the 1996 election to propose a number of family tax initiatives that were designed to address the very problem that has been unearthed by the NATSEM investigations. That is why we proposed the family tax initiative which, for the first time in about 15 years, sought to reverse the trend against single income families.We have sought to do it not at the expense of two income families, but we have done it in the teeth of a lot of opposition and criticism from the Labor Party and from other sections of the Australian community who seem to believe that giving choice to parents about the caring arrangements for their chil  dren when their children are young represents some attempt at social engineering and turning back the clock to a time when overwhelmingly mothers in the Australian community were not in the paid work force. We are not about social engineering. We are not about turning back the clock. We are about giving effective choice to Australian families. We are about giving more choice to the mothers and fathers of Australian children so that they, and not the government, can make a decision as to whether both parents are in fulltime work or when children are very young one elects - mother or father - to be at home full time to care for them.That is why the family tax initiative for the first time in 1996 recognised the need to reverse this trend. We did it by the introduction of a special increase in the tax-free threshold where one family member was out of the full-time work force and where one of the children was under the age of five years. That translated into very significant additional help for those families. But we were not content to leave it at that: we went even further in the tax plan that the Labor Party is about to vote against. One of the things the Labor Party will do when it votes against our tax plan is vote against justice for single income families in Australia. What it will be doing is saying that you should not have a tax system that recognises the right of families in this country to elect against paid child care and to provide parental child care in place of paid child care.We believe in choice. We do not believe in telling people what to do. We believe in giving those people choice. Under our new proposal, under the proposal the Labor Party intends to vote against, it will be possible for a single income household with one child under five years to have a tax-free threshold of $13,000 as a minimum. The Labor Party does not like that. The Labor Party does not like the choice that is involved in that. The Labor Party is prepared to turn its back on the findings of the Harding report - not surprisingly, because this report covers what period? It covers the period 1982 to 1995-1996, and I wonder who was in power then.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. In relation to this matter, as I have stated quite openly, a set of reviews on emission standards has been under consideration for some time. The motor vehicle industry and the trucking industry had indicated a series of options which they might have been prepared to work with. However, they did not support the outcome that was previously - I beg your pardon, let me phrase this more correctly - they had indicated some willingness to consider some options that were being looked at. But on 4 June, which is since the House last met, I have had this letter from the National Road Transport Commission. It reads in part:You will be aware that the Commission has been working for some time with the National Environment Protection Council on a review of vehicle emission standards. This work has been progressed by the Motor Vehicle Emissions Committee. A few weeks ago, the Motor Vehicle Emissions Committee advised the Commission and the National Environment Protection Council, of a set of options for consideration.Their proposals were qualified in a number of cases by questions regarding the availability of low sulphur diesel fuel. For technical reasons, the  emission standards under consideration are heavily dependent - upon being able to access fuel of the appropriate quality.I note that the environmental proposals outlined in the Tax Package will accelerate the availability of low sulphur fuel, and as a consequence provide for the acceleration of vehicle emission standards, particularly for light and medium diesel vehicles. These are now proposed to meet Euro 3 from 2002/3, rather than Euro 2. -  - Yes I did. -  - So the Leader of the Opposition, regrettably, calls into question the integrity of the National Road Transport Commission. The letter goes on to say:This is an important change as this segment is the largest numerically and operates mainly in urban areas where emission levels are most relevant.The package - now - also provides for Euro 4 in 2006/7 which was not previously under consideration.At the meeting of the National Road Transport Commission this morning, Commissioners expressed strong support for the new vehicle emission standards. The proposals to accelerate the introduction of low sulphur diesel fuel will provide for a significantly earlier introduction of diesel emission standards than was previously considered possible. - Yes. - No, I am quite happy to table it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and his  interest in the Australian economy. Recent indicators show increasing confidence in the Australian economy. A survey of 180 chief executives by the Australian Centre for International Business at the universities of Melbourne and New South Wales indicates business leaders are expressing a level of optimism not seen since the Asian financial crisis in 1997. Expectations amongst chief executives indicate that they are preparing for strong growth in both local and overseas investment opportunities over the next six months.The ANZ job advertisement survey was released today in relation to May. It shows that, according to the ANZ Bank, job advertisements rose by 1.3 per cent in May. This is the highest level since the Labor recession of 1990. Compared with May last year, the number of job advertisements was up 17.9 per cent and the last three quarters have seen consistent rises: 0.8 per cent in March, 1.7 per cent in April. According to the ANZ Bank, recent trends in job advertising, based on previous experience, are consistent with net new jobs growth averaging 18,000 to 20,000 per month over the next three months. -  - I take the interjection from the member for Melbourne who welcomes such good growth in the Australian economy. - Oh, you do welcome good growth in the Australian economy. - Mr Speaker, I apparently misrepresented him; he does not welcome good jobs growth in the Australian economy. This is equivalent to an annual growth rate in employment of about 2¼ per cent. So we see a return in confidence in the business sector coming out of the Asian financial crisis. We are seeing good jobs growth in the Australian economy. We now have unemployment at the lowest it has been in a decade - the lowest it has been since Labor's recession in 1990-91. Good economic results, of course, are not built on bad policy. It has been necessary  over the course of the last three years to lock in low inflation and low interest rates, to lock in a budget surplus and to start reducing debt. - And I am sure the member for Paterson will be glad to know that this government has paid off $24 billion of Labor's debt. When this government came to office, Labor had accrued new debt of $80 billion in its last five budgets, two of them presided over by the now Leader of the Opposition. Not only has this government put the budget back into surplus, we can now say we have paid off $24 billion of the Keating-Beazley Commonwealth government debt. And if this government's plans to privatise Telstra are put in place, we have the chance to completely eliminate the Keating-Beazley Labor debt and get the Commonwealth government debt free in the 21st century. They are the benefits of good economic policy. That will be seen in a strong economy and good jobs growth, and good jobs growth is what the coalition is committed to.</DOC>

All that needs to be said in regard to this is that we have negotiated that the diesel fuel credits will be administered and preserved under the new Energy Credit Scheme when it comes into place.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question. I guess he was seized of the importance of this matter when we saw over this last weekend the apprehension of a vessel entering our territorial waters - a vessel which may have been heading either to his electorate or to mine, although it has been suggested in some more informed comments that it may have been on its way to mine. The fact is that we have seen a very significant increase in the number of -  -  - I am emboldened by the comments of the honourable members opposite on this issue because I heard an interjection that said that we were not doing enough. There are some opportunities of course for the opposition to be able to assist us in relation to doing what needs to be done. I will come to that in a moment. We have seen a significant number of illegal boat arrivals. There have been some 33 with some 738 people this year to date. That is quite significant. It is a matter of concern to the government. -  - Yes, `gruesome' was a term that I used to describe the people smuggling that is going on, and I think it is a trade in human beings which ought to be seen in that light. The fact is that it is becoming increasingly sophisticated. There have been vessels capable of travelling at night in international waters, which has not been the case before. They are operating with the most sophisticated navigational devices. We are seeing a level of organisation associated with these matters which is more in line with those that have been used to access the United States of America and Japan.We are intent on protecting the integrity of our borders. There has been an increase in arrivals, not only by sea but also by air. We have responded in a number of ways to deal with those issues and I will mention them. Firstly, we have been acting very positively offshore in relation to these matters, as exemplified by the way in which we were able to deter the possible transport of some 2,000 people from Somalia to Australia. I want to commend the cooperation that my officials were able to engage from the international media to ensure that people were aware that they had no entitlement to access Australia or enter here unlawfully and that they were being grievously misled by the organisers.We have also been actively involved internationally in relation to China. I attended a conference at which I met with the Chinese vice foreign minister. I was able to engage him on these issues and obtain continued cooperation from China in relation to removals. We have also sent the secretary of my department to the Fujian province where most of these recent arrivals have come from to enable him to put clearly the matter before local officials and to ensure that they are actively involved, as I know China is, in trying to interdict vessels before they leave. The Prime Minister has established a high level task force to look at our own coastal surveillance arrangements. The report to him will enable us to consider further action in that regard. I have also mentioned that I am looking at increased penalties for those people who are involved in people smuggling. I am sure I will receive the utmost cooperation  from the opposition in ensuring that, within legislation that is already in another place, we might be able to make amendments which will deal with this issue quickly.As others engaged me, I heard reference to prompt return. Let me finally say that the opposition could be well seized with the importance of facilitating some other legislation - that dealing with judicial review - because those people who exploit the opportunity to delay the departure of people who have no lawful right or entitlement to be in Australia are ensuring that the people traffickers are out there holding the view that, if they get people to Australia, they may be able to remain here. We need your cooperation in relation to that measure to ensure that we are able to deal with these matters quickly and expeditiously. I would hope that, in the spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship for which the Labor Party is so well known, we will see some cooperation tendered in relation to that matter shortly.</DOC>

 - The timber industry in Corangamite and throughout Victoria, in such places as the electorates of Ballarat and Indi where I have visited in recent weeks, have definite concerns regarding the future of their jobs and their businesses. In the town of Colac, some 300 people attended a meeting with me - which was organised by the CFMEU - to express their concerns and, in particular, their fears and anger that the federal Labor Party are determined to scuttle the government's RFA legislation in the Senate. I attended a similar CFMEU meeting in Woodend in the electorate of Ballarat. In each case, all of the people were telling me how grateful they were to their local members in representing their interests by having me speak with them and understand their problems.During my visit in Corangamite, I also had discussions with executives of the Geelong based chipwood exporter, Midway Pty Ltd, which is owned by a consortium of Victorian sawmillers and is essential to the viability of the sawmills, as it exports their mill residues, the chips and the forest waste necessary to ensure healthy forest regrowth. Midway informed me that if it is not confident that the Victorian RFA process can be completed by this December it will cease purchasing product throughout Victoria in September of this year.The government has provided additional human resources to the process, and I have advised Midway that I am confident of completing all the conditional RFA processes by that time. However, I cannot guarantee the passage of the government's RFA legislation through the Senate - which is equally import  ant to a firm like Midway, which creates jobs throughout country Victoria and also in the electorate of Corio.I am now in possession of the Labor Party's proposed amendments to clause 8 of the RFA legislation - and I can tell you I did not get them from the Labor Party, which shows how cranky some of their own people are with them. Not only do they propose that the completed WA RFA and all future RFAs, such as three in Victoria, four in New South Wales and one in Queensland, be subject to Senate disallowance but they further include 11 opportunities for litigation after that event, plus they place severe constraints upon any company damaged by the acts of a future government to receive compensation. In other words, these amendments are clearly designed to scuttle the whole national forest policy process and to remove any incentive, through resource security, to encourage investment in the future in the forest products industry.It is even worse because they have clearly shown their intention in their amendment to clause 3, where they add that there should be special arrangements for relocation and retraining of the workers in this forest industry, when - with the Prime Minister's permission - I have put all the focus on value adding industry development and keeping people in their jobs, in their towns and in their districts, and keeping the industry going.In South Australia recently - in fact, just last week - two longstanding Labor Party MPs, steeped in the traditions of the Labor Party, decided to cross the floor on an issue of grave importance to South Australia. Not for them the principle that their job is more important than their constituents' jobs and futures. In this parliament, five Tasmanian representatives and five Tasmanian senators are working against their state's best interests, as highlighted by the Deputy Premier of -  -  - By their squeals would you know them! Why don't you work for your own people for a change? - Now we have Victorian Labor MPs and senators doing the same thing. Where is the member for McMillan? He puts out press releases about the electorate of -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. When he has a few Oxford mates to speak with about forestry - no worry for the workers. - Michael O'Connor from the CFMEU knows where to get help - he has come to me. I would like to know what the member for Corio is doing in this process for truckies in his electorate. - Yes, I am, Mr Speaker. What I want to point out is that, without this RFA legislation, all the good work comes to nothing because people cannot invest. If people do not have the security to invest it is these people's jobs that then count. I want to know why the Labor Party has done a backflip on its own policy. I would say to you, Sir: don't workers' rights count anymore? South Australians Cameron and Crothers have the guts to put their people above arrant political opportunism. - We have just had an example of how the Labor Party works. - It is all about five per cent, not your own constituents' jobs.</DOC>

 - The opposition is wrong again. In terms of alleging that we have short-changed country Australia, we have not. Indeed, with respect to the Northern Territory, Darwin has been a very big winner thanks to the Grant Tambling clause in the matter. - Remote centres and remote and regional Australia are being assisted in many additional ways by the agreement reached between the Prime Minister and the Democrats, and this will be further detailed in the amendments which will come forward. We are doing something about reducing the transport costs, whereas you stand for keeping a massive regime of diesel fuel excise tax on rail and too much transport tax generally. We are going to reverse that. I am proud of what this government is doing for rural and remote Australia, including promoting alternatives to diesel power generation.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There has been some speculation in this morning's media that the government would be supporting the member for Holt for the position of Director-General of UNESCO. I can confirm to the House that the government will indeed be supporting the member for Holt for that position. - No `Hear, hears' from the member for Kingsford-Smith, I notice. We regard it as important that UNESCO be well led and that the next Director-General of  UNESCO be an effective Director-General, and it is the view of this government that the member for Holt would be an effective Director-General. Putting party politics aside just for a nanosecond - if the Leader of the Opposition could bear me doing that - I think it is in Australia's interests that we promote somebody who had a long record as the foreign minister of this country and who, before that, held a number of other portfolios which are relevant to UNESCO's work. His experience as an academic is also relevant to that job. I think he will be a good Director-General should he be successful in being elected.It is time that the Asia-Pacific region had a Director-General of UNESCO, and there are at the moment four candidates from our region putting themselves forward. Whilst we have respect for those people, we do not think any of those people would do the job as well as the member for Holt. We regard the member for Holt as considerably better qualified for that position.There was a report, I think on the AM program, suggesting - and this was I think one of the more bizarre suggestions that I have heard in recent years - that somehow we were running the member for Holt for this position in order to place additional pressure on the Japanese Chairman of the World Heritage Committee in the lead-up to the consideration by that committee of whether Kakadu should be listed as in danger as a result of the Jabiluka mine. The World Heritage Committee will be considering this matter on 12 July. The election for the Director-General of UNESCO is not until three months later. There is absolutely no intention of the government, or for that matter I am sure the member for Holt or anybody else, to use this question of who the next director-general should be to put pressure on the current Chairman of the World Heritage Committee, who is the Japanese candidate for the position. It just does not make any logical sense; it is simply an absurd proposition. I think the member for Holt could take comfort from the fact that just about all members of this House will be behind him. - The member for Kingsford-Smith won't be. I hope that members of this House when they go abroad do put in a good word for the member for Holt for this position. Australia has no head of any similar United Nations agency. We are a founding member of the United Nations. We are something like the 12th biggest contributor to that organisation. We have always been a very active country in United Nations affairs and it would be appropriate that a long-serving and successful foreign minister of this country take that position.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and interest. As she mentioned, some two million Australians have asthma. We have the second highest mortality from asthma in the world, and it is particularly increasing amongst younger people. One in four children, one in seven teenagers and one in 10 adults have asthma. It costs the country somewhere between $580 million and $720 million, depending what assumptions you make. It is for this reason that the government has given a commitment to support a national asthma campaign for the cost initially of some $9 million over three years. We have four main things we hope to achieve from this. The first is the improved management of asthma. This is important because two-thirds of asthma deaths are premature and preventable. We hope to work with practitioners and patients to try to get a better continuity of care and get much better use of medication. The second thing we hope to do is to substantially increase education and awareness of asthma in the community. Thirdly, we hope to do research on asthma to have a look at what triggers the onset of attacks. Some attacks are life threatening. We do not have a clear understanding at all in the Australian context of what may trigger such an attack. Fourthly, we hope to undertake some monitoring to improve our understanding of the burden of asthma - at the moment in this country there is no clearing house for asthma data - and researchers tell us this will substantially help in the treatment of this condition.Finally, at the health ministers meeting in August, the Commonwealth will be proposing that asthma become Australia's sixth national health goal and target. There has been some opposition to this in some governments around Australia. In the last few weeks I have talked to a good number of state and territory health ministers, and I believe it will have strong support.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. Work for the Dole is, of course, one of the signature programs of the Howard government and it is giving new hope and new opportunities to long-term unemployed people in Brisbane, as elsewhere. Unfortunately, even though people such as the member for Melbourne now admit that Working Nation was an expensive failure, there are still too many people associated with the Labor Party who hanker for the good old days. - I am advised by the member for Moreton that senior officers of the Brisbane City Council have told one of Australia's leading and most respected charities that the Brisbane City Council will not cooperate in putting together a Work for the Dole application because the Brisbane City Council has said that it is philosophically opposed to the scheme and that it wants it to fail. This is very sad for the 100 youngsters who would have benefited from this Work for the Dole project, and it illustrates appalling double-standards on the part of Brisbane City Council because between 1992 and 1996 the Labor controlled Brisbane City Council -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Between 1992 and 1996, the Labor controlled Brisbane City Council hosted no fewer than 3,300 labour market program places and, in the process, received $28 million in federal taxpayer funds. -  - Over four years, Brisbane City Council has hosted 3,300 labour market program places but has not put its hand up for a single Work for the Dole place. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am advised that only 31 per cent of participants in Brisbane City Council's programs achieve positive outcomes compared with 45 per cent of Work for the Dole people going on to paid employment or training. I think it is time that members opposite stopped trying to sabotage Work for the Dole. It is time that the Brisbane City Council stopped playing party politics with the future of unemployed young Australians and started cooperating with community groups that want to benefit from this program.</DOC>

 - As I answered in the last couple of questions, the first principle - and it is good to see the Leader of the Opposition listening - is that you do not impose a tax on a tax. The second question is a valid question: are those levies taxes or fees for service?  As we work through the detail of the tax reform package -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Let's just make it clear. The first point is: no taxes on taxes. The second point is that you have to assess whether they are a tax or a fee for service. If they are a fee for service, then it gets rebated back to the person who pays it as a business input.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question and for his interest in this very important area. As the House knows, some of Australia's most important industries such as the citrus, grape, stone fruit and cotton industries critically rely upon seasonal labour. It is no secret that many growers have had trouble finding enough workers to harvest their crops. The government is determined to ensure that the labour requirements of these industries are met and that young Australians and working holiday-makers are more aware of the job opportunities that now exist in these industries, particularly because an experienced picker can earn up to $800 a week.To that end, the government has established a national harvest trail working group which will be chaired by the member for Hindmarsh. Other members are the member for Mallee, who asked the question, the member for Blair and the member for Hume. This working group also includes Mr Brian Caddy, Mr Don Carazza and Mr Bill Trevor representing area consultative committees of my department. It also includes representatives of the Macintyre Valley Cotton Growers Association, the MIA Council of Horticultural Associations, the Mildura and District Harvest Labour Committee and the Northern Victoria Fruit Growers Association. This working group will hold a series of public consultations on the labour needs of their industries. It will then make recommendations for the establishment of a national harvest trail to promote ongoing, year-round employment in these industries and to help boost Australia's tourist potential. I thank the members involved in this working group and those other fine Australians for the contribution they are making.</DOC>

In relation to those matters that are fully costed as part of ANTS, they have of course been taken into the budget position. As the Prime Minister says, it is really a luxury for the Labor Party to start asking questions about surpluses. It is an absolute luxury. I can tell you this, Mr Speaker: when I first became Treasurer of Australia, nobody got up and asked me questions about cutting into surpluses. It was all a question about what we were going to do about a $10.5 billion deficit, which the Labor Party opposed every dollar to us cutting.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for his question because the information I am about to deal with is relevant to people right across Australia and not only to those people in Perth. The fact of the matter is that the article that the member referred to shows that the accreditation agency established by the reforms of this government is in  fact doing the job that it was set up to do. It is part of the appalling legacy of the Labor Party that was left behind that we have so many aged care facilities which, quite frankly, are not up to scratch. They are not adequate for the sort of care that we require for older Australians.The Labor Party tolerated standards - or, shall I say, lack of standards - that we simply will not tolerate. The establishment of the Standards and Accreditation Agency, which is doing its job, will ensure that the standards that are met are part and parcel of the excellent reforms that this government has put in place to ensure that care, when needed by elderly Australians, is properly given and given in a way that the individual benefits from that care.</DOC>

 - From GST to Glenn Milne - a story of the Labor Party's tactics. Let me make a couple of things clear. Firstly, the question is hypothetical because the coalition does not intend to, and will not, lose  the next election. That is the first thing. The second thing is that the Treasurer and I together are strongly committed to the cause of taxation reform. May I say that not only does policy ownership of the tax reform plan belong to the Treasurer, who has done a very remarkable job in putting that policy together, but also it is the policy of the government from the Prime Minister down. Suggestions that my office would have authorised anything critical of the Treasurer are quite wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his interest in youth homelessness and for his strong support for the government initiatives in this area. The government has now announced that an additional $45 million will be provided for services for homeless people. When you add this funding to the commitments made in the last federal budget, it means $90 million more for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program over the next four years. That increase in funding is in line with the recommendations of the national evaluation of the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program. It will certainly provide much needed additional support for the people who are providing this excellent service.This funding is in addition to the amounts already announced by the government - $60 million over four years and $20 million each year thereafter - to support intervention to help young people who are at risk of becoming homeless. This will certainly help families stay together and to resolve their problems. This is quite a significant initiative, reflecting the Prime Minister's particular interest in these matters. This extension of funding will support another 100 priority areas, providing assistance in about 12,000 cases for intervention with young people and their families  where homelessness is an issue. There will be around 30 regions identified in the first selection round and a further 45 in the second round where pilot projects will be implemented. I might add that all existing pilot projects under the youth homelessness program will be automatically included in the priority areas for the first selection round.The member for Macquarie I know is particularly interested in the fact that Senator Newman indicated that the Nepean-Blue Mountains-Hawkesbury area has been highlighted as one of those areas which will be a high priority under this program. In addition, the Nepean family integration project has been awarded one of the pilot programs, and this program will particularly assist vulnerable families who are facing homelessness issues. This government is indeed committed in a real and practical sense to assisting families and young people facing homelessness, and our financial commitment demonstrates that we are prepared to work with the states to ensure that there is a range of suitable programs across the nation to assist young people facing homelessness problems.</DOC>

 - Firstly, congratulations to Tony Lockett on an outstanding performance. -  - Well, good, and I listened carefully to your question. Secondly, whether it is a sporting arena or whether it is rural and regional Australia, there is a huge gain from the dynamic of the tax reform package. You stand for a 43c a litre tax on every litre of diesel. - A lot of people who play football in country areas use a lot of transport to get to and from football, just logically. So I am very delighted to defend  every aspect of the new tax system. The sooner it is passed by the Senate, the better. - The Australian  had a curious question associated with that poll this morning. If they more clearly declared what the question was utilised in the poll, I think we would get a better balance in the responses from the Australian people. Australia, sporting Australia and export Australia will be better off for the new tax system when it comes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for that question and I particularly thank him for focusing on what is the most important element in this whole debate - that is, the Australian national interest. We are pursuing taxation reform because it is in Australia's long-term interest to get rid of the taxation system that we now have. We believe in a taxation system that will take $4½ billion off Australia's export costs. We believe in a taxation system that will take $10½ billion off business costs in Australia. We believe in a taxation system that will dramatically reduce the price of fuel in rural and regional Australia. We believe in a taxation system that will result in 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers paying a marginal rate of not more than 30 cents in the dollar.We believe in a taxation system that will sweep away the multi-layered complexity of the existing wholesale sales tax system and replace it with an infinitely simpler, fairer and more effective and more equitable indirect taxation system. We believe in a taxation system that will enable the Australian states to provide increased resources over the years for government schools, for hospitals, for police and for all the other services that governments are meant to provide. In other words, the Liberal and National parties - those parties that occupy this side of the parliament - are committed to a taxation policy  which is in Australia's long-term national interest.At the end of the day and at the end of the political combat, parties are judged on their commitment to the national interest. We took taxation reform to the last election because we believed it was for the good of Australia. We continue to pursue tax reform because it will be for the good of Australia that we get rid of the existing taxation system. Those who vote against this system are voting against more incentive for 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers. They are voting against cheaper exports. They are voting against more money for the Australian states for government schools, for hospitals and for police. But, above all, they are voting to retain a taxation system that is clearly out of date with the needs of modern Australia and a taxation system that is manifestly unable to carry Australia into the new millennium.</DOC>

 - I think the Leader of the Opposition made some kind of comment in his question that state taxes will stay forever. State taxes won't stay forever. It is Labor policy to keep state taxes forever. - Yes. It is Labor policy to keep state taxes forever. Just so you know, it is Labor policy to keep stamp duty on shares. It is Labor policy to keep FID. It is Labor policy to keep BAD. It is Labor policy  to keep bed taxes. This side of the parliament is in favour of abolishing state taxes. We are going to abolish bed taxes. We are going to abolish stamp duty on shares. - Mr Speaker, as he said in his question that state taxes will stay forever, he was completely false. He was misrepresenting government policy and he was describing his own because we are going to abolish stamp duties on shares. We are going to abolish Labor's bed taxes. We are going to abolish financial institutions duty, and we are going to abolish bank account debits taxes. Those taxes come off. The second point that I make is as follows: we are going to abolish Labor's wholesale sales tax. Listen, Leader of the Opposition, you are engaging in a huge fight to keep wholesale sales tax. That is what you love. No wonder you love it. - The point that I am making is that, when we abolish wholesale sales tax, all of the embedded wholesale sales taxes in gas production are abolished. No wonder the Labor Party loves wholesale sales tax. When it introduced wholesale sales tax, it introduced it at a rate of 2½ per cent and it is now at 32 per cent - Labor's secret whole  sale sales tax. When you are looking at gas prices, you are taking out all of those indirect taxes, which Labor is committed to. You are taking out all the embedded wholesale sales taxes on practically everything that is required to produce gas. You have an up-front transparent tax at the end of it. Businesses - let me make this point - that are buying gas get a full rebate of GST. They don't even pay any tax on the gas. But they would not get a rebate if you embedded wholesale sales tax, they would not get a rebate of the financial institutions duty, they would not get a rebate in relation to their stamp duties - all of the hidden taxes that the Labor Party loves.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. I thought this would be a matter which both sides of the House would be deeply interested in, as we do battle in the interests of the great Australian lamb industry and the great Australian lamb export industry. They have worked hard to carve out a $100 million market in the USA using a lot of their own dollars and resources to finetune their product and develop extra jobs here in Australia, and to grow the overall size of the lamb consumption market in the USA to the benefit of even USA producers and processors as well as to Australian and New Zealand lamb producers.Our existing access is reduced if it is capped, if they impose barriers, and this is grossly unfair as this is unsubsidised lamb product going from Australia to the largest economy in the world - the United States. The US administration ought to very carefully consider all of the ramifications arising in relation to the proposal to utilise safeguard action to impose unjust, unfair barriers when the ITC found that there was no injury thus far created by the Australian and New Zealand lamb export effort.A protectionist decision will create a huge backlash, quite properly, amongst farmers in Australia and New Zealand. It will sour the attitude in the lead-up to the meetings of APEC in Auckland and to the WTO meeting in Seattle in November of this year. It would also be the wrong decision for the US lamb producers and processors, who have gained a 50 per cent increase in the price of their US processed lamb over the last six months. I want to make it very clear that the Australian government stands as one with the Australian lamb industry in fighting all the way with regard to the consideration by Washington of a determination in respect of the ITC.I close with a short quote which is very relevant to this matter: `Protectionism is just a fancy word for giving up'. Who made that statement? None other than Governor Bill Clinton as then presidential candidate in 1992. May I respectfully remind the President of the USA of his quote on the campaign trail and that as they take steps towards protectionism, which the government is considering in the USA, if they are going to provide any sort of leadership, they ought to think carefully about this and think again.</DOC>

 - Of course in relation to anybody who is outside both the tax and the social security systems, the government has announced it will have provisions for them to get one-off compensation. But this statement that there are 1.1 million such persons includes a lot of married women who are not in  the tax or the social security system but are dependent on a primary income earner, it includes numbers of children who are not in the income tax system or the social security system but are dependent on income earners, and those persons are already fully and adequately compensated by the increases in family allowances. The family allowance increase for each child is $140; for the single income family, $350 - and, in addition, there are income tax cuts, which of course the Labor Party opposes. So those single income families get income tax cuts and additional family allowances, both of which incidently the Labor Party opposes. That puts those families in a much stronger and a much better position.We have said, if there are people outside of that - and that is the overwhelming bulk of the so-called 1.1 million people who can be identified - there will be one-off compensation, as we have provided for self-funded retirees. The honourable member then goes on to talk about surpluses. I have never seen such born-again, newfound interest in surpluses as now comes from the Labor Party. This was the hero of the $10.5 billion deficit. - Mr Speaker, the fact is that this government believes in running a surplus budget, and we are not going to take any lectures from the Australian Labor Party on surplus budgets. If it had not been for this government, this question would have been to the effect of `How much would we be adding to a $10.5 billion deficit?' That was your policy. When this side of politics said we were going to put the budget into surplus, you opposed us hook, line and sinker on every measure. So we are not going to sit here and hear this `$10.5 billion deficit man' on the question of surpluses. - I have finished.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question. The Treasurer alluded to some of the differences between Labor and this government. Another obvious one is that, when we came to power, there was a fundamental change in the attitude of government towards welfare cheats. This government is serious about stopping welfare cheats, and we have been taking decisive action over three years to stop the  small number of people who cheat on taxpayers by attempting to claim benefits to which they are not entitled.Most people who receive social security benefits do so because they are in need of assistance, and these people are also entitled to protection from those who cheat the system. In the budget process, the government announced a number of other initiatives to help reinforce our campaign against the welfare cheats. There will be an increased number of Centrelink officers stationed and located in the Australian Taxation Office to assist with data matching processes. In particular, there will be savings in identifying those who are wrongfully claiming benefits through data matching with the Australian Taxation Office's reportable payment system and their prescribed payments arrangements. This will help to detect those social security recipients who are receiving other income without properly declaring it.In the first half of the 1998-99 financial year, Centrelink conducted about 1.3 million reviews to identify overpayments, and 116,000 of these reviews resulted in cancellations or reductions in payments. Debts were identified totalling over $137 million. This action has been followed up by prosecutions in cases where clear social security fraud has been identified, and 1,510 people were convicted of social security fraud involving over $14 million. We are serious about addressing these issues of fraud to make sure that only those who are entitled to receive benefits get them.In addition, we are currently reviewing tenders for the enhanced investigative optical surveillance arrangements to improve the capacity of Centrelink to seek out those who are involved in elaborate scams which are resulting in their receiving payments to which they are not entitled. Around 70 per cent of all social security debts are created because people fail to declare the income that they have received or incorrectly report their income. So, to prevent these sorts of debts from occurring in the first place, Centrelink has appointed 230 debt prevention officers whose task it will be to work with Centrelink customers to avoid debts occurring in the first  place. We want to assist people in that regard so that there can be no allegations in those instances of defrauding the system.We want to work with men and women of goodwill, those who assist Centrelink in providing information, so that the hardworking people of Australia do not have to bear the cost of welfare cheats and welfare fraud. Those who are entitled to receive benefits should receive them and receive them in an efficient and fair way. Those who are cheating the system will not be tolerated by this government.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Lilley, I have considerable respect for the Society of St Vincent de Paul. I think it does tremendous welfare work in this country. I listen carefully to things that the society says, as I do statements made by the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and other organisations.It is fair to say that the changes that the government has made as a result of the agreement with the Australian Democrats have received a lot of comment. Much of that comment has been supportive. A lot of the comment has been critical. I make this comment to the Society of St Vincent de Paul: I find it extraordinary that anybody properly applying themselves could regard a package which changed the original personal income tax scales so that a rate of 47 cents in the  dollar applied at $60,000 and a rate of 42 cents in the dollar applied at $50,000 as being a bonanza for the rich.It is a bonanza for middle Australia because they will have a bit of incentive. I am very proud of the fact that, through this taxation package, we are going to deliver a level of incentive to middle Australia the like of which no government since Federation has ever proposed. To say to 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers that you can work and pay no more than 30 cents at the margin up to $50,000 is a remarkable improvement on the present system.Coming to the question of the less well off in the Australian community, I would remind the honourable member for Lilley that, as a result of the changes we have made with the Democrats, essentially two things have occurred: the GST has gone off basic food and, in addition, the real value of the compensation package has been increased. That is a double benefit. You have an agreement that provides a bonanza for middle Australia and a double benefit so far as compensation is concerned for low income earners in the Australian community.The astonishing thing is that the self-proclaimed supporter and sympathiser of and protagonist for the Society of St Vincent de Paul, the member for Lilley, is going to join with all his other Labor mates in voting down a two per cent real increase in the pension. You are going to vote down an increase in the pension. You are going to vote down increases for the unemployed. You are going to vote down a tax bonanza for middle Australia.The member for Lilley gets up in this place and asks questions as the social security spokesman for the Australian Labor Party. He does not understand the real benefit of this package to low income earners. He does not understand the family benefits. He does not understand the benefits for middle Australia. But he is locked in to joining all other members of the Australian Labor Party in voting against the best chance this country has had in a generation to reform its taxation system. The reason that this government remains absolutely committed to the cause of taxation reform is the reason I outlined in answer to  the question from the member for Grey - that is, it is in the long-term national interest of this country.You can nitpick. You can point score. You can try to get a cheap headline. In the end, you will be judged on the way in which you matched the national interest of this country. At the present time, you are failing the national interest of Australia and you are failing it in a big way.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. He is a person who has a great deal of perception about the challenges that an ageing Australia presents us with in the next century. Unlike the Labor Party, who never had the ability to look forward any further than the next election, this government is looking forward over the next 50 years at the impact an ageing Australia will have on its work force, on its social policy and on its health policy. To put it into context, this government has a vision that will utilise the wisdom, abilities and experience of older Australians and include them in the work force.The fact is that, if you look at the statistics, by the year 2020 we will see a slowing in the rate of new entrants into the work force - from 170,000 today to 125,000 for the entire decade. That means that we cannot afford to discard the post-45s and the post-55s, as had increasingly become the case under the 13 years of Labor government - a government which sent all the wrong messages and said people could retire at 55. Anyone who is thinking of doing that had better think again. We recognise that a lower birth rate and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives -  - mean that sudden immigration or indeed - dare I say  it - adhering to Jeff Kennett's dictum to go out and procreate a little more is not going to change the fact that this is an ageing society. We are indeed the product of our history. So, in answer to that very good question from the member for Aston, it is by pursuing policies of growth, fiscal consolidation, taxation reform and planning for the future that we will be able to ensure that all Australians have productive, fulfilling and purposeful lives. We do not discard older Australians in the way the Labor Party did, but say to them, `You are part of this contributing society with cross-generational respect for each other and a prosperous society into the 21st century.'</DOC>

 - I have heard some rubbish talked by the opposition, but none more so than in relation to high rollers and casinos. It may elude the Labor Party frontbench, but states currently have value added taxes on gambling. When this government said that it would be introducing a consumption tax, if it had been applied without a state set-off it would have been double taxation on the margin - on the same issue. This government said - and I think there are three countries in the world that do it - that it would apply GST to gambling; that is, to the margin on gambling. -  - There are three in the world. And may I say: what is the Labor Party policy on applying tax to gambling? Nothing. -  - Not only did this government say it was going to apply it but, when it announced that it was going to apply it, the states legitimately said it would be double taxation on the same thing so the agreement with the states was that, to the extent that the GST taxed value added, the states would reduce their value added tax accordingly so that there was not any double taxation. In other words, to the extent that the Commonwealth taxes, the state reduces - but the overall tax never varies. I just add here that it is Labor policy to have no Commonwealth tax whatsoever on gambling.In relation to high rollers, this means that high rollers, like anybody else, are taxed on their margin. Like any other punter, the high rollers are taxed on their margin - and it is right that high rollers be taxed on their margin. It is right that the high rollers pay a consumption tax in Australia. And, if I may say so, on this side of the parliament we think the high rollers should pay a tax not only on their gambling consumption in Australia; we think they should pay a tax on their hire cars and on their entertainment - which of course the Labor Party opposes. The Labor Party wants the high rollers in Australia to get a tax free run. We think that people coming into Australia, whether they be tourists or high rollers, should be paying money to the Australian tax authorities, just as Australians who go across to Europe or anywhere else pay consumption and value added taxes to foreign jurisdictions. It is only the Labor Party that wants to give foreigners a free run on the Australian taxation system. - When a high roller comes into Australia, we in the coalition say that the high roller should pay GST on the margin of their gambling and GST on their consumption. The Labor Party says that a  high roller should get free consumption in Australia - because the Labor Party is against taxing foreigners. The Labor Party would like to have all of the taxes that Australians pay when they go to Europe or Asia or anywhere else not apply to high rollers who come into Australia. We have seen some pretty regressive arguments come out of the Australian Labor Party over its time, but this has to take the cake - the taxable cake. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question in relation to this matter. Yes, I do have some additional evidence to put before the House in relation to the need for reform in this area. I would have thought that there would be no doubt about the need for urgent action in these matters. My colleague and friend the shadow minister and member for Bowman said on 4QY, Cairns on 26 May:Illegal immigrants are now arriving in Australia so frequently that it should be treated as a national emergency.One would have thought that, if the Labor Party saw it as a national emergency, they would appreciate that at the moment we have 1,036 people in our four detention centres. Of those, 230 people are eligible to pursue court action relating to their status in Australia and, significantly, over 60 per cent - that is, 137 - have chosen to do so.So we have a very significant number of people held unnecessarily, in my view, in detention over a long period of time pursuing matters before our courts when we have a perfectly good and independent merits review  system in place - the one that the Labor Party put in place and believed was the most appropriate way to deal with any appeals in relation to these matters. It is a blatant manipulation of our system. It is one in which the courts are being used as a weapon of delay by people who want to ensure that they are able to remain here in Australia. Further, we have some indications that people who are involved in this trafficking are touting that one of the reasons that they can expand their trade here is the opportunity to exploit judicial review.Yesterday I urged the Labor Party to be supportive of one other matter, and that is in relation to the substantial increasing of penalties for those who are involved in this trafficking. I understand the opposition will agree to increase penalties and I understand that they will agree to attaching it to a bill in the Senate so that we can get it through this session, but when I ask whether or not they will agree to facilitating that through the Senate by way of a guillotine the answer is no. You are either serious about dealing with these matters or you are not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question and for his interest in this historic event of the Indonesian general elections. The Indonesian general elections were a tremendous demonstration of the commitment of Indonesians to exercise their new found democratic freedom in a peaceful way. Over 90 per cent of registered voters have apparently participated. It is too early at this stage to be definitive, but indications so far from our election observers from the Australian Embassy and other sources suggest that the process has been free, fair and peaceful. The Australian Embassy and the observer team have commented on the enthusiasm of voters and the general good-natured spirit of polling across the country.I think all members of the House would agree - and I think all Australians would agree, on reflection - that this Indonesian election is a truly momentous event. For us as a country, we have lived alongside a virtual dictatorship since 1955, and I think in the Australian community that has created a sense of uncertainty, a sense of concern. From now on, we will be living alongside the world's third largest operating democracy. That will give the Australian public a much greater sense of confidence in Indonesia. It will make our relationship with Indonesia easier. It will make it a relationship which garners more public support than has been the case in the past. It is truly an historic event, first and foremost for Indonesia but also for us in this country, to see our neighbour transformed into the world's third largest operating democracy.Australia has plenty to be proud of in this process. We have of course supported the  moves towards democracy in Indonesia. It is worth saying that one of the heroes of this exercise is none other than the President of Indonesia himself, President Habibie, because it is he who put this process into place and it is he who has run the risk of his party being defeated in these elections in an open, free and transparent electoral process. He is the person who, at the end of the day, is responsible for delivering democracy to his country and to that important part of our region.The Australian government has supported this process. We provided $15 million worth of both financial and technical assistance, and we are providing an election observer team that is made up of a number of officials, including members of both houses of parliament. It is led very ably by my friend and colleague - your friend and colleague, Mr Speaker, let me add - Senator Ferguson from South Australia, who has been doing an excellent job. It includes people like the opposition spokesman on defence and the member for Griffith, who it would have to be said is one member of the opposition who has a keen and reasonably objective interest in foreign affairs. It has some useful people on it. -  - No, the member for Kingsford-Smith is not on it. This is an election observer team which makes a useful contribution to the whole of the process. I want to repeat for the benefit of the House that this election is an enormously important event, of course for Indonesia but also for Australia. We should be particularly pleased with the manner in which it has been conducted.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the question. The Minister for Defence has dealt with the question of the circumstances of the awarding of the contract and made it very plain that the procedures followed were completely in accordance with the procurement procedures of the defence department. I am advised that the situation is as follows. The company was established prior to Mr Entsch becoming a parliamentary secretary. He contributed $14,000 to help establish the company. Mr Entsch declared his shareholding on the register of parliamentary members' interests and in his separate return to me. Mr Entsch, so I am told, plays no part in the day-to-day running of the company. This is entirely in the hands of his business partner, with the company's day-to-day financial management in the hands of the accountant. This has been attested to in relation to the operations of the company.Mr Entsch has received no director's or other fees or payments from the company during the time he has been a parliamentary secretary. He made no representations on behalf of the company on this matter. Mr Entsch is a director of the business and is listed as company secretary. As indicated, the management of the company is in the hands of his partner and all day-to-day financial affairs are conducted by its accountant. A copy of the letter from his accountant is attached, demonstrating that Mr Entsch plays no part in the day-to-day affairs of the company, and its financial management is dealt with by the accountant.Under the guidelines of ministerial conduct, Mr Entsch is entitled to have this investment because there is no conflict with his duties. There was no conflict, according to my understanding of the operations of this company, with his duties as a parliamentary secretary.  He should have disclosed his directorship and company secretaryship of Cape York Concrete both on his parliamentary return and in his return to me. Given that he fully disclosed the substantive matter - that is, his shareholding, his financial and his beneficial interests - both to the parliament and to me, I am satisfied that the error he made was an error of inadvertence, and in that I am emboldened by the statement of the person who asked me the question. Quoted in an interview in March last year, in answer to a question about declarations of interest, which I think is the subject of this question, the respondent to the question - his name is shown as Beazley - said:Oh, no. Look, inadvertent slips are totally reasonable and totally to be expected. It's not easy to necessarily have in place every single declaration of comprehension.The parliamentary secretary made the substantive disclosure. He disclosed to me and he disclosed to the Australian public that he had a beneficial interest in this company. He disclosed to the secretary to my department that he effectively owned half of the company. At all times he was completely forthright in responding to those questions.I believe that the failure to list the directorship and the secretaryship, given that he has listed his beneficial and his financial interests, is an inadvertence. In those circumstances, although it is regrettable, I believe it does fall into the category of an inadvertence. I am completely satisfied that, as the parliamentary secretary disclosed the financial interests and his true beneficial ownership in relation to this company, his conduct has been entirely proper. - It is marked `confidential'. However, I am perfectly happy to table for the information of the House a memorandum from Lane Accounting, which deals with the management of Cape York Concrete.</DOC>

 - This is the national forestry policy statement and this accompanying scientific document is the Janus criteria. This policy document was prepared in 1992, and it contains some quite interesting signatures of people who endorsed it at the time. It was, of course, endorsed by the then Prime Minister, Paul Keating. It was endorsed by the then Premier of Western Australia, Dr Carmen Lawrence. In fact, it was endorsed by five leaders of Labor governments and four premiers of conservative state governments. This policy was further endorsed by the coalition in the federal parliament at the time, and it was accepted as our policy. It was endorsed by the scientific community at the time, and it was endorsed because of the Janus criteria document which set down the Carr reserve system.In other words, at the time this particular policy was introduced it was Labor government policy, it had bipartisan support and it was accepted universally as a policy that was best for the forest industry taking account of the various factors involved such as the rights of workers, the rights of the economy and the rights of the environment. All of these matters were supported by everybody, and it is very interesting to note that, fundamentally, as far as forest management, forest ecology and forest economy is concerned, there is practically no change whatsoever.I was asked whether there is any change to this policy. Yes, the government in this parliament has changed in a minor way the compensation measures that are proposed by  in fact saying that on the whole we will continue with compensation but redirect it to business development rather than Labor's policy of business exit. Of course, I am adding to that the fact that in some proposed amendments to the regional forest agreement legislation that I mentioned yesterday there is an amendment that talks about relocating people - in other words, kicking them out of their towns when Labor's policy of closing down the forests, which is their new policy, is introduced.At the last election our government went with the national forest policy statement to the people and, after the election, the Prime Minister charged me with implementing it. We have stuck religiously to that policy. - Thank you, Prime Minister. But the other side of that is that the Labor Party also went to the last election with that policy unchanged. They went off in Tasmania, they went off in New South Wales, they went off in Victoria, and in all the forest electorates they told people that they could trust this policy, that they would get regional forest agreements and that the Labor Party would support them.But what did they do? As soon as they got back here and sat in opposition they did a switch on these people. They went into the Senate and decided to kill off part of this policy, the regional forest agreement legislation. They did that to the detriment of everybody, and to the detriment of the forests as well, because it was the scientists who said that this was a good policy for the ecology of forests. In points 5.2 and 5.4 in this document they make the point that there has to be recognition of social factors, that it is a contributing scientific fact.But isn't it interesting that yesterday in this House when I raised these issues all that the Leader of the Opposition wanted to talk about was some five per cent of votes that he perceived he might win by backing down on this policy? Mr Speaker, this is typical of everything the opposition does. You, Sir, and I have been here a long time. We knew a time when, if either side of parliament had a  policy, they were prepared to stick with it. We now have a policy vacuum in the opposition. They come to this parliament with nothing of substance. All they are doing is running around trying to pick up a few little votes, ignoring their natural constituency, and backing down on promises they made at the last election. Why didn't you tell people you were going to knock off the RFA system before the last election? That would have been reasonable.In closing, I want to come back to this whole policy issue. We have seen it all day today, we see it every day of the week - the negativity of the Labor Party. There is not one thing - be it this policy or anything else. The Leader of the Opposition is a man of some considerable dimensions in terms of his physical stature, but in the policy context he could crawl under a rug and not make a bump.</DOC>

 - Can I say to the Leader of the Opposition that that claim would have some substance if the member had not disclosed his financial interest in the company. Quite plainly, the purpose of disclosure is to discover whether there is any potential conflict of interest. I would have thought that if you disclose your financial interest, your beneficial interest, then that is far more material than an office holding in the company. The reality is that this company was effectively owned by two people - the member for Leichhardt and another person - and my understanding is that they were essentially  equal owners of the company. That was fully disclosed by the member.I would have thought that ownership of the company went more to the question of conflict of interest, because it goes to a beneficial holding rather than the office you hold in the company. Of course, he should have disclosed that he was a director and the secretary as well as being the beneficial owner of half the shares - of course he should have - but in assessing his behaviour and his bona fides I would take an entirely different view if he had neglected to disclose his beneficial interest. The fact that he disclosed his beneficial interest - that he told me and he told the Australian public that he owned half of this company - means that he is hardly pretending to me or to the Australian public that he has no interest in the company.In those circumstances, other than to apply the dictum that you were so happy to hand out when it suited you in March of last year would be completely unreasonable. If we live in a world where somebody who has quite honestly volunteered the fact that he is the half-owner of a company is to be hung because he did not contemporaneously say that he was a director and the secretary of the company, then I think you are substituting form and technicalities for substance. I am satisfied, on the information available to me, that the honourable member has behaved in a bona fide fashion. There is no evidence of a conflict of interest. There is no evidence that improper procedures were followed. There is no evidence that any pressure was exerted in order to win the contract. After all, the whole purpose of disclosure in this place is to avoid conflict of interest. That is the purpose of it. The purpose is to avoid conflict of interest. The man disclosed his beneficial holding. He told the world that he was a part-owner of the company. In those circumstances, I believe that he has behaved with honour and honesty. - I say to the parliament that the whole purpose of these disclosures is to guard against conflict of interest. That is the whole purpose of them; they have no other point. Therefore, I would have thought that what really mattered was the substance. Yes, one can be critical of the member for Leichhardt, which I am, for not including the directorship and the secretaryship, but if the member for Leichhardt had also not included the fact that he was the half-owner of the company then he would be in trouble - and he ought to be in trouble in those circumstances. But that is not his situation. And in those circumstances, as I think the Australian people would want me to do, I will prefer substance over form; and I think the substance is on the side of the member for Leichhardt.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. I am aware of published criticism of the Working Nation program. In his recent book Open Australia  the member for Melbourne said that labour market programs under the former government led:. . . to perverse outcomes, with some unemployed people forced to undertake inappropriate and even demoralising training. Labor MPs regularly encountered people who had done several courses and still had little chance of finding a job.This government is determined to do better, and that is why we have introduced the Work for the Dole program, to get away from the training for training's sake treadmill of Working Nation. While the Labor Party engages in mindless nitpicking and the politics of resentment, this government is getting on with the job.The Work for the Dole program is a success, but we are determined to build on that. We are determined to make a fine program even better. We want more community organisations involved. We want to give more participants a wider range of work experience. So last Friday I announced some changes to the way this program will be managed. We are moving towards a brokered model of managing the scheme. We are introducing community work coordinators to act as intermediaries between the government on the one hand and key community groups and participants on the other. In future, community groups wishing to host Work for the Dole participants will not have to tender themselves, they will simply approach a community work coordinator, and this should result in the possibility of shorter, smaller and more varied projects as well as the projects that are already operating.I am sure the House will be pleased to know that a survey of 3,000 Western Australian teenagers has shown that 80 per cent think that Work for the Dole is a good idea; only 16 per cent disagree with the idea. The survey also found that only one in 10 strongly believed the dole was a right and not a privilege. On this issue, Western Australian teenagers make a lot more sense than the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

It is not my practice to say whether I will or have sought advice, nor is it my practice - as is consistent with past attorneys-generals' practice - to provide advice unless the client who seeks the advice requests me to do it.

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that she has a keen interest in tourism. Australia's tourism industry is one of the big winners from the government's decision to further liberalise international air services. In particular, the tourism industry will benefit from more flights, which means more seats, which means more marketing of those seats internationally, which means more competitive airfares and innovative new travel products.The new arrangements are also great news for the development of tourism in regional areas of Australia. We are looking at the number of tourists to Australia doubling in the next decade - that is, 8.4 million tourists arriving in Australia each year. It is good to see that we are taking some initiatives now to spread the benefits of that growth to our regional and rural parts of Australia. The increasing number of overseas tourists is looking to some of Australia's unique attractions, and many of these are found in regional Australia. This aviation decision builds on the government's initiatives to boost regional tourism, such as our regional tourism program extended to $16 million as well as our domestic tourism campaign, which is under way, for another $16 million.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and, in particular, for his concern about the nursing homes in his electorate. I am sure the nursing homes in the electorates of a number of members, particularly in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales, would be concerned. For only the seventh time since 1974 the Commonwealth is going to exercise its mandatory powers of recall, and it is going to exercise those under section 65F of the Trade Practices Act. Up to 4,500 fire doors are to be recalled from around Australia. The recall will have priority in nursing homes, hospitals and other buildings where the occupants need help to evacuate in the case of fire. These buildings are particularly located in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales.We have ordered the suppliers of the fire doors to identify buildings as a matter of urgency and replace or repair doors and bring them up to appropriate safety standards. The costs, which are significant in this case, are to be met by the suppliers. In this case we are determined to protect consumers. We will constantly use our Trade Practices Act powers to force recalls where in particular cases goods are provided that are a danger to the users of those goods. In this case the CSIRO seized three doors from the actual buildings where they were located and tested them. They failed to meet a one-hour standard - in fact, they were burnt through after only 15 minutes, which is an obvious concern to disabled people and elderly people, who may not be able to evacuate a building quickly. Therefore, we have ordered the recall. We expect action to take place immediately.</DOC>

 - Can I say in response to the honourable member for Bowman that, like a lot of Australians, there are some aspects of this case that, insofar as the allegations are to hand, have disturbed me, as I know they have disturbed honourable members on both sides of the House. I have asked the minister and, through him, his department, and after discussion with him we agreed to establish procedures to try to get to the bottom of the matter and to ascertain all the facts. We have appointed Mr Tony Ayres, a former head of the Department of Defence and somebody who held a high bureaucratic reputation in the eyes of both sides of politics. He was the head of the Department of Social Security under the Hawke government, the head of the Department of Defence under the Keating govern  ment, and also head of Defence in the early years of the current government.I do not seek in any way to cover up anything that may have occurred. On the other hand, it is one of those cases where there are counter-assertions of fact. There are disputed claims being made about the circumstances of what could barely be called a termination at 8½ months. In the eyes of many people, that does amount to murder, whatever the circumstances are. I think that is something that people feel deeply about across the political divide. Because of the emotion that is properly attached to a case like this, I have asked that it be examined carefully. I am satisfied on the information available to me at present that the procedures I have put in place will get to the bottom of it. I have every confidence in Mr Ayres. I do not believe at present that a judicial inquiry is justified. It is important to have in mind a number of considerations obviously about the human rights of the lady in question. We have to get to the bottom of the circumstances of what happened in China as best we can. We should not make undue presumptions or levy undue criticisms at the Chinese authorities without having all of the facts in our possession, and I think it is too early to do that. We are trying to get to the bottom of it. I am serious about doing that, and I will keep the House informed.</DOC>

 - I am aware of a report that was released early this morning under the title: The New Economy? A New Look at Australia's Productivity Performance . This is a truly landmark document in recording the transformation of the Australian economy. It is a document that will repay a very careful study by all Australians, particularly members of parliament, who are interested in Australia's economic future. It bears very heavily on the current debate about the need  for further economic reform. The message from this document is that rewards belong to those countries that are courageous enough to undertake reforms and countries that are willing to undertake reforms will reap very significant dividends. The executive summary contains the following statement:Australia's productivity performance is now at an all-time high. Productivity growth is faster now than in the so-called `Golden Age' of growth around the 1960s.You do not get endorsements any stronger than that. There is a very, very strong message that, if you are willing to undertake reform, if you are prepared to embrace reform, you get dividends. There was a time when the Australian Labor Party was committed to economic reform. When the Labor Party was willing to undertake reforms when it was in government, it had the support of the coalition. But now that the tables are reversed, the Australian Labor Party seeks at every turn to obstruct, to delay, to deny, to retard and to prevent the further modernisation of the Australian economy.The reforms that have delivered this `better than golden age' productivity report by the Productivity Commission must be duplicated in future if we are to maintain the great improvement in the Australian economy. The estimates show that multifactor productivity growth has accelerated to an average of 2.4 per cent a year between 1993-94 and 1997-98 compared with a long-term average of 1.4 per cent a year. In other words, productivity has lifted from a long-term average of 1.4 per cent to a figure of 2.4 per cent. The report goes on to say this:.	 The acceleration has not come from a reduction in labour. In fact, the growth in hours worked over recent years is high by historical standards..	 There is evidence - the report goes on to say - to support the notion of `the new economy' . . . The analysis presented in this paper shows the Australian economy to have taken a new growth path which has opened up possibilities for faster growth and more rapid improvements in living standards.I would have thought that every single member of this parliament would have embraced  this report, would have said that this is a compliment to the commitment of the men and women of Australia to lifting the productivity of this country. It is a compliment to the men and women of Australia for having played their part in lifting the economic performance of this country. Output per hour is now 15 per cent higher than it would have been had Australia continued on the old growth path. Put another way, the growth that would have taken 13 years to achieve on the old growth path has been achieved in six years. The shift in Australia's growth path suggests that Australia has opened up new frontiers of growth possibilities and more rapid pay-offs in terms of contributions to average living standards.This report demonstrates that today's prosperity is a product of yesterday's reforms. It follows from that that tomorrow's productivity gains, tomorrow's prosperity, will be a product of today's reforms. The message in that is very clear: if you are not willing to reform the tax system, if you are not willing to further reform the labour market, if you are not willing to undertake other economic reforms, the gains illustrated in this report will not be won in the years ahead. As a consequence, those who delay and obstruct and deny those further reforms will be rightly condemned by future generations for failing the national interest.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can say that the matters that I think he was referring to were raised in this House last week - certain comments by the Victorian Premier - and, as has been dealt with in this House by a number of members of the government, the Premier of Victoria will be the Premier of Victoria. But what I do want to say in respect of what the government's new tax package is about is that it is about taking off, getting rid of, Labor's iniquitous and inequitable wholesale sales tax. The cost of compliance, of course, has caused enormous difficulties to business, whether they be retailers like Coles Myer or any other sector of the business community in Australia. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I also can indicate, once again, to the House that the government's new tax system will get rid of those iniquitous taxes that were imposed by the states that caused enormous compliance costs to businesses throughout this nation. The new tax system will remove nine of those taxes - including bed taxes and stamp duty on share transactions - and, therefore, reduce the cost of doing business in this country. The House should note that the new tax system will provide enormous benefits to all Australians in the work force with genuine tax cuts - tax cuts, of course, which represent the biggest tax cuts that this nation has seen.We can see this opposition continue to try to hold on to the current system which has caused enormous difficulties to the economy, to business, in this country. They have no solutions, and that was stated, I noted, in something I saw overnight. The Leader of the Opposition said to his party meeting yesterday, `Let us focus on the government when it comes to tax. Let us not have the focus on Labor's solutions.' That is what he has told  his party: `Let us not have the focus on Labor's solutions.' We on this side of the House all know why he does not want to focus on Labor' solutions - because they have no solutions. - Let me conclude by saying this: the new tax system that this government is introducing will bring enormous benefits to business. Labor can persist if they like with nitpicking; they can persist with knocking: but the take out of the Australian people is that the Labor Party are nothing but economics spivs.</DOC>

 - Let me say in answer to the honourable member for Petrie that the government has taken plenty of action to reverse those policies. Every so often, Mr Speaker, you really enjoy eating breakfast - and today was a splendid example. If ever anybody was right on the money it was Martin this morning. He was right on the money when he quite rightly took his colleagues apart for having caved in to the pressure of self-centred sectional interests in the Australian community during the declining years of the Keating Labor government. Let me quote what the member for Batman, the former President of the ACTU, the spokesman on employment and other related matters on the front bench of the Australian Labor Party, had to say:. . . the closer we got to the end of that electoral term, I believe, in some instances we were taken over by a middle-class elite who in essence wanted to make some of those decisions but then wanted to pander to minority interests to try to build a coalition . . . What did happen was that in the latter years of the former Labor government they were run by the noisy minority interest groups of the Australian community. They were totally disinterested in the views of the mainstream of the Australian community and, as a consequence, as the member for Batman quite rightly pointed out, they lost contact with their base. 	 That is nowhere better illustrated than in a number of important areas of economic and social policy. One of those policies relates to the question of job generation in the Australian community. One of the reasons why unemployment peaked at 11.2 per cent under the stewardship of the Leader of the Opposition as minister for employment, why it averaged 8.7 per cent while Labor was in office and why it is now, under the coalition, at a 10-year low, was that, when it came to resource development, the Labor Party caved in to what was an unreasonable environmental position - not a legitimate environmental position, but an unreasonable one. It abandoned tens of thousands of workers in re  source industries by adopting a fashionable position. It has continued to undermine the efforts of this government to protect those industries and those workers. - Martin, you are a statesman today; do not spoil it with that interjection on me. You have really put your finger on what you quite rightly say should be a very important debate within your party. I have got to say, speaking for the government, that we were very heartened to hear the member for Batman say this morning that `the Leader has called for a debate and I intend to be part of that debate.' I say to the honourable member for Batman that he spoke a great deal of commonsense when he said that the former Labor government were dominated by the noisy sectional interests, they lost contact with their working class base, they ignored the needs of ordinary, mainstream Australians and they basically were a party that was taken over by a trendy political point of view. I say that in all of these respects, Mr Speaker, the member for Batman was absolutely correct.I say in response to the member for Petrie that, since taking office, this government has sought at all times to govern for the mainstream of the Australian community. We have sought at all times to do a number of very important things. First and foremost, I am proud to say that we delivered in full and on time the wonderful $2 billion a year family tax initiative. That initiative was designed to help the battlers of Australia, the very people that the member for Batman knew had been abandoned by the party of which he is a member.We have moved to restore balance so far as resource development and caring for the environment is concerned. We agree with the frustration of many union leaders in states like Western Australia, who believe that the Labor  Party - both in Western Australia and nationally - has abandoned the interests of workers so far as the forest industry is concerned.We believe in giving families effective choice. We do not believe - as the member for Batman said the Labor Party believed - in waving fingers at particular sections of the Australian community and deriding the choice of parents of young children to remain full time at home caring for those children while those children are young. I think the member for Batman quite rightly pointed out the fact that you need to adopt policies that give both mothers and fathers of children effective choice as to whether they should receive paid child care or the full-time child care of one or other of the parents.I applaud the courage of the member for Batman in being willing to take on those within his party who seek to hijack the Australian Labor Party to the narrow sectional interests with a very narrow view of what Australian society ought to be. I am proud of the fact that the government I lead has been able at all times to govern for the mainstream of the Australian community. This is not a government that is dictated to by the noisy interest groups. We are not owned by the trade union movement. We are not owned by the business community. We are not owned by any one section of the Australian community. As I look around me, I see the representatives of the great sweep of men and women of Australia. I see a party that represents every section of the Australian community - I see representatives of the workers; I see representatives of small business - and I am very proud of the fact that we have within our ranks a greater number of men and women who have had small business experience than any other government since Federation. In other words, we are for the mainstream of the Australian community.I wish the member for Batman good luck on what will be a long and bitter battle to restore the once great Australian Labor Party to its true working class base. - </DOC>

 - The answer to the first question - have I seen advice from the Secretary to the Treasury? - is no, I have not. I will have a look at that. But I also say this, and one should always put a rider when it comes to a question from the member for Hotham: do not take as being gospel the statements that are built into his question. - I will have a look and I will see. I did actually follow with some interest yesterday the estimates with regard to Treasury. I watched the Labor senators looking for glimmers of hope that might give them some sort of basis for the knocking that has been going on as an excuse for policy when it comes to the economics in this -  - Thank you again, Mr Speaker. To move to the second question, which related to the states, what the government will deliver to the states in the new tax system is a growth tax. Labor opposes a growth tax for the states. That is what it comes down to. They oppose everything, of course, but they oppose a growth tax for the states. The Commonwealth has guaranteed the states that they will get no less than their entitlements under financial assistance grants. They will get that growth tax - something they never ever could have achieved under Labor. Labor was never interested in seeing that particular process work - something that the states have cried out for for many, many years. That is what will be delivered to the states under the government's new tax system.So Mr Speaker, as I have indicated, the Labor Party can continue to knock; they can continue to nitpick. The simple fact is they are not relevant when it comes to economic debate in this country. That irrelevance has been a deliberate decision, it seems, on the part of the Labor Party. The one thing we know about the Labor Party is that they have bought a one-way ticket to policy oblivion and they will stay there for a long time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. The government's  policies for education are designed to ensure that every young Australian has access to a quality education, whether they are in government schools or non-government schools. I am aware of comments from the Australian Education Union and their mouthpiece, the member for Dobell, who speaks on behalf of the Australian Education Union, that the government's policies are in some way discriminating against students in government schools. Let me make several points about this and put the facts on the record. While the federal government provides only 15 per cent of the total direct funding for government schools, in every year of the Howard government funding for government schools through the Commonwealth budget has increased. This year it is 20 per cent more than it was when Labor was in power in 1996. In fact, government schools will see over the next funding period an  increase of $1 billion in funding from the Commonwealth government - an additional $1 billion over the current four-year funding period.I was asked about alternatives. Of course, there is no education policy alternative from the Labor Party except the mouthed cliches from the member for Dobell, and there is going to be even less chance of seeing one now that the Labor Party is consumed in a massive internal policy debate. Friday is the big day when the member for Batman launches a new book which he describes as `a searing criticism of the middle-class trendies who dominated Labor Party policy making'. He is going to strike out on Friday at the chardonnay socialists in the Labor Party.I see from Michelle Grattan's - I am sure factual - column this morning in the Sydney Morning Herald that the member for Batman is concerned that the Keating government `became dominated by the pet subjects of well-heeled, middle-class advisers' who took the party away from its working-class roots. He is obviously thinking of people like the member for Perth, Mr Stephen Smith, and the member for Jagajaga, advisers to the Keating government, who undoubtedly foisted on that government these trendy, middle-class policies which took the Labor Party apart from its  roots. And they have added some chardonnay socialists since then from the Democrats.What we are seeing now is a fight for the soul of the Labor Party, because what the member for Batman wants to do is to bring the Labor Party back to its traditional base. It has lost its working-class base to the coalition. He wants to fight back against members like the member for Werriwa, who wants to break the trade union connection. He is all for traditionalism, he is all for going back to the past of some of those fundamental values - and good luck to him.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. As one who reads the Queensland Country Life  editorials - as he does and many others do: the member for Dawson, the member for Wide Bay - let me make the point that I am delighted with the QCL editorial last week which said that the tax deal is the best thing for country Australia that there has been for a very long time.Both the member for Groom and the member for Forrest have raised with me recent developments with EU food products, particularly arising from the alleged outbreak of dioxin contamination of Belgian stockfeed. This is a very serious issue which has now reached a stage where many supermarket shelves in parts of Asia have been cleared of European goods which are in the categories listed as being at risk.I do not want to dance on the difficulties of a major trading partner and competitor, but I do want to point out that we now have a situation where Austrade has swung into action to connect the many extra demands and proper requests they are getting from supermarkets in Asia with Australian food suppliers - suppliers of clean food and fresh produce from Australia.This builds nicely on some recent breakthroughs including, in February, the launching of Australian chilled pork onto the Singapore market. That is going so well it is already worth, in a matter of just four months, several million dollars to Australian pork producers and to such companies as Watsonia in Western Australia and Bunge in the electorate of Farrer.Austrade is promoting opportunities for Australian companies in the food services sector in South-East Asia, working closely with the Supermarket to Asia strategy - Mr Kennedy and others - the Australian Dairy Corporation and the Australian Meat and  Livestock Corporation. In conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, I am driving further progress to ensure the comprehensive promotion of high quality Australian food products throughout Asia.There are scheduled major trade exhibitions to promote Australian food products and services, including the food and hotel exhibition in Malaysia in September this year - and others to follow. We have a circumstance available to us to further expand our export effort and opportunities in the direction of Asia in a systematic way and, because we were not tied to the minority trendoid advice of the previous government, we are expanding our export efforts to every other part of the world as well. The diversification of our export effort has been markedly successful against the tide.I join with the Prime Minister in congratulating the member for Batman on his wonderful comments this day. The agony on the faces of the femocrats in the Labor Party was a joy to behold. You are invited to cross the floor.</DOC>

 - May I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question and recognise the very, very keen interest that he  takes in family issues - indeed one of the leading advocates of families in this chamber. In fact, this has really been one of the trademarks of the coalition government - its commitment to families. Stronger families certainly mean a stronger society, a stronger Australia. Under the leadership of the Prime Minister this government has made a real commitment to families and improving their lot, contrasting sharply with the performance of the Labor Party during 13 years, which was so ably highlighted by the member for Batman earlier today.The very creation of the Department of Family and Community Services is a demonstration that this government is determined to focus policy outcomes on families and to build the sort of organisation at government level which delivers real outcomes to families. So there has been a range of new programs, like the partnerships against domestic violence, the Relate program, the family orientation of many of the support initiatives that have been undertaken, extra child-care places, the focus on early intervention to try and prevent family breakdown and to ensure that families are given every possible assistance to stay together whenever a crisis arises. All of those things are measures to assist families to become stronger.But, in addition to that, this government is addressing in a very serious way the issues of family income and in particular the decline in circumstances of single income families, a matter that was highlighted earlier in the week by the NATSEM study and highlighted again very effectively, I thought, this morning by the member for Batman. He was absolutely right when he pointed to the fact that Labor have turned their back on the working classes, have turned their back on the poorest single income families - the Norms of the tax debate sitting in their armchairs while it all goes by, sipping their beers, or, if the member for Batman is right, chardonnay these days - as they have moved towards their interest in the double income - the upwardly mobile families.The key thing of interest in the NATSEM study was the way in which family incomes under Labor had fallen by $24 a week. The  single income families, the battlers - the sorts of people that Labor in the past had always said that they were standing up for - were the sorts of people that did poorly under Labor government. So, when we introduced our new tax package, it included specific measures to assist single income families. The new structure, from July 2000, will provide an extra $2½ billion of assistance for families, helping the people that the member for Batman is now expressing some interest in, the sorts of people that were neglected by his party when in government.In particular, single income families will benefit - those with children under five years, an increase of $350 a year - and that kind of increased assistance flows through into the tax cuts. Effectively, a single income family with a child under five will not pay tax on their first $13,000 worth of income - and they are real benefits to the battlers, real benefits to single income families to ensure that they are able to play their role in building stronger families. And again it contrasts so much with Labor. Labor's social security policy was a flimsy five pages in their policy document. Indeed they have lost their way; they have no idea where to provide the sorts of supports that families need. The light on the hill has become the dimmest of glimmers. Labor have lost their social conscience. It is up to this side of the House to deliver for Australian families and in particular single income families.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. He is obviously interested in this issue and very much aware of the implications - that our failure to address the judicial review issue in relation to asylum claims in particular can have a very deleterious effect not only on the people who are involved in these matters but also on the access of other Australians to our court system where they are entitled to expect they will receive expeditious treatment in relation to the matters that they are litigating.The fact is that a staggering 65 per cent of the Federal Court's administrative law case load is now made up of immigration matters. The bulk of these relate to failed asylum claims. In 1997-98 there were 1,045 applications to the Federal Court seeking judicial review on migration matters. This year there has already been 1,148 applications lodged. Tellingly, 47 per cent of applicants withdraw before the matter reaches the judge. They put  their claim into the system and then walk away from it when it is at the door of the court.The fact is that this unmeritorious case load is clogging up the system and leading to very significant indirect costs being borne by the rest of the community. It is delaying Australian litigants. The Law Reform Commission recently undertook a study in relation to these matters. In relation to that, although immigration issues are seen as being less complex and involving less pre-hearing events and less hearing time than other cases, they nevertheless occupy on average 6.7 months before they are able to be dealt with and are obviously having an impact on the average duration of all other cases. The court is trying to expedite these matters, but it is having to do so with enormous difficulty.The former Labor government saw these as serious issues and introduced amendments to part 8 of the Migration Act to limit access to judicial review. The provisions in part 8 were recently reviewed by the Federal Court and upheld as being a valid exercise of power, and that was a very appropriate decision, I might say. The High Court had something to say when it looked at this issue in relation to the proposed judicial review changes that this government has in mind, that is, in relation to a privative clause. - Yes, and I'll tell you about that, too. - What the High Court had to say was that a privative clause would be constitutional. In the obiter dictum that was given, a privative clause would be constitutional. That has been one of the main arguments the advocates have tried to advance to you to change your approach on these matters. But the second point the court made is that at the moment with part 8 operational some people cannot pursue their claims before the Federal Court but they can access the High Court. The High Court was saying, `If  you are going to stop cases coming to us that are unmeritorious and an abuse of process, you need to have provisions which operate in relation to both the High Court and the Federal Court in exactly the same way.' That is what the High Court was saying: `If you are going to stop us getting this case load, make sure the Federal Court is operating on the same basis.' By implication, they said that a privative clause would be constitutional and I think you are safe in drawing the conclusion that the High Court was saying that a privative clause is appropriate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. The Centenary of Federation in 2001 is a year full of promise. A large number of events, programs and projects are being planned by the National Council for the Centenary of Federation, a body established by all Australian governments to coordinate events and activities for the year. The year will start with a televised dawn ceremony at Australia's heart, Uluru. We will then be reminded of where our nationhood started with a parade through the streets of Sydney and a re-enactment of the Proclamation of Federation in Centennial Park.The Centenary will spotlight a whole range of important political events, such as the opening of the first parliament in Melbourne during May. It will recall times when Australians were called on to defend their nation, and it will celebrate Australian endeavour and much more. One of the highlights will be the opening of the new National Museum on Acton Peninsula here in Canberra in March, which will be the flagship of the Commonwealth's Centenary celebrations. We will commemorate the first crossing of our nation by rail - and there have been some strong proponents of that project within the government, namely, the Deputy Prime Minister. We will commemorate the founding of our national airline, Qantas, and there will be a week-long festival in Central Australia to celebrate traditional and contemporary indigenous culture.So it is a year that will be marked with dignity, and it will be remarkable in that we will educate Australians not only about our history but about what it means to be an Australian. It will incorporate our indigenous community, our diversity, our sporting heroes, our artists, our scientists, our youth, our cities and our bush. The Centenary of Federation is, I am sure all members will agree, a rare opportunity for us to share the pride we feel in the progress of our nation, to tell our own stories and to support and encourage all Australians to participate.In drawing to conclusion, I wish to pay tribute to one person who is immensely proud to be an Australian - ultra-marathon runner  Pat Farmer. As many, if not all, members would recall, on 31 May Pat set out on a historic journey from Canberra to run around Australia for the Centenary of Federation. Pat is running an average of 70 kilometres a day over the next seven months to help spread the word of the Centenary of Federation. He will finish in Sydney on 1 January 2000 and will set a new record for running around our vast continent. Like Pat's once in a lifetime run, the Centenary of Federation is a unique opportunity for all Australians to declare and show their love for their country and plan our future with confidence.</DOC>

 - On the information available to me, the parliamentary secretary is not in breach of the guidelines. It is the case that he would have signed an annual return - that is the case. That does not, of itself, mean that he is in breach of the guidelines. It does not mean that he should no longer be a parliamentary secretary, because there is nothing in the guidelines which says that the directorships of private companies  should be resigned. It depends entirely upon the activities of those private companies.It is the case that, as I indicated yesterday from the very beginning when these questions were raised, in completing his parliamentary return, and also the return to me, the parliamentary secretary in question did not, in relation to those companies of which he was a shareholder and simultaneously an office holder, record the fact that he was both. - Yes, I did. I did ask him why. In the explanation that he has given, and in the explanation that I understand he has now given to the Clerk of the House - and I will read out the explanation that he has given to the Clerk of the House; as is clearly going to be the case, the parliamentary secretary will have an opportunity later this day to say something personally about these matters - he said on the third page of the statement:I filled in the registered directorships of companies section, believing that this section related only to directorships and secretaryships but did not involve any ownership in the mentioned companies. Having already noted my shareholdings, I believed I was not required to make further mention of these companies.On further advice, I am now aware that I made an inadvertent error and I would like to correct my record. I am in fact a director of the three companies made mention of in the shareholdings in public and private companies sections, and these companies are Septennial Holdings, Vervale and Cape York Concrete. I am also the secretary of Vervale and of Cape York Concrete. The companies currently listed in the registered directorships of companies section of my statement are companies that I have no financial shareholdings in. These companies are Deugro Australia and Deugro Northern Territory.He goes on to say:These omissions were an honest oversight on my behalf and my declaration was completed in good faith and clearly with the intention of declaring all of my interests. I apologise for any inconvenience in relation to that.He went on to say:It should be emphasised that at all times I disclosed my financial and beneficial interest in these companies.As I said yesterday in answer to another question from the Leader of the Opposition,  the whole purpose of these disclosures is to determine whether there is any conflict of interest. The thing that determines a conflict of interest is the financial or beneficial interests that somebody has in a company.What this man has done is to incorrectly complete his form, but in the process he has disclosed, on the information available to me, the beneficial and financial interests that he holds in these companies. Also in the course of yesterday's questioning and this morning's reporting, questions have arisen about the constitutional position of the member as a member of parliament. Reference has been made to section 44(v) of the Constitution and it has been suggested by the Labor Party that in some way he might be disqualified from sitting in this place. I have received, and propose to table, an opinion from the Acting Solicitor-General of Australia, Mr Henry Burmester QC -  - I seek to table -  -  - The opinion from the Acting Solicitor-General, Mr Henry Burmester, dated today and which I table, says, amongst other things, that he was asked to advise on the application of section 44(v) to Mr Warren Entsch. In the course of the opinion - and I ask the members of the House to listen to this conclusion carefully because it goes to the heart of what is at issue - he records:In the present case, Mr Entsch, through the legal framework of a company, is essentially involved as a sleeping partner in a business operation in relation to which he has no day-to-day knowledge or practical control of the activities undertaken.Mr Burmester goes on to say:In my view, on the authority of the Webster case and on the basis of the facts provided, Mr Entsch is not disqualified under section 44(v) of the Constitution. This is because the agreement made between CYC and the Department of Defence is not the type of agreement that falls within section 44(v) and no pecuniary interest in the agreement arises from his financial exposure to the company or as a shareholder.That is an opinion that has been provided by the Acting Solicitor-General of Australia. It is the opinion of a man who has advised both sides of politics in relation to legal matters  and those in the opposition who seek to deride that opinion are deriding the professional views of a man who has given very faithful advice to governments of both political persuasions. On the basis of that opinion, the arguments advanced by the Labor Party in relation to Mr Entsch's holding of seat in the parliament are baseless.</DOC>

 - I did not mislead the parliament. The situation is that, as attested to by the Department of Defence, the correct purchasing procedures were followed. It is also the case that the honourable member for Leichhardt was not aware of the contract until after it had been entered into with the defence department.

If a contract is entered into before you know about it, how on earth can you have behaved improperly?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for that question. I can inform him that the government continues to be extremely concerned about the possible action to be taken by the United States that will restrict Australia's lamb exports. There has been no decision yet from the United States on recommendations from its trade commission which are aimed at restricting Australia's lamb exports. There are reports which suggest that even harsher restrictions are being sought by members of Congress compared with those recommended by the trade commission. It remains our position that no justification exists for any restrictions at all; that this has been a deservedly well and hard-won market for very competitive Australian exporters. It would be a travesty of the  principles of freer and open trade if the Australian exporters were to be punished by the imposition of American restrictions.The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade has, as always, been particularly active on behalf of Australian exporters. He has spoken not only to Charlene Barchevsky, the American special trade representative; he has spoken to the United States Ambassador. Tonight he will be attending, with the member for Hume, a public meeting at Harden abattoirs, organised by the National Farmers Federation and lamb producers, to protest the Australian case.In addition, I can inform the House that this morning I spoke directly on the telephone to President Clinton to convey the concern of the Australian government about possible United States action. I indicated during the conversation with the President that, if this action were taken, it would be regarded more seriously than any other restrictive trade action taken by the United States during recent years. I pointed out to the President that the market that had been won by the Australian exporters had been won fairly; that if in fact the Americans imposed restrictions, it would send a deplorable signal to those other countries around the world that are less committed to freer and more open trade, particularly for agriculture.He is aware, and I took the opportunity of emphasising the point, that it is in Australia's interest to have a freer trading environment for agriculture, and that if a nation such as the United States which espouses the principles of freer trade practises the opposite that provides an excuse and a reason why countries which do not espouse the cause of freer trade are unwilling to take the steps that are necessary. I think as the result of the conversation the United States government, in the person of its President, is under no doubt as to the deep concern felt in this country as to the possibility of any negative action being taken by the United States authorities.I also took the opportunity during our telephone conversation to briefly receive from him a report on the latest steps towards a settlement of the military action in the former Yugoslavia. The President expressed great  optimism about the prospects of the deal that is now being concluded actually sticking and actually working, and he sounded very enthusiastic about the prospects of it being durable and effective on this occasion. I took the opportunity to express the appreciation of the Australian government for the leadership role that has been taken by the United States as the principal power in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.During the conversation I also reminded the President of the great concern entertained by all Australians about the fate of the two aid workers, the two CARE workers - Mr Pratt and Mr Wallace. I asked that, consistent of course with his other responsibilities and the other responsibilities of the United States administration, every effort be made on our behalf to press the case for the immediate release of Pratt and Wallace - two men who were on humanitarian work in the former Yugoslavia, two men who were not spies, two men who should be united with their families as soon as possible.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his excellent question. There is some encouraging news in the figures released this morning. I can tell the House that the teenage unemployment rate is down to its lowest since 1991. The actual number of teenage unemployed is at its lowest since records were first kept in 1978. I can tell the House that only 5.3 per cent of the total population of 15- to 19-year-old people are unemployed. That is the good news.The less encouraging news is that, despite creating over 400,000 jobs since March 1996, despite the fact that this government has now created more jobs than the Leader of the Opposition destroyed in Labor's recession, total unemployment is still 7.5 per cent. This government has always tried to bring unemployment down. There is no magic wand. What government needs to do is create a climate in which jobs will grow. Thanks to the government's policies, confidence is high, economic growth is strong, inflation is low and interest rates are at their lowest in 30 years. So we have created the best possible climate in which unemployment can fall.I have been asked about impediments to further falls in unemployment. If the member for Batman is serious about driving the politically correct trendies out of the Australian Labor Party, he will tell his colleagues to pass the government's legislative program, particularly the junior wage bill.</DOC>

 - I am advised that the procedures undertaken are in accordance -  -  - I am advised that the procedures undertaken by the defence department are totally in accordance with the requirements. So, relating to the letter of 14 January, this letter was written by the project manager, GHD, for the Air Force at the base, Scherger. -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The letter is written by GHD to the Department of Defence representing their position as the project manager. In this the RAAF had sought from them the specifications for reinforcement concrete, joining material, timber and other parts for minor work. They advised in that letter that there were three potential contractors: McCosker, Dinkum and Boral. The department then, in accordance with the chronological order that I have got here -  -  - Chronological - I don't know what you are talking about. On 14  January the letter was received; on 27 January the specifications and drawings of the works to headquarters of Air Force Command including the list of local suppliers; on 9 March the office rang Boral and Cape York Concrete - and I am advised this - to ascertain costs and availability of concrete. On 12 March Cape York Concrete provided written quotes. In March 1999 the office received a copy of the Boral concrete price list. - On 30 March Defence project -  - Defence project delivered branch to raise a purchase order to action their request. On 31 March the office rang the staff of Cape York Concrete for a revised quote. Cape York Concrete provided the written quote. The whole procedure is, as the Prime Minister said, totally in order with the proceedings. - The opposition has no concept of contracting. It is quite clear that orders under $250,000 do not have to have written tenders. Under that quote the work was sought on that basis. I am advised that RAAF wanted to do this work itself and it sought concrete from the people who provide concrete, not the contracting work of engineers. As a result of that, the two people who make the concrete were approached.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I appreciate that he is showing interest in a matter of policy importance. I have indeed seen reports that the opposition, either through ignorance or ideological bias, intends to hold up the passage of the Stevedoring Levy (Collection) Amendment Bill 1999  through the Senate. It might be worthwhile explaining to the House why it is in the interests of the broader Australian community as well as stevedoring employees that this be passed expeditiously.The government established the Maritime Industry Finance Company, MIFCo, to ensure that stevedoring reform would be undertaken at no cost to the Australian taxpayer. MIFCo borrows funds on the commercial market. It then provides them to stevedoring companies to pay for qualifying redundancies which meet the government's reform objectives. Funds are then appropriated to MIFCo to enable it to repay its borrowings, and the government recoups the appropriation through the stevedoring industry levy.Originally, when we established the reform program we expected that $250 million would be sufficient. But the success of reform, the higher than anticipated demand for redundancies -  - I have been challenged to tell you about the crane rates, and I will in a moment. - Yes, it was. Your side is circulating misinformation, so you may be interested in the facts. - The higher than anticipated demand for redundancies means that an extra allocation is needed. For the information of the House, the original $250 million appropriation was expected to be spent in the following way: $148 million for redundancy packages, $50 million for interest, $2 million for administration, $10 million to provide that stevedoring workers receiving redundancies from the WA government receive packages at the industry standard and $40 million for non-redundancy reform such as occupational health and safety programs, training programs, new technology and improvement of wharf facilities.The higher than expected demand means that we now need to look at $195 million for redundancy packages, $105 million for interest, $6 million for administration, $4 million for WA redundancies, $30 million for non-redundancy reforms and $10 million for contingencies in case MIFCo's interest or redundancy estimates are exceeded.It needs to be said that MIFCo is in the process of negotiating these arrangements with its lenders. They will not be able to borrow sufficient funds without this legislation being in place to meet the government's objectives and the legitimate expectations of the stevedoring employees. Let us be quite clear on this: MIFCo does not currently have the resources to meet the expected redundancy claims. The main parties which suffer from the opposition's decision to delay the legislation will be those who are taking voluntary redundancies and expect to be able to access redundancy funds provided through MIFCo. Alternatively, it may be that the stevedoring companies are forced to either delay reform or bear unnecessary costs. Members of stevedoring unions will know where to look when they want support for their objectives in this reform process. - I have been challenged to say something about the reform process. It is worth noting that if you look at Patricks' Melbourne terminal -  - They do not want to hear. It is very interesting. They do not want to know about it. - All right, Mr Speaker, I will come back to the point. The point is that Patricks has reported, in relation to its Melbourne terminal, that it is moving 20 per cent more containers than last year with a work force half the size. Here is the one those opposite really don't like - the average crane rate has improved from 19 to 26 moves per hour and rates of 30 to 35 are being reported on a regular basis, not only exceeding what we requested in our benchmarks but also exceeding what the Labor Party's representative said was possible in this country as they talked down the capacity of Australian workers. Patricks expects comparable performances at its Sydney terminal following completion of an equipment upgrade. The recent survey of Melbourne ports by the Victorian employers' Chamber of Commerce and Industry showed very improved levels of confidence and acceptance of performance amongst port users. This legislation should not be delayed; it ought to be moved through quickly.</DOC>

 - I have not read the transcript of that interview. - I have long learnt, particularly in relation to the bloke who just interjected, that you never take on face value a representation of what somebody on this side said when it comes from the other side. I have read a minute from Mr Rod Corey, the Head of Defence Estate, dated 8 June addressed to the Minister for Defence. Let us just understand the practicality and the realism of this situation. You are dealing here with decisions that are taken in a relatively remote part of Australia. You are dealing with decisions that are taken by delegates of the Secretary to the Department of Defence. The idea that the minister or the head of the department should be involved in a local decision in relation to the awarding of a relatively minor piece of work in relation to some concrete for RAAF Scherger - the idea that he should be involved in it - is plainly ludicrous. It illustrates the total lack of commercial reality that exists on the other side of the parliament.I read simply one paragraph from Mr Corey, the Head of Defence Estate. This is out of the minute that was addressed to the Minister for Defence.5. The delegate was satisfied that CYC clearly provided the best value for money to the Commonwealth.Let me say that again: CYC clearly provided the best value for money to the Commonwealth. It continued:A purchase order was raised and concrete delivered by CYC and laid by the RAAF personnel. That was the view of Mr Corey. That was the advice that was provided to the Minister for Defence.I would make the further point that, on all the information that has come to me - and nothing has been presented to this parliament or to the public to suggest otherwise - the member for Leichhardt did not know about this contract between CYC and the Defence Department until after the company had been given the contract and after the commencement of the work. That is the advice that has been given. In the absence of any evidence that countermands that, how on earth can anybody - let us strip aside all the references to other procedures and go to the simple proposition: was he or was he not involved in anything improper? The answer is clearly no.This parliament and the Australian public are interested in issues of propriety. If he had brought undue influence to bear, if he had used his position to win this contract for the company, you would be entitled to blame him. If you are able to produce evidence that he nobbled somebody at RAAF Scherger, you would be entitled to blame him. But so far the evidence clearly is that he had absolutely no knowledge of this contract until after it had been let, and indeed, as I am advised, after the work had been commenced. That is the single unassailable fact on the information currently available to the parliament. You can rant on about other things; nothing alters the fact that this man knew nothing about this contract until after it had been let.That is the evidence that has so far been produced. I have been given no information to suggest that that is not the case. I have satisfied myself, on inquiry to the member, that that is the case. In those circumstances, I stand by the assertion I made yesterday, and I repeat today, that there has been no allegation of impropriety established against the member for Leichhardt. The member for Leichhardt was in error, as other members have been in error, in completing his pecuniary interests form, but he disclosed his financial interest in the company. He made no attempt to disguise his financial interest in the company. He did not try to interfere in the process that led to the awarding of the con  tract, because he did not know about it. In those circumstances, I think the Australian public wants the opposition to get back to real issues.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question of substance and one of real interest to the Australian people. I also acknowledge the work and the interest that she shows in the economic matters of government. I am pleased to advise the House that the Australian economy continues to perform well against the backdrop of international economic turmoil. Today's labour force release shows that the unemployment rate remains at decade lows of 7.5 per cent. - This, of course, stands in stark contrast to the unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent in December 1992 when the Leader of the Opposition was then the minister for employment. In fact, it has taken some eight years to recover from the effects of Labor's recession that we had to have. The main precursor to employment growth is strong activity growth, and the economy is leading the world in growth, growing by some 4.8 per cent through the year to the March quarter 1999. Over 400,000 jobs have in fact been created under this government, and the ANZ job ads remain supportive of further employment growth, rising by 1.3 per cent in May. The ANZ chief economist, Saul Eslake, stated: The continued strength in job advertising is consistent with other evidence of buoyant business confidence and robust growth in economic activity.The Productivity Commission report that was released yesterday, and which was referred to by the Prime Minister in this House yesterday, reviewed Australia's productivity performance. It found that Australia's productivity performance is now at an all-time high and that the productivity acceleration over recent years is due to very strong growth in output and did not come from a reduction in labour.The ACCI Westpac survey of industrial trends for the June quarter, which was released on Tuesday of this week, shows that the Australian economy is continuing to perform strongly. Mr Bill Evans, Westpac General Manager of Economics, stated:This survey confirms our view that the Australian economy remains robust, with no sign of the much anticipated slowdown. Indeed, the activity measures indicate that growth is accelerating and expectations are the most buoyant that we have seen since the mid-1990s.The National Australia Bank monthly business survey for May, which was also released last Tuesday, shows that business conditions remain at around the highest level since 1997 when the monthly survey commenced. The NAB's Chief Economist, Alan Oster, commented:Overall, the national survey points to another very strong performance by the non-farm business sector in May, with few signs of any slowdown in domestic activity during the June quarter.It is the achievements of this government that have resulted in strong growth, low inflation, mortgage interest rates that are at their lowest for a generation, the third budget surplus in a row, and the prospect of completely eliminating Commonwealth net debt. This shows that the policies of this government for the past three years have made a significant contribution to the strong economy which Australia is experiencing. The policies of this government will maintain that growth in the future. This stands in stark contrast to Labor's policies. Labor's policies are simply to oppose. </DOC>

 - I think there are a lot of members on this side of the House who would like to take the Leader of the Opposition on a tour of rural areas, and he would learn the meaning of the expression `asset rich and income poor'. He would learn that it is quite possible for something to be making no money even though it maintains assets. As to the context of the remarks made by the member for Leichhardt, as he demonstrated yesterday, he is perfectly capable - and very effectively so - of speaking for and answering for himself.I state the general proposition that there is nothing inconsistent with an assertion that you are not making any money out of something even though that something has a great number of assets that you are trying to dispose of - which I understand to be the position in relation to Vervale. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. I am aware that the Australian Education Union and its fellow travellers are today co-hosting an event at which they will no doubt continue to make untrue and misleading statements about school funding. For its own ideological reasons, the Australian Education Union and its mouthpiece in this place, the member for Dobell, continue to run a divisive campaign of untruths about government school funding.The Australian Education Union keeps on running down government schools at every opportunity. It keeps telling people in this country that government schools are being run down. It keeps damaging the government schools sector and it does so in the interests of a cynical campaign based on the politics of envy. It hopes to mislead parents in the community about what is actually happening as a result of the government's policy to provide quality education for every young Australian. Today I have seen a press release announcing this activity from the Australian Education Union and so-called parents bodies which contains the following statement: `The 1999-2000 budget is an attack on public schools.'This is so ludicrous that you have to speculate about the motives of people who would make a statement of this kind. This is a statement about a budget which this year is committing to government schools 20 per cent more funding directly through the Commonwealth budget than the Labor Party committed in 1996. This is a budget which will deliver over the next four-year funding period almost $1 billion more to government schools than they will receive during the current funding period, and this is despite the fact that the Commonwealth government provides only 15 per cent of direct funding to government schools.What these people do not like is the fact that the government set out in this budget to address the gross inequities suffered by low income working-class parents who wanted to exercise educational choice. They do not like parents having the right to choose their school. As Mr Peter Crimmins, the Executive Officer of the Australian Association of Christian Schools, said on the budget, `Choice in schooling is now a reality for working-class Australian families.' This government is committed to choice and quality of education for every young Australian and it is time the Labor Party and its union backers stopped trying to talk down the government system in this country and recognised the right of all parents to accurate information and educational choice.</DOC>

 - With the greatest respect to the ABC PM  program and also to the Courier-Mail , I do not normally rely exclusively on either of those news outlets for information relating to the activities of any of my colleagues. I have sought advice from the member for Leichhardt and I am satisfied on the advice that he has given me that he is not involved in the day-to-day activities of Vervale. I am also satisfied on the information he has given me that there are not many activities of Vervale, for the reasons that have already been outlined by the member for Leichhardt.It is true that it is an obligation of ministers and parliamentary secretaries to devote their energies and their time to their duties. It is also the case that it has long been recognised on - I thought until now - both sides of the House that, when people entered the ministry or became a parliamentary secretary, it was possible for them to retain the assets that they had and the company arrangements they had, provided there were not conflicts between their private interests and their public duty. That takes me back to a challenge I threw out earlier in question time, and that is that, if this is about propriety, then where is the evidence of impropriety by the member for Leichhardt? It is true -  - It is very interesting that as soon as you -  - No, I am not shifting the ground, I am addressing the ground. This is all about honourable conduct. There is no evidence that this man has behaved dishonourably. There is evidence that he was careless in completing his pecuniary interests form, but it would be a very brave Leader of the Opposition who got up and asserted that no person on his side of the House had ever been careless in completing his or her pecuniary interests form, a very brave opposition leader indeed! Let me say on this side of the House that in the words of the opposition leader - in an interview he had with Glenn Milne a couple of years ago - `inadvertent slips happen all of time'. Of course they do, and the Leader of the Opposition has acknowledged that. I agree with him that from time to time that can occur.What we are looking for here is evidence of bad faith. What we are looking for here is evidence of a minister who abused his position. There is no evidence that Warren Entsch abused his position, none whatsoever. There is no evidence that he has broken the code in relation to the day-to-day conduct of his business. I have satisfied myself on the information that he has provided to me that he has not breached that part of the code and I therefore reject the charge made by the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Herbert for his question and his continued interest in the rural workers in his electorate of Herbert, and also the adjoining electorates of Dawson and Kennedy, who have benefited greatly from the policies of this government over the past three or four years: policies that have delivered sound  economic management, that have delivered strong growth, that have delivered lower interest rates and lower inflation - something the Labor Party could not do in 13 years in office. We have delivered -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would like to inform the House of some very positive improvements in employment in rural industries in Australia. In the rural sector, under Labor, the last statistic was 404,000 people employed. Under the coalition government, that has moved up to 437,000 people employed. That is an increase of 33,000 jobs in rural industries - or eight per cent - during the time that this government has been managing the affairs of this nation. It is through those economic policies that have delivered $540 million worth of interest rate cuts per annum to rural Australia - the lowest interest rates in 30 years in this country - through policy settings that have delivered an increase in exports of food products to Asia in the first quarter of this year by 14 per cent, and through policies that have delivered much more flexible workplace relations in this country, particularly in rural Australia, that we have delivered those benefits and those policy settings that have provided the framework and the opportunity for employment growth, particularly in rural industries in Australia - and that needs to be recognised.Contrast that position with the position of the Labor Party and its fellow travellers. I instance a particular circumstance at the moment where the Labor Party's fellow traveller, mate and key underwriter, the AWU, is denying pay increases to rural workers and their families this year, this month. The latest behaviour of the Australian Workers Union, in its refusal to sign off on a more flexible working arrangement in their award for pastoral workers, is denying pay increases to rural workers and their families.  This typical pig-headedness of the AWU means that thousands of rural workers in the bush will miss out on pay rises on 1 July. This is the typical attitude of the unions and the Labor Party. They are not prepared to move forward, not prepared to embrace change and not prepared to embrace improvements in the way that the structures in this country work. They just want to continually oppose beneficial arrangements that are going to flow to all Australians. We are about putting together a strong economic structure in which rural Australia can operate in this country. We are proposing a tax reform package which unashamedly benefits rural Australia. Out of that tax reform package there will be reduced input costs, for the average farm, of $7,500. That goes all the way towards improving employment prospects in rural Australia. Our $12 million income tax cuts will directly benefit workers in rural Australia. We are working with Australia's rural industries to create a much stronger economic environment and we will deliver more jobs growth from that much better working environment - unlike the Labor Party and the AWU.</DOC>

 - In response to the member for Barton's question, I have taken the view that I ought not require the resignation of the member for Leichhardt, because his failure to record his directorship - and, in the case of one of the companies, his secretaryship - was not as part of a pattern of behaviour designed to deny to the Australian public knowledge of his financial and pecuniary interests in those companies. The honourable member whose responsibilities for law in the opposition would, I am sure, instruct him to understand that what really matters in relation to a company is your financial stake. Once you have a financial stake in a company, your interest in the fortunes of that company tend to accelerate. -  - Mr Speaker, the honourable member for Barton asked me a serious and thoughtful question, and I am endeavouring to answer it in a constructive fashion and I do not think the Leader of the Opposition is helping his colleague by interjecting. What really matters in relation to the disclosure of pecuniary interests in this place is what light they shed on potential conflicts of interests. The reason why I am sticking by the member for Leichhardt is that he did not seek to camouflage his pecuniary and financial interests in the company. I am also sticking by him because there is no evidence that he abused his position as a member of parliament or as a parliamentary secretary.I am also sticking by him because, on the evidence available to me, in a practical day-to-day commonsense understanding of the word and the terms and the activities in the commercial operations of companies, he was not involved in the day-to-day operation of the company. And that is the evidence that has been presented. I am adopting a practical, commonsense approach. I appeal to those opposite who are interested in having sensible, workable guidelines of ministerial behaviour and not an intricate cobweb of legal rules. I would warn those who gloat on the opposition front benches that, if we ever in this country get to a situation where you are out if you commit a technical breach where there is no evidence of corruption, no evidence of malevolence, no evidence of abuse of power and no evidence of personal greed or personal enrichment, we will reduce this place to an arena where few people of ability, talent and aspiration would want to enter.There is a lot at stake in this. If you can produce any evidence that this man has been corrupt, if you can produce any evidence that he has abused his position or sought to unduly influence members of the Australian Public Service, then you might have a case. But, until you do that, I do not think you get to first base.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question because it gives me the opportunity to remind the House of the veterans' entitlements that are available to veterans of war and conflicts. I remind the House that Gulf War veterans are also entitled to medical and financial support in the same way as veterans of any other conflict. In fact, the Department of Veterans' Affairs has already received applications from 213 veterans of the Gulf War with a range of conditions since the cessation of that conflict.  Approximately 140 claimants with a range of different illnesses and injuries have been successful, which proves that the current system is working. If Gulf War veterans prove that the injuries or the illnesses they suffer are a direct result of Gulf War service, they may be entitled to a range of benefits, including a white or gold health treatment card to cover their health costs. They may also be eligible for a disability pension. I also advise the House that the government also meets the costs of diagnosis and treatment of a veteran's illness if it is war caused.There has been speculation regarding the existence of Gulf War syndrome. The Department of Defence and my department are in touch with the United States and the United Kingdom which had substantially larger numbers than we did involved in the Gulf War. There is as yet no internationally accepted medical or scientific consensus of a Gulf War syndrome. But we do acknowledge that most conflicts and the Gulf War resulted in veterans with illnesses and injuries from that service. I repeat that 140 veterans of the 1,650 who served in the Gulf War have been successful with claims that they say are - and that have been proven to be - the result of their service in the Gulf War. In fact, we are also studying the health of 213 veterans who have made claims against the department.Critics can play semantics about whether or not the government recognises a syndrome. What we are concentrating on is giving veterans with war caused illnesses the care that they deserve. One hundred and forty veterans of the Gulf War are receiving that from my department, which demonstrates that the system works. It works for Gulf War veterans just as it has for veterans of other conflicts and other wars. I encourage veterans who feel that they have a claim to contact the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The good news is that since we came to government there are another 70 agencies or over the counter shopfronts of the Department of Veterans' Affairs through Centrelink or through state government agencies where veterans can make those claims. That is the other good news.</DOC>

 - The question of whether there is a financial gain would depend -  - Well, it is still a gain. -  - There is no law in this country or there is no code in relation to ministers or parliamentary secretaries that asserts that you cannot have an income stream separate from your parliamentary remuneration.  - There is no law that says you cannot do that either. Are you seriously saying that when somebody becomes a minister or a parliamentary secretary they are forever forbidden from having any kind of pecuniary gain from any other source? Is that your argument? That is the basis of the question, and it is a plainly ludicrous one.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is true that in the past every second Thursday was pension day but, from the beginning of next month, pensioners will be able to choose the day on which they receive their pension payments. Pension day can be any day. Centrelink has already provided information to pensioners about their new options and a significant number of people - in fact, around 60,000 pensioners - have already indicated that they want to be paid on a different day. They are choosing Wednesdays, Fridays - all sorts of days that suit their particular needs.Some Commonwealth Bank and St George Bank customers have another issue that they may wish to consider when choosing when their pension should be paid. In the past, the Commonwealth Bank and St George have adopted the practice of making the pension payments available a day earlier than they actually received the money from the government. Even though they received the funds on a Thursday, they allowed pensioners to access that money on a Wednesday. The new payment cycles project is dependent upon faster  processing of data. That is going to mean that there will be more accurate payments and people will be paid for every day for which they are entitled, rather than having to wait for the first payment date before they receive any benefits. So there are real benefits to pensioners from these new proposals.However, because the data will be processed much more quickly in the future, it will no longer really be practical for the banks to advance the money a day early, nor would it be fair to other pensioners who get paid on a different day if funds were provided just to those who were paid on a Thursday. Many pensioners who want to receive their money on a Wednesday may like to change their pension day for that purpose. Instead of receiving their money on a Thursday, they may like to get it on a Wednesday or, for that matter, on any other day. If they elect to make that change, there will naturally be one payment which will be adjusted to take account of the shorter period. After that, all payments will be made on the anniversary of that day.I would like to thank particularly the Commonwealth Bank and St George Bank for the cooperation that they are providing in introducing these changes. They are helping with the education campaign for their customers to ensure that there are no unpleasant surprises. Those who will be affected by the Commonwealth Bank arrangements received a letter from Centrelink around a month ago. There has been follow-up publicity. Any one of the Commonwealth Bank customers who would like to get their pension on a Wednesday, as has been possible in the past, should just phone Centrelink and arrange for that change to be made. This new arrangement will provide greater flexibility and real benefits to all pensioners. We encourage those who would like to be paid on a day other than Thursday to notify Centrelink so that their payments can be processed appropriately.</DOC>

 - I will no doubt have an opportunity outside of the parliament to peruse the legal advice that the opposition has rustled up from Labor lawyers. I dealt with this matter yesterday when I tabled the legal advice from Mr Henry Burmester, who is the Acting Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth. The Acting Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth has advised us in terms that are as strong and compelling as you can possibly get in relation to these matters that, in his opinion and based on the existing law, there is absolutely no reason why there should be any doubt about the position of Mr Entsch. In those circumstances, we have no intention on the government's side of supporting such a motion.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. Obviously this is a very serious issue, particularly for those members in South Australia who represent the tuna fishing industry there. The southern bluefin tuna industry is worth $170 million in exports annually and 3,000 jobs in regional Australia. The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna was established in 1994 to better manage stocks of southern bluefin tuna. Australia is a party to the trilateral agreement with Japan and New Zealand.I inform the House that, on 1 June this year, Japan announced that it would begin its second year of unilateral experimental fishing. In 1998, without the agreement of Australia or New Zealand, Japan conducted a unilateral experimental fishing program in which it caught 1,464 tonnes of southern bluefin tuna above its agreed allocation under the commission. This is equivalent to a 25 per cent above quota catch or $60 million worth of extra tuna. Japan is in breach of its obligations under the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna and under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Japan's decision follows months of intense negotiation by the members of the commission on a joint experimental fishing program. Australia offered up a proposal for a joint scientific program, which was rejected by Japan.Australia has joined with New Zealand in calling on Japan to cease its experimental fishing program immediately. This government will not agree to a program that adds to the risk of stock reduction, or to a program that does not add significantly to existing assessments of southern bluefin tuna stock or improve the management of southern bluefin tuna. Australia takes its international obligations for sustainable fishing of southern bluefin tuna very seriously. Unmeasured practices on the high seas can have a detrimental impact on fishing stocks in our zone. All bans for port access and access for our fishing zone will remain in place indefinitely.The government has decided to commence proceedings against Japan under international law immediately. These options are currently being assessed. Australia and our government  will continue to take strong measures to ensure the conservation of the southern bluefin tuna stock and protect the interests of the Australian fishing industry. I should note that the Prime Minister is actually going to Japan and is going to take up this issue. Also, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has taken up this issue with the Japanese Ambassador. We will continue, as a government, to stand by and protect the interests of the Australian industry.</DOC>

 - Beazley CJ seems to have completely overlooked the fact that, if you give advice on the state of the law, you normally pay some regard to cases that have been decided on that point of law. Therefore, it is barely surprising that the late Chief Justice of Australia Sir Garfield Barwick is a person whom the Labor Party continues to pursue with its unforgiving tribal hatred, but nonetheless he is one of the greatest lawyers that this country has ever produced, without any doubt, and I will back Barwick against Blackshield any day, even though I was at law school with Blackshield. On this particular occasion I will back Barwick against Blackshield. In fact, I will back Burmester against Blackshield on this occasion. The Acting Solicitor-General has given a very strong opinion. It is very clear on the case law and, therefore, we have no intention of playing the legal and political game of the Australian Labor Party. Let them go elsewhere for Labor justice. We will not support any such motion.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - I am glad the Leader of the Opposition has asked me this question, and I will endeavour to address it with the seriousness that it deserves. It remains a  matter of great regret to me and to the government that, so far, we have not been able to secure the release of these two fine Australians, who were not spies but engaged on humanitarian work inside the former Yugoslavia.The Leader of the Opposition will be aware from his own experience in government that when a situation like this arises there are a lot of things that are done and said behind the scenes which, if made public, might prejudice the outcome that we seek to achieve. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to accept it from me - and I am very happy to provide him with private briefings, if he so desires - that the government has, ever since these two men were taken into captivity, done everything it could do through the normal overt diplomatic channels, and also many other things through back channels, in order to bring about the release of these two men. You will also be aware of the efforts of the aid organisation CARE International.I can inform you that the foreign minister went to Belgrade at the weekend at the express invitation of the foreign minister on the understanding and in the belief that the prospects of a meeting with Slobodan Milosevic were very strong. It is apparent from what the foreign minister has told us since the weekend that domestic circumstances inside Yugoslavia conspired to bring about a situation where Milosevic felt that he could no longer see the foreign minister. It ought not to be interpreted from that that the prospects of release in the near future have gone out the window.But it is also self-evident that the Yugoslav state is in a very precarious condition. It has just emerged from a period of some 70-odd days where it was under the heaviest military bombing which has been embarked upon by any group of countries since World War II. The President of Yugoslavia himself is facing very serious charges in relation to criminal activity.You will I think understand that the pressures that are operating in this situation are extremely difficult. They are quite intense. Our objective is to get the men out, not to score every rhetorical point. Our objective is  not to seek to win debating arguments to secure the release of Mr Pratt and Mr Wallace. As a consequence, we intend to bite our lips and our tongues in relation to some things that are said by quite a number of people who should not say them.I ask the opposition to accept that we are doing everything we humanly can. If the Leader of the Opposition wants further information, I am very happy to make that available to him, and I extend that same courtesy to the member for Kingsford-Smith. Our efforts go on unrelieved in order to secure their release and it ought not to be a matter of any partisan political point scoring that that release has not yet been secured.</DOC>

 - Today is the beginning of Treatment Works Week, which is a week designed to point out to the community the benefits that can be achieved through a concerted, comprehensive attack on the drug problem within our community. All Australians share a concern about the level of drug taking. All Australians are committed to reduce it. We may differ and quarrel about the best method to be adopted, but there can be little argument that across the board there is a determination on the part of all sections of the Australian community with goodwill to reduce the level of drug taking within our community.The government's Tough on Drugs strategy involves the expenditure of more than $500 million and it represents the largest commitment at a national level towards fighting the drug problem. It is posited on the belief that you have to tackle the drug problem at three levels: you need to strengthen law enforcement, you need to provide more resources for education and you also need to be able to provide more resources for rehabilitation and  treatment in relation to those people who wish to break their addiction.The criticisms that have been levelled at the government's approach suggesting that in some way we are focusing on law enforcement to the detriment of treatment and education are wrong. Ours is a balanced program. It is true that we are putting a lot more resources into providing additional strike teams, it is true that we are putting more resources into strengthening the law enforcement agencies; but it is also true that we are putting more resources into education and we are putting more resources into treatment.The major directional change that occurred at the recent COAG meeting illustrates our approach. At that meeting we secured the support of all the premiers across the party divide, as well as the two chief ministers, to an approach involving the diversion of people into treatment as an alternative to those people being captured by the criminal justice system. That approach complements the approach already taken by the New South Wales government, a Labor government, and by the Victorian government, a Liberal government, which offers to people who have a drug problem the opportunity of treatment rather than being caught up in the criminal justice system.We have invested not only a large amount of Commonwealth money in that diversionary approach but also a great deal of hope and expectation that it will provide a more effective response to the problem. It is not an easy task; it is a very big challenge. We all know how easy it is to despair. We know how easy it is to throw one's arms in the air and say, `It's impossible to tackle the problem successfully. We might as well give up, legalise it all, admit that we can't win the fight and say yes to every imaginable social fad in the area of drug treatment.' That is not the view of the government and it has been the experience of countries overseas that have gone down that path that, rather than reducing the problems of drug addiction, they have in fact multiplied them and they have added to the problems of drug addiction with other activities which have worsened the social condition of those countries, particularly in their larger cities.The government remains very committed to pursuing every element of its Tough on Drugs strategy and we believe that that three-level approach is the right approach and an approach that commends itself to the great majority of Australians.</DOC>

 - I do not, of course, remember the precise terms of that answer I gave in March last year. In accordance with my longstanding practice, I will have a look at the answer before accepting that the Leader of the Opposition's recapitulation of it is accurate. But I do remember that that probably would have been an answer given in the context of the circumstances arising out of the closure of a mining operation in the town of Cobar in New South Wales. -  - I acknowledge that it is in the context of Cobar. My recollection in relation to Cobar is that, as a result of activity undertaken at the government's request by the Australian Securities Commission, the overwhelming bulk of the money that was owing  to the men at Cobar was recovered. I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition's question gives me an opportunity to remind the parliament that, in relation to Cobar, action taken was highly successful and the just entitlements of those men were delivered.I am pleased to inform the House that on 18 June the Treasurer wrote to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission to ask it to consider whether an investigation into the Oakdale closure was necessary. I remind the House once again, without in any way wanting to pre-empt or being in a position to predict what the outcome of that independent inquiry will be, that it was at the initiative of the government that action was taken by the Securities Commission last year to recover the benefits for the men in relation to Cobar.I also inform the House that, as announced on 16 June, Senator Minchin and the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business will meet industry associations - particularly the mining industry - to discuss responses to this issue. Both of those ministers will meet representatives of the Oakdale miners when they come to Canberra tomorrow. While this issue is a joint Commonwealth-state matter, the Commonwealth has moved in several Commonwealth-state areas. The Commonwealth is currently developing two options via the Ministerial Council for Corporations. The first of those is to introduce more effective penalties for company directors for misusing company structures to avoid payment of employee entitlements, and strengthening the existing related party and insolvent trading provisions of the Corporations Act. In addition, other options outside the Corporations Law are being considered by the Workplace Relations Ministers Council.As I mentioned, miners from Oakdale and other areas will gather in Canberra tomorrow. A delegation of those miners will meet my two ministers on 22 June. I also inform the House that Centrelink are administering entitlement rules according to the legislation. I understand that the response in those areas has been speedy.This is a matter of concern to the government and the community. There is a great and  understandable sympathy within the Australian community about the fact that men who have worked in this industry all their lives could have at risk their redundancy payments and some of their other leave entitlements. I can assure the parliament that every avenue of the available law will be used if there is any action that ought to be taken to recover assets that might otherwise not be available to satisfy the entitlements of those men.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for being concerned about and interested in the state of the Australian economy. I am aware of some recent commentary on the Australian economy, some of it ill informed - mainly emanating from Labor sources - but some of it well informed.No doubt the member for Mitchell has in mind the statement to the Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration made recently by the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The Governor of the Reserve Bank indicated in his testimony that his view was that in all likelihood the Australian economy would grow in the current year in excess of four per cent, measured either in year average terms or in four quarters to June. In the budget we recently brought down we said that growth in 1998-99 would be about 4¼ per cent. That is higher than the G7 at an average of 1.7 per cent, higher than the OECD at an average of 2.2 per cent, higher than the US economy which is growing at a little under four per cent and higher than any of the countries of the Asia-Pacific region. That was done on the back of good policy, of getting low inflation and low interest rates in Australia, of putting our budget back into surplus and of paying down debt.I was asked what effect the sale of Telstra will have on the Australian economy. As is pretty well known, when this government came to office, Labor had Commonwealth net  debt at $96 billion - 96 thousands of millions of dollars. Twenty-five billion of that - 25 thousands of millions of dollars - was racked up in the two years before this government came to office, when the Minister for Finance for the Commonwealth of Australia was none other than the Leader of the Opposition. Twenty-five per cent of the Commonwealth net debt was racked up in the two last years up until 1996 by the Leader of the Opposition.Since this government came to office we have not only put the budget back into surplus but now paid back $25 billion of Labor's debt - $25 billion paid off the mortgage of Labor's debt. If another 16 per cent of Telstra were to be privatised, by June 2000 Commonwealth debt could be down at $51 billion. We could have paid off $45 billion of Labor's debt. That would be a wonderful thing for future generations in Australia. No longer would taxes be collected to service Labor's debt. No longer would they have to pay higher taxes because of Labor's mistakes of the past. We would be able to free them from the deficit and debt legacy of the Labor Party and its failed finance minister.You might have thought that the Labor Party, having created the problem, would support efforts to solve the problem. That would be the decent and honourable thing. We on this side of the parliament cannot understand why the Labor Party would be opposing a strategy to pay back the errors and the failures of its term of office. We say this to the Labor Party: having created the problem, you should at least seek to be part of the solution. There is still time for this Leader of the Opposition to lead. There is still time for this Leader of the Opposition to try to undo some of the damage that he did to the Australian economy, to free future generations from debt, to give them lower taxes and better services, to give them the opportunity to pay back debt, and to get this economy back onto a sustainable growth path.</DOC>

 - Of course, we are absolutely familiar with the way in which the opposition will misrepresent documentation. - Absolutely. It would not be an uncommon practice for them to do so. It would not be the first time that the opposition sought to misrepresent the situation. Let me make it entirely clear: books purchased overseas are liable to GST. In fact, I do not even know why I am asked this question, because the Labor Party opposes any GST on books purchased overseas. That is your policy. You oppose any GST on books purchased overseas. This is the Labor Party that stands up here in question time and says, `How come you are only giving rebates to 20c a litre on diesel excise when we are opposed to any rebate?' It is the Labor Party that stands up here and says, `How come you have taken food out of the growth tax for the states?' when it is opposed to any growth tax. - Mr Speaker, if I may say so, the point was just made by the Leader of the Opposition. He says he does not believe there should be a GST on books imported into Australia, so he will get up and he will ask a question on why it is that you are able to get around a GST on books imported into Australia. Hypocrisy has no bounds in the hands of the Australian Labor Party. This is the side of politics that believes that there ought to be broad based indirect tax on materials brought into this country, whether purchased overseas or produced in this country. We will ensure that the laws are enforced.</DOC>

 - I can report to the House that 3,021 Australian businesses received EMDGs this financial year totalling over $145 million. I thank the member for Kalgoorlie and the members for Mallee, Page and Riverina and also former ministers for  trade for their recognition of the importance of the Export Market Development Grants Scheme and how it creates new export effort and extra jobs from that export effort. Indeed, the firms assisted generated over $5 billion worth of exports - a ratio of $36 of exports for every dollar of grants paid. This year's outcome means that every grant below $60,000 has in fact been paid in full to the companies, individuals or trusts that have been involved. The payout ratio for grants over $60,000 is pooled and will roughly work out at some 99 per cent in respect of that circumstance.The government's efforts to focus this scheme on small and medium sized enterprises have been particularly effective, and full marks to Austrade in that regard. Two-thirds of grant recipients are small enterprises; over 600 recipients are rural exporters; 866 recipients are new to the scheme, with many of these exporting for the first time; and 237 businesses became eligible to receive a grant, thanks to the lowering of the threshold from $30,000 to $20,000. I just briefly say that almost one in five of the EMDGs are in respect of the tourism industry. I do not even bill the Department of Sport and Tourism for that particular bonus budget allocation; it comes from my department. It is worth about $20 million to the tourism industry. When Jackie Kelly returns I will remind her that it has to be worth at least one allocation to the chess academy, sooner rather than later.Could I just add that the Export Market Development Grants Scheme is doing powerful work in boosting our export effort to the world and the tourism industry is very much a part of this equation. I am sorry if there is some reflection on that. I do not think it is intended because, at the end of the day, our biggest earner of hard currency is the tourist industry closely followed by a massive amount of exports of goods and services - and I remind the opposition that all exports of goods and services go GST free.</DOC>

 - That is not the case. The application of GST applies to books, whether Australian produced or whether imported by an importer or a bookseller. - I am asked from the Labor Party side, `How?' Let me ask this question: how does the wholesale sales tax apply to CDs imported from overseas? How does it apply? Now I will explain. It is the same rule as applies to GST. - The rules which will apply to a GST are precisely the same rules as apply to WST. Let me take the example of CDs. The tax on CDs under the WST - although it is a complicated tax and I might be wrong - is, I believe, 22 per cent. If somebody imports a CD from overseas, it is taxable at the border under your wholesale sales tax system. If your big point is that customs officials do not open every parcel that is coming into the country, I would have thought that was fatal to your WST system.The truth of the matter is that we do not open every parcel that comes into the country, as everybody knows. But, with wholesale sales tax, under the $400 limit - which I think you are allowed to bring in on your person - if it becomes apparent that somebody is bringing in a CD, it is taxable at the barrier. It is the same as your wholesale sales tax system on cars. If a car comes to the barrier, it is taxable with your 22 per cent wholesale sales tax. It is the same in relation to GST. We have picked up the same rules in relation to GST as apply to wholesale sales tax. The tax applies at the customs barrier. Those items that are identified at the customs barrier are  taxable at the customs barrier in the same way as they are taxable if they are sold directly for domestic consumption. What is more, it applies to all of those items coming in for domestic consumption, because those items are taxable to the end consumer. The rules which will apply are those rules which apply to WST, with all of the barrier import controls and applications as apply under the current system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge the work that he does in his very important rural part of Victoria in promoting the interests not only of existing industries but also of those clever and innovative people who are looking for new opportunities both here and internationally.He is very well aware, of course, of the importance not just of getting the fundamentals right - which the Treasurer alluded to a moment ago by pointing out that we are now in a position, realistically speaking, to see Commonwealth debt cut from $96 billion to $51 billion, undergirding the lower interest rates and the inflation rate, now at its lowest level since 1963, that his farmers and others are enjoying in that electorate of Mallee - but also that modern telecommunications, the capacity to research and to communicate right across the globe, to develop electronic commerce and so forth are very much part and parcel of the exciting futures that can be found in far-flung regions.It is very welcome news that, in addition to that part of the social bonus announced during the last campaign, there will now be a further sum of some $314 million made available for a number of very important initiatives. Some  of them fall under the Networking the Nation element, including $70 million for BARN, Building Additional Rural Networks, to support the introduction of innovative new telecommunications technologies and services in rural areas. This is particularly welcome because it recognises there is a lack of scale which is a major factor in making the delivery of many telecommunications services in rural areas economically viable. There is $45 million to assist local government authorities to provide their services online and to establish access points for advanced telecommunications services. A further $3 million, on top of the $25 million we have already committed ourselves to, will extend the mobile phone service. Anyone who understands regional Australia knows how important that initiative is.As I have mentioned, these are in addition to existing commitments such as a $250 million extension to the Natural Heritage Trust which now, amongst other things, involves 4,300 Landcare groups; that is, 4,300 groups across Australia developing approaches to sustainable agriculture and better environmental outcomes. Then there is the $70 million for the rural transaction centres. There is $120 million for SBS television all over the country, state by state - even in Alice Springs. -  - There is some suggestion that the member representing the Northern Territory does not want SBS in Alice Springs. There is $158 million new money now for a new initiative to be known as the BITS program, Building IT Strengths program, that will encourage the development and growth of innovative information technology and telecommunications industries. About half of these funds will be used to establish incubator centres for small to medium enterprises in the IT&amp;T sector.The pity of all of this is that not only do those opposite oppose the measures that have built the foundations for economic recovery in the bush - getting debt down and all of those sorts of things - but they oppose this initiative as well. It is a very sad reflection on a party that now says it has an interest in the bush. I notice they are talking about setting  up a Country Party branch under the Labor Party's auspices in New South Wales. Can you believe it? That's what they are talking about doing. They say they have an interest in the bush and yet they want to oppose this very important initiative. Anyone in rural Australia can see through them. It is quite transparent. They don't give a damn about the bush.</DOC>

 - The agreement with the Democrats, negotiated in good faith, will be delivered. The fact of the matter is really quite straightforward: we are proposing savings in transport for Australians of well over $1 billion. We are proposing cutting the excise - in other words, taxes - on rail by $160 million. We are talking about a whole range of other initiatives, such as upgrading bridges, which will allow for the more effective loading -  - We are going to deliver on the commitments that we have made. You  want to oppose that. There will be legislation coming into the House this week which will quite clearly give you the responsibility and the opportunity to demonstrate whether you are going to support these important initiatives for rural Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. I am aware of some recent concerns about Work for the Dole, particularly as expressed in Western Australia. I wish to make a number of points in response. First of all, Work for the Dole participants are paid an extra $20 a fortnight to cover any additional costs they face. Second, Work for the Dole sponsors generally provide transport to hard to access projects. Third, Work for the Dole sponsors are required to provide any necessary special clothing. Fourth, Work for the Dole is not about training for training's sake but about developing the work culture and work ethic which job seekers need. Fifth, Work for the Dole sponsors are required to demonstrate that their projects will not displace current or future paid employees.As the House will know, in the recent budget the concept of mutual obligation was extended to job seekers up to age 34 in receipt of benefits for 12 months or more. That means that, all up, mutual obligation will apply to an estimated 300,000 plus long-term Newstart recipients in the coming financial year. As a condition of continuing to receive benefits, they will be required to engage in some form of structured activity such as part-time work, voluntary work, formal education or training, intensive and highly organised job search or Work for the Dole. Members opposite might be interested to know what their ideological soul mates in the British Labour Party think of this kind of approach. I am  quoting the education secretary of Britain, David Blunkett, who said:Not working is not an option. This is `tough love' which doesn't punish, but offers help in return for endeavour.That's what the British Labour Party thinks. I am quoting from a London newspaper:Earlier yesterday, Mr Blunkett shrugged off complaints from some young people that they did not like the jobs on offer.`Thirty years ago I did not like the pay or the job I had but I went to evening class and took the day release course to get the job I wanted. I am asking youngsters to do no more than that.'There are even some outbreaks of commonsense amongst members opposite. I refer, of course, to Michael Thompson's splendid polemic against new class infiltration of the ALP that was recently launched by the member for Batman, who said:Despite the member for Melbourne's assertions, most ordinary Australians remain wedded to the community ethos of their parents - loyalty, saving, work, mutual obligations, patriotism and family.But there is one person who can be guaranteed as absolutely impervious to any new ideas, there is one person who can be guaranteed to live in the past - and that's the Labor lord opposite, still yearning for ministerial triumphs, like the Collins submarine and the Jindalee radar and the telecommunications cable roll-out and still trying to live down 11.2 per cent unemployment.</DOC>

Having seen the letter the Treasurer wrote to the member for Hotham's constituent, I am well justified in not accepting anything that is put forward by those who sit opposite. The situation with the member for Leichhardt is that none of the allegations made against him of impropriety and of using his office have been substantiated. The member for Leichhardt remains an honest man; the member for Leichhardt is a hardworking local member.

 - I thank the honourable member for Riverina for her question. You will recall, Mr Speaker, that it has just been alleged in the House of Representatives by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and backed up by the Leader of the Opposition, that I had written to constituents advising them on how to avoid GST. I now believe that they have a blacked-out copy of a letter which I wrote to Mr Wallace Kirsop on 25 May 1999, in which I said to Mr Kirsop:Thank you for taking the time to visit my office concerning the taxation of imported books . . .Whilst books, magazines and clothing are not currently subject to WST, it is intended that they will be subject to GST. - That was what I said, was it? I continue:Currently, the Australian Customs Service (ACS) screens postal articles and cargo, and given the volume, this is a very resource intensive exercise. The relevant By-Law - this is the current relevant by-law - concerns goods of `negligible or low value'. The By-Law provides that:.	 Goods received by post can be cleared without Duty/WST - WST, Labor's tax - if the goods are valued at less than $1,000 and the Duty and WST -  -  - But there is on CDs! Labor's tax is on CDs and on everything else. This is the Labor Party's by-law -  - I will keep on reading:. . . if the goods are valued at less than $1,000 and the Duty and WST combined is less than $50..	 Goods received as air or sea cargo - amazon.com, I suppose - can be cleared without Duty/WST if the goods are valued at less than $250 and the Duty and WST combined is less than $50.The ACS intends to maintain this treatment under a GST . . .  -  - Your rules! As I said, your rules are to be kept under a GST, meaning that imported goods are taxable and, under a de minimus rule, can be cleared if the tax is less than $50. I then go on to say:. . . although a complete proposal has not yet been developed.I table the letter. The current rules will be applied to the GST. -  - If that amounts to an instruction on how to avoid GST, it amounts to an instruction on how to avoid WST - because they are your rules. As I said in my answer, your rules will be applied in toto at the customs border on a GST system. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has seriously  misled this House. He has been dishonest again.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question. I know how dedicated he is to increasing higher education opportunities for young people in his electorate. I am pleased to inform the House that, once again, record numbers of undergraduate students are enrolled this year in Australia's universities. In fact, the figures have gone up every year under the Howard government. The first figures for 1999 show that there now are some 40,000 more undergraduate students in universities than there were under the Labor government in 1996; it has gone to a total of 402,372 students.Members of the House need to recognise that these increased numbers of undergraduate students would not have happened if we had persisted with the policies of the Labor Party. The Labor Party locked tens of thousands of young working-class Australians out of Australia's universities, and it did so by restricting entry in a number of ways which this government has now taken away. Our policies have opened the door to university for tens of thousands of young Australians. And there is still no agreement on the other side of the House as to how Labor will respond to this situation or whether it would reimpose these controls.The member for Batman, in his famous foreword to Michael Thompson's book, makes the point that many people within the party and the broader labour movement have been concerned for some time at the directions the party has been taking in crucial areas such as education, welfare and social policy generally. But, of course, he is not the spokesperson for education on the other side.  The Leader of the Opposition is reported in the Australian on 12 June as saying that the member for Batman is three years behind the debate. They are a pack of happy little vegemites over there on the frontbench of the Labor Party.But ALP backbenchers apparently are rallying to the cause. The Australian on that day reports that they are `submitting a flurry of policy proposals and ideas' but some are `complaining they cannot reach Mr Beazley'. The Leader of the Opposition, to be fair to him, has admitted that he has been hard to get in touch with. The article says:The Labor leader concedes he needs more contact with the backbench and has decided to get out more and organise meetings with MPs.He is packing his lunch, he is getting a map and he is setting out to try to find the backbench. - I was asked about the prospect of alternative policies. As a result of the ideas coming up from the backbench, a group of MPs, including frontbenchers, are forming around the more approachable Labor deputy leader, Simon Crean, who happens to be a close Ferguson ally. I do not think anyone expects those ideas to come forward effectively through Mr Simon Crean. - Indeed. What I was pointing out when I was asked about alternatives is that there is a policy vacuum on the other side of the House, and the spokesman is none other than the member for Dobell. The government has made two significant changes to entry to university: we have provided additional financial support to students who have been taken in by universities above  agreed targets, and we have allowed universities to offer for the first time fee paying places to Australian undergraduates - and there are now some 1,740 of these fee paying undergraduates enrolled.The policies of this government have opened the doors to Australian universities to tens of thousands of students who were locked out by the Labor Party. And the policy chaos which existed and still exists on that side of the House shows no prospect whatever of providing a satisfactory alternative.</DOC>

 - I do stand by what I said. I am not aware of any breach by the member for Leichhardt of any obligation under corporations or securities law. One has only to contemplate the range of situations that directors and secretaries face in their work to see that the sort of proposition you are putting has no practical merit. An executive director of BHP is not going to know about everything going on in that company. A plumbing contractor is, on the other hand, potentially able to know everything because he is the only person doing it. A non-executive director will not know what is going on on a day-to-day basis.On that basis, Mr Entsch as a non-executive director is perfectly correct. Company secretaries, as the member from his previous life as  a solicitor would know, in general terms delegate much of their responsibilities to the employed accountants. What Mr Entsch has said seems to me to be perfectly compatible with that practical arrangement.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question with regard to this year's winter cereal crops and the prospects. One of his former colleagues in the grains industry indicated in the media last week that the recent rains we have had, which have been up to 50 millimetres across those areas mentioned by the member for Groom, have been worth about $1 billion to the Australian economy. Those rains have allowed thousands of farmers to complete their cereal sowings across that sector of northern New South Wales and southern Queensland.I am pleased to inform the House that this year it has been forecast that record areas will be sown to winter crops. ABARE forecast that around 19 million hectares will be sown. Areas sown to wheat are forecast to be up three per cent to 12 million hectares. Canola is forecast to climb to 1.5 million hectares, which is up a massive 28 per cent. As a result, wheat production is forecast to increase by 3.5 per cent to 22 million tonnes in this year's season. It should also be noted that, as a result of our government's policy, at the end of this month or the beginning of July the Australian Wheat Board will become a grower controlled company in line with our government's policy of getting the growers in industry in control of their industry organisations and in a better position to manage the sale of that commodity on the international playing field.More importantly, it is worth while noting that, on the basis of our government's policy  underpinning the agricultural pursuits in Australia, as from 1 July 2000, we will be able to provide major benefits to those grain growers across Australia with regard to the reduction in freight costs that have been the subject of much debate recently across Australia. We will massively reduce the cost of the diesel excise as far as road transport is concerned. But, most importantly, as far as the grains industry is concerned, we will completely remove the diesel fuel excise from the rail system which is going to provide enormous benefits to the grains industry across Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question because it allows me to advise the House of action this government has taken in relation to naval veterans of the Far East Strategic Reserve. More importantly, prior to the 1996 election, we said that we would be reviewing anomalies that were of much concern to many of the veterans in many areas of service throughout this century.After 13 years in government, the Labor Party had done nothing about the anomalies that existed in relation to the naval veterans of the Far East Strategic Reserve and, in 1997, what we did was extend repatriation benefits to those veterans of the Far East  Strategic Reserve. But, in my discussions with veterans of the Far East Strategic Reserve, they still had some concerns relating to medals and also the adequacy of the benefits that were flowing from that initial review. That is why I have announced an independent review into veterans' entitlements and the repatriation benefits and medals for the Australian Defence Force between 1955 and 1975.This independent review will cover areas of service including the Royal Australian Air Force at Ubon, the Royal Australian Air Force at Butterworth in Malaysia and the service in Malaya during the period of the confrontation with Indonesia. It will also look at whether prima facie evidence is presented to review those possible anomalies. The review will also examine the particular reference of the naval component of the Far East Strategic Reserve, and the reference is specific in comparing the conditions prescribed for the naval contingent with the conditions for those personnel from the other two services.This review will involve consultation with the ex-service community. Public hearings have already been advertised, and I would certainly urge members on both sides of the House to contact their own associations or veterans and constituents in their own electorates who have had concerns about this area, because this government is getting on with the job and doing the reviews we said we would prior to the 1996 election. I think this is certainly good news for those veterans of the service in South-East Asia between 1955 and 1975, because this is an independent review of that service.</DOC>

 - I am aware of those statements, and I am also aware of the fact that  the Labor Party had 13 years to fix this and did not do so. The outrage which is now being demonstrated by the Australian Labor Party should be set against the fact that the Labor Party in government explicitly rejected the very change it is now advocating in opposition. I also recall the section of the shadow cabinet submission that was circulated in August of last year in relation to the private member's bill of the member for Prospect. It contains a note from John Angley, who I understand then was, and may still be for all I know, an adviser to the Leader of the Opposition, in which he said this:The downside of the levy is that it is another cost on jobs. If it is a state-wide fund like workers comp, the cost per worker in the form of premiums inevitably grows. It also reduces the responsibility of employers/owners to fix their own affairs rather than fall back on the fund.As a result of a cabinet discussion, the government has proposed an amendment to the Corporations Law which will create an offence whereby companies' directors who deliberately arrange the affairs of their companies so as to defeat the entitlement of workers and bona fide entitlees to particular benefits will be subject to criminal penalties and criminal liabilities. The weakness in the case being put by the opposition is the weakness of hypocrisy with a capital H. This opposition, on this issue, sat in government for 13 years and did nothing to cure the situation that they are now with confected outrage talking about.As is well known, there is a delegation of people from the Oakdale mine in the building. Representatives of that delegation will meet the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business this afternoon as well as the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. They will be accompanied at that meeting, as I understand, by the Minister for Finance and Administration, who is the local member for the affected mine. They will receive from those three ministers a very comprehensive and sympathetic hearing.But I want the members of that delegation, when they meet those ministers, and if they have already met representatives of the Australian Labor Party or if they meet them afterwards, just to remember one fact: the  Labor Party had 13 years. That does not disentitle them from now arguing for a change, but it does reflect rather profoundly on their bona fides as representatives of the working people of this country.The Labor Party on this issue, as on so many other issues, is behaving in a very hypocritical fashion. I remind the House of what I said yesterday: in relation to the Cobar mine, as a result of action taken at the instance of the government through the Australian Securities Commission, 85 to 90 per cent of the entitlements of those men were recovered. I would remind the House, without making any claims of wrongdoing under the Corporations Law by the Oakdale companies, that similar action has been taken by the government, and no amount of head shaking by the member for Canberra can alter the fact that you had 13 years to fix this and you did nothing.</DOC>

 - Last night, the further sale of Telstra was passed through the Senate, and I am pleased to inform the parliament that there are very significant national interest benefits that are going to flow from this decision of the Australian parliament. First and foremost, another $16 billion or more will be contributed to a further reduction in the Beazley-Labor debt. The Australian people should be reminded of the extent to which the Commonwealth debt of this country was run up during the time that the Leader of the Opposition was finance minister. Tens of billions of dollars were added to the Commonwealth debt of this country, and it has taken the resolve and the determination of a coalition government to wipe out that debt.I can think of no better gift that the present generation of Australians will give to future  generations of Australians than to give to the people of this country in the next millennium an essentially debt-free society. That is what we are about: we are about wiping out net Commonwealth debt. The strongest possible argument in favour of the total privatisation on proper terms and conditions after due inquiry in relation to the nationwide responsibilities of the Telstra company, the greatest contribution of further privatisation of Telstra to the people of Australia, is that we are paying off the Beazley bankcard. What we are doing with the further privatisation of Telstra is taking the debt burden off future generations of Australian taxpayers.But there are more benefits than that. There is $70 million out of the social bonus that will go into rural transaction centres. What that $70 million will do is bring banking services and government services into the bush. There will be a further roll-out of SBS. I know that the member for Dawson, who represents the town of Mackay in this parliament, will welcome the fact that out of the $120 million television fund we can continue the roll-out of SBS around Australia and into Mackay; the member for Murray will welcome the fact that out of that same fund we will be able to roll SBS out into the city of Shepparton; the member for Grey will welcome the fact that there will be a roll-out into Port Lincoln; the member for Eden-Monaro will welcome the fact that there is a roll-out into Eden; the member for Indi will welcome the roll-out to Myrtleford; and of course the member for Kalgoorlie - one of the triumphal victors of the 1996 election - will welcome the roll-out into the great city of Port Hedland.I wonder, in the face of those enormous benefits to the people of rural and regional Australia, how it is that the member for Hunter will vote against an SBS roll-out in the Upper Hunter. How will he explain that to the people of the electorate that he represents? How indeed will the member for the Northern Territory explain to his constituents why they can't have a full roll-out of SBS? How can you face your constituents? -  -  - How can you face your constituents? - And neither will the present reaction from the member for Dickson. - Mr Speaker, through you, Sir, this dereliction of duty to constituencies knows no bounds, because not only do we have the spectacle of members like the member for the Northern Territory and the member for Hunter voting against the SBS roll-out in their own electorates; even worse than that, they are voting against giving Australians in remote areas untimed local calls to their neighbours.I am very proud to say that on this side of the House the members for Leichhardt, Wide Bay, Maranoa, Parkes, Grey and Kalgoorlie know what is good for their constituents. They know that they want untimed local calls, and that is why they are voting to represent the interests of all Australians in those electorates. But, shamefully, those Labor Party members who represent the people in the electorate of Braddon, in the electorate of Lyons, in the electorate of Franklin and, again, our old friend, Mr Speaker, in the electorate of the Northern Territory are not  interested in giving those people untimed local calls because, by their action in this House and by the action of their colleagues in the Senate, they are saying to those people, `You are second-class Australians, and you are not entitled to have untimed local calls.' So not only are you saying no SBS, you are also saying no untimed local calls.The further sale of 16 per cent of Telstra will further reduce debt. It is an intelligent implementation of our election commitment but, very importantly, it will bring enormous benefit to rural and regional Australia. Those Labor members who are voting against it will be remembered at the next election for having let their constituents down.</DOC>

 - As the House saw yesterday, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is quite good at misrepresenting the facts. One would not want to stand up here and take from him an account of what Senator Newman had to say, or indeed take from him an account of what anyone had to say. He is well known to be somebody who completely misrepresents the facts in this chamber on a regular basis.In relation to the housing situation, I would have thought that even the Treasurer of the  state of Tasmania - who feeds you most of these questions - would have known that, at a special Premiers Conference, the Commonwealth agreed to make available to the states what they claim would be the increased cost of building housing. That was agreed at the special Premiers Conference when six states, including the Treasurer of Tasmania, signed up for their share of the GST. He couldn't get his signature on the document fast enough - the old Treasurer of Tasmania - to get his share of the GST. I would surmise that that is what Senator Newman is talking about.Since that time, we have had further claims from the states. I must say that to get a claim from a state Premier for more money is not an unusual event. Hardly a day would go by without an additional claim coming in. As this government has made clear, we are not engaging in additional claims in relation to housing because we consider that matter to have been settled at the special Premiers Conference and additionally settled by this fact: for the first time in decades, the Commonwealth will be giving the states a growth tax.The states will be collecting 10 per cent of the goods and services produced in this country. As the goods and services produced in this country increase, the 10 per cent share of the goods and services produced by the Australian economy will flow to the states. It is a growth tax. The states are guaranteed not only to receive what they currently receive but to have revenues which grow in proportion to the economy - something that has not occurred outside of tax reform.We in this parliament know who opposes a growth tax for the states: the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party opposes a growth tax for the states. It opposes the reorganisation of Commonwealth-state finances. It opposes modernising the indirect tax system. It opposes reducing personal income taxes. It opposes family assistance. The member for Werriwa goes to the paper and says, `Don't think that there aren't thinkers on the Labor side of politics. Just because we haven't had a policy for the last four years, don't think there aren't thinkers.' He says, `We write books.' And he names all these  people who write books. Why? Because it is a substitute for policy advice. You will never get any policy advice out of the born to rule set of the leader and deputy leader of the Labor Party. - I have.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question, and I know he would agree with me that, by any measure, the first Telstra share offer was an outstanding success. Around 1.8 million Australians, or 14.2 per cent of the adult population, bought shares when they were  first offered in November 1997. It is interesting to note that some 81.2 per cent of those who acquired those shares in November 1997 still hold those shares. In fact, through the Telstra float back in November 1997, 559,000 of those purchasers were first time investors in the stock market.This Telstra share offer has brought to some 40 per cent the number of Australians who are investing in the stock market. So in every sense now, alongside home ownership, the great Australian dream includes the ownership of shares. Australia has become one of the truly great share owning democracies of the world. The passage of legislation last night by the Senate allows the government to proceed with the next tranche of Telstra. Whilst the structure of the second Telstra offer is yet to be determined by the government, I can indicate that the government is committed to ensuring that Australian families and first time investors are able to get involved with the share offer that will occur. We will announce that method for the sale of the Telstra 2 shares as well as the timetable over the next few weeks.But it is ironic that last night when the Senate passed the legislation it was once again opposed by Labor. This is the Labor Party that does not want to give tax cuts to all Australians. This is the Labor Party that does not want to make our exports more competitive. This is the Labor Party that does not want to give a growth tax to the states. This is the Labor Party that does not want to bring down the cost of transportation to rural Australia. And this is the Labor Party that does not want to allow this coalition government through the sale of more Telstra shares to reduce that debt which they ran up over 13 years.The government will proceed with the sale of some 2.13 billion shares, and we will do two things. We will provide a billion dollars to rural and regional Australia in particular. I have noted that none of the state Labor premiers are complaining about the boost in information technology that that social bonus will bring to them. I have noted that none of the Tasmanians in this House are complaining about the fact that -  -  - this government is prepared to give a boost to Tasmania to give them a help, which of course they never got when Labor was around. The second thing we will do from the sale of Telstra shares is continue to reduce that debt which Labor ran up over their 13 years in government.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to answer the question from the member for Dawson and say yes and yes. In fact, this is one of those splendid days to be in government. Not only do we have Labor on the run - you can never match what we are doing for country Australia with this social bonus - but we have some distant static from state politicians on both sides of politics who could only wish they could deliver the list we are now delivering for country Australia.Not only are we giving $150 million for untimed local calls in isolated areas but we are giving an additional $20 million to meet the special communication requirements of remote and isolated islands such as in the electorate of Dawson, the Northern Territory and elsewhere. Not only are we giving $70 million to the transaction centres to be administered through Minister John Anderson and Minister Macdonald to places like Urana and beyond, but we are giving $36 million to facilitate Internet access and electronic commerce for people in rural and remote areas. We are also giving $25 million referred to by the Prime Minister to the corridors of some of  our busiest highways as well as South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania.This is why the hypocrisy on this matter should now be fully exposed. The member for Dobell produced legislation in this place - let me remind both sides of the House; this is an honest representation of the legislation - that at midnight on 31 December of this year the analog system would be junked with no practical alternative for country Australia. He is the guilty person in setting up the bush for a disaster on mobile telephones. That is the truth of the matter. - The shame of it is that you were an accolade of Keating the reformer. - The member for Perth likewise. There you were in the Senate last night trying to put about some populism when you know in your heart that that is ancient socialism which will deny you government benches for life. I am glad I stun the Labor Party because their decision -  -  - What the coalition government has done as an alternative to junking analog is provide for the spectrum to allow Telstra to roll out the CDMA, an affordable Rolls Royce mobile telephone system - something you are opposed to. -  - Well, let that be on the record. We have also provided for the filling in of black spots along the various corridors of critical highways, and for that to be further extended in a practical way so that, come midnight on 31 December, we will have done something additional - and that is, allow for flexibility with the shut down date for analog. In other words, we were determined to see that country Australia was not left behind with the junking of analog. Yes, we  support the transfer to the digital systems of GSM digital and CDMA digital but at a time which has practical benefit for all of country Australia. We stand up for our constituents. I am just delighted with the outcome on Telstra. -  - My predecessors, state and federal, within my party and in other leadership positions in the political fabric of this country can only wish they have such a list as the list the coalition government presents to the people today on telecommunications.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He of course is a man who represents the largest electorate anywhere in the world, and he does an out  standing job. He is at the forefront of people who are looking for new and innovative solutions for the need to develop new job opportunities in rural and regional Australia - something we are committed to doing and you are committed to opposing. We are committed to doing, and you are committed to opposing in every way that you possibly can, from balancing the nation's books right through to developing innovative new approaches.The member who asked the question, I believe, is doing an outstanding job. I have met some of the people from his electorate who are looking for new technologies to help them create new business opportunities right across the country. The expansion in the social bonus, an additional $314 million, I believe will make a very real difference in terms of job opportunities and quality of life matters for people in rural and regional areas.I would like to refer to a couple of these in particular. One is the $70 million for Building Additional Regional Networks, BARN, a program to expand Networking the Nation, including services to the remote territories. When you meet and talk with people from electorates such as Kalgoorlie you find that they are just beginning to become really aware of the opportunities that are presenting themselves, but they need to be able to expand their knowledge and understanding of those new technologies as well as have better access to the capital and hardware needed to do it, and this program will help with just that.Another point that is worth making is that the difference between effective local government and lacklustre local government in regional areas is critically important. We have a $45 million fund made available for Networking the Nation's local government fund. That will be administered under the auspices of the highly successful Networking the Nation program. Each state will receive funding of $6 million, $6 million will be divided among the territories and we will retain $3 million at a national level to ensure that local government authorities in Australia are able to provide online access to their own information and services and public points of  access, very valuable, to advance telecommunications services such as the Internet.The other thing I would like to mention, because I think it is very important, is that I remember a former member for Riverina in this place asking a certain former Prime Minister what he intended to do about the closing of banks in rural and regional areas and specific reference was made to the town of Ivanhoe. The reality was that the previous government was not really very concerned about them, and that is an attitude that has continued into opposition. Well we are. Firstly, through what we learnt with Credit Care, we have seen 50 financial institutions put in small towns that had lost access to banking services. Secondly, we have provided $70 million for rural transaction centres. There has been an incredibly positive response to that initiative. In fact, we have had more than 600 expressions of interest and inquiries and over 40 formal applications from across the states and the Northern Territory.Those applications are this day in this town being assessed by the newly appointed independent advisory panel, which will set in process the mechanism by which the first round of rural transaction centres will be shortly announced and opened. It reflects us getting on with our commitment of rebuilding rural and regional Australia. It is in stark contrast to the couldn't care less attitude of the ALP.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. As is probably pretty well known in Australia now, in its last five years of government, the  Australian Labor Party took Commonwealth net debt from $16 billion to $96 billion. They ran up $80 billion of debt in five years. If the Commonwealth were to produce a surplus of about $3 billion, as it will this year, it would take us 30 years to undo the damage that Labor did in five. You would have to run a budget surplus of $3 billion for 30 years to actually undo the damage that was done by the Australian Labor Party in their last five years of office. In the last two years of office, Labor ran up $25 billion worth of debt under the stewardship of the then Minister for Finance, Mr Kim Beazley.The great thing about having the budget in surplus is that we are not running up debt. It means that, in relation to the government's privatisation program, every single dollar that is received from privatisation now goes to retire debt. Every single dollar of the privatisation will be going into retiring and putting to bed Labor's debt. When the Labor Party was in office, you will recall that it supported privatisation. I have here a good quote from none other than the then Minister for Finance to the National Press Club on 24 August 1994. He said:The primary objective driving the privatisation program is to make Australia an efficient, internationally competitive economy . . .  - That was the then Minister for Finance of the Commonwealth of Australia in August 1994. Mr Speaker, you will not often find me quoting him, but I will quote this. He went on to say:Of course another benefit of privatisation is that it contributes to the Government budget, helping to reduce debt and providing funds for Government programs.There will be backbenchers in the Labor Party who will think that the Labor Party always opposed privatisation. Not so. The Labor Party was a great supporter of privatisation when it was in office. The Labor Party was in favour of privatising Qantas, Australian Airlines and the Commonwealth Bank. The Labor Party became absolutely irresponsible only when it went into opposition. But there is one thing that the Labor Party never did. The Labor Party never used privatisation to  retire debt. I want to give the House one example. In July 1995, the Qantas public share offer, a Labor Party privatisation, raised $1.4 billion. Do you know how much of that it used to reduce debt? Not one single dollar, not one single cent. The then finance minister received $1.4 billion for the sale of Qantas, which he spent in its entirety in the year of receipt, and then went and borrowed another $10 billion to finance his deficit. He took $1.4 billion, spent the entire proceeds and then borrowed $10,000 million extra to run his budget in the 1995-96 year. The then finance minister was the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley.You have all sorts of nostrums coming out of the Labor Party now. We always used to turn our backs when we were embarrassed by our record too, and that is precisely what he is doing now. This is the man who supported privatisation, used the proceeds, ran up debt and now wants to lecture the government on surpluses. The frontbench wants to complain about the diesel excise coming back to only 20c. The frontbenchers want to complain that the states are getting a growth tax. The member for Batman wants to go back to the working-class roots and get away from the chardonnay drinkers of the Labor Party. He ought to talk to the member for Kingston. The member for Kingston does not drink chardonnay; he makes chardonnay. He is a winemaker. These are the working-class roots of the Labor Party now - making the chardonnay for the party dos. Old Chifley would have been proud of the vignerons that now make up the frontbench of the Australian Labor Party. Wonderful people but never consistent!</DOC>

 - The House has already one day this week been treated to the rather fertile imagination of the member for Hotham when it comes to interpreting letters sent, or statements made, by members on this side of the House. The words of the ministerial code are clear. The statements that I have made in relation to the behaviour of the member for Leichhardt are well known to this House. I can only say in relation to the statements made by the member for Hotham and the Leader of the Opposition in the last three questions that I do not make any admissions, I do not offer any agreement to, and I do not confirm any of the interpretations that have been placed, and I will continue, as I said previously, to analyse the questions that have been put. It is a bit hard to analyse questions while you are still in question time, but if the opposition would like me to terminate question time now so that I can go away and analyse them, I will.The member for Leichhardt, on all of the evidence available to me, has behaved in a totally honest and correct fashion and I have had no evidence presented to me of any conflict between his private interests and his public duty. I think he is performing his public duties extremely well - and so do his constituents.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for his question and the interest that he shows in the work that we are doing on environmental issues, particularly in the Murray-Darling Basin as his electorate borders on the great River Murray.Today is a great day as far as people like the member for Indi who are interested in the improvement of Australia's natural heritage and the environment are concerned. We all remember that for 13 years Labor painted themselves as the environmental guardians in Australia, but effectively they never delivered on the ground. We all remember in July 1989 the former Prime Minister Mr Hawke and the former environment minister Graham Richardson standing on the banks of the Murray River promising a billion trees. It was interesting to read on the weekend that a recent visit to the site by press gallery veteran Alan Ramsay showed what a hollow promise that was.In 1996 during the election we went to the people of Australia with a proposal to provide $1.25 billion to Australia's natural heritage, and we have delivered on that promise. We went to the 1998 election making a commitment for a further $250 million, and last night when the Senate, to its credit, approved the sale of a further 16 per cent of Telstra, it meant that we will deliver on that. Our government, the Howard government, will be delivering $1.5 billion to Australia's natural heritage - an outcome that the ALP could only dream of. They could never deliver. We are going to deliver on that commitment to the Australian natural heritage.The further sale of Telstra will be used to restore and indeed boost the natural capital of the Australian environment. This new funding  will continue to support the full range of Natural Heritage Trust programs such as Bushcare, Rivercare, Landcare, Coastcare and, particularly important to the member for Indi, the Murray-Darling Basin 2000 Program. These are all very important programs that a lot of Australians and our government support. Not only are we retiring debt - saving the wasting of taxpayers' money on paying interest - out of the further sale of Telstra, we are also investing in Australia's future in the Natural Heritage Trust Fund. On the point of asset sales, because it is as a result of an asset sale that we are able to do this, I would like to point out to the House a quote that I came across in researching the answer to this question. -  - The Labor Party need to listen to this quote. I quote from a speech:Despite some critics suggesting asset sales amount to selling off the family jewels, they do not result in a loss of infrastructure but rather a transfer of ownership. Asset sales allow the government to maintain public services and benefits to the Australian people while maintaining the deficit reduction strategy without increased taxes.Who said that? I wonder whose speech that came out of? Was it the current Prime Minister? No. Was it the current Treasurer? No. It was the then Minister for Finance on 13 May 1994 when Labor had some policies, before they became a policy vacuum in opposition. When Labor sold assets such as the Commonwealth Bank the proceeds were not used to retire debt, they were not used to invest in the natural heritage; they just went back into revenue - into Labor's spending campaign of the time.Our government is delivering on both fronts. We are retiring debt, we are saving taxpayers' dollars from being wasted on servicing Labor's debt and we are investing in Australia's natural heritage, in the environment, and the heritage for our children. We are investing $1.5 billion directly into programs on the ground.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his interest in this matter. It has always been an article of faith for the member - indeed, for all of us on this side of the House - that all Australians, wherever they choose to live, should have access to the Internet at the cost of a local call. Now it is being delivered. The $36 million allowed for from the social bonus fund from the further privatisation of Telstra will mean that all Australians in regional areas will not have to pay STD rates to access the information superhighway. They are going to have the same access to the Internet as those who live in metropolitan areas. At the same time, Australians in rural and regional  areas will benefit from the $45 million local government fund which will allow those local governments to provide public Internet access for their communities.Small business in the information technology sector will also benefit, for we are assigning $158 million to assist the growth of the information technology sector through the Building IT Strengths program. The economic benefits to small business from further assistance and access to the information technology sector are only too obvious. If they are going to go into the next century as players in the information revolution we have to have firms that are so developed that they can grasp the opportunities. We do that by assigning $78 million to establish centres, in every state and territory, where small businesses can lease premises, share resources and get assistance to improve their business and planning skills, their technical skills and their networks, to make them more competitive - especially internationally competitive. Businesses at the leading edge of technology - those working on the next generation of IT services - are going to be able to test their work at sites across Australia. An amount of $40 million is going to set up these sites across the length and breadth of the nation. This is going to enhance small business's capacity to develop new designs and products for the next generation of IT services.As the member for Cowper would appreciate, these industries are supporting these innovative proposals. In a statement released yesterday, 21 June, by the Australian Telecommunications Industry Association, its chairman said:It will mean that Australia's small and medium information IT&amp;T firms and entrepreneurs will be provided with assistance to create new business and employment opportunities thereby encouraging international competitiveness and overseas investment.At the same time, the Australian Information Industry Association issued a statement welcoming the government's new initiatives. It said:To encourage the growth of e-commerce in Australia it is important that all Australians have online access to these services, especially those in rural and remote areas. Therefore, the Association  welcomes the Government's initiatives to promote online facilities and points of access.Who would oppose these breakthrough, innovative and long-lasting initiatives by the government? Only the members on the other side of the House.</DOC>

 - This is an exciting project which the federal government is advancing in conjunction with state governments, including the Queensland state government. Indeed, the federal government is putting $8 million plus into the project, the Queensland government - to its credit - is putting in $2½ million, and other state and territory governments are putting in to ensure that the Australian exhibition at Hanover 2000 stacks up in a practical way on a tremendous site which has become available following the reallocation of part of the area which was to be occupied by Korea with proximity to one of the main pathways through the Expo site at Hanover.The process of tender selection was, of course, quite properly at total arms length from either the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Trade. It is true that the company which received the tender has international connection absolute. Perhaps that  was one of the factors which led to its selection in terms of the project presentation that they made with regard to their tender and their site development. There is absolutely nothing to hide on this issue. But in respect of any tender process which involves the selection of one successful company there will be those who are disappointed, including those from Melbourne and elsewhere who are quite bitterly disappointed. I would encourage them to keep producing submissions for future activities, and they will be properly considered in the very correct way that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade goes about these matters.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Can I first thank the member for Aston for his question. I know that he and - to be fair - all members of this House have a very great concern for the fate of Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace. The honourable member asked what degree of optimism I had for their early release. I think all of us have gone through phases of being optimistic and pessimistic. During the course of the early part and middle part of last week it is true to say we had a fairly high degree of optimism of a relatively early release, only to find on Saturday that President Milosevic had reconsidered this case  on Friday night and had decided for the time being to ensure that Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace were retained in prison. I think, nevertheless, it will not be too long before they are released, but it is very difficult to make any predictions about that.I spent Friday evening and Saturday in Belgrade, and most of Saturday I spent with the foreign minister of Yugoslavia, Mr Jovanovic. I had been advised earlier in that week - on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday; that part of the week - that President Milosevic was likely to see me, and I had hoped to see him on that day. I was disappointed when the foreign minister told me that he had spoken to President Milosevic the previous night, the Friday night, and that the President had decided not to see me and that there would not be a release - with, of course, the two things being related.But the visit was, I think, very useful in ensuring that the Yugoslav government knew several things: firstly, that this issue goes to the very heart of Australia's bilateral relationship with Yugoslavia; secondly, that this is an issue of very real concern not just to Australia and Australians generally but to the international community. Indeed, last Monday I spoke with the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan. Following that discussion in which, inter alia, I raised with him the case of Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, Mr Annan wrote to the Yugoslav government yet again urging the release of Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace.Thirdly, let me say it was an opportunity for me to meet Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace. Members of the House may like to know, by the way, that I passed on to them the fact that this House had passed a resolution on the previous Thursday in support of their release - which I think they already knew, as a matter of fact, through the embassy. But they were in good health and showed themselves to be in good spirits, despite their circumstances. They seem to be well fed. They said the food was adequate. They both reside in a cell in the military court in Belgrade, which they said to me is about 25 square metres. There is one other person - the Yugoslav  citizen from CARE Australia - in that cell with them.Needless to say, the Australian government will continue to work tirelessly for the release of Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace, and I will certainly return to Belgrade if it is necessary to do so. We will certainly continue our work with the international community in order to maintain international pressure, because the Yugoslav government does recognise there is strong international pressure on them to release these two Australians. For the time being, the President has made the judgment that for domestic political reasons he does not want to proceed with the release. We want to make sure the release takes place and that the international community continues to focus on this issue.</DOC>

 - Let me make very clear what I said in the previous answer: that this was done quite properly at arms length from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade. -  - So on the one hand we get accused of interfering too much in tender processing and now we are being accused of interfering not enough. Make up your mind! There is a proper process and the  Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade I am confident has followed that proper process. At the conclusion of that process they made that selection. They no doubt took into account the relevant information with regard to the performance of this company in respect of the Australian exhibition at Hanover 2000. The information which has been displayed about the successful tenderer looks interesting and exciting with regard to the project. The process of tendering was also done in consultation with the state governments, most notably the Queensland government, in respect of Hanover 2000. I will further analyse the information the shadow minister has presented, but this is due process and not subject to ministerial intervention. Nevertheless, in a contract worth around $10 million, it is important that we get absolute performance for every dollar of taxpayers' money being expended on this proper purpose.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question. As local members, we all know the impact of natural disasters on our communities. We cannot stop disasters happening, but we can try to ensure that every facility is made available to help the victims. I am pleased to inform the House that on three recent occasions Work for the Dole teams were involved in disaster clean-ups, along with volunteers from State Emergency Services. For the past seven weeks, 20 Work for the Dole participants have been removing fences destroyed in the Crookwell bushfires. I understand the member for Hume recently attended a community barbecue to thank these good young people. For two weeks after the storms devastated Sydney's eastern suburbs, 55 Work for the Dole participants were involved in cleaning up homes, streets and parks. Most recently, 14 Work for the Dole  participants in Byron Bay have been helping to protect public facilities and homes from flood erosion. I would like to congratulate all those fine Work for the Dole participants for acting in the great Australian tradition of mateship to those in need. I should point out that it will be far easier to deploy Work for the Dole volunteers to help in disaster clean-up under the new administrative arrangements planned by the government.This latest demonstration of the success of the Work for the Dole program does have implications for those who continue to oppose it. The Leader of the Opposition is understandably proud of his reputation for decency, but every time he calls this program `mickey mouse' or `social punishment', he demeans people who deserve our support. So I invite the Leader of the Opposition - that former minister for white elephants - to change his mind on this, as he has on so many other things.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to provide a response to the third question on this matter. Caribiner International Pty Ltd has a registration number in this country, ACN 077757307. It is the Australian subsidiary of NYSE-listed Caribiner International Inc. The Australian company was formed for the acquisition of three Australian private companies, Wavelength Communications Pty Ltd founded in Sydney in 1983, the Event Company founded in Melbourne in 1988, and Stagecraft Corporate Theatre Pty Ltd founded in Brisbane in the year of Expo 1988. I am advised that Caribiner employs over 120 Australians full time, including all the previous owners. And it pays tax in Australia. In addition, Caribiner employs over 150 contractors on an ongoing basis. -  - Do you want the answer? The consortium for Expo 2000 includes four other organisations - Tonkin Zulaikha, architects; APP, project management; Rhythm Media, culture and events; and Manboom, sponsorship - all of which are wholly owned by Australian citizens. I just want to make the point there is a due process, that process was fully complied with, and I am excited about Australia stepping forward at Expo 2000 in a very powerful way for the promotion of Australia in Europe.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his question. May I take this opportunity to congratulate the member for Wannon for his hearings with the Governor of the Reserve Bank. The governor could not have been more glowing about the state of the Australian economy, and that is just one reason why we are the second greatest share owning nation in the world. Australians have taken to the stock market in very considerable numbers. In fact, I can advise the House that, over the last nine months alone, three-quarters of a million Australians for the first time invested in shares listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. That means that 57 per cent of direct share owners invested for the first time in the three years to 1998.As the member for Wannon and many other members would know, 5.5 million Australians now own shares. That means we are the second largest share owning nation in the world after the United States, where 43 per cent of the population owns shares. If the Minister for Finance and Administration is able to repeat the very successful effort of Telstra tranche 1 and encourage enough Australians to invest for the first time, Australia will become the greatest share owning nation in the world.I ask this question of the ALP: why does the Labor Party oppose extensive Australian share ownership? Why does the Labor Party oppose any effort that is made by the government to give the people of Australia a chance to invest in Australian companies? Why is the Labor Party opposing the abolition of stamp duty on the transfer of shares? Why is the Labor Party opposing the sale of a second tranche of Telstra? Why is the Labor Party doing everything that it can to stop people in its own constituencies - and in fact its own parliamentary members - from owning shares in Australian companies and in Telstra?There are a number of parliamentary members of the ALP who think Telstra is a pretty good investment. I do not think we have time to go through all their names. I cannot; I am going to resist. - Just to appease the Prime Minister, I want to point out that I know the member for the Northern Territory thinks they are a good investment. -  - They are a good investment. I cannot hear your investment advice from here. We want to find out whether more Australians want to invest in shares and, accordingly, I have approved $180,000 being allocated to a study to investigate the level and extent of share ownership in Australia. It will be an independent report. We could probably save some dollars if we just sent the surveyors to ask the Labor Party some questions about share ownership. But what we want to do is put aside the class warfare that has entrenched the philosophy of the Labor Party. We want more Australians owning shares; we want to become the most significant share owning nation in the world.</DOC>

 - I am certainly very glad that the member for Hotham quotes my eloquence. I can assure him that he stands in no danger of anybody ever quoting his eloquence, on this or on anything. He stands in no danger whatsoever of ever actually standing for a policy in this place. Has the Labor Party a policy on indirect tax? - Has it a policy on income tax? - Has it a policy on Commonwealth-state relations? - Has it a policy on anything? - Here is the would-be heir to Curtin and Chifley who walks into question time brandishing thermometers. It's a wonder you didn't bring any chooks in, or maybe you did - maybe you were the chook that came to the dispatch box. - By agreement with the Australian Democrats, the government will be introducing a new broad based goods and services tax and abolishing Labor's wholesale sales tax - the wholesale sales tax that the Labor Party loves, Mr Speaker, you will recall, which has one rate for chocolate Quik and another for strawberry Quik. This agreement was reached with the Australian Democrats because the Australian Democrats had a policy of excluding food from a GST. We have come to an agreement with them that food in restaurants will be taxable, takeaway food will be taxable, meals which are prepared will be taxable and fresh -  - I am actually explaining an agreement which was reached between the government and the Australian Democrats, the Australian Democrats being the second most responsible economic party in this parliament - with the Labor Party long after. The agreement with the Australian Democrats is as follows: food which is served in restaurants will be taxable, takeaway food will be taxable, pre-prepared meals will be taxable and fresh food will not be taxable. What that means, Mr Speaker, is that fresh food, which is GST free, should become cheaper than it now is under Labor's tax system. The Labor Party never had a system for making food WST free. Food always had the embedded costs of WST in it under the Labor Party's regime and so, with the new tax system, food actually becomes cheaper. And not only does food become cheaper, but pensions are increased, income taxes are cut, family allowan  ces are increased and Commonwealth-state relations are improved.This side of the House believes in doing things; reforming and building a stronger Australian economy. Nothing could more illustrate the irrelevance of the once great Australian Labor Party than a second generation politician, without any policy, wandering into the parliament and, as his big gag for the day, waving around a thermometer.</DOC>

 - While our opponents opposite play games and throw mud, the government has got on with the business of governing Australia. The government has got on with the business of delivering not only a stronger and better taxation system, not only stronger and better environmental policies, but also today in the government's response to the parliamentary committee report, To have and to hold  - a bipartisan committee chaired by the member for Menzies, who has played a major role in constructing family policy in the time that he has been in the national parliament - we have underlined the ongoing commitment of this government to practical policy designed to help the generality of Australian families.In addition to a number of specific measures that I announced today, we made it clear that the foundation of stable family life in this country is stable economic and social conditions throughout the nation. This government has delivered like none other in the last generation in providing a stable Australian economy, and that is demonstrated through the dramatic fall in the level of housing interest rates. Nothing goes more directly to  the value of the weekly pay packet of the average Australian family than the cost of a housing mortgage. The average Australian family is $330 a month better off as a result of the policies of this government.The average Australian family is more interested in a group of political parties in a government, in a coalition, that will deliver real benefits to them than they are in a group of politicians who play games and throw mud. What we have seen over the past few weeks is a classic demonstration of the great divide in Australian politics. We are for policies; we are for taking the Australian people forward to an even better millennium. The Labor Party is for looking backwards, for throwing mud and for playing games. I say to the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that games are no substitute for policy. Mud slinging is no substitute for offering a policy alternative and the longer you continue down that path, the more you will condemn yourself in the eyes of the Australian community.Our policy in relation to families is soundly based in the belief that we need to provide strong and stable economic and social conditions. We need to recognise the right of families to choose according to their own assessments of what is right for them and the caring arrangements for their young children. I am very proud of the fact that our tax package provides not only personal tax cuts of about $12 billion a year but also an additional family package of over $2 billion, which will significantly redress the imbalance that has developed over last 15 years in the taxation system, where a bias has crept in against those people in the Australian community who have the responsibility of raising children.It is very significant in the independent analysis that has been done of the taxation package that a number of bodies have highlighted the fact that it is middle income families who get the most benefits out of our taxation package. And that is no mistake, because our policies are directed fairly and squarely at the mainstream of the Australian community. We recognise that our responsi  bility is to govern for the mainstream of the Australian community.In the national family strategy that I announced today we announced the establishment of a Marriage and Family Council to take forward the work of the Family Services Council. We announced the trialling of a voucher scheme for pre-marriage education through a network of accredited providers. We reaffirmed our commitment to providing policies in the workplace that will encourage the optimum blend of work and family responsibilities. One of the greatest benefits of the industrial relations reforms of this government is that they have maximised the opportunities for effective choice for Australian families, for working men and women, in relation to the blending of their family and work responsibilities.Let me say once again that this side of politics - the Liberal and National parties - are about developing forward looking policies for the future of the Australian community and the future of the Australian family. The Labor Party is not only locked in backward looking, regressive policies, but its response to our policy is simply to play games and throw mud.</DOC>

 - The government has come to an agreement with the Australian Democrats - which is the responsible economic party in Australia, apart from the government - in relation to tax reform. If the Australian Labor Party was really interested in cleaning up definitions, the Australian Labor Party could have voted; it could have actually dealt itself into this debate. The Australian Labor Party took a decision to deal itself out of the debate and, because the Australian Labor Party took a decision to deal itself out of the debate, the real, responsible opposition economic party, the Australian Democrats, got the box seat in relation to tax reform. When the history of tax reform in Australia is written, people will say, `Why is it that Meg Lees was more important than Simon Crean?' The answer is that Meg Lees is more economically responsible than Simon Crean. The answer is that Meg Lees is somebody who is able to take responsibility for decisions and step up to the plate and negotiate with government.You have to ask yourself: why would a party like Labor have no policy? I will tell you the answer. A party like Labor has no policy because a party like Labor has no leadership. To have a policy requires leadership. Here we have a party which votes against everything because it cannot stand for anything. - As I said, the reason why the government has come to an agreement with the Australian Democrats is that the Australian Democrats have sought to be relevant to the tax debate. The Australian Democrats have sought to be part of tax reform in Australia. When the Australian Democrats put to us the way in which they would like the GST to apply to food, we agreed with the Australian Democrats and their definitions. That was necessary to reform the Australian taxation system, and it was well worth it.</DOC>

 - The member for McEwen is right to refer to the fact that the decision of the Senate to support the privatisation of a further slice of Telstra means that more and more Australians can join the direct ownership of this great national asset; more Australians can join the hundreds of thousands of Australians who already own shares in this great company. This great company will be even greater as a result of the decision that the Australian parliament has taken.It is worth pausing for a moment and analysing just exactly what the opponents of the privatisation of Telstra have voted against. First and foremost, they have voted against getting rid of Labor's debt. That is the first thing they have done. The greatest benefit for the entire nation through the privatisation of Telstra is the capacity it gives to the people of this country to rid themselves of Commonwealth debt at the commencement of the new millennium. But it becomes worse than that when you analyse the benefits that have flowed from the privatisation of Telstra. We are aware that in 1996 the coalition secured a mandate to privatise one-third of Telstra and that in voting against that Labor was not only voting against the decision of the Australian people; Labor was also voting against the largest environmental investment in our nation's history - that is, the Natural Heritage Trust. Labor also voted against improved communications for rural and regional Australia. Labor wanted to deny 1.8 million Australians the opportunity to take a stake in Telstra, and 559,000 of the 1.8 million shareholders in Telstra as a result of the first tranche of Telstra being sold were shareholders for the first time.Almost 600,000 men and women in the mainstream of the Australian community took up this opportunity to buy a direct stake in this great national asset. But worse still, the  party of Chifley and Curtin voted to deny Telstra employees from owning their own company. No fewer than 92 per cent of the employees of Telstra took up the offer to buy shares in the company. Well may the member for Melbourne nod his head, because the member for Melbourne supports the privatisation -  - At the last election, we frankly and openly told the Australian people that, if re-elected, we would present legislation for the further privatisation of Telstra. Thankfully, that legislation has now passed through the parliament - to the extent that we now have parliamentary authority to sell a further 16.6 per cent of Telstra. But once again, the Australian Labor Party - the party of Chifley and Curtin - has voted against a measure that will give to ordinary Australian workers enormous additional benefits. Apart from anything else, in the sale of the further tranche of Telstra we are once again going to provide additional incentives for the workers in Telstra to take up shares in the new issue.But those who sit opposite, who claim to represent those workers, voted against it. They voted against extending SBS to another $1 million Australians. They voted against putting banking services back into the bush in 500 small towns. They voted to deny rural and regional Australians access to the Internet at the price of a local call. They voted against continuous mobile phone coverage on Australian highways. They voted against an extra $250 million to further protect our environ  ment. They voted to oppose a boost to Australia's information technology and electronics sector.The privatisation of a further tranche of Telstra brings enormous benefits for rural Australia. It will bring enormous benefits for the workers in Telstra. It will help to reduce the debt that we inherited from the economic mismanagement by the Leader of the Opposition. In every sense, it gives the people of Australia an opportunity to directly own a share in a great Australian asset.</DOC>

I think the Prime Minister described those comments as `negative and backward looking'. I agree with the Prime Minister's assessment. I am always interested when the Labor Party wheels into the federal parliament quoting and relying on Mr Kennett. It shows that they admire him. There is a lot to admire in Mr Kennett.

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I think all Australians will be pleased to know that Australia has been invited to join the Financial Stability Forum, a forum which has been set up by the G7 to look at the international financial architecture. The announcement by the G7 that Australia, along with Hong Kong, Singapore and the Netherlands, had been invited to join the Financial Stability Forum noted that those four countries were considered significant financial centres. This is, firstly, international recognition that, outside of the G7, Australia is one of the four significant international financial centres and, secondly, international recognition that on the matter of the international financial architecture Australia in many respects has played a leading role.At the end of last year the Prime Minister asked me to report to him with a task force on measures that could and should be taken to reform the international financial system. We reported, and the Prime Minister took those issues up at the APEC leaders forum meeting, we have taken them up in the International Monetary Fund and, most recently, I took them up at the APEC finance ministers meeting in Langkawi, Malaysia. Australia has been urging in the international role that there should be more work done on highly leveraged institutions, or hedge funds, and that they should be forced to make greater disclosure. We have been urging that developing countries need to have systems to deal with volatile capital flows. We have been urging that the impact of offshore financial centres should be examined. We took a series of initiatives to the APEC finance ministers meeting which, by and large, were adopted at that meeting. The G7 has set up a Financial Stability Forum to look at those issues. Along with the G7, four countries, one of which is Australia, will be involved in looking at these issues.This is a recognition of the hard yards that have been done. It is a recognition of our own economic success in the face of the Asian financial crisis. It is a recognition of the work that we have done in strengthening our own  domestic institutions. It is a recognition of the Prime Minister's diplomatic efforts. For all Australians, being part of that international forum, of which there are only 11 countries in the world, indicates that Australia will be able to play a key role in a major body on a major issue which will affect the world financial system.</DOC>

 - I think Kentucky Fried Chicken has today put out a press release welcoming the government's changes. So, good timing on the question. We appreciate it very much, thank you. We would like a few more of them. In relation to the application of goods and services tax, the liability lies on a registered business. -  - I am looking for it. I will table it as soon as I find it. It is somewhere in here. The liability falls on a registered business, and a business reaching certain turnover limits has to register. The liability falls on a business, just as a liability in relation to wholesale sales tax falls on business. Liability in relation to financial institutions duty, which the Labor Party loves, liability in relation to bank account debits tax, which the Labor Party loves, and liability in relation to stamp duty on shares is on those  who are doing the transaction. The liability does not fall on consumers; it falls on registered businesses. Registered businesses, as we know, will be given assistance by the government in setting up their schemes. I think the fact that most businesses in Australia support tax reform stands as a testament to how out of touch the Labor Party is on this issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hindmarsh for her question and, indeed, for her interest in this issue. The Australian government supports the decision made by the United Nations Secretary-General to implement a short delay in the timing of the ballot in East Timor for security and logistical reasons. The Secretary-General is to report shortly - I think during today, New York time - in greater detail to the Security Council.	 The government has been in close contact over the last few weeks with the United Nations on this matter. On Monday of last week I met with the Secretary-General in New York, and Kofi Annan and I discussed the question of whether the ballot should or should not be delayed. Certainly we have taken the view that we would ideally like to see the ballot take place on time, but that if there were significant security problems still in place and logistical issues to be resolved then a short delay would be appropriate.I also discussed these matters with Ambassador Marker, the Secretary-General's special representative and other officials from the United Nations. Our Ambassador in Jakarta, John McCarthy, met with Mr Marker and also with the UNAMET head, Ian Martin, on 21 and 22 June to follow up the discussions I had in New York. We do share the Secretary-General's concerns about the security situation in East Timor. A secure and peaceful  environment is clearly fundamental to the success of the ballot. We have been urging over a long period now the Indonesian government and, more specifically, the Indonesian military to take further action to improve the security situation, and we will continue to do that.We remain committed to doing all we can to support the consultation process. We have provided substantial logistical support, and I have told the Secretary-General that we will provide additional support if additional support is necessary. It is the Australian government's view, and I think it is the Secretary-General's view as well, that the more the United Nations presence is deployed - that is, the civilian police presence, the military liaison presence as well as the civilian presence - the better the chance of improving the security environment in East Timor. We are hopeful that the deployments that are now taking place will have a significant impact on that environment.As I said at the beginning, the government supports the Secretary-General's decision on a short delay. We would not want to see a substantial delay, because if the delay were to be for, say, six or nine months - over a significant period - then it would play into a completely new political environment within Indonesia itself, and the opportunity for holding the ballot at all may be lost. This government has played a key role in bringing about the possibility of a United Nations ballot in East Timor for the first time in a generation. It is an enormous contribution that we have been able to make to seeing the great problem of East Timor resolved, and we will continue to work for a satisfactory resolution of this matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I acknowledge the longstanding interest that he has shown in families and the submissions he has made on reducing income tax burdens on families. As far as the Liberal and National parties are concerned, we think that families should have lower income tax rates. We think that under Labor income tax rates were too high, that families were being punished and that they need tax relief. From 1 July 2000 - this is the great news - families in Australia are going to get income tax cuts. The Labor Party has been defeated in its bid to keep income taxes up and the Labor Party has been defeated in its bid to prevent the cutting of income taxes.This government introduced, after the 1996 election, a tax cut for all families. From 1 July 2000 we will be introducing tax cuts across the board. The tax-free threshold will be lifted to $6,000. The 20 per cent rate will be cut to 17c. The 34c and 43c rates will be cut as low as 30 cents in the dollar and the threshold for the 47 per cent rate will be  pushed out. From 1 July, a single person with no dependents on average wages of about $37,000 will take home around $22 a week extra as a result of income tax cuts. From 1 July 2000, a one-income family earning $29,000 with one child under five will receive an additional $58 a week in income tax cuts and additional family assistance. This side of politics believes that single income families on moderate earnings are entitled to income tax justice, and the great thing is that Labor has been defeated in its campaign to keep their income taxes high.I was asked whether there were any alternative policies on offer, and the answer, I fear, is no. There are no alternative policies that are being offered by the formal opposition in this country. They know what they are against; what they don't know is what they are for. They are against indirect tax reform, they are against income tax reform, they are against family assistance reform and they are against the new Commonwealth-state financial deal. They are a group of people who can only say no because they cannot say yes. Why would a political party have no policy? A political party has no policy when it has no leadership, because to have a policy requires leadership - to stand for something is much harder than to stand against something.We saw in the paper that the Leader of the Opposition has cancelled his overseas trip in July. When Leaders of the Opposition start cancelling overseas trips to stay in the country, it is a sure bet that their leadership is in trouble. When he says he is going to be running around the country listening, he is going to be listening to his backbench, he is going to be listening to who they want as their leader and he is going to be listening as to how to shore up his leadership position. We don't blame him either. There are many more caucus votes to be found here than at No. 10 Downing Street, and from this side of the parliament we wish him all the best in his leadership.</DOC>

 - I have seen the news release and the news release in fact says, as I recall, that the NFF has supported the introduction of a broad based consumption tax for the past 10 years. I think the point that Mr Donges is making is that those farmers who are in the GST-free area will not get the benefits of cash flow that those farmers who are in the GST-applicable area do. If you are in the GST-applicable area, as you know, you collect GST and you hold it for a quarter before remitting it. What Mr Donges is saying is that those farmers, such as horticulturalists, who are in the GST-free area will not get the benefit of that cash flow. They will not be holding GST. I think that is the point that he is making.Let me turn that around the other way. If the Labor Party had its way, there would be no farmer getting the benefit of GST cash flow. Mr Speaker, do you see how the argument runs? The Labor Party stands up and says, `We are upset that there are some farmers that won't get the benefit of the GST.' That is its position. It is like the member up here who says, `What about the transporters? Only some of them are getting 20c a litre.' The Leader of the Opposition says, `They are only getting a growth tax without food; that's terrible.' The shadow minister for whatever he is the shadow minister for says, `Horticulturalists won't get the benefit of the GST cash flow advantage that the pastoralists, wheat farmers, all of the other broadacre farmers and everybody else will.' If you really wanted people to get the benefit of the  cash flow advantage, you would be supporting the government's position. It is absolutely illegitimate for the Australian Labor Party to say that it is against any cash flow for any farmer because it is against GST and then get up and complain about an exemption. It is like diesel. The Labor Party says, `We are against any cash back for any transporter,' and then wants to claim that there are some people missing out. It is like the growth tax: it is an absolutely illegitimate argument. I am sure that those farmers who are on the opposition frontbench will explain that to the shadow minister. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He represents a vast area of New South Wales. He is very keen to see that people in that far-flung region have every possible opportunity to advance their interests in what are unquestionably challenging times. The reality is that we are now in a position to offer $1 billion worth of social bonus, which will greatly enhance both the quality of life and economic opportunities for people in rural and regional areas through what amounts to a coordinated and well-directed set of policies. This is in stark contrast to the total absence of policies being put up by the other side.Interestingly, I am told that those glum faces out there on the other side reflect the fact that they have been told to go out and sell their policies. In caucus they have been  told to go out and sell the good message of what they have to offer. It must be a pretty demoralising experience because I thought really that, in answering the question, it would be most useful to have a look at what members on this side of the House are able to say about the policy position that they are currently in and that they are able to put to their people.The member who asked the question was able to say yesterday that securing a second partial sale of Telstra is a best of both worlds victory for the people of western New South Wales and that better recreational and commercial telecommunications services will eliminate the tyranny of distance in western New South Wales while the nation will pay billions of dollars less in interest. The federal member for Murray has been able to say that the $1 billion social bonus from the 16 per cent sale of Telstra will deliver improved telecommunications services throughout regional and rural Victoria, boosting business, information technology and job opportunities. She said that the funding intentions announced today would help rural and regional communities to access the future. Can they offer those things to their people? What can they offer by contrast? Where can they go out with their rural communities and make these sorts of claims? They cannot.The member for Hinkler has been able to point to the fact that between 200 and 250 rural and regional communities will now get access to SBS television - 200 to 250 communities across rural Australia that do not have SBS will now get SBS. The member for Riverina has been able to talk about extended mobile phone coverage. That is one policy that they did have. They had one. It was to deny a whole lot of Australians access to mobile phone coverage. We are not only keeping it alive but extending it for a whole lot of people right across regional Australia. The member for Riverina says:Extended mobile phone coverage and federally funded SBS are two issues that I have been working hard to achieve . . . In securing funding for these initiatives, we narrow the service gap between city and country areas.The NFF, quoted here just a moment ago, said that the most valuable element of the  extra allocation would be improved telecommunications infrastructure in the bush. It said:Country people will also benefit from the significant reduction in call costs for extended zone users in rural Australia . . .The federal member for New England has been able to say that this would be of great benefit for New England and other areas of regional Australia. It was beautifully summed up by the member for McEwen, who is able to say to this House that farmers from her area of Mansfield have not only thanked her but also asked that those thanks be passed on to the federal government. What a contrast with the policy vacuum that the others are supposed to go out and sell - I do not know what with - in the areas that, presumably, the Leader of the Opposition wants them to go to.</DOC>

 - I thank the whip for his question. The time has come to take a very careful look at notice of motion No. 10 on the Notice Paper . The simple fact of the matter is that this government's so-called tax reform legislation stands in tatters. There is not a single economic journalist in this country who supports them.  - I go to why it is relevant to discuss point (1) of the motion now, since the Deputy Prime Minister wants to do it by the book. The first point is:that the national taxation debate is no longer about `tax reform' but merely about `tax change' - and not change for the better We have got no better authority on that than Professor Peter Dixon of the Centre for Policy Studies at Monash University, who says that all those things that were claimed for it - that it would improve the adequacy of the tax system, that it would improve its simplicity - are nonsense. He revealed that. His final conclusion on it was, `Why would you bother?' - I would have thought the report from the Centre for Policy Studies, produced yesterday, gives ample urgency to a consideration of this matter. That particular report - this is why we must discuss it - pointed out that we gain nothing from the tax system in simplicity as far as this is concerned. We are introducing a massively complex new tax that is going to be borne by all Australian families. It delivers nothing in terms of simplicity to the size and the complexity of the act - nothing whatsoever. The conclusion, like that of every economic journalist, is `Why would you bother?'It is urgent that point (2) of the motion be considered as it points out that, on the official estimate of the Treasurer, this tax package costs at least $20 billion over the first three years of its operation. That is $20 billion which could be spent effectively on a genuine, decent tax cut for families, like the Labor Party's proposition on working family tax credits. That is the only genuinely new piece  of policy introduced since the last election campaign. - On that point of order, the rule on questions to other members is this:Questions may be put to a Member, not being a Minister or an Assistant Minister, relating to any bill, motion or other public matter connected with the business of the House, of which the Member has charge.Then the rules which apply are the rules for questions in standing order 144. The rules that apply in that case, of course, are all the rules that apply to you lot. When there is a bill being questioned - any bill that may be before the House - there are, of course, constraints. I would remind you that this is a motion. - So the reason why point (2) has urgency now is that all the flexibility to do a decent business tax cut has been constrained now by so-called revenue neutrality. Business has already given it the office in this package with what it has done on the business numbering system, which we support, and what is being done with taxing trusts of companies, which we support, but we are not sure about the Nationals. They have  given it the office, but now they have to give more. So what might have created a few jobs in this country is in fact not going to create the jobs that it could have done because they have been constrained by the fiscal parameters of this particular proposition, costing $20 billion, and they will have to work out ways in which they can get families to carry the entire tax burden.We ought to consider point (3) now as there will be, as a result of the changes on food, some 375,000 small businesses -  - The other reason why point (3) is important is that we have had the Premier of Victoria come out and say that the  problems of compliance these 375,000 small businesses confront are just diabolical. They are going to be entitled to about $300 worth of compensation for putting in a $15,000 cash register with bar codes. He knows darn well that they are not going to thank you for that. The families who run small business in this country are not going to thank you for the fact that they sit up an extra two hours every night trying to rationalise their books. The Victorian Premier has added urgency to this -  - I think it is very urgent. This is why point (3) is so important, the Premier of Victoria having come out this week - before the parliament has had the opportunity to consider these matters - and described these proposed changes, specifically because of their impact on small business, as `diabolical'. These proposed changes are diabolical because of the massive compliance costs that will be imposed on small business and the fact that small business will not have the resources to be able to confront them. Finally we get to point (4), which says this:as a result of the GST food fiasco, the States will be required to keep indefinitely a range of state taxes and duties amounting to $2.5 billion which the Government promised prior to the last election would be abolished.The Treasurer still persists in this place arguing that they have indeed been abolished when he knows darn well that they are on the never-never. There has been no simplification of this tax system, just a rendering of it as massively complex.Everybody in the country knows this: that the tax cuts they get are the tax cuts they are entitled to, and no more; and that what they are getting from the goods and services tax is a massive tax on Australian families. That is why your voters do not want it. - That is why our voters do not want it. That is why the bush does not want it. That is why we need to discuss this motion now - so that we can expose the farce that this tax change has become.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As part of the agreement between the Australian Democrats and the government last night, the government undertakes to ensure that the states will keep arrangements providing for rebates on cellar door and mail order sales for wineries of up to $300,000. This will be of enormous benefit for wineries, particularly small wineries who at the moment use cellar door sales or mail order arrangements to give a rebate and encourage tourism. The government believes that this will be a great thing for small wineries. In partnership with the Australian Democrats, who have been part of the tax debate, we have come to that agreement.The origin of the rebates was that the states had imposed, in relation to wine, business franchise fees which were struck down by the High Court. The business franchise fees did not apply to cellar door sales and mail order sales, whereas the Commonwealth wholesale sales tax did apply. Because the High Court struck down the business franchise fees at the request of the states, the Commonwealth applied the equivalent of the franchise fees by topping up the wholesale sales tax. Because that was a state revenue base and because that state revenue base had not previously includ  ed cellar door sales, the states undertook to, and did, run rebate schemes.Now that the Commonwealth is abolishing financial assistance grants, abolishing the safety net arrangements and introducing a goods and services tax which will ensure that the states have all of the revenue which they previously had and more, the states should be in a position to continue those rebate schemes. Indeed, I understand that South Australia has already indicated that it will, and I understand that the matter is under consideration in Western Australia and quite possibly in Victoria as well. -  - I know that the member for Kingston, as the Labor Party's vigneron, is interested in this point. I also know that the Labor Party's vigneron has been ringing up radio stations, making submissions in relation to tax - as the member for Kingston, interestingly enough, not as a vigneron. But we do acknowledge and welcome his interest as a winegrower. As I said yesterday, he is really a source manufacturer for the chardonnay drinkers of the Australian Labor Party. In fact, we could call him the `sauce manufacturer', keeping the left-wing chardonnay set in the Labor Party fuelled for branch discussions in relation to those certainly important left-wing issues that old Martin, the member for Batman, is not so concerned about. I suppose Martin would prefer a red to a chardonnay. - He would prefer a pink. Simon is the red. These old ACTU presidents - one red, one pink, Batman and Hotham -  - Second generation politicians - all in dad's family business, aren't we, Labor members of parliament? - In relation to cellar door sales, the Australian Democrats and the government have agreed that those cellar door rebates will continue. They should be funded by the states, which will have plenty of revenue under the GST and the guarantee system. We will be negotiating that with the states in the near future.</DOC>

 - I am glad the Leader of the Opposition asked me that question. When a number of questions were asked on this yesterday, I said that I would analyse them. I have certainly analysed the questions and I have also analysed some of the public comments that have been made about the questions. One of the public comments - I will come to it in a moment - was made by the Mayor of the City of Cairns, Councillor Tom Pyne, who I understand has been a member of the Australian Labor Party all his life. In a statement under the heading `Mayor slates city being dragged through the mud' he had a few comments to make about the remarks that have been made by those who sit opposite. - Order! The member for Herbert! The Manager of Opposition Business is entitled to be heard in silence, as is every other member. - The Manager of Opposition Business knows that that cannot be a point of order under relevance. The Prime Minister is being relevant to the question that was asked and has the call. - As a result of the questions that were asked yesterday by the member for Hotham, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I discussed the matter with -  - The member for Dobell is quite right, but the Prime Minister has not indicated that is his intent. - I do not believe that others may interject when the Speaker has the floor. I thought the Prime Minister was indicating that some of what he answered yesterday was relevant to the question asked today and, until I have evidence to the contrary, I will hear him. - A series of questions were asked and, as a result of that, I had a lengthy discussion with the member for Leichhardt during which I sought an explanation and a comment upon the allegations that had been made against him. As a result of that, the member for Leichhardt has written a lengthy letter to me, together with a large number of attachments. I table that letter. I sent a copy of that letter before question time to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.It is relevant to the questions asked both yesterday and today for me to make a number of observations and points. The first of those is that the land that was purchased by the member - the ownership of which was fully disclosed both on the House of Representatives register and on the return given to me - was bought at public auction for $26,000. Its value if it were freehold is $195,000 but that is not its value in the hands of the member for Leichhardt. It is also true that all of the  actions by the member for Leichhardt were taken in the bona fide discharge of his obligations and duties as a member of parliament.I mentioned a moment ago the statement that had been made by the Mayor of the City of Cairns, Councillor Tom Pyne, which is dated today. I will read this out because I think it is directly relevant to the quite scurrilous charge that has been made against the member for Leichhardt. - The member for Corio is doing nothing about the standards of the parliament. -  - The member for Burke is warned. - Under the heading `Mayor slates city dragged through the mud', the release states:Cairns mayor Cr Tom Pynehas slated some Federal politicians who have attempted to drag the city's name through the contaminated mud of the NatWest project at East Trinity.And at the same time they have tried to link Federal Member for Leichhardt Warren Entsch to the site as part of a sustained attack on the local politician.'The fact that Mr Entsch works very closely with this council on a wide range of community issues is well known.'This positive partnership has done so much good for the Cairns community.'As a life member of the Labor Party, I find it refreshing that a man from the other side of the political fence is prepared to put everything else aside and work in the best interests of the people he serves.'Anyone who knows the East Trinity area also knows that the NatWest site has been the subject of many failed proposals over the last 20 years.'It remains a degraded, contaminated site behind a bund wall which the giant CSR company found was unviable for the purposes of growing cane.'In fact, it was Mr Entsch who joined with East Trinity ratepayers to highlight that the soil on the site was heavily contaminated with acid sulphate, and successfully lobbied for a report from the CSIRO to be made public.' Cr Pyne said any suggestions of a bridge being pushed across the inlet to that site was 'pie in the sky stuff.''Successive State governments ruled this out under the FNQ2010 regional transport strategy, and this council has taken the same position,' he said.Cr Pyne also said that more than 80 per cent of all land identified under a draft development control plan . . . for potential urban development across Trinity Inlet involved the NatWest site.'But for those in far away Canberra who are unfamiliar with Cairns's geography, this site is only one parcel of a large area of land across the inlet which is known as East Trinity,' he said.'Mr Entsch's property is more than 10 km away from NatWest's site and is a restrained parcel bounded by national parks and with no identified urban potential under that DCP,' he said.'We will continue to work with Mr Entsch in the best interests of all residents across the Inlet,' said Cr Pyne. -  - Attached to the letter that was sent to me by the member for Leichhardt is a note from the Chancellor of James Cook University, Lieutenant General Grey, the former head of the Army, who comments inter alia in relation to the workshop that was organised at the request of the member for Leichhardt in furtherance of the interests of his constituents:The Workshop was as close as you could get to an apolitical meeting of experts and interested parties trying to solve a major problem in the Leichhardt electorate. It has been evident for some time that the solution is likely to take time and significant funding, the source of which is yet to be identified.It was also the subject of critical comment yesterday including, on the information available to me, a quite erroneous report appearing as the lead story in today's Sydney Morning Herald  regarding some comments I think of a Dr Fitzpatrick in relation to the alleged misconstruction of the CSIRO report. The thrust of that report in the Sydney Morning Herald  was in some way that improper pressure had been applied by Mr Entsch, the member for Leichhardt, to CSIRO in relation to the publication of this report.The information that I have in the form of the letter that was provided to me by Mr  Entsch includes a letter dated today's date from Malcolm McIntosh, the respected Chief Executive of CSIRO, which details the sequence of events in relation to this report. He says inter alia:The letter was dealt with in the normal way by sending it to CSIRO for a draft response. At no time did Mr Entsch or his office contact us about the content of the reply. The draft letter from Mr Entsch to Mr Whitney was delivered to Mr Entsch's office on 31 March 1999. We also provided an executive summary of CSIRO's work to be sent to Mr Whitney with the letter which noted that CSIRO was writing up the research as a formal report but that it had not yet been peer reviewed, part of our internal quality control.He goes on to say:Neither Mr Zagar nor Mr Entsch made an attempt at any stage to influence the final report or its findings.I repeat:Neither Mr Zagar nor Mr Entsch made an attempt at any stage to influence the final report or its findings.Of course ratepayers were keen for this report to be made available. It had been commissioned as far back as 1995, and the people of that district had a legitimate interest.At all stages, the member for Leichhardt has disclosed his personal financial interest in this land. The member for Leichhardt was making a valid bona fide representation on behalf of interested constituents regarding a longstanding environmental challenge in his electorate. To assert that in the circumstances of this case there is a conflict of interest involved is to assert the ridiculous proposition that it is beyond the capacity of any person, particularly one representing a rural or regional electorate in this parliament, to make representations that might in some way improve the amenity of that district.For example, it would be improper for a member of this House who owns a rural property to seek funds from the government for flood mitigation that might improve the value of that rural property. It would be beyond the warrant of a representative of a rural community in this parliament owning a property within that electorate to make representations regarding the building of a road that might enhance the amenity of the proper  ty. It would be beyond the warrant of people to argue for regional development funds. It would be beyond the capacity and the right of a member who owned a property in an area to seek resources under the Natural Heritage Trust that might improve the amenity of the property.In other words, what the Labor Party members have done on this occasion - in their desperate search for dirt as a substitute for decent politics - is to stretch the meaning of conflict of interest beyond all reason. I am satisfied on the information made available to me that the member for Leichhardt has behaved properly, he has behaved energetically and he has behaved enthusiasticly in pursuit of the interests and the rights of his constituents, and I am satisfied with the explanation that he has thus far provided to me.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question, which draws attention to the very important speech on family policy that the Prime Minister made this morning. The Prime Minister clearly demonstrated again that it is this side of the House that is doing all the work on policy development and it is this side of the House that cares about families and is providing real benefits for families. My word, that contrasts with the member for Lilley, who yesterday put out a media release to try to pre-empt the Prime Minister's speech, but all he did was draw attention to the absolute emptiness of Labor's policy development. In fact, if they stuffed a thermometer into their policy pot, the mercury would drop below zero; but if it came to rhetoric, then it would go to fever pitch. That is about the only use they can make of thermometers.The member for Lilley actually suggested yesterday that this government had cut $1 billion out of child care. The truth of the matter is that this government in 1999-2000 will spend $1.1 billion on child care, and that  is nine per cent more than Labor spent in their last year in office. So there have been no cuts. There have actually been increases in child-care expenditure, and that flows right through. Some 93,000 families are now registered with Centrelink for school aged child-care assistance. We have provided 30,000 extra new long day care places. When it comes to outside school hours care, the matter referred to by the honourable member for Parramatta in his question, we have funded 87,000 extra places. That is what this government does when it comes to child care - we boost expenditure, we provide more places.And we have done a lot more. In fact, the legislation already passed by this House which will simplify the child-care benefits by combining two payments into one will mean an increase again in child-care assistance for Australian families - that is, $7.50 a week for a low income family with one child in full-time care. This is the government that cares about families, that cares about the care of their children, that provides real increases in resources to ensure that Australian families can enjoy the services that are available in this country.</DOC>

 - As I think I said yesterday, as part of the agreement between the government and the Australian Democrats, the government will ensure that the states continue to operate rebate schemes. As I think I said yesterday to the House, I understood that the South Australian government had already indicated that it would. You ask me why I said that. I said that because the Winemakers Federation put a submission into the Australian Senate saying that it had. I was relying on the Winemakers Federation -  - Oh, okay - you are not allowed to rely on the Winemakers Federation. When the Winemakers Federation says that South Australia has agreed, that is untrue, is it? The Winemakers Federation says to the Senate that the South Australian government has agreed to continue a rebate scheme and you are not allowed to say, `I understand they have agreed to continue a rebate scheme.' What an appalling thing, to actually believe a Senate submission from the Winemakers Federation! Today I still believe the submission from the Winemakers Federation. - I have also indicated, as I told the House yesterday and as I assured the Australian Democrats, that this government has undertaken to ensure that the states will continue those schemes, and we undertook that by a letter which was signed 36 hours ago and we now have 12 months in which to get their agreement. I know the opposition thinks we can accomplish tax reform with the click of a finger and an instantaneous ray of light, but I will back us over the next 12 months and, having given that understanding and assurance 36 hours ago, I now have 365 days minus 36 hours to bring it off.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for what I think is a very, very appropriate question. - The member for Grey asks the eminently sensible question: are there any alternative proposals to those currently being progressed by the government in a number of areas? I will take the areas that have been raised in the question by the member for Grey. He asks: is there an alternative to the government's taxation reform program? The answer to that of course is no. All we have had from the Labor Party are stunts, all we have had is negative reaction, all we have had from the Labor Party is negative criticism. The Labor Party, from the very beginning of the tax debate in this country in July 1997, has set out at all stages to obstruct, to destroy, to mislead and to behave in a negative fashion. On the eve of the passage of legislation through this parliament, the Labor Party stands bereft of any  policy alternative to the tax reform agenda being posed by the government.I move on to the next issue, that is, job opportunities for young Australians. We had a marvellous opportunity this morning to witness just how negative the Labor Party has been about job opportunities for young Australians. We had tabled by my colleague the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business the report of the Industrial Relations Commission which essentially agreed with the philosophy that the government has been pursuing over the last three or four years. That shows in stark relief the absolutely negative approach of the Leader of the Opposition, who in May of this year boasted to the Australian public that the Labor Party had voted against a proposal to protect the jobs of a quarter of a million young Australians. Now we have the situation that even the Industrial Relations Commission has endorsed the approach being taken by the government.What do we have when we move to the issue of modernising Australia's environmental laws? All we get in the Senate is personal abuse directed by Senator Faulkner on behalf of the Labor Party against the Leader of the Australian Democrats. Instead of embracing the reforms to Australia's environmental laws, the Labor Party have gone down the track of narky, negative criticism. They have no policies. They have no alternatives. They have no vision. They have no alternative strategy. All they seek to do is criticise. All they seek to do is behave like the political narks that they are, Mr Speaker. All they seek to do is to engage in mud slinging and personal denigration.The list goes on, Mr Speaker; strengthening choice for families. In the last budget we did more than any government, I believe, in the history of this country to entrench the principle of parental choice in education. In the words of a spokesman for the Independent Christian Schools of Australia, this government has done more than any other to put choice within the reach of working class families when it comes to the education of their children.What is the Labor Party's response to that? The response of the Labor Party is to dredge up a decades old debate that we had put behind us in the maturity of the modern age, a decades old debate that attempts to draw a distinction between Australians according to whether they were educated at a government school or an independent school. Shame on the Labor Party for trying to revive such an old debate. Shame on the Labor Party for misleading the Australian public about the respective roles of state and federal governments. Shame on the Labor Party for being so negative.There is mounting evidence - and the latest is some very interesting research referred to in yesterday's issue of the Bulletin magazine - of a sense of optimism and hope within the Australian community; a growing belief on the part of the Australian public that we can in fact stare down the challenges that in the past it had defeated; the undeniable fact that we are living in an era of economic prosperity and strength that we have not seen since the late 1960s - in the face of all of that, we have a very stark contrast in this chamber.On the one hand we have the coalition party which is forging ahead with progressive policies to address the challenges of the day and the opportunities of the new millennium. On the other side we have a pathetic, irrelevant Labor Party whose only response in the absence of their own policy vacuum is to throw mud and engage in personal denigration.</DOC>

 - The questions get weaker and weaker. The agreement with the Australian Democrats is that food which is sold in restaurants and the like, food for consumption, is taxable. - But food which is not sold in restaurants or similar shops is not subject to the GST. - You can dress it up in your rather immature way, but it does not alter the fact. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition then asks: will I be giving advice on tax avoidance? I think that is what he said. Of course, he alleged that when I referred to the rules in relation to imports on books -  - He said that if you put up the price of a book with GST, people would go overseas to buy it. I think that is what he said. Let's take a book which is probably not well read called Civilising Global Capital  by Mr Mark Latham, which retails in my electorate at $24.95. If a GST applies to that book and that goes up by six per cent, it would go up by $1.50. Instead of retailing at $24.95, it would be retailing for $26.45. He says that, if that goes up from $24.95 by $1.50, everyone will go onto the Internet and buy it over the Internet. - They can avoid the tax. It goes up $1.50, and he says they will buy it on amazon.com. - We went to amazon.com to see if we could buy this book and the member for Werriwa will be very pleased to know that you can buy it through amazon.com for $US24.95, on an exchange rate of 65 cents. If you want to buy that on amazon.com and avoid the $1.50 of tax, you will pay - postage included, which will have it delivered to you in four days - $A91. - Here is the great tax avoidance institution. The Labor Party will be out advising people on avoiding tax, and getting a $24 book for $91. When they say WTG, they really mean it.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, you wonder how they said the budget was balanced when it was $10,000,000 million in deficit. It is the same crew that will avoid tax by buying a $24 book for $91.The member for Deakin asked me about recent indicators in relation to the Australian economy. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute leading index of economic activity was released yesterday showing that the current state of economic activity was 4.9 per cent in April above the trend of 3.6 per cent, and the leading index which indicates the speed of the economy in six months time surged during April to be 6.6 per cent. As the general manager of economics for Westpac commented: The index is even more clearly signalling that growth through 1999 and into 2000 will be well above long-term trend and overall the leading index for Australia continues to signal Australia's growth will be maintained at a healthy pace.Since the government came to office, inflation has averaged around one per cent per annum compared to an average of 5.2 per cent per annum under Labor. Because the government has had a policy of low inflation, that has meant that employees have had real wage rises. Real wages have averaged an increase of two per cent per annum under this government, compared to 0.3 per cent per annum under the Labor government.The Labor Party was a party of low real wages. Because the Labor Party could not control inflation, real wages under Labor were suppressed. I think this is the point that the member for Batman makes when he says that the Labor Party forgot about the working people when it was in government. It forgot about the working people because, although inflation was high, real wages grew slowly. The Governor of the Reserve Bank, in his testimony to the House of Representatives standing committee recently, said:Employees have seen that quite modest nominal wage increases have translated into decent real wage increases because inflation has been contained. They have not had to build anticipatory increases into their wage bargains to safeguard themselves against inflation getting away from them.So, low inflation, high productivity: real wage growth in a growing economy. It is true to say that it has been the big structural reforms that have helped Australia to get improved productivity. - The member for Kingston, who was part of the old guard that believes in economic responsibility, who was very much part of the Keating-Willis years, does talk about productivity. - But you should bear in mind - and the reason why the member for Dickson interjects now is that she says she joined the Labor Party because it gave away  economic responsibility - a big change occurred.The member for Kingston made a speech earlier on saying that he wanted a Productivity Commission inquiry in relation to the automobile industry. The Labor Party opposed the setting up of the Productivity Commission. - `Yes, we did,' says the member for Canberra. The member for Kingston wants a full-blown Productivity Commission inquiry into the car industry from an institution that the Labor Party opposed setting up because it considered it to be part of economic responsibility. The Labor Party wants to take credit for improved productivity in the economy whilst opposing competition reforms, opposing tax reforms, opposing corporate law reforms, opposing industrial relations reform and opposing the macro-economic reforms.If the member for Kingston wants to position the Labor Party in economic responsibility, the first thing he must do is deal with his leader and deputy leader. They took a deliberate decision after 1996 to walk away from economic responsibility and, until the Labor Party walks back, there is no point in these backbenchers running around and saying, `Oh, this is just political opportunism. You can expect it from an opposition.' The Australian public deserves much more than that, and until the battle is fought and won in the Australian Labor Party no member of the Australian Labor Party can claim any credit or any responsibility in relation to economic policy.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is still to make a major speech on the Australian economy. We run around with thermometers and chooks and salads, but not one decent policy. As I said yesterday, why would anyone want to lead a party that had no policy? Why would you have a party that had no policy? The failure of policy is a failure of leadership.</DOC>

 - There is, of course, no confusion on this matter, other than in one or two idle minds on the opposite side. It is a fact that, at the 9 April Premiers Conference, the Prime Minister agreed with the states that additional money - some $269 million - should be provided to the states in recognition of the extra costs associated with the goods and services tax on their housing costs. - The figure mentioned by way of interjection takes into account a lot more than the GST implications. It includes a whole lot of things that have got absolutely nothing whatever to do with the tax reform package, as he ought to well know. This $269 million figure was, incidentally, agreed with the states as the net effect of the GST, bearing in mind that at that particular stage there would be increases in rent payments to the states as a result of the higher pension payments that the Commonwealth is providing under the new tax arrangements.Under the arrangements with the Democrats, those increases in revenue to the state housing authorities will not occur. However, in the arrangements, the Commonwealth has provided to the states a number of areas of  revenue - enabling them to retain stamp duty, as referred to in the question - which will more than compensate for the loss of revenue associated with this arrangement with the Democrats. So the information provided by the Treasurer to this House and by Senator Newman is entirely consistent and entirely appropriate.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. This morning I tabled in the House a report by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on the subject of junior rates. Mr Speaker, you might remember that this was the subject of debate back in 1996. It was agreed at the Senate level and through the House of Representatives that there would be an inquiry into this whole issue of junior wage rates - an issue which has been particularly difficult since 1993 when the Labor Party implemented certain changes to the industrial laws which established a non-discriminatory provision which has held out the prospect of the abolition of junior wage rates. The government has today tabled that report. We welcome that report.I am pleased to advise the House that the report vindicates virtually every proposition which the government has put to the commission and which has formed the basis of the campaign that we have been waging to protect the jobs of hundreds of thousands of young people and the campaign that we have been waging to give young unemployed people the chance of a job in the future. After the years of controversy that have dogged this issue and created uncertainty for employers about providing jobs for young people, it is about time that this issue was finally resolved and that we had a legislative framework to  give young people the chance of a job and certainly the chance of protecting the jobs they have got.The Labor Party, all through this debate, have basically been in favour of abolishing junior wage rates. They are on the public record. If you go back to the last election, the then shadow minister for industrial relations said:As a matter of principle we do not support wage differentials based only on age. We do support wage differentials based on competency. Kim Beazley made this clear when asked about the issue in Perth yesterday.That has been Labor's policy position. In fact, they created the problem that we have had to solve in the time that we have been in office.Anybody with any commonsense can understand that, if you increase the wages of young people by 50 per cent, in a lot of businesses those young people, sadly, are going to lose the jobs they have. I think the Labor Party themselves have started to recognise the impossibility of their own position. So, when we did a deal with the Democrats to have an inquiry, they decided their best position was to hide behind the work being done by the commission and await the decision of the commission. In that sense, I have welcomed the fact that they basically committed themselves to the outcome of the inquiry. They have made that pretty clear. The Leader of the Opposition said in March this year:This is a test for the government. They should await the Commission report and study it carefully. Well, one party needs to be serious about the junior wages issue so it will be Labor - so he boasted in March. Since then, in February, the member for Batman said:The recommendations might even make tough decisions for the ALP.How right he was. Even the backbench were echoing this. The member for Lalor said:. . . and when it's completed that task to make the decisions operative through industrial relations awards and agreement . . .A clear commitment to the outcome of the report. The member for Canberra said:I implore the government to look very carefully at the outcome of the AIRC inquiry and to consider  very carefully all views and look very sincerely at the evidence that will be and is available.It is about time that we had a serious look at the commission's report. It is about time that you stood up here and supported the conclusions brought down by the commission through a process which you have been publicly endorsing for months and months. You have been hiding behind this report. - Now the report is out for all to see. Now that this report is out, it is time for you to stop prevaricating, stop hiding behind the process and finally have a policy position that will give the young people who have jobs the prospect of keeping those jobs and the possibility of more jobs in the future. The umpire has looked at the issue. As my opposite number said, `They've done a fine job.' - They have done a fine job. It is time that the Labor Party -  - today, here and now - stood up in this parliament and supported the conclusions of this inquiry and then went ahead to support the bill that we will reintroduce today. When that bill was defeated earlier this year, the Leader of the Opposition said he was chuffed at the capacity of the Labor Party to prevent young people having jobs. It is about time - young people ought to come first - the Labor Party supported the conclusion of this inquiry and thereby support the bill that we will introduce.</DOC>

 - I certainly do recall the statements I made about pursuing policies that would be beneficial to small business. I am extremely proud that we have in fact pursued those policies. We, of course, have delivered the lowest small business interest rates in 30 years. We are proposing to abolish the wholesale sales tax system, which is an enormous burden on small businesses in Australia. We have delivered more simple industrial relations laws. If the Labor Party would stop its mindless obstruction in the Senate, we could deliver -  - For the benefit of those who sit opposite - I know they do not know much about small business at all; they know very little about anything to do with the ordinary life of the great mainstream of the Australian community - I can tell them that there are a lot of things outside the taxation laws that involve red tape and multiplicity for small business. The industrial relations laws of this country and the multiplicity and complexity of the award system have been an enormous burden on small business. Which have been the parties that have been campaigning to reduce the red tape burden of the industrial relations laws on small business? The Liberal and National parties.As I was about to say before the point of order raised by the Leader of the Opposition, if the Labor Party would drop its mindless obstruction to our proposals to further reform the unfair dismissal laws of Australia, it would remove enormous small business complexity, enormous red tape and enormous constraints so far as small business is concerned.The government's taxation reform agenda will sweep away the absurdity of the existing wholesale sales tax system, which contains five - in some cases seven - rates of indirect taxation and is a source of constant concern to small businesses throughout Australia. Of course, in asking the question, the Leader of the Opposition has completely overlooked the introduction of the new pay-as-you-go taxation system which will be of enormous benefit to small businesses in Australia. It will dramatically simplify the payment of taxation. It will dramatically consolidate on to one form the various remittances that small business has to make.In looking at the overall impact of the taxation package on small business, Mr Speaker, you have to bear in mind that, in opposing this package, the Labor Party is opposing the removal of an enormous amount of red tape on small business, particularly in relation to taxation remittances.Of course, the Leader of the Opposition also overlooks the fact that a very large number of small businesses in Australia are not incorporated and are still sole traders or partnerships. He completely overlooks the fact that one of the other very pleasing elements of the government's taxation reform package is our commitment to abolish altogether provisional taxation. Provisional taxation has been the bane of the existence of farmers and of many small traders not only in country towns but also in the suburbs of Australia. Once again, in asking this question, the Labor Party demonstrates how completely and utterly out of touch it is with the needs and the aspirations of small business. As to the last part of the question - did I agree with what the Victorian Premier said? - no, I did not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Our concern in this issue from the very start has been the fact that, in our opinion, if you abolish junior wage rates, a lot of young people are going to lose their jobs. Through the inquiry process conducted by the commission, they have in an independent and impartial way attempted to weigh up the various competing claims as to the job impact of the removal of junior wage rates. The ACTU in the commission's inquiry attempted to downplay - to suggest that the job impacts were minimal, if not non-existent. When I say that that was the ACTU's position, you will  appreciate that basically that has been the Labor Party's position through this debate all along.The commission went to great pains to look at the evidence. They invited, for example, the ACTU to contradict the evidence, to rebut it and to put different evidence on this particular issue. This is the conclusion in the commission's report. On page 165, it says:. . . an effective removal and non-replacement of the existing discounts for age against adult wages will involve relative adjustments of a dimension that will result in significant dis-employing effects for the class of employees now in receipt of junior rates, or . . . to be in receipt of the substituted pay rates . . . It could not be clearer. There will be a lot of job losses if we abolish junior wage rates. You mention the retail industry. There are a lot of young people employed in the retail industry. They put evidence to the commission which was not rebutted that something like 160,000 or 170,000 young people's jobs would be lost if we abolished junior wage rates.We have had an independent process to test it. The support which the commission provides now is for this simple proposition: it will cost a lot of jobs. We have also been making the point that if you had junior rates in some industries where they are not now available, then that would further provide opportunities that are currently not available. In other words, this is about not just protecting jobs but creating jobs. The commission examined this issue very carefully and said this in the summary of the document:Well designed junior rate classifications, framed to reduce capacity to exploit the use of them, may justifiably be used for creating or protecting employment opportunities for young employees.So here we have the umpire saying that it is not just about protecting jobs, it is also about creating jobs. The Labor Party lined themselves up with the shoppies, who were proposing a cut-off age of 18. Of course, the proposition with the shoppies proposal was there would be no job losses for people between the ages of 18 and 21. The commission did a thorough job on that proposition as well. This is what it said on page 170:Consequently for most 18 year olds and above, the application of full adult rates would cause an overvaluation of the work performed and be expected to reduce the employment prospects of the 18 to 20 years old age group.This report is absolutely clear and unequivocal: if you abolish junior rates, a lot of young people going to lose their jobs; if you have junior rates, you will be able to create jobs. The proposition which has been supported publicly by the Leader of the Opposition will mean the loss of jobs for people in that age bracket. This is the clearest, most unequivocal statement you could get from an umpire. It is further unbiased and impartial evidence supporting the simple proposition that the Labor Party should abandon its political posturing and its alignment with the ACTU on this issue and it should line up with the government and, more importantly, with young people and their prospects of having a job in the future.</DOC>

I occasionally have the pleasure of visiting the National Party party room at their invitation on social occasions, but I have thus far not been to any of their regular party meetings. But they, of course, attend ours. I have no idea what is said, but I can assure you that the resolution of the government to stamp out tax avoidance is evidenced in the proposals in ANTS and is also evidenced by other proposals that we have put through the parliament, which you opposed. But that resolution remains undiminished.</DOC>

 - This is one of the important issues which goes to the future of Australia's trade policy. I am pleased to update the House with a very interesting development in the House Agriculture Committee of the United  States Congress this week when Congressman Dooley - Democrat, California - made an intervention which I think both sides of the House will be interested in. In hearings, Dooley made a statement which was in strong support of the proposal that had been made by Australia and New Zealand which avoided the need for trade barriers. He said that it was wrong for the United States to be challenging `our friends and allies, Australia and New Zealand' on the lamb issue. This man is a Democrat congressman from California. This represents further steps forward. - I am sorry that you mock this matter. I see the member for Dickson smiling. It really is a shame that they are light-hearted about this serious issue. I think I prefer the DPCK, the Democrats post-Cheryl Kernot. The ALPWCK - the ALP with Cheryl Kernot - is going nowhere. - I want to come back -  - I want to just remind the House that I thought you were in bipartisan support of the stand we have made on behalf of the US lamb industry. - This is an important issue. I further advise the House that yesterday I made further contact with Cheryl - Charlene Barchevsky, the US trade representative. -  - It's a long time since any of you went out to a lamb industry rally. Further, today I meet with Richard Fischer, Ambassador, deputy US trade representative - if you do not know. I did so here, in the annex to the cabinet room, to make the points that count on behalf of the Australian lamb industry. -  - Can you treat this as a serious issue? - We are pushing ahead in a range of directions. The meeting with the US Ambassador, Richard Fischer, visiting Australia at this time was a very constructive meeting; it was one, however, in which he advised that there is still no final decision in relation to the matter which is now before the President for decision - and we are now beyond the deadline of 60 days, which relates to that particular decision.I emphasise to the House in absolute terms that the Australian government remains  opposed to any barriers being created to the Australian legitimate lamb exports and the New Zealand lamb exports to the United States of America. I emphasise to the House that that was a market won fairly, without subsidised production; it has been carved out by the dint of hard work by our lamb exporters who put many millions of dollars into finetuning their product so that they could win a share in that market.I emphasise further the point of Congressman Dooley that, in fact, what we are offering is the ability of the US producers to grow the market and create a win-win-win situation. In these closing deliberations by the US administration, I would strongly urge that they consider again the package which we have offered to help facilitate a win-win-win outcome. Once again Australia stands ready, as I said at Harden a fortnight ago, to take this matter to the WTO, if the need arises in the light of President Clinton's decision.</DOC>

 - That question really just shows how little about health the shadow minister understands. The first question is: what effect will it have on the agreement? It  is hard to say as it only happened last night, but my gut feeling is none. The second question is: what effect will it have on the budget if there is not an agreement? The answer is that the government will save money, it will not cost money, because the GP agreement is a net cost to the budget and, if the agreement does not go ahead, money will be returned to consolidated revenue. -  - So the shadow minister is 180 degrees wrong, as she usually is. I told her this yesterday in the Main Committee, and she was yapping on there like she is yapping on now. If you had listened, you might have learned something. -  - No, Mr Speaker. - The shadow minister asked about the pathology agreement and the agreement on pharmaceuticals. Again these were explained to her yesterday; clearly she was not listening as she is completely incorrect on both of them. The first is that the so-called savings in pathology are by an agreement with pathologists, not with general practitioners. So it is irrelevant whether there is an agreement with GPs or not. That is a very fundamental point that she clearly does not understand. And with pharmaceuticals, the savings there would probably not be achieved but lesser savings would. But the only reason they would not be achieved is if you did not have an agreement and then net savings would go back to the budget because you would not have to pay the GPs extra money.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. He has had a very real and long-lasting experience with the trucking industry in this country and understands that it provides the economic lifeblood or the veins and the arteries through which our economic lifeblood in rural and regional Australia flows. He is rather like the member for Eden-Monaro, who I note yesterday made the comment that Eden-Monaro, being an electorate that earns much of its income through rural industries - including wool, beef, fishing, dairy and forestry - will benefit enormously as a result of these reforms. The raw figures reflect that. There will be an estimated $1 billion slashing of road transport costs. Rail transport will be down by $160 million. All businesses will save at least 7c a litre on their diesel and petrol. We are looking at a $30 million a year upgrading program for the nation's bridges.As the member for New England would well know because of his familiarity with these issues, that will allow the more efficient loading of our trucks. There will be an estimated $840 million annual boost to gross domestic product as a result of that reform. That is worth having because economic growth equals jobs, and we need jobs in rural and regional areas. All diesel used for off-road purposes by primary producers will be excise free. Miners will get full credits for diesel fuel used off-road. Marine users, ferry users, charter boats, bush hospitals and nursing homes will all get the full benefits as well.The interesting point in all of this is that, to their credit, the Democrats were able to say to us during negotiations that they are not against growth. They are in favour of growth because that is where jobs come from. Unfor  tunately, that cannot be said for those opposite who have consistently fought against the things that this government has done to recharge the economy. Now we have the member for Dickson speaking here as usual and also speaking out in the broader arena against the cutting of transport costs by billions of dollars a year. - Do you know what she said yesterday in a press statement? I commend it to everyone in this place. It is a collectors item because, apart from anything else, it reflects not only the fact that the opposition is against a reduction in transport costs but also the fact that it does not understand that the transport task in a country like Australia grows not as a result of cheaper fuel but as a result of economic growth. That is why the transport task increases. This press statement says that what we have done is to give a multi-billion dollar boost to pollution. - Not a reduction in the cost of transport but a multi-billion dollar boost to pollution. It says that the scheme will deliver a multi-billion dollar pollution boost over the next three years. That is what it actually says. - Then she says it is the truth. The reality is that the Bureau of Transport Economics, the BTE, says that in totality our package reduces pollution. Despite the fact that we will have a doubling of the transport task over the next 20 years or so, by the year 2015 not only will we produce all of the economic benefits of the tax changes and fuel it along the way by slashing transport costs but also we will deliver cleaner air in our cities. It is not a pollution boost; it is a win all around. It needs to be simply stated again that here is a press release which clearly shows that the opposition is against these valuable reforms. It is a collectors item, and I commend it to everyone.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I am aware of claims being circulated by the Queensland Teachers Union as part of a vicious and divisive campaign in that state. This campaign is designed to mislead parents in Queensland about the Commonwealth's funding policies for government and non-government schools. I would assume that the disinformation will shortly be issued as a press release by the member for Dobell, so I felt it was desirable to inform members of this House about the facts of government and non-government school funding in the state of Queensland.Queensland government schools have done very well under the Howard government. Since 1996, government schools in Queensland have received nearly $65 million in additional funding from the Commonwealth government, a 24 per cent increase over the Labor Party's funding in that state. Today I want to correct a couple of selected highlights from this disinformation pack from the Queensland Teachers Union. Perhaps the most  extraordinary claim that is being put around by the union is that some non-government schools are already receiving the same amount per student from the government as government schools. This is utterly false. When all sources of public funding are taken into account, Commonwealth and state governments spend on average $5,600 on a government school student, whereas the same figure on average for non-government school students is $3,500. For schools serving wealthier communities, the figure can be as low as $1,500 per student. The Queensland Catholic Education Commission, I am pleased to say, has entered the debate to set the record straight in relation to Catholic parish schools in that state. It has pointed out that, according to official Queensland figures, government schools in that state are receiving some $6,600; whereas when you total all income from parents and governments, parish schools have total resources of only $6,000 per student, significantly lower than the resources that are going to government school students.Yet the Queensland Teachers Union is out there telling parents that non-government schools are receiving more than government schools in that state. It is a disgraceful campaign. As Alan Druery of the Queensland Catholic Education Commission says, `The Queensland Teachers Union's criticism was unfair and pitting Queenslander against Queenslander.' This is a divisive campaign. This government's policies are designed to open opportunities for all young Australians. The member for Makin handed me a letter yesterday from the principal of Prescott Primary School, which is in her electorate. The letter states:Your government is to be commended for its commitment to principle and for delivering outcomes that enhance the choice of working-class families. Specifically, we wish to acknowledge your commitment towards the delivery of greater fairness and equity in funding for non-government sector and for working-class families in particular.This government's funding policies for schools are all about equity. The Labor Party and its fellow travellers in the trade union movement, the Queensland Teachers Union, are all about division, distortion and negativ  ism, with nothing positive to say to advance educational equity in this country.</DOC>

 - It is my custom when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asks me questions of this kind to say that I will analyse the question, because often analysis goes very much to the heart of the veracity of the claims. - But even if you were to accept the claims made and the matters canvassed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, they hardly go to substantiate the allegations of misbehaviour which have been levelled against the parliamentary secretary. The question of whether there is a development application in relation to a particular piece of land is, as I understand the local government practices of Australia, a matter of public record. Therefore, it is something that ought to be easily capable of resolution. But, as I did with his earlier question, I will analyse what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has put to me. I have no intention of doing more than that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and her obvious interest in this important issue. I can confirm that 104 people were being gathered illegally in West Timor at Kupang for travel to Australia. We were advised by an Australian businessman of what was occurring, we engaged in discussions with the Indonesian government in relation to the matter and yesterday officers from the Australian embassy in Jakarta went to Kupang. There, with the assistance of local police, they interviewed the 104 people about their intentions. We were told they were intending to travel by Merpati Airlines to Darwin and that they had been provided with false references to obtain visas as part of the Northern Territory Expo to be held on 11, 12 and 13 July. They were expecting to receive visas. They had paid between $2,000 and $6,000 each to the organisers. Many had put up their life savings. They were told they would be guaranteed work in Australia for at least a year, earning between $15 and $20 an hour.Of course, they were properly informed by officers of my department that their efforts in relation to these matters were futile, that the actions of the organisers were unlawful and that they had been tricked and lied to by unscrupulous people-traffickers. It was obviously a very elaborate scheme, one which involved very significant financial rewards for those involved.It is important that we are able to deal with these matters effectively. What this demonstrates is that the placement of additional staff overseas in last year's budget has been very helpful in giving us effective intelligence information. Obviously there needs to be further efforts in relation to those matters. But if I can put it in the kindest way, it is also important that the urgency with which the issue of further enhancing the penalties for  those involved in people smuggling is before us. The activities of those who are involved are significant. The penalties at the moment, which have been in place for a long period of time, are certainly not sufficient to discourage people from these heinous acts. If we can get that legislation in place as quickly as possible I think it would be to the benefit of the nation.</DOC>

 - I have seen that story in the Sydney Morning Herald . Given the track record of that newspaper in relation to this particular matter, I am not disposed to believe it. - I say that very deliberately. It is a track record in relation to reporting of this matter stretching back to when it was first raised in the parliament when the frontpage lead story on this item -  - can refer to a legal opinion tabled by the Leader of the Opposition,  can have a whole front-page story reporting the debate over the application of section 44 of the Constitution, yet utterly fail to report the fact that the government received advice on the constitutional position from none other than the Acting Solicitor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia.This goes very directly to the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He asked me whether I had seen the Sydney Morning Herald report. I have seen it. He then asked me whether I accepted it and I am explaining why on first blush I do not. I have given him some good field evidence in relation to this very issue which would lead anybody prudent not to take much notice without further inquiry.I will go further, Mr Speaker. The question relates, as does the Sydney Morning Herald article, to the attitude of the head of the CSIRO, Mr Malcolm McIntosh. It happens that Mr Malcolm McIntosh wrote to the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. Can I say that Malcolm McIntosh is one of the most respected senior public servants in this country. Malcolm McIntosh has not only served with great distinction as the head of CSIRO but also sat on a number of government inquiries, including the Defence Efficiency Review. He has also served the government on the Supermarket to Asia Council and also the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council.Relevantly, he wrote to the minister on 23 June. I want to read carefully what his letter said, and it goes very directly to the question asked of me by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He said, inter alia:The letter was dealt with - and that is the letter that Mr Whitney wrote to Mr Entsch - in the normal way by sending it to the CSIRO for a draft response. At no time - I repeat, at no time - did Mr Entsch or his office contact us about the content of the reply. The draft letter from Mr Entsch to Mr Whitney was delivered to Mr Entsch's office on 31 March 1999. We also provided an executive summary of CSIRO's work to be sent to Mr Whitney with the letter which noted that CSIRO was writing up the research as a formal  report but that it had not yet been peer reviewed, part of our internal quality control. - I am going to read the next paragraph. It says:Following the delivery of the letter and summary Mr . . . Zagar contacted CSIRO about the timing of the report's publication. - It says:Neither Mr Zagar nor Mr Entsch made an attempt at any stage to influence the final report or its findings. Mr Zagar was, however, keen that the report be available for a meeting of the East Trinity Ratepayers' Association on about 21 March 1999 and asked if CSIRO could attempt to finish the final report by then and make it available to the meeting.What a shocking thing to do! What an outrageous abuse of office! I am ashamed that he should have done such a thing! To have used his public office to get something out of the bureaucracy to take to a meeting of his constituents - shame on you, Warren! You must never do that again! It is an absolutely shocking thing for you to do!So in answer to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, yes, I have seen the report in the Sydney Morning Herald. I prefer the words of Malcolm McIntosh contained in his letter to the minister than the interpretation placed on the behaviour of people by the Sydney Morning Herald in relation to this particular issue. I am encouraged to say that by the track record of bias of the Sydney Morning Herald in reporting this particular issue. I make no apology whatever for saying that. I believe that particular newspaper's reporting of this particular issue - at this stage I do not make this as a general observation but in relation to this particular issue - has lacked balance and has been totally biased.The worst example was its total failure to include in its lead story any reference to the advice of the Acting Solicitor-General. How on earth a newspaper of record can give a report on a matter as serious as a claimed  breach of the Constitution without reporting that the government of the day had received advice from the Acting Solicitor-General that there was no breach utterly and completely escapes me.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question -  - One of the central aspects of this whole debate about the existing system of junior wage rates is whether or not there was some feasible, practical alternative which was non-discriminatory. The whole thrust of the opposition's campaign against junior wage rates was to raise the prospect of, `Don't worry. When we get rid of junior wage rates, there will be a practical alternative.' It was part of the terms of reference, in fact a sort of primary question, for the Industrial Relations Commission to answer that basic question - namely, is there an alternative? The commission spent a lot of time looking at it, and I refer members to paragraph 2 of the report where the full bench said:The essence of our report is that none of the identified non-discriminatory alternatives most closely examined by us were feasible.That is an absolutely critical finding.One of the good things about this commission inquiry was that it did give everybody a chance to put up an alternative. This question of whether there is an alternative has been debated now for about 10 years. For years and years and years, no-one came up with an alternative, but the opposition have claimed that there really was one and all you needed to do was ask the commission what it was. The commission examined proposals from the CFMEU, from the shoppies union, from the ACTU and from other parties and came to the conclusion that the existing system was a clear, simple to administer system. The commission basically supported its continuation in all that it said, in particular in coming to that conclusion.The Labor Party have sought to use this commission inquiry and the process as a blind to not themselves have a policy on this issue, even though we know their basic proposition has been to get rid of the junior wage rates system that we have today - in fact, they themselves created the problem back in 1993. The incredible thing is that they created the problem, the parliament set up an inquiry to see what the solutions would be and they are now still opposed to the only solution to the problem - namely, the passage of the legisla  tion which the government has before the parliament. The Leader of the Opposition said -  - In September the shadow minister said, `We do support wage differentials based on competency.' I think most people would say, `That sounds like a reasonable thing,' so the commission had a close examination of that particular issue. Paragraph 7 of its summary said:Competency based classification of entry level juniors is difficult, a low priority and not even the best option.The unions all put up their alternatives, and none was found to be practical or feasible. The opposition supported the shoppies position; that got knocked out. The Leader of the Opposition put up his in principle competency based approach; that was looked at by the commission, and that was knocked out. -  - They examined that issue as well. Don't you understand? You supported the report; you supported the inquiry process. They have pulled the rug out from beneath your feet. You have been blown away by this process. - You have no policy position whatsoever, and you do not have the decency on behalf of young people to stand up and say, `Okay. We now will accept the report,  we will provide security for the jobs you have got, and we will let this legislation go through.' Oh, no: you are chuffed that young people will have their jobs thrown away on the ideology of the ACTU and the Labor Party. - I accept your point, Mr Speaker. Whilst the government has policies and we are getting on with implementing those policies, what do we have from the opposition? Nothing other than mudslinging, down in the gutter, attacking people over triviality. Whilst that is going on, we have the members for Batman, Barton and Dickson all being directors or shareholders of public companies without making the appropriate declarations to parliament. Your hypocrisy is incredible!The member for Batman is a shareholder in ACTU Building Pty Ltd. In over three years, he has never disclosed his role with this ACTU investment company. For nearly eight months after being elected in 1996, the member for Barton was a director and, in all probability, a shareholder of two companies linked to Turner Freeman Solicitors. He never declared it, and he has been a chief accuser. He has been attacking the member for Leichhardt. -  - There is a reference, Mr Speaker. That is, the government has a policy position on junior rates to protect young jobs, and all we have is hypocrisy from the other side, including from the member for Dickson who has also been in breach.The reality is that the report of the commission is now out. Your cover is gone. It is time we had a policy. It is about time for once in your life you stood up and had a policy. I say that the young people of this country deserve a statement of policy from the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - Of course the second part of the question is based on an entirely false presupposition, and I totally repudiate it. In relation to the first part of the question, the legislation provides that in relation to those items that attract GST they attract it at 10 per cent. As people would know in relation to administering the Income Tax Act, the commissioner from time to time issues guidelines on what will and what will not be acceptable in terms of claims and the like. He would have the same power in relation to the administration of the goods and services tax. It would be a matter for his consideration. If he wanted to issue such draft guidelines, there would be adequate power for him to do so.</DOC>

 - The House will be aware of the announcement I made with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in Sydney yesterday that we will commit an  additional $124 million of resources over a period of four years to step up in anticipation the fight against illegal immigration into this country. I make it clear that our record to date in stopping illegal immigration has been very effective indeed, and I place on record my appreciation of the work of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, who has handled a very difficult issue with great skill and very great care.As all Australians know, legal immigration to this country is part of our history and always welcomed. This government is second to none in its belief that immigration over the centuries has made a tremendous contribution to building the modern Australia. But illegal immigration, people smuggling, which now involves about four million people worldwide a year, poses a very significant threat to countries like Australia. We are an attractive place to come to, we have a big coastline, and there are aspects of our laws which convey the perception in some parts of the world that, if only you can get into Australia, you can tie up the legal system for years and stay here.That is a perception that would be removed overnight if the Labor Party were to drop its opposition in the Senate to certain legislation that the minister has been trying to get through. So, in addition to the measures I announced yesterday, can I again ask the Australian Labor Party, in the national interest, to stop saying no and to stop being negative and would they please withdraw their Senate opposition and allow the passage of the legislation that will do so much to remove the perception that exists in countries around the world that this country is a relatively easy mark, judicial review wise, providing you can get here in the first place?Importantly, yesterday's announcement provided for the stationing of 12 immigration officers in potential source countries, the acquisition of two additional Dash 8 aircraft and a night capable helicopter to be used in the Torres Strait area, the establishment of a National Surveillance Centre and better intelligence arrangements, and a new position of Director-General of Coastwatch to be filled by an officer of the Australian Defence Force  and that person to be directly answerable to the head of the Australian Customs Service.It is an appropriate response to a looming challenge. It occurs against the background of this government having had a great track record in dealing with the problem to date but, recognising that there is no room for complacency and further measures and further resources are needed, once again the government is getting on with the job of governing well for the future of Australia. I ask the Labor Party to drop its negativity towards the minister's legislation. Let the legislation go through so that we can send a loud and clear message to the rest of the world that this country is not an easy mark and that if you come here illegally you are going to be returned to the country you came from very quickly and without any undue delay.</DOC>

 - The presupposition of the question is entirely false again. -  - As was comprehensively displayed last week, the one thing you can always trust about the Labor Party is if they do not have an argument they will always try a smear - always. They will make a false allegation in the belief that by repeating it people will come to think it is true. The rules that are to apply to the GST prima facie are those rules that apply to the wholesale sales tax - rules put in place by the Australian  Labor Party; rules, if they were rules allowing tax avoidance, that would allow tax avoidance on CDs, that would allow the avoidance of tariffs on clothes -  - They would be allowing avoidance on clothes. If the Australian Labor Party believe they should not open every parcel, is it not the case under Australian Labor Party rules that you could order clothes over the Internet without a tariff? They are the rules of the Australian Labor Party, the great defenders of tariffs. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has spent three years telling Australia what it needed was tariffs and in the last eight months he has been saying that he is drying out - the born-again, redeemed alcoholic. - The import rules apply regardless of the nature of the item. They are the same rules. There is no import rule for books, another import rule for CDs and another import rule for jeans. The import rules apply to imports. As Kep Enderby famously once said in this House, most of our imports come from overseas. The rules in relation to imports apply to things from overseas, whether they be CDs, jeans or books, and they are subject to a de minimus rule. They are subject to a de minimus rule which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition recently described as sensible, as I saw in one radio interview. They are sensible for this  reason: if you do not want to have a de minimus rule, you can start opening every parcel that comes into the country to see if it is a CD or to see if it is jeans, because if it is jeans there should be a tariff paid. But for years and years and years under Labor Party rules you operated a de minimus rule.As for this argument that a six per cent rise in the price of books is suddenly going to drive people onto the Internet, the example I gave this House last week was the fine book by the member for Werriwa. A $25 book would go up $1.50, and the Australian Labor Party says that this is going to drive people onto the Internet - $1.50, or a six per cent increase. They are going to go onto the Internet and they are going to order in sea mail or airmail. I think most people would order airmail. How could you wait longer than four days to get the member for Werriwa's book? Under the Australian Labor Party rules, they will go airmail to avoid $1.50. I gave the example in the House that you can get the book, as I bought it, fair and square, for $24.95 in an Australian bookshop or you could go onto the Internet with priority airmail and can avoid $1.50 in GST and buy it for $93.70.Even if you could buy cheaper overseas, your argument is this: that a six per cent increase is going to drive people onto the Internet. Let me throw down a challenge to the great micro-economic reformers of the Australian Labor Party who are now apparently worried about the price of overseas books sold in Australia. The biggest item in keeping Australian book prices high for overseas publications are the rules which prevent parallel importing. We all know that. If the Australian Labor Party were interested in the price of overseas books in Australia, they would have a policy on parallel importing, would they not? But what was their position on CDs? To oppose the abolition in relation to parallel importing. Why? To keep CD prices up in Australia. - It was. That was the whole idea - to keep CD prices up in Australia because the argument was that it would then go to the Australian subsidiary of the  multinational company and they would pay off the artist. That was your argument. - We will take some interest in the Labor Party worrying about the price of books when we see the Labor Party take a position in relation to parallel importing. Until it does so, like all of its questions on tax, this is just sheer hypocrisy from a party which has no policy and can do nothing but nitpick and engage in negativity. As I said earlier, why would you have a party without a policy? Why would you bother running a party if it did not have a policy? It is nothing more than a jobs racket to keep these particular people employed.</DOC>

 - The good thing about the introduction of a goods and services tax with quarterly returns is that it gives the government the opportunity to dramatically simplify other taxation obligations for companies. The goods and services tax return will provide for a business its company tax instalment notification, its fringe benefits tax notification, its prescribed payments system and its reportable payments system. We have the obligation under this new system to collapse five separate taxation systems into one. It will also provide an alignment of  business tax payments and the introduction of an Australian business number, and with the introduction of the Australian business number and quarterly GST returns the opportunity to attack the black economy.Mr Speaker, the Australian Labor Party, which says it opposes a goods and services tax, nonetheless says it supports an Australian business number and a pay-as-you-go tax system. What it does not realise is that a pay-as-you-go tax system works off a GST return. The Australian Labor Party policy was to introduce a system derived from a GST return whilst opposing a GST return. So, in other words, you would require the equivalent of a GST return, without having a GST. That was the position that the Australian Labor Party took to the last election.	They said the same thing in relation to the Australian business number. The Australian business number is the registration for GST. The Australian Labor Party said, `We support the ABN. In other words, we will make them all register for GST, even though we won't have a GST system.'Mr Speaker, these were, of course, nonsensical propositions which were put by a party which had no policy. The only policy it had in the last election was to adopt ours or to tax pre-1985 capital assets. That was the other policy that it put forward, as John Della Bosca has now said, to tax pre-1985 assets, a complete miscalculation of the electorate. Aren't we glad that Labor weren't elected? The only thing they pledged to do they now admit themselves was wrong. They have no policy, no ideas and they oppose for the sake of it.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, there is some tax mix switch, yes. I am not denying that and I have never sought to deny it. But you have to compare it with the tax mix switch that occurred in 1993 when - despite your promise that you were against increases in indirect tax and despite your l-a-w promise which you broke - you increased indirect tax without compensation. Neil Warren has been quoted by both sides in this taxation debate, and, as he said, the scandal of 1993 was that you hit the pensioners without compensation.	 What you did in 1993, despite what you said in the election campaign when you ran a fear campaign against the Hewson-led opposition - despite all of those promises - you shamefully increased indirect tax without compensation to the great detriment of the poor in this country. In those circumstances you have no credibility getting up here asking me questions about tax mix switches.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question and for his interest in dry land salinity. It is a natural resource management problem that exists in his electorate of Hume. Obviously, we are taking very seriously the issue of dry land salinity as quite an insidious problem across Australia. It is not just a problem that affects agriculture or farmers; it is a problem that all Australians should be cognisant of. Of course, the extra $250 million going into the NHT out of the further privatisation of Telstra will allow us to enhance programs that will address dry land salinity across Australia. This is a problem which affects almost 2½ million hectares of intensively farmed land, and also it affects some 80 regional towns. This is not just an agricultural problem; it is a problem for all Australians that we need to address.Last Thursday at the national science briefing I launched phase 2 of the government's national dry land salinity program, a program pitched squarely at finding solutions to this enormous problem. We are allocating $15 million to that program, along with the states and the stakeholders. As part of that, I announced another $550,000 to further boost dry land salinity research and development.	The important issue to identify here is the fact that we have a policy in place to address this very serious issue as far as Australia's farmers are concerned. It is interesting to note that in the 1994-95 budget the allocation for natural resource management was around $90 million. In the 1999-2000 budget the allocation is around $186 million and the further investment of another $250 million taking the NHT funding to $1.5 billion - the largest environmental exercise  any government has undertaken - will give us a lot more capacity to address this issue.It should be noted that our land and environmental assets have carried Australia throughout its history. It has been the wealth generated from these assets that has been used to build the infrastructure of this nation and our government is committed to protect and preserve these assets. We have a policy in place to do this. We are further enhancing that now and we will be able to add a further $250 million to the NHT, something that the Labor Party could only dream about.</DOC>

 - Yes, I read Mr Cleary's story in the Financial Review  this morning, like most people, and the report, of course, was complete nonsense. - You used him as your election material on election day, you will recall. So you obviously found something in his stories. The Australian Taxation Office has said that that is complete nonsense. The notion that efficiencies to be achieved elsewhere in the ATO are to fund the GST is also completely wrong. The administration of the GST is funded from GST revenue. This is a critical point to bear in mind: all revenue from the GST goes to the states, and it is out of that revenue that the costs of collection are paid. All revenue goes to the states, and it is out of that revenue that the collection costs are paid. They are a separate item to be paid for out of the revenue raised. It does not come from anywhere else in the Australian Taxation Office; it comes out of the revenue  which the GST raises, and the states pay for the collection. - Yes, they do, as a cursory reading of ANTS would demonstrate. It has been the published policy now since the policy was issued. It may take a few times to get through, but I say it again: all of the revenue from GST goes to the states. That is why we say the states have a growth revenue. The states have 10 per cent of the goods and services, subject to GST-free areas, produced in Australia. That is why they have a growth revenue. They could never get a growth revenue under the Australian Labor Party. Under the Australian Labor Party, Labor kept wholesale sales tax and then gave money through financial assistance grants. Revenue from GST goes to the states. We are now in the situation where this government takes the responsibility for reforming federal-state relations, which gives the states a new growth tax without seeking or obtaining any of that revenue, and the collection costs come out of the moneys that are raised.To say that something comes out of any other area of the tax office is conceptually completely wrong. The states have agreed that the money for collection will come out of the revenues that they receive. As I recall, the Treasurer of Tasmania could not get his signature on the GST revenue fast enough. He could not wait to get his signature on it, along with Peter Beattie and Bob Carr. Do not think that it is the whole of the Labor Party that is troglodytic in its thinking on tax. There are some progressive elements in the Queensland government, the New South Wales government and the Tasmanian government. They could not wait to get their signatures on the revenues quick enough.As I recall, one of the things that they are insisting on doing is making sure that the collection costs are kept to a minimum. They were most insistent that they were going to scrutinise the situation to ensure that the tax office's collection fees were not inflated in any way. We agreed to that because we have said that, less the collection costs, the states should get the revenue. So conceptually it is quite an erroneous thing to say and, of course,  we are not surprised for that reason that it was raised by the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. There has been a very strong and unequivocal reaction from the Australian public on this issue. It really is time that we had a likewise black and white response from the Leader of the Opposition as to exactly what his policy is. He is slipping and sliding on an issue where the jobs of thousands of young people are at stake, and no point of order will save him. - That point of order comes from the Leader of the Opposition, who was chuffed earlier this year that he voted against the jobs of young people. This point of order comes from the Leader of the Opposition, who had his union mates out there in the press on the weekend attacking this decision by the Industrial Relations Commission. We know where his bread is buttered. The Leader of the Opposition has a lot of trouble standing up for young people's jobs. -  - In the Australian community, take for example the Australian Industry Group -  -  - His chance will come when the legislation is before the parliament. We will see how fair dinkum he is. The Australian Industry Group said:The finding handed down today by the AIRC in relation to the Junior Rates Inquiry represents a sensible decision reflecting the realities of the youth labour market in Australia.The retailers said:The report vindicates our concerns about the disastrous impact on young jobs if junior rates were to be abolished . . . Retailers, their young employees and potential young employees now need certainty about employment conditions and wages for juniors.That is what we demand of you. The Farmers Federation said:The report recognises that there is an indisputable relationship between any abolition of junior wage rates and reduced employment prospects for young people all over the country.That is something the Labor Party is reluctant to admit. The Business Council of Australia said:It provides a strong basis on which to support the government's youth employment bill.The Daily Telegraph  said `Start up wage still crucial'. It pinned the Leader of the Opposition in its editorial on the weekend by saying:The opposition is beholden to the trade union movement which believes all workers, no matter what age, experience or ability, should be paid the same.It went on to say:Labor should not deprive youngsters of these opportunities and assets through its pigheaded rejection of youth wages.That is the Daily Telegraph's  response to your vacuous speech last week. The West Australian  makes the same point again, as do even young people themselves. For example, there is a report on a young worker from McDonald's in Jolimont, Gemma Jones:She said she started on a wage of $5.80 an hour in 1996. Her wage had gone up with each birthday and she now earned $9.97 an hour.In the Courier-Mail  today in Brisbane, Dione Stewart, an 18-year-old, said:It is great that they are staying, because a lot of young people wouldn't get jobs.She went on to say:I've learnt basic skills that will take me into any job that I will do later on, like customer service, dealing with complaints, working with other people and sacrificing my time for work time.These are the voices of ordinary Australians. These are the voices of young Australians who demand that the Labor Party finally stand up for their jobs, stand up in the national interest and give them some certainty by passing our legislation. The Leader of the Opposition has cancelled his overseas trip. He has got nothing but points of order; he has no policy. - No, I'm going to finish him. - In conclusion, this is psychobabble wrapped up in a point of order that we have now had twice. The Leader of the Opposition was right when he told his party room that there would be a lot of negativity on industrial relations for the Labor Party. I tell you what: there will be a lot of negativity, and it will not just be coming from us. It will be coming from young people in this country who demand security in the jobs that they have got now.</DOC>

 - The member for Dickson appears to have read the explanatory memorandum and has a reasonable concept of the realities that we are putting before the Australian people - which are that, in essence, where diesel fuel is used for the purposes of regional and rural economies, it will indeed be exempt for vehicles that weigh over 4½ tonnes loaded. The real issue here is that, whilst the tax package in relation to diesel is not exactly as we originally designed it, the overwhelming benefits to rural and regional Australians flow and the overall benefits to the broader economy flow. The economic growth that is thus produced and accelerated -  - I make the observation that the minute we start to get to something -  - which relates to their position, it suddenly becomes a point of order on relevance for them to raise. Quite simply, the point in all of this is that, given that today is a broadcasting day and there are a lot of people in regional Australia who listen to this, what ought to be brought home yet again is that you are totally and absolutely opposed to the benefits of reducing transport costs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question. I note with pleasure that a group of young Work for the Dole participants on the Central Coast have been rewarded for their efforts in organising, promoting and conducting an Australia Day under 18s dance party by winning an award for the best youth event in New South Wales. I know that people in the electorate of Robertson support Work for the Dole because they have written letters to their marvellous local member saying things like, `I would have to recommend Work for the Dole to anyone who is in the unemployment rut.' Another quote is, `This is the best thing that has happened to me in a long time.'Last week I noted that the Leader of the Opposition dismissed the appeal of government programs to generation X, amongst whom support for the Labor Party has collapsed from 52 per cent to just 37 per cent. I am sure that in his travels around his backbenchers' offices, doing his beetroot in gumboots routine, the Leader of the Opposition will notice growing support for Work for the Dole. He will notice amongst Labor people who, in the words of Michael Thompson, support loyalty, saving, work, mutual obligations, patriotism and family - the sorts of Labor people who have been aban  doned by the Leader of the Opposition - growing support for Work for the Dole.Last week I had the honour of launching a paper by the Here for Life movement, entitled `Voices of young Australians', based on forums involving more than 5,000 young people, which called for `a diversification and expansion of Work for the Dole', and I am delighted to say that the government is doing both those things. A fortnight ago a survey of 3,000 young Western Australians showed more than an 80 per cent support for Work for the Dole. The department's own research shows that more than 80 per cent of participants believe that their involvement with Work for the Dole has boosted their self-esteem and their determination to find work. The New South Wales Chamber of Commerce and Industry ran a survey which showed that the single most popular measure in the Treasurer's widely acclaimed budget was the doubling of  Work for the Dole.So I would suggest that the Leader of the Opposition interrupt his travels around his backbenchers' offices to visit some Work for the Dole teams. I am sure that he would find, as I have, scarcely a single participant who is not glad to be doing something rather than nothing. It would certainly be a nice distraction from refereeing the fight between Gary Gray and John Della Bosca. If the Leader of the Opposition were to have any credibility at all, he would listen to the advice of those people on his own side who take policy seriously, he would put someone like the member for Werriwa immediately back on his front bench and he would reject the sort of stuff that is being said by John Della Bosca now.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dickson for her question. It is made quite plain in the explanatory memorandum. For vehicles of 4.5 tonnes gross vehicle mass and over but less than 20 tonnes GVM, a grant will be available for transport tasks including return journeys performed (a) between a point outside the metropolitan areas and another point outside the metropolitan areas; or (b) between a point outside the metropolitan areas and a point inside a metropolitan area; or (c) between different metropolitan areas - that is, interstate journeys. In terms of the administrative details, as has been made quite plain in this place, the details will follow further -  - There is nothing unusual about that. We have never denied it. There is nothing made up about this. We have been open and frank about it. It is the normal way it is done. But the member for Dickson wants those whose journeys are obviously specifically made to the benefit of rural and regional economic outcomes to have to record that portion of their trip before they leave an urban area, then the portion of the trip between there and their destination and then on the return trip to differentiate again. That would be the administrative nightmare. The bottom line in all of this is quite simple. The bottom line in all of this is that the ALP and the member for Dickson stand for fuel with a 43c a litre excise rate. That is the bottom line. The coalition, on the other hand, stands for fuel excise at 20c a litre. The ALP stands for higher transport costs - I hope they have told the AWU and the Transport Workers Union - and we stand for lower transport costs.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kennedy for his question and for his ongoing interest in greenhouse gas and also in delivering better policy as far as the transport industry in regional and rural Australia is concerned. The answer to the question is obviously yes, we have done an analysis. It has been done by Environment Australia and the Australian Greenhouse Office, drawing on work that has been done by ABARE and BTE. That analysis shows that the new revised package will deliver greenhouse gas savings of 5.5 megatons by the year 2010.That is completely contrary to the assumptions made by the Australia Institute, in which the greenhouse implications of the original tax package were overstated and the greenhouse savings measures of the renewable energy and transport initiatives in the revised package have been ignored. Such measures include: $100 million per year over four years to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, incentives for low sulphur diesel, new diesel/petrol vehicle standards, subsidies to accelerate conversion of suitable vehicles to compressed natural gas and LPG, and a grant program to encourage households to install photovoltaic cells. It is not surprising that that work done by the Australia Institute was commissioned by Greenpeace and the Australian Conservation Foundation - two groups not noted for their political balance. Most importantly, the new analysis that the government has had done confirms the positive environmental outcomes secured in the agreement between the government and the Australian Democrats in delivering air quality and greenhouse gas savings. The Environment Australia analysis shows that the revised tax package will deliver 5.5 megatons of greenhouse gas savings by 2010. We have had this new analysis audited by a respected energy economist, Dr David James, who found the savings will almost certainly be much greater than those that were set out in the analysis.In simple terms, the agreement secured with the Australian Democrats will ensure that there will be a net benefit in greenhouse savings and similarly air quality will be improved. The BTE estimates that the new package will deliver a 40 per cent reduction in particulate emissions from the transport sector by 2005. The Australian people will get a cleaner, greener environment as a result of this government's negotiations and agreement with the Australian Democrats, again to the exclusion of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

May I congratulate the member for Menzies on the lead that he has taken and the view that I know he shares with members on both sides of the House about the importance of the family as an institution in the Australian community. If the member had carefully studied the responses that I gave - not only the response to the document but also the one I delivered when I launched that formal response - she would be aware that I pointed out to those present and to the Australian community that the government's response to the evident need to support families in the Australian community is not limited to specific initiatives designed to provide specific incentives for such things as premarriage education and relationship counselling but also goes very directly to the economic environment in which families live. It is true that family breakdown costs the community very dearly, and I agree with the member for Chisholm on that subject. It not only costs the community very dearly in economic terms but also costs the community very dearly in psychological and emotional terms. Anything we can do as members of parliament to prevent that we should do. I would say to the member respectfully that the economic climate in which families live does influence their capacity to stay together. It is one of the factors. She will know from her own life experiences, as we all know, that if families are subjected to economic pressure there are difficulties. Those of us who have been involved in any way will be aware of that. If you have a strong economy, low interest rates, rising real wages and growing numbers of jobs, then you have more conducive circumstances for families to stay together. Governments that deliver strong and growing economies, low interest rates, lower taxes and rising job opportunities are governments that are supporting Australian families; governments that deliver the opposite are governments that are not supporting Australian families.You can produce all the specific responses in the world, you can provide all the vouchers for premarital education in the world and you can provide all the instruction in the world, but if you have a bad economic climate you are going to put enormous pressure on Australian families. That is why we regard the most pro-family of all the family policies this government has followed in the last 3¼ years as being the way in which we have brought unrivalled prosperity to the Australian economy.The member for Chisholm shakes her head, but - through you, Mr Speaker - is she seriously asserting that interest rates which are now $330 a month lower than they were in March 1996 have not taken pressure off Australian families? Is she seriously saying that the fact that we have 400,000 more jobs has not taken pressure off Australian families? We are going to deliver, against the opposition of the Australian Labor Party, to which she belongs, $12 billion of personal tax cuts to Australians on 1 July next year and, on top  of that, we are going to deliver $2½ billion of additional family benefits. -  - I thank the member for Chisholm for raising this issue, because it gives me an opportunity to talk about something that is central to what this government is about. This government is about delivering stability both socially and economically to the mainstream of Australian families; this government is about helping families; this government is about cutting their taxes; it is about cutting their interest rates; it is about providing jobs for Australian children; it is about providing choice for Australian parents -  -  - I warm to the task. In the last budget that was brought down by the Treasurer - in the words of the National Director of the Independent Christian Schools of Australia - this government has done more to provide choice to working-class families so far as education is concerned than any government in Australian history. I am proud that I lead a government that has a Treasurer that would deliver such a budget and that has an education minister who has that kind of vision. -  - I say to the member for Chisholm that I share her commitment to the cause of Australian families. It is a commitment that I believe ought to be shared across the political divide. I invite her attention to the wonderful economic conditions we have delivered that have done absolutely marvellous things for the environment in which Australian families now live and operate and raise their children for the future benefit of the Australian community.</DOC>

 - This is a very important issue and I do thank the member for his question. I know he shares with older Australians generally their desire to look forward to remaining in their own homes as long as is possible. Unfortunately, not only did the Labor Party run down residential care and withdraw $1.5 billion and leave us 10,000 residential places short but also they failed to pay attention to the need, requirement and desire of older Australians to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. This government has focused on both. We are making up the difference, making up those 10,000 lost places - which was the legacy of the Labor Party - and we have now increased by some 374 per cent the amount of spending that we are putting into community aged care packages which will allow older Australians to remain in their own homes. In this latest round, some 4,300 additional places have been advertised that we have made available. This means that older Australians can have the dignity of remaining in their own home with their own things around them by having someone to come and help them with the fundamentals like bathing and dressing in their own home, having a little home maintenance and having food brought into their own home.It means also that we have paid attention to the plight of carers. Carers are very important in enabling Australians to remain in their own homes, and so we have dramatically increased the amount of money that we are spending on respite care so that people can have that break and still allow people to remain in their own homes. We have increased spending on HACC - home and community care - which is shared with the state governments. We provide 60 per cent of the funds and the state governments provide 40 per cent. In other words, at every opportunity we have increased the amount of funding and the amount of help  that is given to older Australians in need of care to enable them to have it in their own home for as long as possible - because, quite frankly, that is where most people want to be.</DOC>

 - My last contact with the Premier of Western Australia on this issue was on Saturday. He assures me that he plans no changes to the Regional Forest Agreement. Secondly, when certain questions were raised and suggestions were made that there were legal questions to be settled on this issue, the reality is that the Premier has also said publicly that the state of Western Australia proposes no such change. The agreement that was signed with the Western Australian government just happens to be based exactly upon the National Forest Policy Statement. Mr Speaker, you might remember who created the National Forest Policy Statement. It was created in 1992 by a political party that goes under the misnomer of the Labor Party. - This policy has been applied implicitly in the Western Australian agreement. What is more, the associated JANIS criteria on reserve areas has the highest percentage compliance of any agreement signed to date. That is recognised amongst most Western Australian members of parliament with the exception of the party that actually signed off on the National Forest Policy Statement for Western Australia - the Labor Party. The person that signed it is known for her lack of memory. But some of the others might have been able to remember that it was the now member for Fremantle that signed that agreement for the people of Western Australia. That is the agreement that has been met and that is the agreement that is in place. -  - The question relates to regional forest agreements in Western Australia. I refer to the Western Australian parliament. I repeat `parliament', because although it was a Labor government the responsibility of then Liberal oppositions was to support this policy as the suitable response to a very, very difficult issue. The response was: give people high levels of reserve areas, which has been done, give people job opportunities and job protection, which has been done, and give the national economy a chance because it is very expensive to find forest products from other parts of the world. Of course, implicit in that is that you can buy as much timber product from the rest of the world as you like, provided your policy says you can cut down other people's trees. That is the other issue that this party of no policy and no relevance seems to be unable to address. - The federal government has signed an agreement in good faith. It is standing by it and, I am confident, so will the Western Australian government.</DOC>

 - It is interesting to note the member for Paterson's compulsion to get up and defend the New South Wales minister, a former member of this House, but I wasn't going to insinuate anything of the kind with regard to the New South Wales minister, who I think is the member for Clarence. Just in the process I would like to acknowledge the interest of the member for Page in this issue. This government put together the sugar industry package which allocated adjustment funding for both the New South Wales and Queensland sugar industries. The Queensland industry got on and got the work done. The funding flowed from the Commonwealth through to the industry and it achieved the desired outcomes that were agreed to between our government and those respective industries.It was not the case in New South Wales. Mr Speaker, you may ask yourself why. The reason is that around the time of the New South Wales elections the minister in New South Wales, who didn't want to give any conservative government any credibility as far as the agreement was concerned, held up the funding having legal interpretations and legal assessments of the process undertaken, which cost New South Wales taxpayers money and cost the New South Wales sugar industry time as far as the developments they wanted to fund with the million or so dollars that were on the way through. Unfortunately, we had to deal with this issue through the New South Wales government and through that particular department in New South Wales. The only people who were disadvantaged were the people that the Commonwealth, with Commonwealth dollars, set out to help. - On the weekend, we had the person in question, the member for Clarence, with his colleagues in Melbourne talking about Country Labor. The Labor Party could not give two hoots about people in country Australia. They could not give two hoots. - It has taken the New South Wales Labor government over six months to assist the process of getting Commonwealth dollars spent on the ground to help the people it is supposed to help - and all for political means around their election in March of this year. And that is what the member for Paterson is trying to defend.</DOC>

 - The government has given terms of reference to Mr Ralph, and one of those terms of reference was that business changes should be revenue neutral. Mr Ralph will be reporting in July, and the government will look at and assess his report. As far as the government is concerned, this is the last leg of tax reform in Australia. The reform of the indirect tax system, I hope, will be accomplished this afternoon. The reform of the personal income tax system, I hope, will be accomplished this afternoon. The reform of family assistance, I hope, will be accomplished this afternoon. The reform of Commonwealth-state relations, I hope, will be accomplished this afternoon. The final leg will be the reform of business taxation.</DOC>

 - It is appropriate that the honourable member for Hughes, who is one of those many members on the government's side who are very much in touch with the needs of middle Australia, should ask me a question about tax reform that goes directly -  - It is appropriate that a member such as the member for Hughes should ask me this question, because I am immensely proud, as all members of the government are, of what we believe will be the verdict of this chamber this afternoon. We made it very clear almost two years ago that we were determined to deliver taxation reform to the Australian community. We are on the verge of seeing that commitment delivered, and it will be a truly historic day for the economic welfare of Australia when that verdict is delivered because it will bring to an end a process that has now gone on for almost a quarter of a century.I have with me a copy of the report of the Asprey committee, entitled Taxation Review Committee: full report, that was delivered to the Whitlam government on 31 January 1975, fulfilling a remit given to it by the former coalition government and by the late Billy Snedden, who was Treasurer in the McMahon  government in March 1972. In the concluding portion of the introduction to the Asprey report, the committee had this to say:Accordingly, this Committee expresses the hope that, out of the discussions which appear and the recommendations which are contained in this report and from the disputation which will inevitably follow upon its publication, a fairer, simpler and more efficient taxation system will eventually emerge than the one which presently produces the revenue for the Australian Government.I am delighted to say to the House that the policies that the government is implementing in the area of taxation reform will, almost 25 years after that expression of hope was delivered by the Asprey committee, be delivered to the Australian people.It is fair to remember that, when I announced the explicit commitment of the government to taxation reform in August 1997, I said that the government's process would be guided by five principles. The first of those principles was that there should be no increase in the overall taxation burden. Far from there being an increase in the burden, in fact, taxation is going down under the government's plans. We are going to cut personal tax by $12 billion a year. We are going to provide another $2.5 billion worth of family benefits, particularly to middle Australian families. So a big tick to the first point. The second point is that any new taxation system should involve major reductions in personal income tax with special regard for the treatment of families. That also has been delivered in full. - Mr Speaker, I am not endeavouring to canvass legislative details; I am talking in the broad about the pathway ahead for the Australian taxation system. The third lane in the highway was that consideration should be given to a broad based indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes. Once again, the government gets 10 out of 10 for what it has done. Once again, we have delivered in full on that commitment.The fourth lane was that there should be appropriate compensation for those deserving of special consideration, and I think it is very, very important to emphasise that the compensation provided in the government's plan is very generous by any measure. It is in stark contrast to the lack of compensation provided by the Keating government after the 1993 election when it dramatically increased every indirect tax it could lay its hands on, hurt the poor in the process and gave not one dollar of compensation to the poor and low income earners of Australia. Finally, we committed ourselves to a reform of Commonwealth-state financial relations.So, in every particular, we have delivered in full on the commitments that we have made. We have given a new basis for Commonwealth-state financial relations, and that is why the premiers, despite what they periodically say, all lined up to sign it. And none was more enthusiastic than Bob Carr - he almost bumped Peter Beattie out of the way. He drew himself up to his full height and, in that serious historical tone, he said, `You know, Prime Minister, it is not the policy of my party to support this - but, please, where do I sign, Prime Minister?' And  no wonder, because this is a marvellous deal for the states.The states, under this plan, for the first time in 50 years, will have a financial base for providing the additional government schools, the additional police services, the additional hospital services and all the other social services that it is the constitutional duty of the states of Australia to provide. They have been begging and arguing and pleading and cajoling and requesting and demanding a growth tax for as long as I have been in politics, and I believe they have been doing that since World War II days - and at long last the government has delivered on it. I know that deep down the states cannot wait to get their hands on the GST revenue because it will give them a fiscal base the like of which they never dreamt they could ever have.So I say in response to the member for Hughes: this is a great day most importantly for Australia's economic future; this is a very important day for middle Australia - we are giving them lower personal taxation. We are providing a proper fiscal basis for the states of Australia; we are providing reductions in costs for our business community; we are providing reductions in costs for our exporters. As I look across and see the vast array of representatives of both the Liberal and National parties who represent rural Australia and regional Australia, I know that we are delivering something that - in addition to lower interest rates, which we have also delivered - the people of the bush really want, and that is lower fuel costs.It will ever be to the shame of Labor that it voted to keep fuel costs to the Australian bush higher than those fuel costs ought to be. But Labor is against lower fuel costs for the Australian bush, and that is a message that will be taken by every coalition member all around rural Australia - and you will not be allowed to forget the infamy of voting against measures that are designed to cut the costs of fuel for Australian farmers.</DOC>

 - I find it passing strange that I am now being asked questions about future budgets. This last budget which was brought down in May, to my knowledge, has not even been enacted, the appropriations have not even been enacted in the Senate - and they are already onto future budgets. I love the way in which the Labor Party asks me about what is going to happen to surpluses in future budgets. What a luxury question that is. - My point is this: would a government which had fought so hard to get a budget into surplus be in the business of giving that away? We were opposed every single step of the way. I thought I heard - I will have to go back and read the Hansard  - the Leader of the Opposition just say that I had missed my targets on budgets. I think that is what he said. But when he was the finance minister of this country, he said that the budget was in surplus when it was ten thousand millions of dollars in deficit. - This is the government that took a budget which was ten thousand millions of dollars in deficit, after the finance minister had run around in an election campaign claiming it was in surplus - probably the most dishonest claim ever made in this country. - This is a government which took a budget that was ten thousand millions of dollars in deficit and put it into surplus. When I brought down this government's budget in May of this year it was the third surplus in a row and it was fought every step of the way by Labor. Having put this budget into surplus, we are going to keep it there. - When this government came to office the budget was ten thousand millions of dollars in deficit, and this government put it into surplus. The last budget that we brought down on this side of the House was the third surplus in a row. The only threat that ever came to delivering surplus budgets in this country came from the Australian Labor Party which opposed every single measure required to put the budget into surplus.When this government engaged in tax reform and when this government engages in future tax reform, I can tell the House entirely this: this government is going to reform the taxation system and keep its fiscal strategy on track. We would not have brought the budget back into surplus, we would not have fought the Australian Labor Party every inch of the way to give away the advantages which we have secured for the Australian people.Mr Ralph has been given terms of reference and he will abide by those terms of reference, as I said in my opening answer, and what is more the government will abide by its fiscal strategy. There is no threat to the government's fiscal strategy from John Ralph. The threat to the fiscal strategy lies where it always lay - with the Australian Labor Party, with the $23 billion man, the man who did two budgets for an accumulated deficit of $23,000 million.</DOC>

 - Today is a historic day for Australia. Today we stand on the edge of giving Australia a new taxation system: a new taxation system for indirect tax; a new taxation system for income tax; a new taxation  system for Commonwealth-state relations; and a new taxation system for family allowances. As the Prime Minister said, this brings to an end a chapter of 25 years - 25 years of trying for a new taxation system in this country - and we stand today on the eve of establishing a new taxation system for Australia.All of those Australians that care about Australia seizing its opportunities for the next century are going to say that this was a parliament that finally was able to deliver fairness to the Australian people and families. It was able to deliver an economic future for them. Today we can say in relation to tax reform that negativity and backward looking thinking have been defeated. The negativity of the no-policy opposition has been defeated. As the Prime Minister said, the Asprey inquiry in 1975 recommended a new tax system. In the Fraser government it was the current Prime Minister, then as Treasurer, who took up the leadership on the tax issue. -  - I would not want to seem partisan in this because in the 1980s it was Labor that took up the cudgels for tax reform. As Prime Minister Hawke said in November 1984, `Unless there is a source of income in the consumption area, then the mass of Australians, the ordinary taxpayers, are not going to be able to get the substantial cuts in personal direct taxes to which they are entitled.' He was right. The Labor Party in the 1980s was led, and it stood for tax reform.Then when Labor lacked leadership and began opposing tax reform for the meanest, cheapest, opportunistic, populist reasons, it was the coalition again that took up the cudgels for tax reform. We were glad to do it. We were glad to stand up in the national interest and support tax reform. It was done as a result of great leadership that was shown by the Prime Minister again after his election in 1996, with the support of the Liberal and National parties, with the goodwill of the Australian public, with the support of the business community and with the good wishes of all of those that believed Australia de  served better. In 1985 Mr Keating, the then Labor Treasurer, said this:If we don't as a nation adopt this proposal - that was Labor's consumption tax proposal - then you won't see significant reform in this country in taxation for the balance of this century.Mr Keating was proved wrong by a year. In 1999, this was the parliament that took leadership and this was the parliament that delivered it. Having opposed the government every step of the way in relation to tax reform, having taken the cheap, mean, populist, opportunistic road, what do you think the Labor Party would then say once the tax reform was introduced? The latest pearl of wisdom we had from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on the 7.30 Report  was, `Well, if it is introduced, what will we do about it? We'll keep it.' He said this:The system is in place. We will have to deal with that. We recognise, as we have said consistently, it is almost impossible to unscramble the egg. -  - Is that what he said - `almost impossible to unscramble the egg'? In other words, he was saying, `This system which we hate so much - if we ever got elected, we'll just have to take the benefit of it. That growth tax for the states which we oppose so strongly - we'll just have to let it stay.' And on the cheapest of reasons. That was not true. He knows it. He could very easily run to the next election with a promise to reintroduce wholesale sales tax. It can be totally unscrambled, every `enact' word changed to `repeal' and every `repeal' word changed to `enact'. Labor could go, as a modern political party, into the next federal election saying, `Bring back wholesale sales tax. What we need in this country is a narrow indirect tax base, with higher income tax rates and five rates.'He would find that that proposition has been totally endorsed by one of the thinkers of the Labor backbench. Yes, Mr Speaker, should I say - singular - the thinker of the Labor backbench? The member for Werriwa said on 9 December 1998 - remember this was the pearl of wisdom last night, `You can't unscramble the egg. Poor old Labor will have to take advantage of all of the  coalition's hard work'; poor old Labor - in this parliament:It is not as if, as some have said, the GST is like some scrambled egg which can never be unscrambled. It is in fact just another tax, which this government is trying to place on the statute books. Just as the GST can be legislated in, it can be legislated out.In a debate on tax policy, who would you put your money on? The thinker of the frontbench or the thinker of the backbench? Who do you think actually has a policy and a thought on these particular issues? It is not as if they are devastatingly interesting policy or thoughts, but if you have a thought you are different in the Labor Party. He is engaged in this experiment as to whether it is possible to be a thinker and a member of the Labor Party. If you do that, you realise that what the member for Hotham is saying is absolute nonsense. The member for Hotham is trying to get off the end of a long skewer. If he were being consistent, he would run to the next election with a proposal to reintroduce his wholesale sales tax, with all the modernity of the tax system of Botswana and Swaziland and the modern thinking of the frontbench of the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I am sorry to have to say I just cannot believe the ineptitude, the narrowness, the stupidity, of a question of that nature - this from the people who do not want to reduce transport costs, this from the people who do not want to remove $4½ billion of taxes on our exports. -  - This from the people who want to leave wholesale sales tax on every item. - I return to the point. There would not be a trucking company, there would not be anybody involved in transport in Australia today, who does not say our package is an infinite improvement on anything that they have offered. For their record in this area we go back to 1993, and against all the promises they made during the election campaign they have increased taxes on transport. This is unbelievable. - The fact of the matter is that whether you are buying a truck or any other piece of capital equipment relating to transport, whether you are maintaining it, whether you are running it, it is going to be cheaper. I have not met anybody who either is involved in transport or uses transport who does not overwhelmingly prefer our approach.In relation to the narrow issue of what will happen to the second-hand value of trucks below 20 tonnes when they are loaded, all I can say is the new trucks will be cheaper - everyone in transport and who depends on transport will welcome that - and the marketplace is the appropriate instrument to work out the value of second-hand trucks in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fairfax for his question. Today is, as we all know, a historic day because today we are on the eve of getting rid of Labor's wholesale sales tax - a tax on knowledge. The member for Fairfax has put his finger on what is one of the great weaknesses of the taxation system supported by the Labor Party, because the wholesale sales tax, unlike the goods and services tax, is a cascading tax. It flows through, adding cost to item after item. When the Treasury calculated the impact of the wholesale sales tax on the cost of delivering education, it found that it added, over a four-year period, almost $1 billion to the cost of providing education in this country.Labor's wholesale sales tax is a massive tax on knowledge which this government is now going to get rid of. That means education is going to be cheaper to provide. It means that state governments, private school providers, non-government school providers and parish schools will be able to provide education more cheaply to their communities than they can at the present time. There will be a saving of something like $1 billion - $960 million over four years.But the families of this country who believe in education and young people who believe in education should take further comfort from the historic reform which the Prime Minister has brought through this parliament and which will see success today. This tax will provide a growth tax to the states that will ensure that there is a continuing growth in revenue needed to support the government school system in this country. This tax package will provide a massive income tax reduction to Australian families - the biggest income tax reduction in Australian history. The average family in this country will be some $40 to $50 per week better off as a result of this package. This means that education will be more affordable than ever before.This is a wonderful tax package for education, and this has been recognised by responsible people outside the government parties in this parliament. As Senator Lyn Allison of the Australian Democrats has said, `Education is a winner from the fairer GST.' It is only the babblers on the other side of the House, the lap-dogs of the Australian Education Union, who are prepared to put up the argument that somehow or other this tax package is not fair for education. Constant negativism and opposition, nothing positive, is what is destroying the reputation of the opposition amongst families and amongst young people. I do not think anyone summed it up better than 19-year-old Katie Hall, who was quoted in yesterday's Australian when she said about the opposition leader:What's he done recently except bag the government?That is what young Australians think. Young Australians want an Australia that is moving ahead, young Australians want something  positive, young Australians want leadership - and that is why this generation of young Australians is backing the government, backing its tax reform and backing better education in this country.</DOC>

 - This issue was canvassed yesterday and answered. We are negotiating and talking through the compliance arrangements with the Democrats. We have had discussions with the Australian Taxation Office, and we will involve others. It might even be possible this time -  - No! - No, probably not. They have made themselves utterly irrelevant. We know that they do not want the abolition of WST on transport. We know that they want trucking costs to stay up. Isn't it amazing that the minute we start to talk about their policy they see it as irrelevant? - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. The good news is that from 1 July of next year all Australians will receive an income tax cut. This will be done by increasing the tax-free threshold by some 11 per cent, from $5,400 to $6,000. It will be done by dropping the 20c tax rate to 17c. It will be done by dropping the 34c and 43c rates to 30c and by pushing out thresholds. It is government policy that 80 per cent of Australian taxpayers will have no higher marginal tax rate than 30 cents in the dollar. That is a great break for Australian families.For example, a one income family with one child under five years of age on a salary of $29,000 from 1 July of next year will have their tax cut by $800 and their family assistance will be increased to around $5,355. A single income family with one child under five as a result of tax cuts and family assistance benefits from 1 July next year will take home an extra $58 a week in increases in tax cuts and family assistance. That will be a result of reforming the tax system. To quote the words of Bob Hawke:Unless there is a source of income in the consumption area, then the mass of Australians - the ordinary taxpayers - are not going to be able to get the substantial cuts in personal direct taxes to which they are entitled.Mr Hawke was right. As a result of tax reform, families will do much better. Also, the abolition of Labor's hated wholesale sales tax will make many items cheaper; 21 days after royal assent is given to the abolition of Labor's hated wholesale sales tax the 32 per cent rate is going to come down to 22 per cent. So 21 days after royal assent to the legislation prices should start falling on tape recorders, radios, televisions, watches, clocks, cameras, binoculars and a whole host of items which Labor has been secretly taxing at 32 per cent for decades. Once we get around to abolishing Labor's wholesale sales tax on 1 July 2000 all of those taxes are abolished, but in the interim as a transitional measure the 32 per cent rate will come down to 22 per cent. That will start in advance of 1 July 2000, with those prices starting to fall.The great thing about reforming the tax system is that you can abolish the hated  wholesale sales tax. We have a program to abolish stamp duties on shares, a program to abolish the financial institutions duty. All of those taxes can go. Income taxes can be reduced. Family assistance can be increased. That is what makes this a historic day for the reform of the Australian taxation system, a great day for the families of Australia, for whom tax reform is going to mean so much.</DOC>

 - Let me begin to respond to that question by just saying three things that we know very clearly about the ALP's policy in this regard. - Let me then put it to the House in these terms. I wish to make three points regarding how our policy proposals vary from theirs. The first is that we propose a billion dollar slashing of Australia's transport costs, including hundreds of millions of dollars reduction in fuel excise. They propose not to allow the Australian economy to benefit from any of these measures. The second -  - The second point I wish to raise is that we support tax reform and they do not. The relevance of this to this debate is that in 1993, because they would not support tax reform, they had to increase wholesale sales tax and fuel excise. Their record is one of increasing fuel excise. - The third point is that there is absolutely nothing unusual - in fact, it is normal practice for a government to set out clearly in an act its intentions, when it comes to the administration -  - You say I do not know the answer. It is quite apparent that it is normal practice for you to work through the compliance and administrative arrangements subsequently. We have been quite open about that. -  - No. You want to remain irrelevant to the whole process. That is fine; but it ought to be remembered very clearly - and this is part of the third point - that the fact is that there are 110,000 primary producers in Australia at the moment and every time they make a diesel fuel claim, they have to distinguish between on-road and -  - I can conclude by simply stating that the reality is that these arrangements already exist. - I have been absolutely open and frank with the House. Our intention is to deliver huge savings in the cost of transport. Let no-one miss the essential point in all of this, which is that the Labor Party is opposed to the cutting of transport costs. That is the bottom line. That is all there is to be said to those people who are looking for cheaper fuel in Australia.</DOC>

 - I agree with an interjection from the Labor Party. Someone said, `Good question,' and I think it is a good question. It demonstrates the ongoing interest of the member for Moore in the environment of Australia. I am pleased to be able to take a few moments of the House's time to outline for the benefit of honourable members and the Australian public the major initiatives that this government has undertaken over the last three years to improve the Australian environment.We regard the environment as a serious mainstream political and social issue in this country. I am especially proud of the fact that we established, through the Natural Heritage Trust which is worth $1.5 billion, the biggest  single package in Australian history for dealing with fundamental environmental problems. That is not a bad opening for the answer to the honourable member for Moore - a $1.5 billion Natural Heritage Trust. And guess who voted against it? The Australian Labor Party.Out of that, we are dealing with such antisocial activities as tackling river degradation and pollution of coasts and oceans. Mr Speaker, you would think everybody would put their hand up to spend money to fix up the rivers, the oceans and the coastline of Australia, but no, the Australian Labor Party said, `No, we can't agree to that because it's being proposed by the Liberal and National parties.'I will give the Leader of the Opposition one piece of advice. If he wants a bit of guidance on political tactics, he ought to listen to the most successful Labor leader in Australia at the present time, and that is Bob Carr. He ought to listen to what Bob Carr has said about automatic negativity. He ought to remember that one of the things Bob Carr said about political oppositions and political parties is that the public is getting sick and tired of political leaders who automatically say no to a proposition just because it is being advanced by their opponent. That is exactly the approach that has been adopted by the Australian Labor Party under the current leadership in relation to so many of the government's policies.Through the Natural Heritage Trust, we tackled not only river degradation and pollution of coasts and oceans but also land degradation and damage to the Australian bush. We have created over 600,000 hectares of new reserves under the regional forest agreements. The Labor Party even said no to the regional forest agreements. The whole idea of regional forest agreements was originally put forward by the Labor Party in government. What are they now doing? They are voting against their own policy. That is what the Labor Party are doing. They proposed this when they were in government and now, in opposition, they are voting against it.We have also put in place a comprehensive oceans policy to balance the legitimate con  cerns of conservation and the environment. We have created the world's second largest marine park, the Great Australian Bight Marine Park. We have reformed environmental laws to give more consistency and clarity. - What happens when we reform environmental laws? We witness in the Senate not cooperation and support from the Australian Labor Party but a torrent of abuse directed at the Leader of the Australian Democrats by Senator Faulkner, the leader of the Labor Party in the Senate. We have put in place the most far-reaching and comprehensive assault on urban air pollution and greenhouse gases of any Australian government. We have new world-class standards of vehicle emissions supported by a billion dollar package of government programs.In answering this question, I would like to record my great respect and gratitude for the great work that has been done by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage in my government, Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Senator Hill, the hero of Kyoto, the man who negotiated an outcome, the man who -  -  - Here we go again. Here we get a splendid example. Kyoto was all about preserving jobs in regional Australia. The Labor Party wanted us to sell out the coalminers of the Hunter Valley and the Bowen Basin. They wanted us to sell out the iron ore workers of Western Australia. Senator Hill did a great job for Australia. He did a great job for Australian jobs. He achieved an outcome that was good for the environment and also good for Australian industry. I am also very pleased to note that, within the environment movement, there are those who have the Labor Party disease - they say no automatically to anything proposed by the government - but there are other organisations like the Worldwide Fund for Nature, the Humane Society International and many of the state conservation councils which are  adopting a far more sensible and moderate position.In summary, this government has outstanding environmental credentials. It has an outstanding environmental minister. It has achieved the right balance between caring for the environment, promoting job growth and protecting Australian industry. It can be done. You do not have to sell out the special interest groups to do it. Under Senator Hill's leadership in this area, we are delivering first-class environmental outcomes for all Australians.</DOC>

 - I am quite happy to answer a question on tax because I bear responsibility for tax matters. As everybody in this place knows, it was the Australian Labor Party which put wholesale sales tax on wine at 26 per cent. It was done after the 1993 election. The Australian Labor Party went to that election promising income tax cuts - sorry, not promising income tax cuts. Income tax cuts were l-a-w. It abolished them and introduced a wine tax instead. - The WST on wine had been taken to 26 per cent. If my memory does not fail me, I think that increase in wholesale sales tax on wine was voted for by the then member for Hunter. When Labor's wholesale sales tax was to be abolished and replaced with the GST, as the government said in its election policy, it was necessary to equalise the price back and it was equalised back with a wine equalisation tax. In relation to the wine equalisation tax, although during the election policy it was posited at something like 32 per cent, the bill actually imposed it at 29 per cent. If I am not wrong, in the Senate yesterday when the Greens voted to change that to a volumetric tax, the Australian Labor Party voted against the Greens. The vote was two to 62, with the Australian Labor Party supporting the government both on the wine equalisation tax and the rate. No amendment was moved by the Australian Labor Party in relation to the rate. Oh, Mr Speaker! Oh, what a tangled web we weave.In relation to cellar door sales, the government has said and always said that it believes that cellar door sales should be rebated, and they should be rebated as they always have by state governments. Why was it state governments that were running rebate schemes? It was state governments that were running rebate schemes because, in addition to Labor's 26 per cent wholesale sales tax on wine, the state governments had business franchise fees. The business franchise fees by and large exempted cellar door sales. But when those fees were struck down by the  High Court at the request of the states, the Commonwealth said it would apply a uniform tax, as it was required to do under the Constitution, in return for the states running rebate schemes. When the wholesale sales tax is abolished and replaced by a wine equalisation tax, the states should continue to run those cellar door schemes.That is the agreement that we have reached with the Australian Democrats. The South Australian government has already indicated to me that it will be keeping a rebate scheme in relation to wine equalisation tax. Again, if the Labor Party want to make a positive contribution, what they should be doing is joining the government, supporting the government, going to the states, including people like the Treasurer of Tasmania, and saying to them, `Keep those cellar door schemes going.' That would be a positive contribution. That is what oppositions used to do. There are some members in this place who think that oppositions have always been negative, populist, opportunistic and nitpicking. That was not the case. This is a new rule led by a party with no policy. Get on board, support the government and together we can fix this problem.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question. As chairman of the backbench committee, he has been very concerned to secure the passage of the government's legislation to protect the jobs of young people not just in his own electorate but Australia wide. Clearly, the report from the commission goes not just to the question of protecting the jobs of existing young people - important as that is, given the fact that there are something like 160,000 or 170,000 jobs of young people at stake if we are unable to secure the passage of the legislation which the government is proposing - but also, importantly, to the possibilities of  creating further jobs for the benefit of young people. For example, my department in advice to me - and I think it was part of our submission - made the point that in the building and construction industry there could be another 6,000 jobs for young people if we had an effective junior rates system now available. We are in favour of young people having the chance of a job in the building and construction industry. The Labor Party is not in favour of such a proposal.In the area of the manufacturing industry, it is our view that the incorporation more widely of junior rates would give young people the chance of a job in manufacturing. That is something which the coalition is in favour of. That is something which the Labor Party is opposed to. The reason I say that is that one of the people who controls the policy of the Leader of the Opposition, Dougie Cameron of the AMWU, made it very clear in the Age last Friday that he was totally opposed to junior rates in his industry. He said that there would be national industrial action if anybody tried it.How do we know that counts a lot in the Labor Party? We know because his union paid over $350,000 to make sure that you lot on your side do what you are told by the Dougie Camerons of this world. This is why the Labor Party are basically negative on this issue, as they are on so many other issues. - In that case I will continue. The Prime Minister made reference to the comments of the Premier of New South Wales about being negative for the sake of being negative. I think it is worth quoting. -  - Bob Carr said:I think the electorate is telling political leaders these days to come up with positive approaches. Don't waste your time just attacking the other side. We're sick of that.It is no wonder young people in this country are looking to the government for political leadership. Why shouldn't they? -  - If you look to this government not only will we will provide political leadership but also you have a better chance of keeping your job with John Howard as Prime Minister. I see the Labor Party are going to change tactics. The Leader of the Opposition was in the party room this morning. It seems he has put up a white flag on tax reform. He has told his party room -  - I was concluding with exactly that point, Mr Speaker, because junior wage rates go to the question of the employment of literally hundreds of thousands of young people. I am informed reliably by AAP that the Leader of the Opposition announced in his party room that he is going to make a major policy statement on employment in Melbourne on 23 and 24 July at an employment seminar. This does provide a new challenge for the Leader of the Opposition. Fancy him telling his own side that he is going to an  nounce a policy. Fancy him saying that on 23 July he is going to announce a policy. What he ought to do is announce a policy that will provide jobs for young people. That is what he ought to do. That is his challenge. That is where the high jump bar is and it is time - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. This is an important issue to Australia. -  - I particularly acknowledge the interest of the member for Curtin in our international relations. The Australian and North Korean officials had a meeting in Bangkok on 25 June. This was the first meeting of capital based officials between Australia and North Korea in a very long time. Meetings have taken place between embassy officials in Bangkok, but meetings of capital based officials have not taken place  since the end of diplomatic relations between Australia and North Korea many years ago.These were discussions which covered a range of issues: the food security situation in North Korea, importantly, as well as regional international security issues and relations between North and South Korea. Australian officials at these talks, on my instructions, stressed to North Korea that progress in bilateral relations does require clear and positive moves by North Korea on a range of arms control and non-proliferation issues, especially in the missile and nuclear areas. We also want to see constructive engagement by North Korea with South Korea. And we want to see, in an overall sense, changes in North Korea's international behaviour which would contribute to an easing of regional tensions.Members of the House may know that some few weeks ago the members for Griffith and Holt visited Pyongyang, capital of North Korea, and possibly other parts of the country. They came back and gave me quite a graphic account of the food security situation in North Korea. There have been many other reports also from international agencies, in particular, the United Nations, about the food shortages in North Korea. We told the North Korean officials in Bangkok that Australia, which had committed $10 million in humanitarian assistance to North Korea this calendar year, would continue to work closely with the international community in monitoring relief efforts. Australia would be prepared to provide additional assistance to North Korea in the future, given the severe food problems that North Korea has. But it would be all the easier for us to be generous if North Korea were to meet some of the benchmarks that the international community wants it to meet on arms control and disarmament issues.The talks were an important contribution by Australia to regional security and they do contribute to efforts by the international community to draw North Korea out of its isolation and to contribute to a relaxation of tensions on the Korean peninsula. The South Korean government has particularly welcomed the contacts that we have been making with North Korea.</DOC>

 - As I informed the House last week, the Winemakers Federation of Australia had put in a submission to the Senate saying the following:Following industry representations to the state governments after the release of the tax reform package, the South Australian and New South Wales governments have agreed to continue cellar door rebates and remaining state governments are also likely to agree.After I was asked about this matter in the House and various allegations were made by members of the Labor Party, I rang the South Australian Treasurer, Mr Lucas, who indicated that indeed the South Australian government had said that it would run a rebate scheme. In other words, the Winemakers Federation submission was right and I was entitled to rely on it. I have discussed this matter with the South Australian Treasurer, who has made it clear that they would continue a rebate scheme, which is, of course, federal government policy. The honourable member opposite then says that the states might try to make the Commonwealth pay for it. - And the sun might come up tomorrow. We would all be surprised if a state government came along to the Commonwealth and said, `We would like more money to pay for something.' This would be the most unusual event in Commonwealth federal history. I well remember the  words of one of the Labor ministers who said, `Never stand in between a premier and a pot of money.' - I am informed by the Prime Minister that it was his predecessor, Mr Keating. It is the man whom those opposite admire, as I recall. In the 1996 election campaign, the Labor Party advertised that the only person who had the capacity to lead Australia was Mr Keating. Well may they say that; there is certainly nobody else on the Labor side who is qualified to lead the country. No wonder so many of them still pine for the good old days.Would I be surprised if a state premier said that, in relation to the rebate scheme that they were operating and were pledged to continue, they would seek a Commonwealth contribution? No more than the suggestion that the sun would come up tomorrow. Will the Commonwealth government be picking up an area of state responsibility? No, the Commonwealth government will be funding the states with a growing growth tax, with all of the revenue of the goods and services tax replacing all of the financial assistance grants. And we will be delivering on our agreement with the Australian Democrats to ensure that those rebate schemes are continued by the states.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. It would be seriously unwise for me, as minister, to get involved in the internal affairs of the AMA. So I have no intention of commenting on that matter at all. With respect to the other things that the honourable member raises, the pathology agreement is with the pathologists, not with the AMA, so I do not see what that part of the question has to do with anything. The savings in pharmacy relate to the GP agreement and, as I have explained several times previously, if that does not go ahead, the government actually saves money.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. Obviously from the electorate that he represents he takes a great deal of interest in issues revolving around the current circumstance of the Australian wool industry. This week is a significant week in the history of the Australian wool industry.	 The first reason is that today our government gets the new tax package through this House. We will be introducing a lot of savings and a much better taxation system for the entire rural community, particularly for wool growers. The benefits from the reduction in transport costs, which we have been debating in the chamber this afternoon, will flow on to wool growers and there will be extra savings for the rail industry with a $160 million cut in diesel excise to the rail industry.Just as importantly, members would be aware that last year when the government decided to freeze the stockpile in Australia it also decided to privatise the stockpile. This Thursday, WoolStock Australia comes into existence as the new grower controlled company that has the responsibility of managing  the stockpile from that point forward. This move has been completely endorsed by the industry. The industry, the entitlement holders in the original stockpile - the shareholders in WoolStock Australia - will be able to take control of this asset from Thursday under the leadership of Mr Donald McGauchie. He will do an excellent job as the Chairman of WoolStock Australia. That starts on Thursday.There is another important point to note this week for the Australian wool industry. Members will recall that at the end of last year, at a meeting that was held in Goulburn, the wool industry as a whole made a fairly significant decision; they expressed, very clearly, their feelings on how their industry was being run, and the government responded to that.I announced in this House that we would establish a Future Directions Taskforce which would report by the middle of this year. I am pleased to announce that the report of the wool industry Future Directions Taskforce will be made public tomorrow. We will be consulting with the Australian wool industry on the way forward from that point on - how to restructure the industry and how to better target the practices of the industry for the future of the industry and, particularly, for the growers in the industry.I will finish on the point that I started on. This week is also a great week for the Australian wool industry because of the benefits that will flow to it from this government's tax reform package, which will go through the House today.</DOC>

 - I will have a look at what can be released without prejudicing anything that is an operational matter. As a former justice minister, I am sure the member will be aware that there is some material in this area that, in the public interest, ought not to be released because it could compromise the future effectiveness of operational things. I, therefore, think it is unreasonable, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary - and I cannot imagine that he would have it - to imply that there is some cover-up. There is no cover-up on this. I am perfectly happy to make things available which do not compromise operational matters - anything that does, I will not.We adopted all of the recommendations of the Moore-Wilton report. It is my understanding that Moore-Wilton's report subsumed the report that was being done by Heggen into the two particular incidents and dealt with them. I will go and have a look at the material and at what can be made available without prejudicing operational things, because we do not have anything to hide. I make it plain that there has been no attempt at covering up anything. We are trying to provide better protection for this country against illegal immigration, and we believe that we have. In the spirit of making information available consistent with protecting operational things, I will see what I can do.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for his question and indeed  for his interest in these historic talks. As some honourable members may know, the DARE II talks are under way in Jakarta at the moment and are due to conclude tomorrow. We do regard these talks as a significant step forward in the reconciliation process in East Timor. We do not have unrealistic expectations about what can be achieved from this first really effective meeting of reconciliation of the conflicting parties to the East Timor conflict, but we do regard it as a very significant step forward. I know that future meetings will be required and future activity to encourage reconciliation will be necessary, but at least after 24 or so years of violence in East Timor the process of reconciliation is beginning.It will not come as a surprise to members of this House that the government has been extremely supportive and active in encouraging the DARE II process to take place. We have funded an academic from the Australian National University, Mr George Quinn, as a consultant to DARE II. The government has provided $80,000 worth of help to fund the DARE II meeting, and we are quite willing to contribute to further reconciliation efforts. We have also been involved in extensive discussions with all of the parties involved: the Indonesian government, the pro-integrationists, and the pro-independence people.In conclusion, the Australian government does very warmly welcome the participation not only of the pro-integrationists but also of the pro-independence leadership in these discussions. The fact that the Indonesian government has agreed to allow Xanana Gusmao and members of the East Timorese diaspora - in particular Jose Ramos Horta - to participate in these talks is a very important step forward. We have a very long way to go before East Timor is able to live in peace, but this is a constructive step forward, and the Australian government will continue to encourage and support these efforts.</DOC>

 - What a marvellous question to get at the end of question time. I have an enormous respect for the views of Sir Robert Menzies on a large number of issues and I read from time to time what he has had to say to draw a bit of inspiration and understanding, although I cannot say that I have recently spoken to him on the subject of voluntary student unionism. I do know that over the years I have had cause to reflect on the fact that although Sir Robert and I had similar views on a lot of subjects there are a number of subjects on which our views were different. For example, Sir Robert, as befitted people of that generation, had a very different view about centralised wage fixation from the view that I hold. He had a very strong view about the role of the then Conciliation and Arbitration Commission on those issues. Over the years any dynamic evolving political party, no matter how much it holds in respect its founders or its earlier leaders, will evolve policies that are appropriate for the times. If ever there was a policy that is appropriate for the Australian times as we move towards the third millennium it is a policy based on a simple liberal principle - and that is freedom of association.The government's attitude towards voluntary student unionism has not changed. Any suggestion that we have sort of gone slow on the legislation in the Senate because we have altered our view is wrong -  -  - We remain very strongly committed to the principles underlying that bill. I think there is a very important principle of the liberty of the subject involved in voluntary student unionism. I believe that voluntary student unionism speaks of a society where people should not be compelled to join, that voluntary student unionism speaks of a society where the money of students should not be, against their will, conscripted to be spent on causes in which they do not believe. -  - I am very surprised indeed that some of the people who have put up their hands and have put their signatures in support of the opponents of voluntary student unionism, perhaps in ignorance -  -  - of some of the activities on which conscripted money has been spent. -  - This is a free and open society, and any of the people who have put their name to that petition in the paper have a right to do so and they have a right to espouse their cause. But equally, as political participants, the members of my party and I have a right to disagree with them and to say that on that issue they are wrong. I think that every signatory to that petition is in error on this issue. I do not make any exceptions in relation to any of them. I think they are wrong on that issue. When you go through the signatories to that petition, you see that they are what I would call the usual suspects, with one or two exceptions -  -  - There are some honourable exceptions to that. - You know, because you know the usual suspects. You see Jennie  George, and you go on through the list. It is not the least bit surprising.Can I just say that, at 3.40 on an afternoon where the Labor Party is obviously in some degree of depression and despair, this is the sort of question you really dream of getting because it enables you to state one of the fundamental things that divide this side of politics from the other side: they are still in favour of compulsion; they are still in favour of a society which allows power centres in our society to tell people what to do as distinct from affording them choice.Voluntary student unionism is built on the great principle of choice. I believe that men and women who go to universities have a perfect right to decide whether or not they belong to student organisations. The world has changed since the great founder of my party uttered those words. As we go towards the next millennium, the policy put forward by my colleague the minister for education, the policy campaign fought so vigorously by so many of my own party, including the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and many other members and senators of the party, is the right policy for the time. It is a soundly based Liberal policy. It is a Liberal policy that, give or take a few of the usual suspects, has wide support within young Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question. It again draws to attention the vast difference between this side of the House and the other. On a historic week in Australian politics, when the absolute emptiness of the policy bin on the other side has become so apparent, where it is so clear that they have all caught the Gareth disease, `relevance deprivation syn  drome' - no policies, nothing to say - this government continues to get on with the job. - We get on with the job. From 1 July, there will be significant new benefits available for carers, those who look after the elderly and people with disabilities in our community. About half a million Australians care for people with severe or profound disabilities. -  - The carers of Australia are some of the unsung heroes of our nation, forgoing many opportunities for themselves to care for children with disabilities, or their ageing parents. This government is taking significant steps from 1 July to assist carers in their special responsibilities. We have done a lot already. We have extended the carer payment to parents caring for young children with disabilities. We have introduced 70 carer respite centres since 1996 - something that Labor never did.	 Now, in the Staying at Home package, there is another $150 million worth of assistance for carers.Whilst the states have primary responsibility in many of these areas, the Commonwealth is now providing additional resources to help fund assistance to carers. From 1 July, the carer allowance will replace the child disability allowance and the domiciliary nursing care benefit, and we estimate that another 14,000 Australian carers of people with disabilities will have access to this new benefit. It will not be subject to income or assets tests, and it will not be taxed. So it is a very generous benefit to recognise the special contribution that carers make in our community. This  government admires their self-sacrifice in the contribution that they make. We are prepared to help and support them. We have policies to assist Australian families - and what a difference that is from those who sit on the opposite side.</DOC>

 - This question comes from the representative of a party which proposed to actually cut research expenditure in the last election campaign! The Labor Party went to the last election with a proposal to reduce expenditure on research in universities. Its own forward estimates petered out and it did not commit enough money to sustain research expenditure. I not only read that foreword to the green paper before I signed it but wrote the foreword to the green paper, and the statements in the foreword are absolutely correct. - It might be worth reminding the opposition and the House about this government's commitment to research. Let us just look at what the government has put into university research since 1995-96. In 1995-96 - the last year of your government, the last year of the Labor Party government - the federal government committed $346.4 million to research. This coming year, 1999-00, the government will be committing $437.6 million. - The question was about research. Let us just focus on the question you have asked. - They do not like the answer, Mr Speaker. They do not like the answer because they have been misinformed by the spokesman for the policy vacuum over there, the member for Dobell. Government expenditure on research has gone up very substantially. - I was asked about whether or not research expenditure was growing, and I am putting before the House the figures that demonstrate that it has grown very substantially. It is also worth making the point that taxpayers put more money into R&amp;D in Australia as a proportion of GDP than do all but two of the OECD countries. Our public expenditure on research is exceptionally high. Not only that, business expenditure on research has grown very substantially over the  last decade, and the research paper will encourage further investment in research. It will encourage an entrepreneurial culture in Australian universities.This question demonstrates that the Labor Party is totally out of touch with what is happening in university research, it is totally out of touch with what is happening in education and, until it replaces the member for Dobell as the spokesperson for education on its side, it will remain out of touch.</DOC>

 - Many members will have seen in today's Financial Review  an article by a member of the Productivity Commission following up on the Productivity Commission report released recently entitled The New Economy ? A New Look at Australia's Productivity Performance . In that report the Productivity Commission - which of course the Labor Party opposed setting up - found that Australia's productivity performance is now at an all-time high and that productivity has accelerated over recent years. Productivity growth has averaged 2.9 per cent under a coalition government, double that of the average under Labor of 1.5 per cent. - Paul Krugman, the world famous economist from MIT, said recently:I would like to see more Australias around the world.And, at the meeting of trade ministers in Auckland recently, US trade representative Richard Fisher - no relation to one of Australia's great trade ministers, Mr Tim Fischer - said this:Australia of course has been a great grower and it is rather miraculous what Australia has been able to achieve, but if you look around the rest of the world you don't see that kind of dynamic growth.That again emphasises the lift in productivity, the lift in growth in the Australian economy,  as we have put in place a macro-economic framework with which to conduct the Australian economy. We have put in place a charter of budget honesty to lock in good fiscal policy - and it was opposed by Labor. We put in place a surplus budget - and it was opposed by Labor. We entered into an agreement on monetary policy with the Governor of the Reserve Bank - and it was opposed by Labor, saying that it was going to sue the government over such an agreement.We put in place privatisation in relation to Telstra - and it was opposed by Labor. With the proceeds of the privatisation of Telstra, we have been able to pay down Commonwealth debt. And, if Labor would get out of the way and cease its opposition and Telstra were fully privatised, Australia could eliminate Commonwealth debt in 2002-03. - Apparently running a budget surplus and retiring Commonwealth debt has nothing to do with a productive economy. Oh, the thinkers on the Labor back bench! Some of us wonder how the Labor Party gets the people it does on the front bench -  - and the answer lies with the people it has on the back bench. Now that the US has finally got its budget into surplus, President Clinton in talking of America -  - was quoted in the paper today as saying:By 2015 this country can be entirely out of debt if we do not squander the surplus by choosing short-term gain over long-term national goals. If you pay this debt off, it means interest rates will be lower. It means there will be more investment, more new jobs, more money left over for higher wages. There we have President Clinton holding out to the US people the prospect of eliminating US debt by 2015. If Labor got out of the way, Australia could beat the US by 13 years; we could accomplish in 2002 what President Clinton has set as a goal for US economic policy in 2015. It turns on one vote in the Australian Senate. The Labor Party can either prevent Australia eliminating debt and beating the US by 13 years, or it can continue its policy of useless negative oppositionism. The choice stands squarely with the Leader of the Opposition.We on this side of the House believe that Australia can keep its performance up, we can lift productivity, we can beat the US - and we call upon the Labor Party for once in its life to do something for the national interest.</DOC>

 - As I am sure all honourable members will be aware, research investment in this country takes a number of forms. It not only comes from the public sector but it also comes from the private sector. - Just listen. It is not only directed to the sorts of things that were the subject of the question asked by the member  for Dobell but also it reaches into areas such as health and medical research. - They do not want to talk about that because we, in fact, in the last budget have committed ourselves to double the amount. We are going to double the amount of money going into health and medical research. It is not surprising therefore that, since the budget, I have been absolutely inundated with letters from people involved in health and medical research all around this country, applauding the vision and the commitment of the government I lead to health and medical research.As to the interpretation placed by the Leader of the Opposition upon an ABS survey, I have a longstanding practice in this parliament, verified by bitter experience: I never accept an interpretation placed on a public document by the Leader of the Opposition. I do not have anything to add to the very fine answer given by my colleague the minister for education.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his timely question. The APEC meeting has just finished in Auckland this day. I was privileged to attend on behalf of the Australian government not only at  Auckland but also at Christchurch where we had a very successful joint lamb rally and public meeting - with my counterpart and with the farm leader, Ian Donges, and his counterpart, Malcolm Bailey - which added weight to our case to persuade the US not to proceed down the path of barriers against our legitimate lamb exports.On APEC, I am delighted that further steps were taken to lock in the launch of a WTO millennium round at the Seattle ministerial scheduled for November of this year. In addition to agriculture and services which are part of the built-in agenda, there was a very clear-cut decision to add industrials to that in a way which was unanimously adopted by APEC trade ministers - a very pleasant change from some of our difficulties in recent times.On the APEC only activity, the individual action plans are back in business. They are the engine room of APEC. A number of steps were taken to further build momentum with those individual action plans as well as practical proposals, such as the APEC food system, which is seeing a boost to two-way trade and more jobs - newer and better jobs - as a consequence of that additional trade.I might add there was also consideration of aspects of financial transparency and work which the Treasurer and others have done and which the Prime Minister, from his task force, launched. I am delighted that, in reviewing all of APEC at this time as it heads to the leaders meeting in September in Auckland, it has to be said that the management of the Asian meltdown was conducted a whole lot better as a consequence of the existence of APEC. The bringing forward of a recovery, most notably in places like Korea, was facilitated by the additional confidence, contact and networking conferred by APEC when some very hard decisions had to be made, including by the Australian government.There is a bonus for Darwin out of the deliberations in New Zealand these last three or four days, and that is that Brunei has invited Australia to be the host for this trade ministers meeting this time next year - mid-year 2000 - and the good news is that, on my recommendation, Darwin has been selected  for that. It will be a very good boost for the Brunei year of APEC that Darwin will host the trade ministers meeting, especially as Brunei is seeking to develop the theme of service industries and tourism for its APEC year. All in all, a very constructive, successful meeting. But I sadly have to report to the House there is still no such thing as a level playing field.</DOC>

 - I am aware that the honourable member released a report of a letter from Mr Staley to me dated 2 June 1999. I thank her for doing so, because it certainly brought it to my attention and it means that her attempt to mislead the House can be refuted. I have the letter from Mr Staley. In it he posed a number of questions and asked for answers in relation to them.The answers to Mr Staley's questions are that the GST will not adversely impact on government grants to cooperative research centres and, where a grant is a payment by a government that constitutes a consideration for a supply of services, they will be subject to GST only when the CRC is a registered entity. This means that if it is a registered entity -  - Just wait for it - it can claim the full amount of the GST as an input tax credit. - They say it is, and the consequence of it is that they get all of it back. One of the things that has amazed me in this whole debate as it has gone through the House of Representatives is that not one person in the Labor Party has been able to do the work to actually understand how tax applies - not one of them. A registered entity is entitled to claim back as an input tax credit all of the GST paid. That is the whole idea. Businesses do not pay tax on inputs. It is only under Labor's tax system that business pays tax under inputs. - Because Labor's tax, the wholesale sales tax, when you buy something with wholesale sales tax on it, you are not entitled to claim it back. That is the difference. They have always brought with them the fatal weakness of their own flawed taxation system and sought to objectify it onto tax reform. - The provider of the grant will therefore be able to claim an input tax credit in relation to the grant, and the grant recipient will be able to remit the GST to the Australian Taxation Office. Because the transaction is one between two GST registered entities, it will have no net GST effect on either the CRC or the provider of the grant. And that being the case, the CRCs are in a protected position. - The CRCs will benefit from tax reform because they will be able to give all of their input tax credits back. I welcome the interest of Mr Staley in writing to me and I am very pleased to be able to have this opportunity to give him the answers in relation to that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. In April 1997 the Labor Party actually set the benchmark, the criteria, by which the 1996 Workplace Relations Act reforms should be assessed and I think - 2½ years on since the commencement of those reforms - it is only fair enough to judge ourselves against the test which the Labor Party set for us. The then shadow minister, the member for Fraser, said there were five questions to be asked about the government's reforms. The first one was: will there be fewer industrial disputes over this three-year term under this regime than there were in the last three years under the old regime? As members of the House know, we got the lowest level of industrial disputes since 1913 in both 1997 and 1998 - one out of one we passed that test.The second Labor test was: will there be more jobs created in this term under this regime than there were in the last parliament? In particular, will there be more jobs created in small business? Of course unemployment is not good enough but it is the lowest basically for this decade. Youth unemployment is about the lowest since the early 1980s. Importantly, we have created more jobs than Labor destroyed during `the recession that we had to have'. In Labor's last six years there were 24,300 full-time jobs created; under the coalition, 407,000. Half of those were full time and about half of them were created in small business. So that is two questions out of two.The third one was: will the distribution of wage outcomes and benefits be fairer after this act than it was before? That is an easy one to answer. If you are a low income person, real wages have increased by 7½ per cent in the time that we have been in; they  declined by five per cent under Labor's 13 years - so that is three out of three. His fourth test was: will labour productivity increase faster after this act than the current trend rate of 1.75 per cent per annum? The Treasurer has already answered that question. Productivity rates are at a very high level, certainly significantly better than they were when Labor was in. That is four out of four.Lastly: will the overall wage and salary outcomes be more consistent with a low inflation, low interest rate environment than the outcomes of the present system? Interest rates are at the lowest since the bloke walked on the moon. As for interest rates: not only do you get an increase in your wage packet but $330 a month in the average reduction in mortgage rates and of course low inflation. And who is helped by low inflation? None other than the low income folk, those people who are otherwise disadvantaged in the labour market. Those are the tests that the Labor Party set. The official statistics show we have met five out of five. The importance of that fact is that we are now proceeding to the second set of reforms, building on what we have done in 1996, confident in the knowledge that the runs are on the board - more jobs, more employment, higher wages - and that is a good deal for the Australian economy.</DOC>

 - My response to the honourable member for Dickson's question is  to say to her that the package is not quite as we originally designed it. - That is apparently hilariously funny. But I would have thought that that was quite apparent. - It delivers overwhelmingly the benefits that we promised to rural and regional Australia. In fact, the package as a whole may offer better benefits to rural and regional Australia. There are some changes to the arrangements as a result of what we successfully negotiated with the Democrats. I regret, I have to say to the member for Dickson, that she dealt herself - and her party - out of the opportunity to perhaps have smoothed over, to have streamlined, some of these areas for which she now professes great concern about. But that was not possible and the responsibility for that decision lies not with us, not with the Democrats but with you.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Fadden for his question; he has long been a strong advocate for consumer interests. Twenty-one days after the royal assent is given for the bills that passed through the parliament yesterday, tax cuts begin. The wholesale sales tax applying to luxury goods will be brought down from 32 per cent to 22 per cent. These goods, as the Treasurer said in the House yesterday, include clocks, television sets, hi-fi systems, cameras, watches, radios, cufflinks and tie-pins. For the information of the Labor Party, they also include amusement machines, which should  ensure that membership fees for the Labor Party come down as well.Fines will be put in place - of $10 million for companies and up to half a million dollars for individuals - for those who do not bring down the prices. I can advise the House that the ACCC has advised me that it has also surveyed retailers in over 100 cities and towns across Australia, specifically focusing on rural and regional Australia. They have a basket of goods from individual stores in those cities and towns as a price guide and a comparison with the price that should be applied after the wholesale sales tax comes down.As an indication of the broad range of basket that the ACCC has gathered, it covers, interestingly enough, representatives from both sides of the House and towns ranging from Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, from the seat of the member for Northern Territory through to the Gold Coast, Charters Towers, Longreach, Maitland, Bega, Orange, Glen Innes, Canberra, Bendigo, Hamilton, Bairnsdale, Launceston, Whyalla, Broome and a number of other centres. We can also advise the House that the ACCC has a new commissioner dealing with GST prices surveillance, that being Dr David Cousins. That was announced earlier today. -  - The ACCC will be working closely with the Australian Taxation Office to ensure that, to the satisfaction of the member for Fadden, consumers are better off through the GST application. I can advise the House that if consumers do have any complaints about that process then they should ring the ACCC on 1300 302 502 to ensure that retailers are bringing down the prices, which is good news for Australian consumers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. The first point I would make is that, if the truck operating in a conurbation is over 20 tonnes when it is loaded, it gets the full benefit of all the transportation tax relief measures. The second point I would make is that, if it is between 4½ tonnes and 20 tonnes and operating in a conurbation like that, no, it does not get the full benefit. That is known. There is no new fresh revelation in that. The third point I would make is this: all of those truck operators benefit from the abolition of something that, as the Treasurer suggested yesterday, you are evidently going to argue that we ought to bring back at the next election - the WST. It all goes. It is one of the major cost imposts on the transport industry, and it goes. What is more, they get the GST on their fuel back.The next point I would make is in relation to where they might choose to locate. The relief or the taxation concessions are not based around where the truck is registered; it is based around where the fuel is used and what it is used for. The final point I would make is that what needs to be recognised is that, on this issue, you are opposing a valuable set of reforms for rural and regional Australia. You are against them. I want to quote some remarks made in Queensland the other day by an interviewer talking to United Graziers Association President, Noel Kennedy. The interviewer comments that Noel Kennedy believes that the cut to diesel fuel is the most significant part of the GST package for regional and remote Queensland.He says that it will benefit all people who live in remote areas and not just the people who operate a business - a grazing or a mining business. He said that it will benefit the people who live there and the actual cost of living in these remote areas. Freight is a big component of their costs, and of course this will be reduced. He also said that it will either do one of two things: it will reduce the cost of their living or it will improve the quality of life. I suggest it will do both. The bottom line is quite simply that you do not want people in rural and regional Australia to  have the massive benefits that flow out of this very worthwhile reform.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The interjections are coming from a party which, as I said, intended to actually cut research funding in the course of its last announced education policy. The discussion paper on research and research training issued by the government is an expression of the government's determination to strengthen Australia's research base and to make sure that the brilliant ideas of Australian researchers have the best possible chance of being developed in Australia.Australia as a nation has shown that it is very strong in producing outstanding research and brilliant ideas. Too often those ideas have been developed overseas where the jobs have been located overseas when they could have been in Australia. This research paper aims to create a more entrepreneurial climate in Australian research and in the scientific community. Nor can Australia afford to keep losing the best and brightest of its young researchers. Its young scientists are going overseas as a result of the restrictive policies that the Labor Party supported for 13 years. This paper and the proposals in this paper will start to bring back to Australia the best and brightest of our young researchers.The comparative advantage of Australia in the 21st century will be because its economy is an ideas economy. Australia is going to find that its comparative advantage is in its knowledge and ideas, and the policies proposed in this green paper will help to position  Australian research so that it is world class across the board. I am pleased to be able to tell the House that Professor Vicki Sara, the Chair of the Australian Research Council, has said that the paper is `an important step forward for the development of Australia's innovation system'.This government has invested in research. It has put far more money into university research than the Labor Party ever put into university research. Australia is already making a very big investment in scientific research and research in other areas. What this paper is concerned with is getting the national strategy right. We have to make sure that there is an entrepreneurial climate in that research, that there are incentives to commercialise their research, that there are incentives to critical mass so young researchers can feel that they can continue their careers and work in Australia in an environment which will enable them to give it their best.One of the interesting proposals in this paper is $2 million for the Prime Minister's scholarships. The Prime Minister's scholarships will provide assistance to the most promising honours graduates in Australia's universities who are proposing to go on to doctoral research. This is a recognition of the fact that this paper is all about excellence: it is about encouraging the best that Australia can do so that the best ideas and the best knowledge can support prosperity and jobs in this country into the 21st century.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The first thing that comes to mind is that I suspect again what we are seeing here is a failure to understand that all business costs are rebatable. - In full. But there is a serious national issue here and I want to touch on it briefly. - The vision thing. Well, there you go. We see a lot of that from the ALP. It is a vision called oppose absolutely everything, whatever it is, and if it is good for the country oppose it even more vigorously. - The fact of the matter is that we are removing all excise on rail. That is not something you have put up as a proposal. I believe that will assist the long-term competitiveness for rail. The short answer to your question about long-term prospects for rail is that, yes, we have done quite a bit of work on it and what we have established is that rail will continue to enjoy the advantage -  - Mr Speaker, they are apparently not interested in the answer. But I thought it was quite an interesting point that the long-term advantages rail enjoys in long distance heavy freight haulage not only will be maintained but also are likely to be increased because our GST package will promote growth. More growth means a greater task for transport. That means more opportunity for both road and rail, and in the area where rail has an advantage it is our belief, based on research that we have done, that rail can look forward to a very bright future, particularly if we can gain a competitive regulatory environment across the jurisdiction of this country and if we can undo some of the damage that was done to rail in the years when you were in power.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He is a man who holds the largest electorate in the world, let alone in Australia. - He knows a bit about transport and he knows how important it is. - Yes, he knows a bit about campaigning. The parliament yesterday passed some bills which means that collectively transport has had a great week in Australia. It is the lifeblood of the economy, particularly in rural and regional areas. So I want to announce that there is another big win which will commence unrolling tomorrow - that is, what is known as higher mass limits will begin to unroll.For the layman, this means that trucks will now be allowed to carry more freight per load - less trucks delivering more economical usage of our fuel. It will mean, in short, that a semitrailer, which at the moment is legally limited to carry 42½ tonnes, will be able to carry 45½ tonnes. To the layman again, I reassure people that it does not mean more trucks; it means fewer trucks because they can load more effectively. It is worth, believe it or not, something in the order of an $840 million a year boost to gross domestic product - benefits to consumers, the farm sector, the mining sector, fuel distribution, logging, food manufacturing, in short, to all Australians.I would like to say that my ministerial counterparts in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory showed early and strong support for this. South Australia has had higher mass limits since January of this year. Western Australia and the Northern Territory have had them in  part for several years. Tasmania has also agreed. Yesterday Queensland agreed, which is a great outcome. We await a reply from the ACT. But I heard somebody opposite say, `Where is Mr Carr on this?' Mr Carr is dragging his heels. Mr Carr claims to be at the forefront of transport reform, but his minister Carl Scully is saying that they are not going to allow for the unrolling of higher mass limits in this country.Mass limits are a very major reform for transport in this country, with trucks loading more effectively, fewer trucks and lower fuel usage. We are putting in real resources to upgrade bridges across the nation to help the unrolling. It is time that New South Wales came on side with this very important reform, that they stop resisting the sorts of reforms that we see also in the area of the waterfront.I note in closing that the member who asked this question will be interested to learn that among the 13 new enterprise agreements signed recently by P&amp;O is one for Port Hedland. It will make a real difference again to the transport efficiency in his electorate.</DOC>

 - In response to the honourable member's question I really think that, ahead of the report, which has not been completed, he does himself, the Labor Party, the transport industry and, in particular, the  manufacturers of certain trucks in this country a great disservice by making assumptions that should not yet be made. It is true that, entirely appropriately and responsibly for a transport minister in this country, in response to various allegations being made, I have indeed initiated an inquiry. That is under way. But for a number of reasons, including a very interesting set of attitudes by some of the legal people in this country, it has taken much longer than anticipated to complete that review. Due to the complexity of the issues involved, the investigation has been extended. I expect a draft report soon. But I would suggest that, in the interests of fair play and common decency, we not make these sorts of assumptions about people who may prove to have been unfairly and grossly maligned.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question and for his interest in this great program and for recently visiting the Work for the Dole team that was doing environmental restoration on the banks of the Bremer River in his electorate. I am aware of recent public statements about the Work for the Dole program, particularly an adjournment speech last night by the member for Batman, which he described as a fairly significant statement from the Australian Labor Party, presumably to distinguish it from statements from the Leader of the Opposition, whose net satisfaction rating has dropped by 13 points in just six weeks. - The statement of the member for Batman last night was in fact a significant challenge to the authority of the Leader of the Opposition, who has consistently called -  - The Leader of the Opposition has consistently called Work for the Dole social punishment. He has called it a disgracefully shoddy piece of public policy. Yet last night in the chamber we had the member for Batman calling for community organisations to become involved in what his leader thinks is a disgracefully shabby piece of public policy. The member for Batman gave the game away a few moments later when he called for a return to Working Nation style training programs, even though he knows - because the member for Melbourne has told him - that these lead to perverse outcomes and inappropriate and even demoralising training. That is even though he knows - because the Leader of the Opposition has told him:It is true that out of a lot of our training programs people didn't get a job at the end of it. But . . . they weren't around the streets bothering anybody.So that is the kind of shabby, shoddy training that the member for Batman is calling for in replacement of Work for the Dole. The real question is: has the ALP dropped its opposition to Work for the Dole? The answer is: of course it has not. What the member for Batman was doing last night was simply acknowledging the great public support for  this great program. If the ALP were serious about supporting Work for the Dole, it would not give lectures to community organisations, it would tell the union movement to drop its opposition to this program, it would tell the New South Wales AWU to drop its veto on Work for the Dole programs in New South Wales national parks. That is the real test of whether the ALP is serious about for Work for the Dole: is it prepared to take on the unions? That is a test the Labor Party always flunks.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. From the outset, I think that we should acknowledge that we take our obligations as far as international trade very seriously. We, through the Minister for Trade and Deputy Prime Minister, have become a major player on the world stage in terms of trade negotiations and progressing the ideals of the Cairns Group. We have achieved a great deal in that regard.As far as the position that Canada have taken in advance of Australia fulfilling its obligations under this WTO decision, which  is the issue that the member asked about, Canada are probably being a little bit provocative in identifying what retaliatory action they are taking and indeed going to the WTO when the WTO decision was about Australia completing an import risk analysis process by a particular date. That date has not arrived yet. We have announced that AQIS is undertaking that import risk analysis process. - No. It is undertaking that analysis, and we will meet our obligations under the WTO. An interesting point to make is that earlier this year on 1 March, the shadow spokespersons, I suppose, for trade and agriculture, Senator Cook and the member for Corio, put out a joint statement, `Salmon decision: the government must act'. It says:One possibility would be to accelerate the Import Risk Assessment on fresh salmon, currently due to report early next year. As long as it is careful to preserve the integrity of Australia's Risk Assessment process the government would be wise to investigate whether this process can be completed before 6 July 1999.For once, the Labor Party agrees with the position the government has taken. - We have taken that position. The truncated import risk analysis process is under way right now. We will stand by the integrity of the scientific basis of that process, and we will meet our WTO obligations.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question and her concern about the attack in the town of Maliana on a number of United Nations personnel. The Australian government is seriously concerned about the attack on  United Nations personnel in Maliana. We understand that somewhere in the vicinity of 12 United Nations personnel were injured, although I have been advised that no Australians were injured.The United Nations, Australia and the international community as a whole will not, of course, be bullied by thugs. We will not be bullied out of this United Nations process and we will not be bullied into abandoning the United Nations supervised ballot in East Timor. The Indonesian authorities are, as members are no doubt aware, investigating this incident.Last night I took the opportunity of speaking to the Indonesian ambassador about this incident, and I made it clear that the Australian government deplores this kind of violence directed against the United Nations. On my instructions, our ambassador in Jakarta, John McCarthy, also made representations at the highest level in the Indonesian department of foreign affairs. He was not able to speak to the foreign minister because Mr Alatas was absent in Burkina Faso. - Mr McCarthy took the opportunity of reiterating our grave concern, and the ambassador did make the point that the Indonesian police had failed in their duty to provide protection.The incident in Maliana should underline without any doubt to Indonesia that the concerns that we and others have, in particular that the United Nations have, about security in East Timor are real. The international community does expect Indonesia to fulfil its obligations under the tripartite agreement agreed in New York to protect UNAMET personnel. We have, of course, consistently made our concerns known to the Indonesians. - I hear the member for Kingsford-Smith, back on his cheap party political points. You had 13 years to fix up  the East Timor problem. You did not bother in 13 years. - I do not recall the Labor Party organising a summit with President Suharto to discuss the issue of East Timor ever. You never had the courage to do that. - The Prime Minister makes a rather significant point. You certainly did not travel up to Indonesia to lobby on the issue of East Timor. The Prime Minister did. The Prime Minister met with President Habibie in order to discuss Australia's concerns about the security environment in East Timor. We have made something like 50 representations since March on the issue of the security environment in East Timor.In conclusion, I was only going to give the House an update on the situation and what we had done. The constant cackling of the Labor Party reminds us of what could be described as sickening hypocrisy. You had 13 years to address the issue of East Timor and you cry crocodile tears now. If it was such a big issue, why did you do nothing about it for 13 years? You hypocrites! - I have finished.</DOC>

 - The first thing I noticed reported in the press today was that the Leader of the National Party told the state parliament that the Western Australian Premier did tell me that there would be no change to the regional forest agreement which the Premier and the Prime Minister signed some weeks ago. That is a matter of record in the parliamentary Hansard  in Western Australia.We are well aware that certain people from time to time identify other blocks that might be included in the reserve system. I went and had a look at one of them through my department. I think it might have been Jane Block, but I will stand corrected on its title. It was about 5,000 hectares and represented 15,000 cubic meters of saw logs. If that one single block was added to the reserve system negotiated under the JANIS criteria and the national forest policy statement - which was once written by the Labor government; and once written oft forgotten is their practice - if that one block was transferred from production to reservation, 70 to 80 direct jobs would be lost. That seems to be what this minister cautions about. All he wants to do is try to  raise a situation here where there would be further job losses in the forest industries.When the Prime Minister signed that agreement, I was so proud to be able to stand up and say to a town that is extremely vulnerable to this process, the town of Nannup, that the people of Nannup could sleep tonight. It is only due to the fact that the Labor Party will not support the regional forest agreement legislation in the Senate that we are not able to stand here now adding that reassurance to the people of the forest industries around Australia who are extremely worried. The major party - the now party of total irrelevance - is unable to bring itself to support this. We have got the Oxford scholars faction now running the Labor Party on forest issues. They do not care about working people. They wake up every morning and think there is some new party that is not called the Labor Party. The Labor Party used to be committed - as the spokesman on industrial relations has reminded his own side - to putting jobs first.The regional forest agreement is a process that addresses environmental issues under a strict criteria and, in Western Australia, that criteria was met. It also addresses the social impact on people and, for the benefit of the people opposite, that social impact means whether or not they are going to lose their house. - I have finished.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Menzies for his pertinent question. Yesterday was an historic step forward in our ambitions to become a global financial centre. It was a  historic day forward because the parliament passed two very important pieces of legislation that make us world competitive and, in many ways, ahead of much of the world.In the first place, we have got something to boast about in Australia that other parts of the region have not. We have got the second largest stock market in the Asia-Pacific region. We have got the largest futures market in the Asia-Pacific region. We have got the sixth largest funds under management of any nation in the world. As of reports this morning, the Australian dollar is now the fifth most traded currency in the world after the euro, the US, the sterling and the yen. That is an indication of just how successful Australia is in getting its message across to the world that we are a good place to do business in. Much of the credit goes to the work already done by the government and, in particular, by the Minister for Trade, who has gone to Asia and sent a great message to Asia - to Thailand, Hong Kong and Singapore - about our ambitions and successes and the great strength of the Australian economy.Yesterday two very important pieces of legislation passed the parliament. The first one was Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2). That provides a number of tax initiatives, announced some time ago by the government but implemented now, that encourage foreign financial institutions to provide services to Australian consumers, particularly in terms of funds management. Another initiative in that piece of legislation takes the shackles off foreign investors who want to invest in Australian corporate bonds. All of the people in this House should be aware that the Aussie Home Loans and the RAMS of this world issue bonds on the Australian market. If money is cheaper for Aussie, money is cheaper for all Aussies. The benefit of that comes down to lower interest rates for mums and dads. That is what we want.Other initiatives in that bill are a significant step forward, but no initiative is more significant than the billions of dollars we have provided as an incentive for Australian mums and dads to invest in the stock market. The best way to do that is to abolish stamp duty on the transfer of shares. Why does the Labor  Party oppose these initiatives? Why does the Labor Party oppose greater access for Australian mums and dads to the stock market? - The member for Paterson interrupts. The member for Paterson has obviously had his mojo stolen in the last 24 hours. The member for Paterson, who models himself on Austin Powers - </DOC>

 - The press reporting, of course, is slightly misrepresented in the question, and that is not an unusual event. My reading of the press reporting was that the Premier made no comment, but the Deputy Premier then announced to the parliament that the Premier had told him that they were not changing the arrangements. All the evidence I note in the media is that the Western Australian coalition has resolved an issue that represented some difficulty for them. There was clearly very vigorous debate within their party room and their cabinet on the issue. It is pretty clear from today's press reporting, I am pleased to say, that the Western Australian government did what people of honour would always have done, and stuck to their agreements and stuck to their policy. In this House that is easy to differentiate. There is our side and there is their side. This is the side that can be identified as sticking to policy and promoting policy in a way that creates both jobs and conservation, in this case according to the national forest policy statement.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, could I say in reply to the member for Ballarat, and an outstanding Chief Government Whip, that as it transpires I have seen a comment on that very issue. That comment came from none other than a successful Labor leader, and that successful Labor leader is the Premier of New South Wales. He had this to say:I think the electorate is telling political leaders these days to come up with positive approaches.This is the really relevant bit:Don't waste your time just attacking the other side. We are sick of that.That could well be a piece of political advice that the Leader of the Opposition could take  on his travels around Australia over the next five or six weeks because if there is one thing that distinguishes our side from the other side, particularly over the eight months that have gone by since the last election, it is that the Liberal and National parties have got on with the job. They have delivered on what they promised to do. One of the most conspicuous features of a very conspicuous budget delivered by the Treasurer in May was that we were able to announce in that budget the implementation in full of all of the promises we took to the Australian people in October of last year. Not one of those promises was left out. The Treasurer was able to put a document on the table demonstrating conclusively that we had implemented all of our promises.Lest anybody in this House imagine for a moment that in my comments I am adopting a partisan stance, can I refer to an editorial in the Melbourne Herald Sun today. It is under the headline of `The sidelined ALP'. I think it really deserves very, very careful study. This is what it had to say:Having contributed nothing positive to tax reform, Opposition Leader Kim Beazley has the cheek to criticise the government's deal with the Democrats. His own lack of leadership on this issue saw the ALP sidelined in the negotiations which were critical to the nation's future.Yesterday, in a deplorable exercise in negativism, Mr Beazley described the new tax system as 'a complete mess'. He also mocked the government's attempt to achieve a 100 per cent Telstra sale.. . .              . . .             . . .Instead of responding to reality by isolating the minority senators, they allowed Labor to be reduced to a rump.The outcomes on both tax reform and Telstra are far from ideal. But Mr Beazley cannot credibly denigrate the Howard Government's compromise.What you have there is a very accurate analysis. On one side of politics in Australia at the moment you have two political parties that are prepared to put the national interest ahead of the sectional interest. You have two political parties - the Liberal and National parties - which are prepared to take risks for the long-term benefit of this country. You have two political parties - the Liberal Party and the National Party - which are committed  to long-term benefits for the people of Australia. On the other side you have a political party that is wallowing in negativism, a political party that lives by saying no and shaking its head, a political party that is led by a man who has given no political leadership over the last three years. It is also led by a man who is now losing any touch with political reality. I turned on my radio this morning to hear him being interviewed by Fran Kelly of the ABC, and his very first answer in response to a question from Fran Kelly was:Look, we have mounted a full-blown assault on this GST, and we have won the debate.All I can say is that I tremble to think of what he would say if he had thought he had lost the debate. It has been a very satisfying first eight months, satisfying because we have been able to do good things for the people of Australia. Governments are elected and political parties come into this place to stand for principles, to fight for programs to achieve goals, to achieve objectives - not to feed their egos, but to deliver long-term benefits for the people of Australia. I am very pleased and proud that we have done that. We will go on doing that. I thank my colleagues for the contributions that they have made to that.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - What I said yesterday, if you look at all of it, of course I stand by. The matter was considered by the cabinet this morning. Cabinet has a recommendation to put to a meeting of the joint parties which will take place immediately after question time. I ought to tell my colleagues on this side of the House that you hereby have notice of that meeting, and I expect to see all of you  there. I think you will turn up; it is an interesting subject. Then the Attorney-General will be making an announcement during the course of the debate. I believe that the way in which the government has handled this matter will be seen by all fair-minded people who do not want a rigged question as being a decent outcome.</DOC>

 - May I say that the member for Dunkley has taken a particularly keen interest in this issue, not only in the parliament but also in the councils of the coalition parties. I am sure that all members of this parliament have been touched on occasions by the selfless dedication of people who care for relatives and close friends who have profound disabilities. Of all of the constituency cases that I have dealt with, none has been quite so moving and touching and traumatic to discuss as the examples of ageing relatives caring for profoundly disabled adult children, desperately in need of some kind of respite and other assistance.I was therefore pleased when Senator Newman was able to announce on 4 August that the Commonwealth government would provide $150 million more for unmet need for disability services over the final two years of the Commonwealth-State Disability Agreement. I might say that this money is being made available at a time when, for very proper budgetary considerations, funds sought in some other areas of a lesser priority are not being made available, and that reflects the very high priority the government places on this particular issue. The money will be used to purchase vital in-home and respite care services for people with disabilities who have ageing carers. By assisting one of the most vulnerable types of family in this way, the  government is demonstrating its commitment to keeping families together.The House will know that the states and territories have long had primary responsibility for providing accommodation and related support services, so I want to make it clear that our commitment in this area is conditional on the states also undertaking their share of the responsibility. I want to make it very clear that this money must not be used in any way by the states to withdraw, diminish or roll back their own commitment in this area. We do not want to see any cost shifting in relation to disability services. We want the states that will soon, under the GST arrangements, be the recipients of growing revenues from the goods and services tax to shoulder their share of the burden, to do their bit, to play their part and not hide behind the excuse of blaming the Commonwealth, which is the stock state response in so many of these areas.This measure builds on a series of coalition initiatives to help those caring for a severely disabled or disadvantaged relative or loved one. For example, we provided $15.4 million to help ageing carers to look after adult children with disabilities in last year's Staying At Home package. During the last election campaign we committed $20 million to extend respite support for carers of young people with a disability and $80 million for respite support for carers of people with dementia. Many of these carers are older people themselves and both measures were confirmed in the last budget.Despite the need to keep the budget healthily in surplus, which is one of the great economic achievements of this government, may I say that we have, through our 3¼ years in government, retained an unwavering commitment to the social security safety net. We have also found resources to help those in the community who genuinely need help. Ageing parents looking after disabled adult children represent one of the greatest areas of need, of government compassion and of human understanding in our society and I am proud to lead a government that is going to play its part in meeting that need. I thank the member for  Dunkley and other colleagues for their unceasing interest in this very important issue.</DOC>

However, I want to make the general point that Australia does have a very good defence force.

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and interest in economic issues. The honourable member may have seen that today the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry released its investor confidence survey showing that investor confidence was the strongest it had ever been in Australia since the survey commenced. Mark Paterson, the Chief Executive, said:The results of the July survey of investor confidence are nothing short of extraordinary.The ANZ jobs ads were released today, showing a rise of 2.6 per cent in July, the sixth consecutive increase and the highest  level of job vacancies since January 1990. Compared with July last year, the number of job ads was up by 20.5 per cent. That is good news for Australians because it is good news on job opportunities for all Australians. The recently released Morgan and Banks job index said, `Record-breaking job market predicted for Australia.' In June, while the House was up, the labour force figures showed an increase in employment in that month of 62,400 jobs, taking the unemployment rate to 7.2 per cent, the lowest in a decade coming off the Labor Party's record of 11.2 per cent - some four per cent greater. Under the government policy of a balanced budget, low inflation, low interest rates, product reform, labour market reform and debt retirement, we have been able to create an economic environment which has survived probably the biggest downturn in our region since the Second World War.The Fortune magazine, dated 16 August 1999, stated under the headline `Down-under looks up':Once derided as the sick man of Asia, Australia is now the region's most successful economy.The Fortune  magazine quotes the Prime Minister of Singapore, Goh Chok Tong, who said:In many parts of Asia we were concentrating on fast growth but forgetting the fundamentals. Australia didn't and is winning the race.Mr Speaker, that is the change in economic policy over the last three or four years - an economy with a budget back in balance, opposed all the way by the Labor Party. They run around now and say that they are in favour of a balanced budget. When we announced we were going to balance the budget, the Leader of the Opposition with the then Leader of the Australian Democrats were addressing a riot outside Parliament House in protest against balanced budgets. When we said that we were going to lock in a new monetary policy, the Labor Party said they were going to sue us - they were going to take legal action to prevent it. And now, when you put in place the big reforms of the Australian economy, they want to run around and say, `Oh, we were always in favour of that too.'It is like tax reform. Let everybody remember where the Labor Party stood on tax reform. The Labor Party stood for the 1930s wholesale sales tax. Modernity and the Labor Party - back to the days of Scullin! What have we heard from Labor since it has been in opposition? Not one policy, not one economic speech, not one tax modernisation and not one piece of relevance in relation to the economic debate. The Leader of the Opposition went on the Sunday program to talk about a policy which had been discussed at a Labor Party backbench seminar which he did not attend. As Malcolm Farr wrote on 26 July:If Kim Beazley had sat through Labor's two-day seminar on unemployment, he would have heard where policy within his own party was heading.This is somebody who did not even sit through the seminar and went on television and tried to justify a policy which had been dumped - and then said he was leading. He reminds me of the old Sir Humphrey Appleby-Jim Hacker conversation, when the minister said, `I am their leader; I must follow them.' And there he was, down there at the backbench seminar where all of the ideas were being raised and dumped, and nobody remembered to tell the Leader of the Opposition. This is no excuse for a policy. The Labor Party has marginalised itself because it cannot take decisions, it cannot stand for anything, it has no policy and it has no leadership.</DOC>

However, I believe that the defence minister has performed with great skill, great dedication and great application. The defence minister has my total support. I happen to believe that the defence minister has brought a new vigour and rigour to the administration of that portfolio. - May I resume my defence of the minister, Mr Speaker, and may I say that I think he has brought very great application -  - May I say that I think the defence minister has done a first-class job. The defence minister has sought to implement, as all defence ministers ought to do, the policies of the government and to require that all sections of the bureaucracy follow him in implementing the policies of the government. I have every confidence that not only does Mr Moore have my confidence but also he has the confidence of the ADF.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. Improving the literacy and numeracy levels of young Australians is probably the single most important thing you could do to assist educationally disadvantaged young people in this country. Last year the governments of the states, the territories and the Commonwealth committed themselves for the first time to national literacy standards, to a system of comparable testing for young people and to a national literacy goal that every young person coming out of primary school should be able to read, write and spell at an adequate level.Over the last year, the states and territories, together with the Commonwealth, have been developing a regime of comparable testing against the benchmark standards, and I am very pleased to be able to inform the House that since the beginning of last month the states and territories have been engaged in assessments of young people in years 3 and 5 against the national literacy benchmarks. Tasmania conducted its assessments last month; Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia are conducting their assessments this month; Western Australia and the Northern Territory will conduct their assessments later this month; and the Australian Capital Territory will conclude its assessments in September.For the first time, schoolchildren in Australia are being assessed as to whether or not they have the literacy levels they need to continue successfully with their education. Parents have a right to this information. Young people have a right to learn to read and write effectively. It is a matter of deep regret that the education unions have still not committed themselves to supporting this policy - the education unions which write the Labor Party's policy on education - and their lack of commitment doubtless explains why the Labor Party has not committed itself to the regime of national testing against the literacy and numeracy benchmarks.In Western Australia, I was very disappointed to see that the teachers union has urged all teachers to boycott this month's year 3 and year 5 literacy and numeracy tests. Indeed, the president of the Western Australian teachers  union, Mr Brian Lindberg, has called on parents to withdraw their children from the tests. This is an outrage, and it is up to the Labor Party to tell its followers - the unions who support it and the union officials who are so well represented in its ranks - that parents in Australia will not put up with this constant obstruction which undermines the standards of education of their children. Parents have a right to this information. This government has committed itself to giving parents that right, and only the Labor Party stands out, resisting what every parent has a right to know.</DOC>

 - I am happy to tell the honourable member for Boothby and all members of the House that, on 25 July, the government announced the opening of the Telstra 2 share offer. All Australians who are interested in participating in the float have been invited to pre-register by next Monday, 16 August. By pre-registering, prospective investors can be guaranteed the right to purchase 400 shares in Telstra. They may wish to purchase more than 400 shares or they may wish to purchase fewer than 400 shares but, by pre-registering, they can guarantee themselves at least this amount. They do not have to make any financial commitment by virtue of pre-registration. Further, existing Telstra shareholders are not required to pre-register.One of the objectives of the Telstra 2 share offer is to further increase the number of Australians owning shares. To achieve that goal, the government is most interested in ensuring that the Telstra 2 share offer is accessible to as many Australians as possible. Already, more than 40 per cent of our adult population invest in the stock market, and the Telstra 2 offer has the potential to increase that figure. We have taken a number of steps to ensure that the Telstra 2 share offer is available to all Australians who want to purchase shares. Firstly, some 9.6 million letters have been written to all those who are currently Telstra fixed line customers, to those who pre-registered for the first Telstra offer and did not purchase shares, and to all of the brokers' clients.In addition, anyone who wishes to pre-register can do so by using the freecall number 1800 181818, or they may pre-register on the T2 Internet site that is available to anyone who wants to obtain it. In addition to that, we intend with T2 to appoint a regional broker. That will ensure that there is further access for people living outside our capital cities. It is not just about people in the capital cities getting access to the shares, but about all who want them getting access.Australians without a good command of the English language will also be catered for. The information will be available in a number of languages, including Chinese, Greek, Italian, Vietnamese and Arabic. Other languages will be available through a translation and information service, again on a free call. The vision impaired will be able to get access to the information. Braille versions of the pre-registration letter have been sent to many Australians, and large print versions of the acknowledgment letter will be sent to those who seek that alternative format. What this demonstrates of course is that the government is keen to ensure that all those who seek to acquire shares in the Telstra 2 offer are given that opportunity in an affordable and accessible way. I encourage all to look at those opportunities and make their decisions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moreton for his question. The government recently announced the third round of Work for the Dole projects, involving some 20,000 places and assistance of some $32 million to community organisations around Australia. I am pleased to note that there were six projects in the electorate of Moreton. Work for the Dole is one of the signature policies and one of the significant successes of the Howard government, but it has been introduced and implemented in the teeth of blanket condemnation from the Australian Labor Party. The  Leader of the Opposition has described Work for the Dole as `hopeless', as `mickey mouse' and as a `disgracefully shoddy piece of public policy'. The member for Batman has described Work for the Dole as evil. It was not just bad, Mr Speaker; he said it was evil. Mr Speaker, you can imagine that I was somewhat surprised - even a little bewildered, I suppose, if the truth be known - and amazed at the brazenness of the member for Batman when he went on Meet the Press  on 25 July and said:The concept of Work for the Dole . . . is an accepted Labor way, we brought it in. The Labor Party had it, the Coalition had it.If it is true that the ALP is now supporting Work for the Dole, this would be the biggest backflip, the biggest somersault, since the conversion of the apostle Paul. If it is true, the message certainly has not got through to the Labor Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Councillor Jim Soorley, who - just two days after the member for Batman's statement - described Work for the Dole as `a disgraceful, miserable scheme that we will not support'.I think it is important for members opposite to clarify exactly where they stand. There is a very simple test of the Labor Party's sincerity on all of this. Will the ALP tell their union mates to stop sabotaging Work for the Dole projects? In particular, will the Leader of the Opposition tell the members of the Miscellaneous Workers Union - his own union - to lift their veto on Work for the Dole projects in child-care centres? I am all in favour of conversion. If there has been a genuine change of heart, I would absolutely welcome it - but not this poll driven hypocrisy. That is what it is so far.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I did read about the leaked comment in the newspapers from Major General Hartley, which I was disappointed to see. Senior officers' articles should not be appearing in newspapers. As a consequence, I was disappointed with that. There have been some shortages of medical officers in the permanent forces, but we do have a very constant supply of volunteers who do serve within the reserve forces - such as in Bougainville at the present moment. Where there is a limited demand, that has proved to be quite adequate to this time. Around the whole of the Defence Force in Australia and at all the bases I have visited, I have to say that the medical facilities are quite outstanding. At a time when we are not at war, the numbers of medical staff are adequate. For our deployments at the present moment, there is no shortage.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Dawson for her question and particularly acknowledge the tremendous support she has given to Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace. Honourable members may know that the Wallace family come from the electorate of the member for Dawson, and not only the member herself but the people of Mackay have been enormously supportive of the Wallace family through this difficult time. That has been well noted by the government and I think well noted by the rest of Australia.The answer to the honourable member's question is that the Supreme Military Court of Yugoslavia confirmed the convictions of Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace on 22 July, but  it did apply some reduction in the sentences. A formal decision has had to be served on the men, and that has had to await the translation of the decision into English. I can inform the House that that formal decision was served on Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace on Saturday, 7 August. Their lawyers are expected to lodge clemency petitions with President Milosevic today, 9 August.The Australian government has been very active and continues to be very active at this stage in trying to get President Milosevic to grant clemency to those two innocent Australians. On 3 August, I wrote to the foreign minister of Yugoslavia, Mr Jovanovic, asking him to support the clemency petitions. The government has sought further support from key figures around the international community. A little over a week ago the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, again wrote a letter to the Yugoslav government urging President Milosevic to grant clemency. Contact has been made with a large number of governments urging them to follow up with appeals for clemency, and they are doing that.To give some examples, the Greek government has been particularly helpful, and I thank my counterpart there, George Papandreou. Nelson Mandela has agreed to telephone President Milosevic again, once more seeking clemency. Figures in the United Nations system such as Mary Robinson, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and Mrs Ogata, the High Commissioner for Refugees, are doing what they can to try to encourage President Milosevic to grant clemency.Everybody knows this is an extremely difficult task. President Milosevic, for his own domestic political reasons, has so far not released Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace. We watch the domestic political environment in Yugoslavia particularly closely, bearing in mind the fact that these two innocent Australians are still incarcerated in that country. We will do everything within our power to encourage President Milosevic to grant clemency. Of course, at the end of the day we cannot force him to, but we have the weight of the international community behind us. I think  what somebody said to me the other day is a fair comment, that the international coalition we have put together to get Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace out of prison is probably the most widespread international coalition Australia has ever put together for any issue. I can assure the families and I can assure the people of Australia that we will continue with our work.</DOC>

 - Newspaper reports from which the honourable member is deriving his question - and you can rest assured I am aware of all the available information on this issue - suggesting that there is a difference between the Australian government and the government of the United States on East Timor policy and that somehow this is causing a crisis in the alliance are totally false. The Australian government and the government of the United States have worked very closely on this issue. To the best of my recollection - and I am pretty sure my recollection here is right - at no stage has it been official US government policy to push for a peacekeeping force in East Timor. Indeed, there has been extensive inter-agency consultation between officials within the United States administration on this issue. Every single person in the United States administra  tion may have had a slightly different view at any particular time but, at the end of the day, the Australian government has to operate, when dealing with the United States, on the basis of official United States policy. At no stage, to the best of my recollection, has official United States policy been to advocate a peacekeeping force and Australia to stand in the way.If I can take a moment longer, the question is based on a discussion that Dr Calvert had with Mr Roth I think in Washington some time in February when Mr Roth was not professing to speak on behalf of United States policy but expressed a personal view - which I can assure honourable members was never the view of the United States administration. Dr Calvert made it perfectly clear at that time that to rush into proposing a peacekeeping force would obviously be resisted by the Indonesian government. This is the point here. Only a child would continue to argue that we should have a peacekeeping force in East Timor at this time when the Indonesian government do not want it. You cannot do it if they do not want it, and they have made it clear all along that they do not want it.So way back in February when Dr Calvert was explaining this to Mr Roth, there is no doubt that Mr Roth and the American administration were grateful for the assistance that Dr Calvert provided, for the insight that Australia was able to provide on the issue, and for our continuing with a very successful leadership role that we have played on the East Timor issue - a role, let me hasten to remind the House, that the Labor Party for 13 years refused to play. For 13 years it did nothing about East Timor. After doing nothing for 13 years it has a cheek asking us questions about it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question and acknowledge his enormous and ongoing pursuit of the interests of the tourism industry in this country. It is probably relevant to point out at the beginning that the great advantage in further liberalising access to our airports lies in the area of tourism. It has been a rapidly growing industry and it means a lot to many areas of Australia. A huge number of Australian jobs depend upon it. All the experts tell us that, with the right approaches, we can rapidly increase tourism as an economic activity and as a provider of jobs in this country, including in rural and regional Australia where I believe that we have a backyard, as we often see it - the outback - which is a ready-made product and only needs more effective access arrangements to be made in the future to see it expand.There is no doubt that competition brings down costs and enables more options to be developed for incoming tourists. That is something the government has sought to respect in its consideration and action in relation to the Productivity Commission inquiry into our air access arrangements. I think that the recent announcement by the government, which essentially opens access to Australian airports in an extremely liberal way, with the exception of Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth, is a good thing. Freight has now been completely liberalised. This opens up all sorts of opportunities, particularly for international airports and for those airports that can handle international traffic in rural and regional areas to really go for broke. In the case of the four airports that I mentioned, it is important that we do not completely liberalise but that we use access to them as leverage to be able to gain leverage into other markets for our own airlines. The first cab off the rank was Dubai, which has now accessed considerably more liberal arrangements in time for the Olympic Games. It would be remiss of me if I did not finally point out that we have done this without destroying the cabotage arrangements out of respect for the needs of rural and regional communities and their need for air services.</DOC>

 - I am happy to tell the honourable member that I am not aware of any requests by the United States for us to participate in a peace enforcement exercise in East Timor. I have taken the opportunity, since I sit next to the Minister for Defence, to ask him whether he is aware of this great idea. He is not either. -  - Children, quieten down. It is nearly 4 o'clock. You can go home at 4 o'clock. - We are not proposing to participate in a peace enforcement exercise in East Timor, as the House knows too well. The point is that we are not proposing to go to war with Indonesia. That does not come as a surprise to anyone on this side of the House, but apparently those opposite want us to go to war with Indonesia. We are going to disappoint you because we are not going to do it.As far as I know, the statements I made on the Sunday program were absolutely based on the knowledge I had at the time and nothing has happened to enhance that knowledge. The statement put out by my department was honestly and faithfully put together by them. I am completely unaware of any proposal by the United States defence force to mount a  peace enforcement exercise in East Timor, but I will say more: there was a headline in a newspaper saying something to the effect - I do not have the headline with me - that Australia would not back the marines in going into East Timor. I never heard of a plan of the Americans to send the marines into East Timor.Anybody who understands United States policy making processes knows that to send in any kind of peacekeeping force, let alone a so-called peace enforcement force, would involve congressional consultation, and would involve a very substantial policy decision by the United States administration, following a decision by the United Nations itself that it wanted to send in some sort of peace enforcement force. The United Nations has not made that decision and the United States has not made a decision to support a peace enforcement exercise. If there were to be a security force in East Timor in phase 3 - and honourable members will, I think, by now be aware of what phase 3 is about in the East Timor process - we would obviously ourselves be happy to participate in that, if so invited. Obviously we would be and obviously we would very much welcome United States participation but, frankly, whether the United States would participate or not in that exercise I really at this stage do not know. I do not know and they have far from worked that out. So it is not quite as the honourable member presents it.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the honourable member for a very insightful question. -  - Indeed, the coalition government has a very strong focus - and perhaps the Leader of the Opposition might  like to listen - on what we are doing to encourage prevention and early intervention to support Australian families. What we want and indeed what the Prime Minister wants is stronger families -  - That will mean stronger communities and a better Australia. This is all part of the coalition's national family strategy. -  - It is a shame the opposition is not listening because they might learn something from this. Part of the government's strategy is for early intervention to address problems that happen in family life and specific policies targeted towards homelessness, drug abuse, youth suicide and public safety. It is an issue that all Australians and this chamber should have a role in, because for too long governments have tended to focus on picking up the pieces. That is an important element; however, the focus should be on prevention and early intervention, and to this end the government's family relationship program, particularly in education, training and post-marital counselling -  -  - I think it is an important issue that the opposition should be listening to, because it is in the area of relationships, particularly in pre- and post-marriage counselling, that we intend to give 100,000 people right across Australia, including in rural and remote Australia, encouragement to keep relationships together. Part of that is our partnership against domestic violence program. The government has allocated $50 million to prevent domestic violence. Likewise, in the area of the youth homeless pilot program, which I would hope the opposition would also endorse, the focus is to try and keep families together. -  - In the area of child abuse - and you should be listening to this -  we have actually allocated $12 million to help parents of neglected children in their parenting role. -  - I am glad to see there is so much interjection. You must be thoroughly taking this in. In the area of drug abuse, there is an extra $516 million, and for youth suicide $57 million - an extra $8 million to fight youth suicide -  -  - You should be joining the government in these initiatives. And most importantly, there is about $1 billion for the SAAP agreement to help people in supported accommodation. This is all part of what the government is doing on the macro scale, which we have done well: that is, we have lower interest rates, lower inflation and greater employment. This all adds to the great tax package that we have put in place which means $11.9 billion in tax cuts and an extra $2.5 billion in additional family assistance. So what we are on about, and particularly what I will be on about in this portfolio, is building stronger families and stronger communities.</DOC>

 - The question that won the overwhelming support, by a vote of something like 140 to eight last night, of both sides of the parliament - and I think you even voted for it in the end - is the question which will go to the Australian people in November. It is a balanced question. It is a fair question. The proposition that you should use the adjective `Australian' in relation to the President without acknowledging the reality that it is inconceivable that any Governor-General of this country would now be other than an Australian is inconceivable.Every Governor-General of Australia since Casey was appointed in 1965 has been an Australian. It is inconceivable that the Governor-General of this country would be other than an Australian. And by a law enacted by the Whitlam Labor government, the Queen was designated as Queen of Australia. In those circumstances, in the view of the government it was inappropriate, as I described it yesterday, to be selectively patriotic or nationalistic to use the word `Australian' in relation to the President but to omit the reality that the Governor-General will always be an Australian. That is the reason why the adjective was taken out.The government stands by the question. It has no intention of altering its position. And this parliament passed that by a vote of 140 to eight - an unprecedented measure of support, I might say, in the 3½ years that the government has been in power - and we have no intention of altering the question. That is the question which I want to see go to the Australian people on 6 November.</DOC>

 - We on the government side of the House are interested in more than one job. We are interested in generating - as we have over the last 3½ years - tens of thousands of jobs for the Australian community. I am very proud of the fact, as is every man and woman on the government side of this chamber, that in the time that the government has been in office we have generated more than 400,000 jobs in the Australian community. We have done this in the face of fierce opposition from the Australian Labor Party in relation to virtually every measure we have taken in order to reduce unemployment in Australia.The Labor Party set about stopping us getting the economy right. The Labor Party tried to stop us reducing the deficit and creating a surplus. That has been one of the foundation stones of lower interest rates. The Labor Party opposed the family tax initiative. The Labor Party opposed taxation reform. The Labor Party opposed labour market reform. The Labor Party has sniped away at competition policy. The Labor Party has tried, in short, to sabotage every attempt that this government has made in order to reduce unemployment. Yet despite all that opposition we have succeeded in getting the lowest unemployment rate in Australia for 10 years. We also have the lowest level of youth unemployment, I believe, for the last 20 years in terms of those seeking full-time work.The Labor Party has opposed our further attempts to protect the jobs of the young. The Labor Party refuses to support our measures in order to protect the jobs of young Australians. The Labor Party has opposed our attempts to reform further the unfair dismissal laws. The Labor Party, in summary, is an anti jobs party; the Labor Party is a pro high unemployment party. It not only demonstrated that in government but demonstrated it in opposition. I want to say to those who sit opposite and to the Australian people that, unless and until the Labor Party reverses its hostile attitude to the policies of the government designed to generate jobs in the Australian community, it will continue to be seen as irrelevant to the employment debate in Australia.It is no accident that this country has lower unemployment now than for a period of 10 years. It is no accident that we are seen by the rest of the world as the economic strongman of Asia. It is no accident that our economy is the strongest it has been for more than three decades. All of that has been achieved in the face of a policy of obstruction and a policy of trying to defeat, delay and frustrate all the policies of the government which are designed to help the wellbeing of the Australian people. Despite the worst attempts of the Labor Party, we have succeeded. We have the economy on an even keel. The economy is growing strongly, jobs are being generated and there is a measure of economic optimism in Australia that nobody has seen for more than 30 years.</DOC>

 - I note that the honourable member for Melbourne last evening put out a press release relating to an issue concerning  Credit Suisse First Boston and the trading of one of their arms in Japan. That particular issue has been reported in Japan and locally over the past several months. There is nothing new about that investigation; it has been the subject of some reporting in the media for some considerable time. Credit Suisse First Boston informed the government of investigations by the Japanese Financial Supervisory Agency into certain members of their firm in Tokyo at the time that the FSA commenced inspections, and they have continued to be cooperative and diligent in keeping the government informed throughout. As I said, it has been reported frequently in Japanese and international media during that investigation.In anticipation of the release of the findings, several weeks ago the government, as is appropriate, appointed former Chief Judge of the Commercial Division of the New South Wales Supreme Court Andrew Rogers QC as a probity adviser to review the findings of the FSA and other relevant material for any implications for the Telstra 2 share offer. I note that the member for Melbourne in the course of making some comments last evening continued to make some disparaging remarks about Andrew Rogers. You know there isn't an issue when they attack the messenger. - I will continue in respect of the person that the honourable member for Melbourne asked me about, who was investigating as a probity adviser to the government. Whilst attacking this person, the honourable member for Melbourne failed to disclose that the New South Wales government only last year reappointed Andrew Rogers QC to the New South Wales Treasury Corporation. The New South Wales Labor government considers that person to be a fit and proper person, and he is entirely appropriate in this particular issue.The government expects a report from Mr Rogers in the near future, and it will not determine its views until it has that report. The government and I are committed to conducting the Telstra 2 share offer to the highest standard of probity and integrity, and we will not act without careful and mature consideration of the facts. I am not going to go to the knee-jerk reactions of the honourable member for Melbourne coming to simplistic conclusions on this particular issue about an incident in Japan. No advisers have been appointed for the Asia tranche at this time, and this particular issue, as I said, seems to be based by the honourable member for Melbourne on one week-old report in a Japanese newspaper. - It is confidential.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Makin for her question. Unemployment is one of the most critical issues facing the nation. I should pay tribute to the member because she has a well-deserved reputation in her electorate for the fact that she is a fighter for people who are unemployed, whether they are young people, mature aged or otherwise.There is no doubt that we have been pleased to see the success that we have seen in the last three years, with something like 470,000 jobs created since March 1996, compared to the 400,000 jobs that Labor destroyed when they were in office. How have we done this? We have done it by consistently advocating and implementing policies that genuinely make a difference, whether it is getting the budget back in order, further workplace relations reforms, getting interest rates down or helping small business. These are the practical things that have to be done if we are to create more jobs.There is no doubt that, whilst 470,000 jobs is a good number in the time that we have been in government, this government is absolutely committed to its absolute priority to do more, to do better, to see more jobs created in the Australian community. There is no question also that in pursuit of that the government has a set of clear policies and reforms which we are working on seeking the endorsement of the parliament for. So obviously I was pretty interested when I heard that the Leader of the Opposition was finally going to make a statement about what Labor's policy might be on employment. We were delighted that he cancelled his overseas trip so that he could get around the country and formulate some real policies after the three years of vacuum that we have had so far from him.But I have to say that my hopes were a bit dashed by his entry into the debate. He said in his speech, `Work incentives are approved' - this is what he wanted to ensure - `without cutting social security'. That  is a bit of an interesting statement, because the day before he had actually put out a discussion paper that proposed cutting the dole for people who are unemployed, which was a consequence of his own policy, which for some reason he had barely seemed to understand. In fact, he was cutting social security benefits. When this policy was analysed during his own seminar, the shadow minister for employment by the Sunday was basically dumping it. That is an interesting development in itself.What was more surprising was that the Labor Party held a seminar on unemployment, and the reason the Leader of the Opposition did not know that his policy proposal had been dumped by the rest of his frontbench was that he would not bother to turn up to his own seminar on unemployment. I do not know what he was doing, but he should have at least been taking an interest in the development of policy on his own side. More incredibly, after the whole idea had been dumped by the member for Batman, three days after this embarrassing episode, three days after it had been dumped by the shadow minister, the Leader of the Opposition was telling Carolyn Tucker of 4QR, `One of the ideas we are looking at is that part of your dole payment might be used as a job subsidy.' This is a proposition which has been advanced by the Labor Party leader and dumped by his own side, and he is still advocating that proposal. - The simple point is that here we have the opposition claiming to develop policy and the Leader of the Opposition does not even turn up to his own seminar. He has now had the policy dumped by his spokesman and three days later he is back advocating it.  I think the Australian public are entitled to know what exactly is the Labor Party's policy. The only concrete proposal that we actually had from the Leader of the Opposition was - wait for it - that he is going to have another discussion paper, another policy release in September. This is simply not good enough. The Leader of the Opposition is blaming the unemployed. The shadow minister is blaming employers. In both respects here we have Labor's hereditary peers with no idea of the circumstances facing unemployed people and no idea of what to actually do to create employment, using their numbers. And we have got another hereditary peer - No. 11 now; 11 hereditary peers - in the Senate. And what has been their approach so far to creating jobs? The one thing you have done is block every sensible proposal to actually create jobs. It is time you developed a policy.</DOC>

 - Australia today is engaged in a quite remarkable national effort to finally address the literacy problem that was left by the Labor Party after 13 years. When this government came to office, 30 per cent of young Australians could not read, write and spell at a satisfactory level. The Labor Party had nothing to say about that in office and it has nothing to say about it now. It is very  interesting that, in the program that the shadow minister refers to, a program that went for some 45 minutes to an hour, there was not a single comment on that program on literacy from the Labor Party. The reason that there was not a comment is that there is nothing that the Labor Party has to say about literacy. It has no literacy policy whatever. - The Commonwealth is engaged with the states at the moment in the implementation of the National Literacy Plan. All the states and territories have agreed to the national literacy benchmark. All the states and territories have agreed that they will assess, at the earliest possible moment, every child coming into school to see what their literacy needs are and, as a result of the Commonwealth leadership of the National Literacy Plan, this is now happening in every state and territory of Australia. Every state and territory of Australia has now committed itself to a process whereby every child in years 3 and 5 will be assessed to see what their literacy standard is against the national literacy benchmark. There was nothing at all like this attempted throughout the entire period of the Labor government.All the states and territories are now engaged in a process of assessing the preliminary results of the literacy tests given last year. The reading results were identified by an independent committee as being comparable between the states and territories, and that process is now proceeding. Every state and territory has committed itself to a process whereby every child is being assessed, including the Labor government in Queensland and the Labor government in New South Wales.  All this is within the National Literacy Plan that the Commonwealth has established.This government is determined that every child in Australia will have the opportunity to read, write and spell at an adequate level. We could not put up with the situation that we found when the Labor Party left office. If the member for Dobell were less interested in irrelevant rhetoric and more aware of what is actually happening on the ground and more aware of the concerns of parents, he would not ask such foolish and frivolous questions.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. The good news is that on 8 July this year the new tax system was proclaimed as legislation and 21 days later, on 29 July, Labor's wholesale sales taxes started to fall. The government is able to bring down Labor's wholesale sales tax rate of 32 per cent to 22 per cent and, as a consequence, we have already had, as a down payment on the new tax system, price reductions in relation to items like television sets, video players, stereos and cameras. Can I say, from this side of the House, how good it is to see Labor's wholesale sales taxes coming down and being abolished. We know that the Labor Party fought so hard for wholesale sales taxes but were unable to keep them.Members of the House know that I am an avid reader of regional and provincial newspapers. When I was reading the Queensland Times at Ipswich recently, I came across a story which quoted the Ipswich RT Edwards Store Manager, Brian McNamara, saying this:I think it's a tremendous thing. It's great for the general public in terms of prices being more reasonable. It will boost businesses.From the Northern Territory News , members of the House will be interested to know this:Oasis Betta Electrical store, at Palmerston, owner Joe Fernandes said yesterday: 'We have experienced an extremely busy day. 'Our most popular items have been rear projection television - we sold three in the morning - and hi-fi systems.'The West Australian , under the heading `Stores celebrate as tax cuts spur buyers', says:Retravision WA chairman Geoff Kemp said the stores' biggest problem now was keeping up stocks. -  - This is Mr Geoff Kemp. -  - He is no relation. He is very literate, is Mr Geoff Kemp. He said:The floodgates have well and truly opened and we aren't complaining. We've already done 50 per cent more than what we would normally do on a good Thursday.The Sunday Mail  in South Australia said:GST sparks sales boom.The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, charged with ensuring that price reductions are passed on to consumers, was active in ensuring that the first price cut from Labor's wholesale sales taxes was passed on. It found that 98 per cent of retail outlets had passed on tax gains to consumers. Five retailers who were found not to have done so are being followed up by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. There is a national inquiry telephone line to the ACCC which all Australians can ring if they believe there is evidence that wholesale sales tax cuts are not being passed on to consumers. I encourage Australians to do that. In the lead-up to the new tax system, those businesses that do not pass on proper tax cuts to consumers in price falls will be liable to penalties with fines up to $10 million.This of course is the tax cut which Labor opposed. Presumably, it is now still their policy to reintroduce 32 per cent wholesale sales taxes. - It has to be, because they are committed to wholesale sales tax - `a modern tax', according to ALP parlance; the tax that Labor fought so hard to defend. That is their policy. If they had any honesty, presumably they would announce when they would reintroduce the 32 per cent wholesale  sales tax and on what items. We have had this whole false argument from the Australian Labor Party over the last year or so that they were only against taxes; they never actually had the honesty to tell you what they were really for. What they were always for was wholesale sales tax - the modern tax which is practised in Swaziland, Botswana and Ghana, and represents ALP thinking.The ALP, led by such progressive thought leaders as the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, stands for probably the most outdated, outmoded tax system in the world. It would be hard to think of a less progressive political force in relation to tax reform. Consumers know that to build a future for Australia we have to build a new tax system. They are beginning to see the benefit. This is the kind of reform which this government stands for, and we will continue to deliver it.</DOC>

 - The first part of the question went to the heart of the answer that I gave last time. There is nothing misleading or in any way suspicious nor are there any points to be made from that answer. It was an honest one at the time. I am aware of a report floating around that seems to have emanated from an interview on 3AW. I have to say that no announcement has been made, no public announcement has been issued and there is  nothing further to add. I do not know where that report came from.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. This government is particularly concerned about the challenges facing rural and regional Australia and about job opportunities for people who live outside our major urban areas at a time of enormous change. I believe that the efforts we are putting into improving the range of services available for people in country areas will bring real benefits to country people.Included in those initiatives are the transaction centres, that we promised during the last election with a funding envelope of some $70 million, and the objective of setting up such centres in several hundred small communities across Australia. We believe that the centres will make it easier for people to do business in country areas. It will mean they will have access to the services they need to keep doing business where they are rather than facing pressure to relocate to bigger centres or, worst of all, out of the bush altogether.A few days ago we announced that in fact the first 22 communities to see rural transaction centres would now proceed. Seven communities are funded to go ahead straightaway to open up rural transaction centres. They are Eugowra in New South Wales, which is in the seat of the member for Calare; Urana in New South Wales in the seat of the member for Farrer - the middle bencher; Aramac in Queensland, in Capricornia; Dirranbandi in Queensland, and that is in Maranoa; St Marys in Tasmania in the seat of Lyons; Welshpool in Victoria in the electorate of Gippsland, and Gresford, which is in Paterson. There are a number of others - 15 or so - that are preparing business plans, and  they will shortly see rural transaction centres as well.I must say the reaction has been absolutely terrific. The Border Mail commented on 23 July:Urana, one of many small rural and Riverina communities battling a loss of basic facilities, now has a much brighter future.The Eugowra Promotion and Progress Association has written to me, saying:The community are delighted with the wonderful news that the federal government is to fund a rural transaction centre in Eugowra. Following the closure of Westpac Bank and National Australia Bank and the loss of other services in Eugowra, residents can now eagerly look forward to financial services again being provided through the rural transaction centre to be operating in our small rural town.The other proposed services to be provided, for example Centrelink and Medicare, will also be most welcome. Our community and the Progress Association are most grateful to the federal government for making the funding available to set up the facilities of much needed rural transaction centres in places like Eugowra.I think it ought to be recognised that quality of life issues such as access to decent health and education, and services of the sort that we are putting back with these initiatives, make a real difference in people's lives and in particular can influence them to remain living in, producing in and benefiting the nation in many far-flung rural, regional and remote communities.I believe that these very worthwhile initiatives make doing business in country areas much easier and much more advantageous. I think that over time our approach will increasingly mean that the benefits of a rural life will be seen for the attractive options that they do present.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I make the initial remark that I would be very reluctant indeed to take his data for granted. To assume that it was accurate I think in the first instance would be a very real mistake. The first point that has to be made is that world crude oil prices have been increasing rapidly in recent times after a period when they reached, in real terms and in historic terms, extremely low levels - the lowest levels for more than two decades. The price of the international benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, has risen from a low of a little over $11 in mid-February to well over $US20 at the beginning of August. That is an increase of more than 75 per cent.It is regrettable because we would all like to see fuel prices continue at those very low and attractive levels - probably in real terms the lowest they have ever been in recent months. No-one would like to see that more than I would, but we have to live in the real world. The fact of the matter is that, rightly, we price our oil at world levels in this country. It would be very unwise of us to pursue any other policy. As usual, Labor have attempted to blame us for that. I have seen one or two other people attempting to blame us for that as well. That is irrelevant; I think it is political opportunism and ought to be exposed for the dishonesty that it is.I cannot help but close on this observation. We are the team in government that are doing  something about the extraordinary levels of taxation on transport fuel in this country. They are the people who want to oppose it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question. The quality of Australia's science and research is one of our great comparative advantages in the global economy that is growing up at the present time. We cannot take that leadership and that outstanding quality for granted. One of the major purposes of the green paper on university research which the government issued was to put in place a funding framework for university research which will secure to Australian research environments the best and brightest of Australia's young researchers here in Australia and will make sure that the bright ideas that come out of Australian research will be commercialised effectively here in Australia.I am pleased to say that the paper has been recognised as a very important initiative by many of the leading people in Australian research. Professor Vicki Sara, the Chair of the Australian Research Council, said:Taken together, the proposals in the discussion paper allow us to build a world's best practice research funding system.The Chief Scientist, Dr Robin Batterham, said:It is vital that we have a science and technology base that emphasises excellence, well-rounded training and the linkages across institutions and to end users. Dr Kemp's paper addresses all these issues and in my opinion makes some most appropriate changes to the existing system.Tim Besley, the President of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, said:That the discussion paper's urging of universities to concentrate their resources in areas seen to be of future importance is very timely.Professor Brian Anderson, President of the Australian Academy of Science, said:The paper is a determined effort to put Australia's higher education research on a sounder footing.I was very pleased to see the comment from Professor Barry Cunningham, the Vice-Chancellor of Southern Cross University, who wrote to me saying:My preliminary reading indicated that it contains many appropriate and welcome options for consideration. Indeed, your statement that the paper offers a particular opportunity for regional universities seems to be very true.The government's paper has been exceedingly well received within the science community. The government is listening to the discussion and comment on this green paper, which of course contrasts with the complete policy vacuum that exists on the other side of the House. There is no Labor Party policy for university research. The Labor Party's only proposal during the last election campaign was to cut research funding. By contrast, the government has put forward a positive set of proposals for Australian research to make sure that the best and brightest young Australians can find research environments here in Australia which will attract them back to this country, and that Australian science is conducted in an entrepreneurial climate which will make sure that the best ideas are effectively commercialised. This government has a policy; the Labor Party does not.</DOC>

 - First of all, this matter was not raised as you put it with the Australian government; it certainly was not raised with me. Secondly, it is true, as the Labor Party claim, that the cable, which you have apparently got hold of and which reports this conversation, was one of a number of cables that were directed to me. Honourable members might like to know that my department receives something like 186,000 cables every year, which is quite a lot, and 100,000 of them are directed to me. It will come as no surprise that no minister could read 100,000 cables - although I note that you can always tell when the member for Kingsford-Smith is reading, because his mouth is moving. -  - On the question of whether I misled the House, I draw the attention of the House to a press release which was issued today by the Embassy of the United States of America. The first sentence of this press release, which I will table, reads:Media reports that the United States has plans to send U.S. troops to East Timor to maintain order in that territory are incorrect. The United States has no plans to send U.S. forces to East Timor, independently of the U.N., to act as peacekeepers or peace enforcers.What is more, as it happened and by coincidence, the Australian Ambassador to the United States, the redoubtable Andrew Peacock, met yesterday with Stanley Roth, the Assistant Secretary of State, who is responsible for Asia-Pacific affairs. This is what Stanley Roth said of the allegations - and all this blather we get from the opposition - that Australia and the United States have fallen out on the issue of East Timor:These allegations are utterly irritating, because there are no policy differences between us. The United States and Australia could not be working closer on the issue.The point is this: the Labor Party has a guilty conscience on East Timor. You know you did East Timor wrong for 13 years. What really gets in your craw is the fact that this government is working hard to resolve this issue in concert with the United Nations and in concert with our friends such as the United States. The member for Kingsford-Smith, with his puerile behaviour, has of course completely alienated Jakarta. They will not have too much to do with the member for Kingsford-Smith anymore, and apparently he is beginning to irritate Washington as well. And that is not a bad effort for an opposition spokesman for foreign affairs. I think it is about time the Leader of the Opposition found somebody intelligent to do the job.</DOC>

 - I thank the regional member for Parramatta, who is such a strong advocate of the interests of regional and rural Australia. On 29 June this year, the Senate at last passed TLAB2, a bill that included in it a provision to abolish interest withholding tax on corporate bonds. This has been an enormous success in Australian financial markets. I would like to quote from a report by Salomon Smith Barney, one of the largest investment banks in the world. It has a headline `Interest withholding tax gone - a new global era dawns!' It says:Removal of Australia's interest withholding tax is a major fillip for Australia's corporate bond market, and moves it closer to becoming more integrated into global capital markets. Removal is a major step toward a larger, deeper, more liquid domestic capital market. Up to a 50-fold increase in investor audience is possible . . . It goes on to say:Average spread reduction resulting from the . . . removal may range between 5-10 basis points, based on higher liquidity and lower transaction costs.What does this mean for borrowers in Australian markets and particularly small and medium sized businesses? It means up to a 0.1 per cent reduction in the cost of loans. And that goes further, because if we create greater liquidity in the corporate bond market it means more money coming into Australia that can be lent at a cheaper rate to busines  ses, to people borrowing for home mortgages and, particularly, to small business. The bigger the corporate bond market in Australia, the cheaper it is for Australians to build businesses, and that is good news for Australia.That is a direct result of our tax changes - the tax changes which the Labor Party delayed for so long. Only at the last minute did they agree to pass the bill through the Senate. The impact is immediate, with up to $11 billion in issuance coming under the new regime and billions of more dollars coming on to the market immediately. In fact, Morgan Stanley has only recently - for the first time - entered the Australian corporate bond market with a $1 billion issuance. That is good news for Australian investors. And, best of all, it is good news for the battlers of Australia.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I am actually the minister responsible for this area. - Obviously the opposition were not listening. In answer to the question, we do not necessarily take for granted the figures that are issued as evidence from the other side of the House. We learnt that a long time ago. As the Minister for Defence said yesterday, we are reviewing the  FBT reporting legislation to take into account the unique circumstances of our Australian Defence Force personnel and the circumstances under which they serve. For the benefit of those on the other side of the House, who are very slow to learn, for government benefits or payments like child support, there should be no inequitable treatment for Defence families due to their geographic location.The review will include considering how the reporting requirements apply to housing assistance provided to Defence personnel and certainly taking into account that, as military personnel, they must serve wherever the government demands. They are subject to frequent and compulsory moves by the Defence operational needs, which is very much part of our combat capability and our readiness to defend Australia and our interests. The other fact that will be taken into consideration is that there is substantial variation in the rents across this country. I hope that the opposition have listened to what we have had to say and what the Minister for Defence said yesterday.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question. I know how committed she is to giving all families in her electorate the right to choose their school. As announced in the budget, from 2001 non-government schools will be funded according to a measure of the socioeconomic status or level of their school communities. This is a much fairer system for funding non-government schools, which takes fully into account the capacity of school communities to pay. It is based on a process which links the addresses of students to collectors districts as identified by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It is schools like the Warburton Christian School in the electorate of the member for McEwen which stand to gain from this model.  It is perhaps worth making the point again that no school will lose as a result of this funding system.The member for McEwen has drawn my attention to a letter that she has received from the Warburton Christian School. I am delighted that the school acknowledges that the SES funding model will `enhance the choice of working class families'. The principal of the school, Mr Mike Dye, went on to say:We wish to acknowledge your commitment towards the delivery of greater fairness and equity in funding in the non-government sector and for working families in particular.Mr Dye went on to say that this new funding system will enable schools like his to better serve their community. This funding system that the government is establishing is in direct contrast to the Labor Party's attitude to school choice for working class families. The Labor Party's new schools policy was biased very strongly against the capacity of low income families to choose their school. It is only this government which has opened up the opportunities for every member of the Australian community to exercise a realistic choice of school.The crux of the matter is that this government is committed to the strongest equity agenda that any government has pursued in education for a very long time. We are not only committed to getting every young Australian who can learn to read and write up to a satisfactory literacy level but also determined to give Australian families the right to choose their school so they can get the best possible education for their children.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. Although the Labor Party jests about our efforts concerning trade, it is a very important matter, particularly for rural and regional people - our primary producers - in this country. As well as continuing to pursue and exercise our rights concerning the lamb issue in the WTO and the issue of exporting our beef to Korea, we are also exercising our rights on a bilateral basis. Recently the Thai government proposed an increase of approximately 80c a kilo on carcass import licence charges on beef into Thailand. We raised the issue with the Thai government and convinced it that that was not a good idea in terms of its obligations under the international trading regime of which we are all a part. That is just one example of our continuing efforts, in both a multilateral and a bilateral way, to represent Australia's interests in exports across the world.I was pleased to report that, with the help of Austrade, the Western Australian based Chiefton Management company has signed a $77 million contract to develop an industrial park on the outskirts of Mozambique's capital Maputo. This Western Australian company is investing overseas and bringing dollars back into Australia. The first stage of this park, as I say, is worth $77 million. It includes the site for an aluminium smelter that will be taking alumina from Western Australia, which again is important for Australia's exporters.It was a pleasure, in the early stages of my appointment as trade minister, to help facilitate exports for a citrus grower in my electorate - not yours, Mr Speaker! At the beginning of this week he was exporting 11 tonnes of cumquats to Hong Kong. I congratulate David and Annie Morton on their efforts in getting into that international marketplace. As a  government representing Australia's exporters, we will continue our efforts in those multilateral forums as well as on a bilateral basis. We will stand up for Australia's export industries across the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Parkes for his question. Australia was of course dismayed by the decision of the  United States to place tariffs and quotas on the importation of lamb into the US. We believe that decision was not soundly based. Australian lamb producers, in cooperation with their New Zealand colleagues, had developed a significant new market and had developed for themselves, without any kind of government subsidies or assistance, a niche in the US market which was providing good returns to Australian lamb producers but also offering a superior product on the US market.The Australian government has been forthright in objecting to this action at the very highest level - Prime Minister to President. We are following through with this process through the World Trade Organisation consultative process. We are seeking a ruling from the World Trade Organisation against the US action, but we cannot stand by and wait for the World Trade Organisation to respond. It is important that the Australian place in the US market be protected and it is important that we put in place the sorts of mechanisms that are necessary to support Australian exporters to the US so that they can remain commercially viable and intact when the tariff regime ends in 2002.In negotiation with the industry, we have agreed upon the distribution of the quota. Some 16,300 tonnes of quota was distributed on 23 July, leaving around 800 tonnes of this year's allocation to be provided to new entrants or in special circumstances. In addition, the government has announced that it will be paying half the transaction levy applying to lamb sales in Australia. We are introducing a grant based program along the lines of the national pork industry scheme to help with market development and other upgrading in the Australian lamb industry. A lamb industry development advisory committee will also be overseeing this expenditure and supervising the quota arrangements.These sorts of measures will help the Australian producer through this period, but that will not stop the Australian government from vigorously pursuing the illegitimate trade barriers that the US are placing in this regard. New South Wales farmers are currently protesting outside the US Embassy in Canberra. A large number of members on the  government side, including the member for Parkes, joined them today in demonstrating our strongest opposition to the US decision. I call on the US government, even at this late stage, to review their decision and to make a decision that is responsible for any country that wants to be a leader in developing fairer trade around the world.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Wannon for his interest in women's sport. I know he has some outstanding female sportswomen in his electorate. This week, we have seen Cathy Freeman win the 400 metres in Britain, we have seen three Australian golfers - Mardi Lunn, Jan Stephenson and Rachel Hetherington - clean up in the US golf event in Massachusetts, we have seen the trifecta occur in the triathlon world cup with Loretta Harrop, Tracey Hargraves and Rina Hill, and we have seen our junior water polo women's team win the world championships for the first time. And that is not to mention some junior female rowers in my electorate who are doing exceptionally well at the world cup. Many of these athletes have benefited directly from the government's sports programs such as the Australian Institute of Sport and the development of high performance females in sports such as hockey, rowing and netball.But our programs are not just about high performance. We are really about looking at increasing the involvement of women in sport, their achievements and the recognition of women in sport. We have taken a leadership role in enhancing the opportunities of females of all ages to participate in physical activity through the Active Australia program. We see two key areas where females drop their participation in sport: post school and post childbirth. So we are encouraging females to stay active throughout life, especially after childbirth - and I will be participating in the City to Surf next weekend. We have also  implemented a harassment-free sport strategy to make sport more welcoming, more safe and more encouraging for females. We have introduced a mentor program to give females some encouragement, support, advice and inspiration to achieve their sporting goals. Finally, we are developing a strategy to celebrate sport in the year 2000, which is the centenary of the participation of females in the Olympic Games.</DOC>

I thought that was a fairly regular habit, and that is the general stance that I bring to these things. I am satisfied that the procedures that were fol  lowed by the government in relation to these matters were appropriate.I note, incidentally, that there has been some sort of reference to the fact that there are a lot of projects that went to marginal seats on the coalition side. It so happens that, before the 1998 election, we held a lot of marginal seats by dint of the verdict in 1996. I remain satisfied that the correct procedures have been followed. If there is anything I need to add to what I have said I will do so in an appropriate way.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. As honourable members would know, during the year to the end of the March quarter this year the Australian economy grew at 4.8 per cent, one of the highest growth rates of any developed country in the world and the highest growth rate in the Asia-Pacific region. Yesterday, the National Australia Bank monthly survey showed that business conditions strengthened further to reach the highest level since the monthly survey began in 1997. Notwithstanding that, during 1999-2000 we would expect some slowdown on a 4.8 per cent growth rate, more to levels we have seen in the United States - in the threes rather than in the fours. However, we expect that as the world economy picks up there will be a pick-up in the first part of calendar year 2000, that is, the second part of the financial year.Following the very strong growth in the last two years, the government expects that consumption growth will remain solid in 1999-2000, which will be supported by growing employment, incomes, wealth and low interest rates. We believe that the weak international environment over 1997-98 will have some effect on business investment. Investment is expected to ease somewhat in 1999-2000. This comes after six years of strong growth  which has carried business investment as a share of GDP to around historical highs.The good news for the Australian economy after performing so strongly during such weak world growth - in particular, weak growth in the Asia-Pacific region - is that as growth picks up during 2000 and into 2001 that will give strong impetus to exports. Export growth will contribute to Australian growth during 2000-01. By having an open economy with the capacity to adjust, by having a low inflation rate and a low interest rate, by having a budget in balance, by having a debt reduction strategy, by having improvements in the labour market and by having increased competition in the product market, the Australian economy has managed to remain flexible and withstand probably its biggest external shock since the Second World War, rivalled only by the oil price shocks of the 1970s, something that Australia was unable to withstand at that time. These are the results of strong and good policy promoting a flexible and open economy. While Australia maintains a flexible and open economy together with tax reform we can build an even stronger economy which will take advantage of a pick-up in world prospects in 2000-01 with increasing job opportunities for Australians.The next review of the government's growth forecasts will be done in the mid-year review. The government puts out only two growth forecasts, one at budget time and one in the mid-year review. I expect that the mid-year review may be brought forward a little this year. We would expect that the mid-year review would be around November, possibly December. The government will not be reviewing its growth forecasts until that time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am very pleased to inform the House that, having undertaken to reform the waterfront as part of its overall strategy to improve the performance of the Australian economy and jobs, we are indeed achieving some very real and ongoing results. It ought to be stated at the outset that the waterfront is a critical component of the Australian economy. Waterfront performance  can act as an accelerator of economic growth or as a brake. The reality is that for 13 years the brake was firmly on. Higher waterfront productivity is reflected in improved export performance, in reduced costs for imports and in the boosting of national productivity and competitiveness. It is also reflected in a stronger employment outlook for Australia. It means jobs in our traditional export industries in rural and regional Australia, as well as in our urban centres. It also means jobs in those industries that are dependent on imports.I am very pleased to say that the momentum of reform is being well and truly maintained. The implementation of new workplace agreements by stevedores is almost finished. P&amp;O Ports has concluded agreements at all of their container terminal sites and most regional ports. The associated restructuring process has resulted in over 500 voluntary redundancies to date. The total of stevedoring redundancies is now well over 1,400. More than $170 million has been paid out by MIFCo, the Maritime Industry Finance Co.We can now expect real improvement in productivity after the P&amp;O reforms are bedded down. It is certainly my expectation that the competitive pressures between P&amp;O and Patrick, in particular, will grow rapidly and that that will deliver increasing benefits to stevedoring customers. The reality of all of this is that, under this can-do government, the reputation of the Australian waterfront as unreliable and expensive is being replaced by one of productivity and reliability. I have recently had that confirmed in conversations that I have had with Australian and international shippers. The push by this government to capture the full benefits of waterfront reform, especially for the nation's exporters, is in stark contrast to the irresponsible actions of the Labor Party in delaying consideration of the additional $100 million required to fund stevedoring reform. All I can say is that that seems to be entirely consistent with the ALP's approach of opposing everything we seek to do that might offer benefits for the Australian economy and Australian workers.</DOC>

 - I am happy to answer the honourable member's question as the appropriate minister. The premise of the honourable member's question -  - Thank you again, Mr Speaker. The entire premise of the honourable member's question is wrong, as it is based largely, if not entirely, on an article - inaccurate, sadly - in the Sydney Morning Herald  this morning. -  - It is something of a surprise, but we will have to cope with that. The starting point of any discussion on this magnificent Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program initiative of the government is that all 60 funded projects met the guidelines for the program. -  - All of them. All funded projects met the guidelines for the projects. For the Sydney Morning Herald  and the honourable member to repeat a claim that some projects did not meet the minimum criteria is wrong. No projects that were rated  as ineligible were funded by the government. The Sydney Morning Herald , together with the honourable member, seemed to suggest that the process was in breach of the Australian National Audit Office guidelines. The approach used to determine grants was developed based on those guidelines, and the reasons for the government's decisions were fully documented. Finally, there has been some suggestion by the opposition, through many, many hours of discussion and pursuit of this issue in Senate estimates, that there is some degree of political bias in the process. Again, this is wrong. Of the 60 successful projects, 64 per cent were located in the 62 per cent of electorates held by the coalition. - Mr Speaker, I am happy to repeat my earlier answer for the Leader of the Opposition. The process for determining the grants was developed based on the guidelines of the Australian National Audit Office. Let me finish this point, because this is on the political bias allegation of the opposition. Sixty-four per cent of successful  grants were to the 62 per cent of electorates held by the opposition, and 30 per cent of successful grants were in the 33 per cent of seats held by the Labor Party, and five grants were held in the -  - Mr Speaker, there is no doubt whatsoever that this program was much needed throughout rural and regional Australia as well as in urban Australia. It was developed, as is required, by government probity measures and the opposition, together with the Sydney Morning Herald , has failed to in any way dent the confidence of the House in that. - </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, I thank the member for McEwen for her question - her second very good question in a couple of days, may I say. The government is very committed to making sure that young people get job opportunities and that they make a successful transition from school to work. Young people are, without question, the most disadvantaged group within the labour market. By rebuilding the apprenticeship system, by getting into place proper literacy and numeracy standards, by getting businesses to work more closely with schools, the government is lifting the chances of disadvantaged young people to get jobs. We have gone on a long way in repairing the damage that was done to the job opportunities of young Australians by the Labor Party by their virtual destruction of the national apprenticeship system and by the  incredibly high rates of youth unemployment over which the Leader of the Opposition presided when he was in office. -  - You were minister for employment, and now you sit there doing nothing - three hundred days of policy inaction, 300 days of policy silence from the Leader of the Opposition. One area where the government has put in a very considerable effort has been in encouraging schools to be proactive in helping their school leavers get jobs. This is bringing about a real change in the culture of schools. The government has recently offered contracts to over 80 projects under the very successful Jobs Pathway Program. This program is targeted to regions of high youth unemployment and focuses on making sure that young people have the skills and the knowledge to get jobs. Under these contracts, schools and brokers and agents working with schools will provide assistance over the next year to over 61,000 young people to get the skills and the knowledge they need to get jobs. These young people are in years 9, 10, 11 and 12, and this program has got tremendous support in the community from parents, from school principals and teachers, from businesses in the community and from the wider community.Mr Speaker, this government has been getting on with the policy job. While we are solving the problems that Labor left Australia, what we have on the other side of the House is a policy vacuum, total policy inaction, and not a single valuable policy statement from the Leader of the Opposition. Indeed, my thoughts were echoed by Terry McCrann in the Herald Sun on 3 August when he said:. . . Beazley just lacks the intellectual and political strength to pull Labor back to rigorous sensible policy . . . Beazley has consistently done a bunk when the going gets tough.From spending to health reform, from Wik to tax policy, he's either whimped it or been figuratively out of the room. -  - He offers no leadership. This government is putting into place the policies that are getting jobs for young Australians.</DOC>

 - Senators Hill and Alston have not and will not identify the 16 projects that the Sydney Morning Herald  refers to because this would be prejudicial to those projects, not to mention commercial in confidence. -  - You do not understand the processes at all. You are conveniently forgetting them. They would be prejudicial and a breach of some, if not all, cases of commercial in confidence, because the evaluation was only one of the sources of advice the ministers used in making their decisions. The National Council for the Centenary of Federation was another source of advice. There are other considerations. There were regional considerations and the balance between cultural and heritage.The projects were judged against a number of criteria which the honourable member asks  about. There were six and they were: significance; lasting nature; appropriateness for the Centenary of Federation; benefits to the broad community; good management capability; and partnerships in funding. Seven hundred and forty-one applications were received. The projects were evaluated by a task group made up of officers of the Department of Communications and the Arts, together with the Department of Environment and Heritage.	The task force gave each project a score out of four for each of the six criteria I have just mentioned, leading to a possible total score of 24. Specific criteria had to be met; for example, heritage projects had to comply with all relevant approvals. A number of applications were deemed to be ineligible because they did not meet the basic conditions of the program - for example, the project was a sporting facility rather than a cultural or heritage one. In addition, the National Council for the Centenary of Federation made its own evaluation. - Ministers were provided with a copy of every application, the departmental task force evaluations and the council's advice. The ministers then made their own decisions using all those sets of advice and against their own evaluations. All 60 successful projects were eligible, and I ask the Labor Party to name which were not. Which ones do they think do not deserve funding? -  - Which of the 60 projects do you believe should not have been funded? Which one do you have the courage - instead of sniping at the program and at the successful projects - to say should not have been funded? As well as taking into account the evaluations of the task force and the national council, the ministers also took into account the need to find a balance between cultural and heritage projects, a balance between each state and territory and a balance of projects in inner metropolitan, outer metropolitan and regional areas. The opposition refuses to acknowledge in their questioning that the ministers were not provided with  a list of recommended projects. They were provided with all of the information, so they could make worthwhile projects taking all these objectives into account. I challenge the Labor Party to name which of the 60 successful projects should not have been funded.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question. The member for Cowper is a great supporter of small business and I congratulate him for the work he does in Cowper. His support is obviously well appreciated by the small businesses in his electorate. Many people who work in small business understand how important this is because, if our small businesses do well, there will be more jobs in the Australian economy.	 Since March 1996 470,000 jobs have been created and a lot of those jobs have not come from the big companies or corporations; they have come from small business. That is why this government is so strongly in favour of small business. We gave them capital gains tax rollover relief, we cut interest rates and we balanced the budget. We made changes in workplace relations to reduce the number of disputes in the Australian economy, and that level of disputes is at the lowest it has been since 1913. We have been fixing up the unfair dismissal laws, because those unfair dismissal laws discourage a lot of small businesses from giving somebody a job. - We should have an exemption from unfair dismissal laws, and why don't we? Because all these ex-trade union officials sitting on the other side do what the  unions tell them. They are not interested in small business and that is costing a lot of Australians a job.I was pretty interested when the Leader of the Opposition announced that he was going to have a policy. Would you believe it? It is a big statement that he is even going to have a policy, so we were interested. He pulled out a discussion paper. I read the discussion paper. It did mention small business - I will give him that. In the discussion paper he had a bullet point and he had 27 words on small business under the heading `Factors affecting unemployment'. He came up with a startling observation: if a policy was good for small business, that would help to create jobs. So he had a 27-word acknowledgment of small business. When he said he was going to have a policy, I did not think he could have meant that it would be in the discussion paper, because you would not have a 27-word policy, would you? I thought, `Well, it must be in the speech tomorrow.' So we waited until the speech came down the fax to see exactly what he was saying. I have got the speech here - 10 pages. It is the most empty, the most vacuous, speech delivered by a Leader of the Opposition in recent times. Is there any mention of small business - the great generator of jobs in the Australian economy? I table the document. Not one mention of the words `small business'. Not one mention of that sector which has done so much to create jobs.As we showed yesterday, when it comes to policy the only policy they have got is a fashion policy. What we want is a jobs policy. What we want is a small business policy. We want the opposition to stop standing against us and stop using its numbers in the Senate to prevent us from doing things to help small business, thereby helping to create jobs.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first question is no. The answer to the second question is soon. More generally, can I indicate that the tenders for the sale of ADI closed on 30 June. Since that period, the very complex business of Australian Defence Industries has been evaluated in the normal process by the government. It is being done in a very detailed manner, as it should be, and when the evaluation is concluded the government will make an appropriate announcement.In relation to the final part of the question that was asked by the honourable member in respect of jobs in his electorate in the industry at Lithgow that is part of the ADI complex, I simply want to assure the honourable member that part of the criteria when seeking tenders was to put forward proposals that related to the jobs of existing personnel and specifically those jobs where they occur in regional Australia. The criteria that will be used by the government to evaluate will very much keep in mind regional development aspects and employment in regional areas of Australia when a decision is being made.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Hinkler because I know he has a very keen interest in older Australians, and particularly self-funded retirees. I would like to inform the House that an extra 163,000 self-funded retirees have taken advantage of the Commonwealth seniors health card, an expansion program under the Howard-Anderson government. Indeed, for self-funded retirees this is an important initiative. For the  first time they will now be eligible for PBS, which means cheaper prescriptions. The Commonwealth seniors health card is recognition of the important contribution that self-funded retirees have made in saving for their own retirement. In January this year, the government almost doubled the income thresholds to $40,000 for single persons and $67,000 for a couple. I am pleased to see that many older Australians have taken advantage of this important benefit. -  - I certainly urge all self-funded retirees who may be eligible for this card to contact their nearest Centrelink office to take full advantage of this. The extension of this card demonstrates the absolute commitment that the coalition government has to older people in the International Year of Older Persons.</DOC>

Can I say in relation to the Auditor-General that it is my understanding, without checking the act, that he has automatic powers of examination of programs  which do not need any prime ministerial or ministerial triggering. As to his powers under the act and the appropriate use of them and the circumstances in which they can be used, I will have a look at that and, if there is anything further that ought to be said, I will.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Menzies very much indeed for his question and particularly for his deep commitment to strengthening and protecting the Australian family, which is acknowledged by all in this parliament. This side of eternity there is no such thing as perfection, but I am pleased to say that as a result of the social coalition of private sector, community based and charitable organisations the Job Network is continuing to perform extremely well. In the last quarter, job matching outcomes from Job Network members averaged 26,000 a month; this is double the performance of the old CES two years ago and indeed of the Job Network itself just 12 months ago.But there is more good news. Non-English speaking background people constitute 14 per cent of all job seekers, but make up 21 per cent of all intensive assistance referrals. Sixty percent of older job seekers are in intensive assistance, compared to just 40 per cent of all job seekers. I am advised that women are achieving better than average job outcomes thorough job matching and job search training programs. But there is more. The government is constantly upgrading its services for job seekers, and we have recently introduced lodge a resume and resume search facilities which will enable job seekers to have 24 hours a day access to what is a virtual labour market. This Internet based service is a world-class innovation.Despite all of this good news, the Leader of the Opposition - who has a line on everything and a policy on nothing - is claiming that  there is a crisis of confidence in the Job Network. If the Leader of the Opposition had bothered to turn up to his own employment conference, he would not make such silly statements. The Job Network is performing extremely well. It will perform even better in the future. I venture this prediction: the way the Job Network is going, I imagine that it will not be long before the member for Batman makes a public statement about the Job Network - as he has about Work for the Dole - that, in fact, it was a policy that the Labor Party really thought of first.</DOC>

 - The government is concerned about the plight of people who are retrenched for no reasons of their own, where they are in employment in a business which goes insolvent and as a consequence of that they are basically dudded of their entitlements. We believe that this is an issue going beyond Oakdale but also appreciate that there is a specific need to address the circumstances raised by the Oakdale colliery closure. We have had discussions with the CFMEU. We had a discussion with them yesterday. We had a discussion with them a couple of weeks ago - two or three weeks ago or more. - The Minister for Finance and Administration has also had discussions with them. We will be having further discussions. We have set a date for further discussions with them. The specifics of the question relate to the use of the fund, which is a long service leave fund. That fund was set up before this government came into office. That fund was provided with contributions from both employers and employees to pay out superannuation moneys owing. In this particular case all of the moneys that have been owing have been paid out of the fund. Your question is: why does the fund not go further than providing for long service leave entitlements? There is a simple answer to that, and that is that when your government was in office you failed to provide a broader scheme. - I see that you are now concerned about Oakdale. If you take the ACTU's figures, the fact is that for the time you were in office over 200,000 employees lost their entitlements, worth close to $2 billion. We on this side of the House - this government - believe that this is a genuine problem, and we on this side of the House are actually -  - The monumental hypocrisy of these people! - Mr 13 years; 200,000 employees got nothing while you were in government - they lost nearly $2 billion - and you come in here and make claims about those who have been affected. - The simple point is that the fund that is there has been set up for a particular purpose - namely, superannuation. There are people in the industry who say that when it comes to entitlements we should expand that fund and require other contributions to it, and that would be a source of finance. That is an argument they can put. There are obviously - from a policy perspective for the government - a number of options we are examining. Another option was put up by the CFMEU, and that was a 10c levy on coal. We are very concerned about the coal industry. In fact, when Senator Hill went to Kyoto, one of the things he did was save a lot of jobs in the coal industry, which would have gone if your policy had ever been put in place.From the point of view of the Oakdale employees, they want their problem fixed, and we understand that. We are doing other things in respect of training and providing practical assistance. It is not an answer to their point about entitlements but it is something we can do. We have to do all that we possibly can to provide reasonable assistance. However, we are also conscious of the fact that we have a national responsibility: it is Oakdale today but, unfortunately, there will be other businesses that will go broke in the future. As we look at the circumstances of Oakdale -  - It does go directly to the question of funding; I could not be more relevant.  - If it is accepted that we have a national responsibility - as we do certainly accept it, and we would like to see such a national scheme in place - then obviously what we do in respect of Oakdale will have precedent implications for elsewhere. The question goes to one specific option. Another option was the Crosio bill but that did not provide for redundancy. For most of the people at Oakdale -  - Mr Speaker, they had 13 years. I am genuinely attempting to answer the question and the interjections only reflect the fact that Labor have done nothing on this issue and they are now embarrassed by the fact that we are seriously considering it. I conclude by saying that we are keen to ensure the right thing is done by the Oakdale people. We have had a discussion with them. I understand they were disappointed we did not give them everything they asked for yesterday but, at the same time, we do also have a national responsibility.We have had discussions with the Democrats. We also believe the states will need to be involved. We will continue to work at this.  We are keen to deal with the matter sooner rather than later and we have set another date for our discussions with the CFMEU. I would hope the people appreciate that such a proposal being considered by the government would be a significant extension of the safety net available to employees in Australia - in fact, it is the most significant extension of the safety net for many years. We are prepared to go down this track because we are prepared to have a fair system. I can assure the Oakdale colliery miners that we are concerned about their circumstances and we are working on the issue and, whilst they were not happy with the outcome, we have had constructive discussions with the CFMEU.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question, which of course is directed to the welfare of his constituents. I would also like to congratulate Mayor Vernados and his delegation in actively pursuing the interests of their timber workers and local associated small business. I am pleased to advise them, and I was in our meeting, of the continuous and vigorous representation on their behalf by the member for Fairfax, Mr Somlyay. Might I also commend the many other coalition members who constantly represent the interests of all sectors of their constituency, including forestry workers, to me. That stands in stark contrast to members of the other side of this House where the backbenchers of the Labor Party conspire to destroy future job prospects for timber workers by opposing the  regional forest agreement legislation in the Senate - notwithstanding direct requests from the associated unions and the Labor Deputy Premier of Tasmania that they pass that legislation without amendment.I was able to advise Mayor Vernados and his delegation that the government continues its policy of support for jobs and prosperity for the regional timber industry under a program of comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve systems, and a sustainable management regime of productive forests. I thank the Prime Minister for his commitment to the rights of country people to gain and retain employment under those circumstances. -  - The government also expects that native forests and indigenous varieties of timber will form part of the resource supporting those jobs and that prosperity. The government has consequently reversed the Labor Party's funding concept of business exit and worker redundancy to one of funding business development through value adding.A leading sawmill manager advised me yesterday that he had never seen so many Australian timber industry people at the recent Ligna timber machinery expo in Germany. They were there shopping for machinery necessary to access high value markets and to develop their industry. Their presence was a vote of confidence in the Australian government's policy and a commitment to the security available from the RFA process.Nevertheless, as the WA state government has just demonstrated, this process is totally vulnerable to opportunistic and poorly planned decisions. In Queensland, the state and federal government officials have completed all the processes upon which the Queensland government and I, representing the Commonwealth government, must make our decisions. There is no reason to delay these decisions. An RFA should be in the process of being signed, which will remove the uncertainty that presently exists in regional Queensland amongst people who always  thought they could trust the Labor Party to protect them. I had hoped to convince the Queensland government of this circumstance when I visited Brisbane on Friday of this week; however, I now discover my direct contact, Deputy Premier Elder, is in South Africa at present. -  - Yes, and I was doing something for the timber industry. - I was doing something for the timber industry, Mr Speaker. - I was happy to go over there, as the evidence will prove, because I thought it was a good idea that Australian timber workers could have the security of a job in an industry that is selling into high value markets. - We know what the Leader of the Opposition did: he stayed back here to protect his back. My job is not at risk; only yours. The Queensland government was elected on a promise of achieving five per cent unemployment in that state. The RFA could assist them to deliver on that promise. The Commonwealth government has a policy of job creation and  conservation. We have matching funds available to implement that policy. It is therefore totally unfair for the Queensland government to -  - Mr Speaker, this is the third day since the parliament has resumed and I have not got one question from you. What about the Leader of the Opposition asking the first - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question and for her concern about drugs in the community and within sport. I am very pleased to announce today another key initiative by this government to combat the use of banned drugs in sport, and that is the Australian Sports Drug Medical Advisory Committee. We have formed this committee of pharmacists, doctors and endocrinologists to prescribe for athletes who are seriously ill - and I am not talking about an earache or a headache - and do need to use, for therapeutic purposes, drugs that may or may not be banned by their particular sport. Through this medical committee athletes can get approval to use a drug. If there is a subsequent positive test contrary to their sport's regulations, and that test is within the range of treatment prescribed by those medical experts, then it will not be a positive test. This is getting very tough on athletes, because any therapeutic use of drugs must be approved by this committee, but it is also protecting athletes' rights to access drugs when they have a serious medical illness by not restricting them to what is on the banned lists.The committee will be chaired by Professor Ken Fitch AM, a highly regarded medical consultant and sports physician with extensive domestic and international experience in the  anti-doping field. He will be joined by Dr Hugh Hazard, who is the Chief Medical Officer for the National Rugby League; Dr Sue White, who is the Medical Officer with Netball Australia and a member of the Australian Paralympics Medical Commission; Dr Peter Harcourt, the Anti-Doping Medical Officer with the Australian Cricket Board; and Professor Peter Fricker, the Deputy Medical Director of the Australian Olympic Team. The calibre of the team is outstanding.This is another blow against drugs in sport. It is particularly important at this time, with Australia hosting the Olympic Games next year and with the legacy that we hope to leave the Olympic movement as it goes on to Athens and beyond.</DOC>

 - There is nothing greater than the hypocrisy of the Labor Party on this issue. When the Labor Party went to the federal election last year, their policy was to further the widening of the FBT reporting on individuals. What they are complaining about is the policy that they took to the federal election last year. They made no mention of exemptions for ADF personnel, and that is the fact of the matter. Going back even further, it was the ALP that introduced the FBT regime, and at the time they specifically refused to exempt defence. - Settle down, mate. Look, I am just reminding you of your policy. - As I advised the House yesterday, the government is going to take a very careful look at this issue. In answer to a similar question yesterday, I said that we are reviewing this issue to make sure that there is no inequitable treatment of defence families due to geographic location. That is exactly what we said yesterday - we are going to take a very careful look - and that is what we have said consistently through this week.</DOC>

 - I thank the opposition whip for his vote of confidence in me. If he didn't want to hear me, it was very -  - As I was outlining previously, the government reversed the policy that was laid down by the Keating Labor government in their National Forest Policy Statement. - The purpose of making that point was to explain to the House that, with the approval of the Prime Minister, a process that was 80 per cent directed towards buying people out of their businesses and encouraging them to sack their workers and giving them some redundancy has left people in very many parts of Australia, who were subject to that policy, sitting in houses they cannot sell, waiting for the miracle job that they were promised by some other action of government, and they are still unemployed.We took the attitude that that was inappropriate and that, if you wanted to conserve the forests, if you were obliged to reduce the amount of timber harvested from those forests, you should look at the opportunities available in very high valued markets in other parts of the world that will pay us up to $7,000 and $10,000 a cubic metre for wood that is being sold within Australia for $500 a cubic metre. You should encourage and help businesses to invest in a process where they  can add that value through kiln-drying, planing, and finger jointing, using all that state of the art equipment that those people went to Germany to see because they had a vote of confidence in the federal government's policy.We turned the policy around to say that the FISAP money we provided would be to help, particularly the smaller sawmills that lacked capital, invest in those processes and treble their turnover whilst actually harvesting less wood. That is our policy. That is the big turnaround that we made in the regional forest agreement policy, which of course the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia have abandoned. They have abandoned their own policy. But the fact of life is, as I was explaining to the House, we had a state government in Queensland that stood on a policy and were elected on a policy of reducing unemployment to five per cent. - Let me give you an example of the outcome of a policy as created by this government and negotiated in Western Australia. The outcome of the policy signed on 4 May was that, for a lengthy period thereafter, not one sacking was announced in Western Australia. When the Prime Minister signed in good faith with the Premier of Western Australia, he delivered a policy where not one person was sacked. In that process, a virtual halving of timber harvesting was agreed to by the industry and there was a reaching of the JANIS targets for reserves - the highest of any agreement signed yet.That was an outcome that has now, by just one opportunistic decision, seen 200 jobs lost overnight, and I have not heard one complaint from the member for Bendigo, the member for Braddon, the member for Lyne, the member for Paterson or the member for McMillan. I have not heard one of them complaining about job destruction in industries where they have a direct responsibility. There is now a new senator called Joe Ludwig, and we know who his father is. I will be very interested to see how he votes on the regional forest agreement legislation. - The point is that in terms of outcomes we now want the Queensland government to tell the people of Queensland and their timber workers how many jobs they want to knock off so they can keep some Green preferences for a couple of impending elections.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition raises two issues. One issue he raises is the privatisation of Telstra and the other issue he raises is the security of accrued benefits for employees when companies go out of business without having paid those accrued benefits. Against the test of both the national interest and fair treatment of people, I would like to address each of those propositions.Can I say that the partial privatisation of Telstra has been enormously to the interest of ordinary Australians. The partial privatisation  of Telstra has enabled hundreds of thousands of average Australians with great zeal and glee to buy shares in this great Australian enterprise. The privatisation of Telstra has extended the gift of private share ownership way beyond the narrow-minded attitude of the Leader of the Opposition -  -  - and the members of the Australian Labor Party. I am proud of what we have done in relation to Telstra. I am proud of the fact that we have been able to involve directly hundreds of thousands of Australians in the ownership of this great Australian enterprise. I might say that it is very interesting that the Leader of the Opposition raises this question in the context of employees. I remind him that 92 per cent - not 82 per cent or 72 per cent but 92 per cent - of the employees of Telstra took up their entitlement in the last offer of share ownership in that company. That is what the employees of Telstra have done.As far as the second issue is concerned, the Leader of the Opposition will be aware, from the answer that was given yesterday by my colleague the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business, that the government is considering certain proposals. There will be proposals to deal with the Oakdale situation and there will be proposals to deal with the problem more generally if it arises in the future. I would remind the Leader of the Opposition, as we are entitled to remind him on all of these issues, that you had 13 years to address this problem and you did a big fat zero.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to inform the House that unemployment has now fallen to a 10-year low and is now at seven per cent.  Even better than that is that the youth unemployment rate has now fallen to 21.4 per cent. This is 5.8 percentage points lower than in March 1996. I repeat that it is 5.8 percentage points lower than it was in March 1996, and it is the lowest level for youth unemployment since October 1990. Moreover, the number of unemployed Australians between the ages of 15 and 19 looking for full-time work is the lowest ever recorded. After less than 3½ years, this is dramatic evidence of not only the success of the government's economic policy but also the success of the government's labour market policies.But I am entitled - and those who were still left unemployed are entitled - to say that, if only the Labor Party had let our unfair dismissal legislation through the Senate, if only the Labor Party had done something about protecting people who enjoy the benefit of youth wages, if only the Labor Party had agreed in the Senate to further changes to make the labour market more flexible, I would be standing at the dispatch box today and announcing an infinitely better figure than the magnificent figure that I have announced. This figure has been achieved despite the obstruction of the Australian Labor Party. This result has been achieved despite the negative attitude of the Leader of the Opposition. This has been achieved in the face of every attempt by the Labor Party to frustrate the coalition's drive to strengthen the Australian economy. Because we have been successful, because we have had a single-minded and determined Treasurer, because we have had single-minded ministers determined to get on with their job and determined to create opportunities, particularly in the labour market, we have been able to achieve this outcome.Well may the Australian parliament, and indeed the Australian people, ask where the Leader of the Opposition was when we were trying to do these things. Indeed, where was the Leader of the Opposition this morning when these magnificent figures were announced? I understand that the Leader of the Opposition was in Melbourne, and I am indebted for that bit of intelligence to a report from Australian Associated Press. This is how it reads:Police on horseback were brought in as a major union rally fell apart in central Melbourne today when rival factions held separate protests.It goes on to say this:Union leaders, including the ACTU President Jennie George and Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, were left standing embarrassed on a street corner as the second arm of the march blocked their official protest.One officer of the very praiseworthy and estimable Victoria Police was heard to announce as follows:`We have no idea where they are going and we are attempting to control them.'It sounded like a magnificently eloquent description of the policy making processes of the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - It is interesting that he does not ask any questions about unemployment. You have all the time in the world -  - The argument that I addressed last night and the words I used last night are very similar to arguments and words that I have used on a number of occasions in this debate. There are a range of views on both sides of politics in relation to this issue. Just as the Leader of the Opposition, in relation to the various elements of the broad political constituency that he represents, articulates a point of view in relation to some elements of those constituents as well as his own point of view, so it is with somebody who is charged with the great privilege and responsibility of leading the coalition of political forces in this country.Our position on the preamble is well known. May I say it is well settled and may I also say it is well supported. We have been able to achieve through constructive discussion with the Australian Democrats - not through a torrent of personal abuse but through constructive discussion - an agreement on a form of words relating to the indigenous people which are more generous, more proactive, more noble and more gracious than any references that have been made in a formal instrument embraced by the Australian people at any time in our history. We have an opportunity to vote those words into a preamble to our Constitution.Of course there are some people who would like it expressed differently; I understand that. There are a lot of things that have been embraced by the parliament in the various years that I have been here that I would have liked expressed differently, but in the end the question that people have to ask themselves on 6 November in relation to the constitutional preamble, is: are they really so mean-minded that they are going to vote against such a gracious, noble and proactive proposition? I hope that in the end no member of this House will do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. I think all members of the House will be pleased to have seen today that the unemployment rate fell to seven per cent, the lowest unemployment record in a decade. Not only in the last month were 17,000 new jobs created but the 62,000 new jobs of the month before were retained, and that means that since this government came to office some 487,000 new jobs have been created in Australia - nearly half a million new jobs.This is, of course, on the back of extremely strong economic growth. We have had eight consecutive quarters of growth over four per cent, and the last time the Australian economy did that was in 1968. Over the last six quarters we have had growth over one per cent, and the last time the Australian economy did that was never. It is has never been done in Australia before. This has been done on the back of a surplus budget. Labor opposed the surplus budget. This has been done on the back of a new monetary policy. Labor opposed the new monetary policy. This has been done on the back of debt retirement. Labor opposed the debt retirement. This has been done on the back of labour market reform. Labor opposed labour market reform.In all of these great changes to the Australian economy, the Labor Party opposed the  changes and then sought to distance itself from the result. Australia's economic growth leads the world faster than the OECD, the G7, the UK, France, Canada and the US economy. Perhaps the best indication of our prospects for the future is that productivity growth has averaged 2.9 per cent under this government, double that of the 1.5 per cent of Labor during their past term of office.This is a good result. To have unemployment at seven per cent is a good result, but we have a way to go. We should aim to create jobs for all Australians that want to work and we will not stop until we get there. But you will not get there by marching in union protests in the streets of Melbourne. Here we are on the day when unemployment is at a decade low and the Leader of the Opposition is down in Melbourne standing embarrassed on a street corner! There used to be an old war-time song - `There was I standing on the corner'. He is standing on the corner with Jennie George in a street in Melbourne while this demonstration splits in two. -  - The Forrest Gump of Australian politics! There he was in the Defence portfolio but the submarine contract had nothing to do with him - oh no! He was the employment minister when employment -  - Sure. I was talking about the Leader of the Opposition who accidentally flitted across Australian political life but was responsible for nothing. He was defence minister but he bore no responsibility for the submarine contract. He was employment minister when unemployment was 11.2 per cent but he had no responsibility. He was finance minister -  - The standard of debate is not enhanced by referring to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Speaker. We will accept that ruling if that is your ruling. - We are talking about unemployment which, at the beginning of the decade, under the then employment minister was 11.2 per cent. It is now seven per cent. When he was finance minister he was not responsible for $23 billion of Commonwealth government deficit in two years! In all these areas, a minister who had complete responsibility -  - It was the decision of this government in 1996 to turn away from the Beazley deficit path and to put this budget in surplus. The last time the Leader of the Opposition addressed a rally it was a riot outside Parliament House to protest against a surplus budget and all the economic changes which have given Australia the opportunity for employment growth.Paul Volker, the former head of the US Federal Reserve, said in July this year, `There are not many other countries that can match the Australian performance in the past year or so.' In every one of those changes, Labor took the cheap, populist, opportunistic road. And now that the economic changes are producing benefits for Australia, it illustrates the importance of disciplined economic policy - the kind of policy that this government is determined to implement.</DOC>

 - Can I say in reply to the Leader of the Opposition that I do not precisely recall the exact words that the now Treasurer said. I listen very carefully to what the Treasurer says now and I also did in his previous manifestations, and I have a very good recall of radio and television interviews, but I do not remember every word and I am certainly not going to rely on your rendition of it. I will go away and check whether he actually said that. But can I generally say that I am sure the Treasurer, in his then capacity as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, would have been committing a future coalition government to standards of disclosure in relation to the public accounts of this country the like of which had not been seen before. And, of course, under the rules of the Charter of Budget Honesty, that has been delivered on in full. I am particularly proud of that. - And, as the Treasurer reminds me, that was opposed by the Leader of the Opposition - the very person who has asked me the question. In relation to the issue that has been raised relating to the Federation programs, as stated yesterday by the minister responsible, all of those programs were worthy programs. All of them, according to the advice that was given to me by the relevant ministers before I signed off on them late in August, were done in accordance with the guidelines which were developed at my request by the Auditor-General.I asked the two ministers to ensure that the guidelines reflected current best practice for the management of discretionary grants programs and that the senators' departments consulted with the National Audit Office. I am informed that representatives of the then Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts met with the Australian National Audit Office on 27 May 1998. The senators wrote to me on 27 August outlining their recommendations and, in choosing the projects, the senators noted that they had carefully followed the guidelines endorsed by me and which reflected the Auditor-General's guidelines.I am satisfied, on the advice that has been given to me, that all proper procedures have been followed. There seems to be a strange notion in relation to this issue that the ministers had absolutely no ministerial discretion of any kind. There seems to be a notion coming from the Leader of the Opposition that, in relation to these sorts of programs, ministers have no legitimate capacity, no legitimate authority and no right to in any way impose a judgment of their own, separately and apart from a judgment that may be put to them. - We live in a situation in this country where ministers take advice but, in the end, ministers make decisions and ministers stand by those decisions and are accountable for those decisions. That is exactly what has happened. I hear calls from  the opposition about material being made available. I remember that when we were in opposition every question time we were buried in disclosures of documents from the then government! You had to wade your way away from the dispatch box if you were the Leader of the Opposition. -  - Every question time my predecessor used to put document after document, disclosure after disclosure, one piece of information after the other! It was quite extraordinary how transparent the former Prime Minister of Australia really was in the processes of his government. I will follow the right and correct practices in relation to the tabling of documents. But, in relation to this program, I think all of the decisions that were made by the ministers were good decisions, they were done in accordance with guidelines and they made a very significant contribution to the cultural heritage of this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. -  - I am pleased that he adds in his question what else needs to be done. Whilst clearly the figures that have been released today are the best figures for the 1990s, there should also be no diminution in our determination to get on and do more which will provide real jobs for people in the Australian community.The honourable member asking the question has put his support behind Job Journey, which is an expo being held in Frankston on 18 August, and hopefully that is going to help a lot of young people particularly to get apprenticeships. That is a very practical thing which I invite all honourable members, whichever side of the House they are on, to be taking up as perhaps a lead relevant to their area.If you look at the numbers, you see that we have more Australians in jobs than ever before, with 8.792 million Australians now in jobs. We have seen 487,900 jobs created in the first three years and four months of the coalition government. It makes an interesting contrast to compare what we have done in just three and a bit years to Labor's effort when they were in office, particularly their last six years. We have created, for example, 226,700 jobs. In Labor's last six years they were only able to achieve a growth of 24,300 full-time jobs.If you look at the number of people who are unemployed, the number out today is the lowest since October 1990 - a figure of 661,100. The highest that Labor recorded in their last six years was 959,200 - basically a 300,000 difference between their high and our low. On the unemployment rate, as all members will know, Labor's highest number in their last six years was 11.2 per cent in December 1992. Today's figure is the lowest figure since July 1990, a very encouraging outcome. The Prime Minister mentioned young people. Again, it is worth making the comparison. The figure today after our three years and a bit has been a full-time unemployment number of 65,500. That is a 25 per cent improvement in the last year. It is a historically low level and makes an interesting contrast to Labor's record. Again, looking at their last six years, in July 1992 they reached  a high of pretty close to double that figure - 134,800 young people unemployed as a result of Labor's economic mismanagement. The unemployment rate for young people: the figure today is the lowest unemployment rate since October 1990. Again the comparison with Labor: in July 1992 it reached a high of 34.8 per cent.The other number - again referred to by the Prime Minister - goes to the number of young people who are looking for full-time employment, realising a lot of young people are in education. Today's number was the lowest since 1978, which was when these particular figures were first collected. It is a historically low level at 4.9 per cent. We have broken through the five per cent barrier, and that is a very encouraging outcome. Labor's record when they were in office was an unemployment to population ratio high of double that number at 10.2 per cent in July 1992.They are excellent numbers, but no-one should be in any doubt that this is but one month's figures. The fact is the numbers have jumped around a bit; there is a bit of volatility there. But it should also be clear that the reforms that we have introduced really have made a difference. They really have given young people the chance of a job.It is a real irony that the Leader of the Opposition was in Melbourne today opposing the very reforms which actually have given us the rate that we have today. Not only was he deceiving people about the package that we have in front of us in the parliament but he was declaring that basically he is going to vote no to every last bit of it, except the amendments that he is going to put up which will be written for him by the ACTU. I suppose what that means is there will be two lots of amendments because, as we have seen in Melbourne this morning, he does not have one faction behind him - he has two.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for his question. He is very interested in the jobs that are generated by Australia's exporters, as he has a number of critical exporters that are developing their capacity within his electorate. Some of those are involved in increasing pork exports out of Australia, and I commend the member for the work he has done in that area.It should be noted on a day when Australia's unemployment level has gone to a record low of seven per cent over the last 10 years - we should keep reminding Australians of that - that our export industries play a vital role in providing those jobs and, increasingly, Australia's exporters are doing their bit to create new jobs particularly for young Australians. Our government is committed to working with those export industries not only in developing new markets, opening up new markets and in market facilitation but also in providing a very strong economic foundation within Australia.The reforms that we have introduced in the short period in which we have been in government have certainly done that in terms of lower interest rates, workplace relations reforms, eliminating Labor's budget deficit, and low inflation. The basic foundation of the economy is being strengthened as a platform for Australia's exporting industries. Those exporting industries generate 1.7 million jobs in Australia; that is, the jobs of one in five in the work force rely on Australia's exports and their importance within our economy. In the mining sector it is much higher: 90 per cent of all jobs in the mining sector rely on  Australia's exports. So it is absolutely essential that we maintain a focus on those industries. Our growing tourism industry is another one of Australia's great export earners. There are 250,000 jobs in Australia's tourism industry that rely on that industry and on export earnings.It is important to note some of the programs that the government runs as well as the central reform program in strengthening Australia's economy to make it much more competitive in the international scene - programs such as the export market development grants scheme. More than 3,000 exporters, including close to 2,000 small businesses with a turnover of less than $5 million, received EMDG grants in 1998-99. They generated nearly $5 billion worth of exports out of that government assistance and facilitation - a very important program.I would like to identify to the House that one of the most successful recipients of an EMDG grant is in a Labor electorate, in the electorate, I think, of Blaxland. It is a company called Fabquip at Bankstown in Sydney, a construction manufacturer. It received a grant of $114,000. Its export sales to Singapore increased sixfold in the last year with the assistance of that facilitation.We are supporting Australia's exporting industries to market to the world. In the face of difficult economic circumstances in the region our exporters are getting out there and finding new markets. We are going to continue to provide the solid foundation economically within Australia and work with them as they drive for greater market access across the world.</DOC>

 - I repeat what I said previously. The programs that were selected by the ministers were selected by the ministers as a result of a process, firstly, of getting -  - Mr Speaker, if I could start again. As I have indicated previously to the Leader of the Opposition, the ministers got advice. Part of the charge that I gave the ministers earlier this year was that they should consult the Auditor-General. They certainly - on the advice given to me - did consult the Auditor-General. They also, quite properly, consulted the Centenary of Federation Council and took advice. In the final analysis, the decisions they took, which according to the advice I received were proper decisions, reflected both the advice they had received from their departments, the advice that they had received -  - Oh, really! Well, I'm bowing out. - I have finished, Mr Speaker.</DOC>

 - The House is aware that I have been asked to advise on how to deal with the matters raised regarding former Prime Minister Paul Keating in the 60 Minutes  program broadcast on 21 March this year. I have examined the transcript of this program and the 60 Minutes  program of 28 March, together with other material provided to me and material on the public record. I have had the benefit of advice and assistance from senior officers of my department.This examination has been against a background of serious allegations of criminal or other unlawful conduct and allegations of impropriety and possible misconduct in relation to the parliament. The material does not enable a full reconstruction of events, but it has been possible for me to reach conclusions about the main issues of concern from a public interest viewpoint. As to the possibility of criminal conduct, I have not seen anything in the material available that shows any need for a criminal investigation.In relation to other possible unlawful conduct, the material available does not enable me to draw conclusions as to the extent, if any, that there may have been a failure by anyone to meet such obligations. In both of these areas, it is, of course, open to any person who believes there has been a  breach of some law to refer these matters to the relevant authorities.In relation to allegations of impropriety, both as Treasurer and as Prime Minister Mr Keating was in a position where his public responsibilities and his private interests were potentially in conflict. He could not reasonably be surprised that the perception of actual conflict has been raised. However, the only kind of inquiry that the government could establish to examine these issues that would have the necessary powers and protections would be a royal commission. Given the time that has passed since the relevant events, and the fact that Mr Keating is no longer a holder of public office, the commissioning by this government -  -  - of a potentially long and divisive examination into what happened under the most recent Labor governments would not be in the public interest. Mr Keating knows all the material facts. If he wishes in defence of his reputation to seek to justify his past conduct in office to the Australian public, that course is open to him, as it always has been. -  - If he chooses not to do so, the public will be entitled to draw its own conclusions. Another issue is the allegation that Mr Keating misled the parliament when he stated, in March 1994, that he had disposed of his interests in the piggery business. In light of the available material, it is reasonably open to conclude that Mr Keating was less than completely frank in his statement to the parliament and could in fact have been in breach of his obligations to the House of Representatives. However, determination of that issue is properly a matter for the parliament. Since Mr Keating is no longer a member of the parliament, there is now little point in such an inquiry. I have advised the government to the effect outlined in the statement,  and the government has accepted that advice. I will table the advice. -  - </DOC>

 - As the Leader of the Opposition knows, I do not accept unchallenged the summations you make about what somebody has said or about what the law states. As far as I am aware, on all the information available to me, correct procedures were followed by both ministers. Correct procedures -  - I repeat that I do not accept an analysis of any part of the law made by the Leader of the Opposition in question time without the benefit of my own analysis and advice on that law. I have taken that attitude repeatedly and I take it in relation to this question as well. To the rest of the question asked by the Leader of the Opposition I reply by saying, as I have said before, that on the advice available to me the ministers have followed correct procedures. They have affirmed to me that the audit guidelines were followed. I am satisfied on the advice available to me that all of the projects were good projects, all of the projects were beneficial to our culture, environment and heritage, and I stand by all of the projects.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There is some good news. Earlier today, the Private Health Insurance Administration Council released data which shows that private health insurance has risen again last quarter. There are now over a quarter of a million Australians  who have private health insurance who would not have it had we done nothing. -  - Participation has increased in every state and it is up across age groups. It is the second quarter in a row to have shown an increase and this is the best result since 1980, before Medicare started. We certainly do not say that this is the end of the road and that this is all we have to do. There is still a lot of work to be done on the gap, although there are good early signs there. The fact is that our hard work and effort on this is now starting to pay off.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. There were 741 applications under this program, so bear with me if I do not know that particular one. I would simply say that in the handling of that application, as with all others, there were two lists - those that were eligible and those that were not eligible. The 60 projects finally settled on came from the eligible list. Every one of the 60 projects was eligible. The process for funding those projects under the program was explained at some length yesterday in this House, and many times previously in the Senate, and was reiterated by the Prime Minister today. It is an excellent program. A number of electorates, regions and districts throughout Australia have benefited. The government is very proud of a program which the Commonwealth has never previously undertaken. </DOC>

 - I am sure that all members would be pleased to be informed further in relation to the share offer in Telstra. I did inform the House earlier this week that pre-registration had opened and that there was a Telstra share offer on the table. I also informed the House that there is a guaranteed right to purchase 400 shares which could be obtained by pre-registration and that that could be done by phone, by post and by Internet. Over the last two weeks since pre-registration commenced, the response has been very encouraging. Today I am pleased to inform the House that the one millionth Australian has pre-registered for the offer. More than half of those have pre-registered by way of post. Approximately 100,000 of those who have pre-registered have done so over the web site and the balance have done so by phone.This is a strong response. If one bears in mind that existing shareholders are not required to pre-register and that all existing shareholders, some 1.4 million of them, will receive the prospectus and an application form, that brings the total who will receive an application form and prospectus to approximately 2½ million Australians. While that response is strong, as I have indicated, it is not too late to pre-register to get that guarantee of a minimum of 400 shares. The deadline is Monday, 16 August at midnight. If anyone still wants to pre-register, the phone number is 1800 18 18 18. -  - I note that the honourable member for Paterson indicated, `We don't want it!' Some of your colleagues did last time in another place, so I will continue for their benefit. The Internet address is www.t2.telstra.com.au. The offer has been accessible and popular. It is an offer for all Australians. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his question. I am immensely proud of the progress that this government is making in ensuring that the immense wealth that is being generated in the tourism industry - which is one of our biggest industries; it is a $60 billion industry - is being shared amongst all Australians. We have recently seen the appointment of an indigenous liaison officer at the Australian Tourist Commission which is designed to maximise the benefits to indigenous tourism operators from the ATC's international marketing efforts. We know from surveys that 80 per cent of travellers from Europe seek some sort of indigenous tourism experience. With that, we have allocated significant funding from our $16 million regional tourism program to develop and assist indigenous tourism products. We have also adopted a national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tourism industry strategy. We are slowly ticking off on the items from that, such as a code of conduct for visitors to indigenous communities, and working through a number of cultural issues so that our indigenous communities feel comfortable about accessing this marvellous industry which is bringing so many jobs and such wealth potential to the regional areas of Australia. We will continue to work closely with Aboriginal and other organisations to ensure the effective and targeted delivery of assistance programs to advance indigenous tourism.</DOC>

 - In the quiet spirit in which the Leader of the Opposition asks the question, can I, equally, reply quietly. I will have a look at what he has put to me. I will read the act. I will get some advice, like any other Prime Minister or minister would do in a situation like this, and if there is anything further I should add I will. I have been in this place a long time and when questions of that kind have been asked in the past of prime ministers and ministers on both sides of the parliament they have given precisely that kind of answer. The proposition that I should just  accept on the run the interpretation, the embellishment, the context -  -  - the description, or whatever, that is put on it by the Leader of the Opposition is palpably absurd. -  - No matter how many questions he asks me in that vein, I have absolutely no intention of playing that game.</DOC>

 - The government is genuinely concerned about the plight of employees who, through no fault of their own, find themselves  out of a job and without their entitlements being paid. It is interesting that, whilst the government has announced its policy intentions in this regard, that statement was never able to be made by any minister in the previous Labor government. There were eight accords with the trade union movement over 13 years and on no occasion -  - On no occasion did the Labor Party, in the eight accords that they had with the trade union movement, commit themselves to a national scheme to look after workers. This demonstrates, as clearly as it ever could be demonstrated, that the one government in recent times that has been prepared to look after workers, whether through higher real wages or more jobs, is on this side of the House. - I am very happy to come to that point, Mr Speaker, but it needs to be put in context. Even in the last desperate accord between the ACTU and the ALP back in 1995, they said that, while they were prepared to examine the issue, that was provided that it was desirable and practicable. So they were not even prepared to acknowledge the actual need of workers in this situation. At the last election, the government had a policy in  respect of workplace relations known as `More Jobs, Better Pay' and we were committed to introducing that package of reforms. In response, the two things that have happened since we have been in government have been more jobs and better pay, particularly for low income people. We said that we would introduce a policy and we have been undertaking a process of consultation, including with the ACTU, on that policy. That policy provides further protection for employees as well as more job opportunities. Given that that bill is currently before the parliament, it is not unreasonable that we would want to add to it a further protection for workers, namely, a national scheme to provide protection in respect of entitlements.I said to the Democrats about three weeks ago - as we said during the election and have been saying since - that we would like to have that package of reforms through by the end of this year, with a commencement on 1 January. That is a reasonable and sensible timetable. It also provides the opportunity, as I hope will be provided, for any scheme that we do put up to be the subject of inquiry by the Senate committee. It is looking at workplace relations and this is a workplace relations matter. For heaven's sake, we want to get on with this and this is an appropriate means of doing so. Unlike the Labor Party, we acknowledge that there is an issue here to be dealt with and we are prepared to do something about it.</DOC>

 - I do not know what the precise source of this question might be. Maybe the member for Deakin, like the Prime Minister and others who care about the long-term job prospects of Australia, was browsing through a few press reports on 20 August and came across this very interesting comment by somebody which read, `The Howard government has had some major successes on the economic front and they ought to be acknowledged.' The learned commentator on this  issue went on to say, `If one thing flourished under the Labor government, it was unemployment and I do not think anyone could possibly deny that.' I looked for the author under Costello - no - and I looked under Reith, Moore and a number of other names. To my great surprise, I finally came to the letter R in the alphabet and found that it was Graham Richardson who was making these very erudite, accurate and home-grown remarks about the remarkable achievements of the Howard government.The Labor Party sitting opposite scoffed and sneered when the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business talked about more jobs and better pay, but that is exactly the double that this government has delivered to the workers of Australia. The workers of Australia are not only more numerous now than when we came to power but also immensely better off. There are now almost 500,000 more Australians in work now than there were in March 1996. Their real wages have risen and their disposable income has also risen quite dramatically because, as a result of the economic policies of the government, their mortgage interest has fallen by an average of $320 a month. With the triple effect of 500,000 more jobs, $320 a month off people's mortgage bill and increases in real wages, you have a trifecta of improvement which no government in this country has been able to deliver since World War II. It is an achievement of which the government is legitimately proud.I might say in relation to the member for Deakin, who asked me this question, that as a metaphor for the great success we have had the unemployment rate in the outer east Melbourne district in June was a bare 4.7 per cent. I am delighted that I can go around the country and find areas like that. However, I acknowledge immediately that there are still significant areas of high regional unemployment. That is why the stance being taken by the federal government in relation to the timber industry in Western Australia is so absolutely correct. We are standing up for the workers of Western Australia and for the timber workers. Where else do people like  that get jobs if they find their employment taken away from them?Of all the unemployment figures that have come out in the last few weeks, none is a source of greater pride to the government than the fact that, since we came to office, the number of young unemployed people in this country has declined by 5.8 percentage points. We now have the lowest number of young people looking for full-time work that we have had for more than 20 years. Everyone knows that we still have a long way to go. We still need to get the unemployment rate down further. Those sitting opposite would help a lot if they passed our unfair dismissal laws and our youth wages laws. You would help a lot if you would spare a thought for those young people who still cannot get work. But, despite the incredible opposition and obstruction of the Labor Party, we have been able to get unemployment down to a ten-year low; we have given new hope to the young; we have created half a million jobs; and we have increased the real disposable income of millions of Australian workers. All that has been achieved in just under 3½ years.</DOC>

 - In answering this question, I just ask the parliament to contemplate what we are being asked to accept. What we see here is an attack by the Leader of the Australian Labor Party on the workers of Western Australia. This is a very interesting development. What my colleague the minister has done is defend an agreement that was signed by the Prime Minister of Australia and the Premier of Western Australia. I think it is a matter of great regret that the Western Australian government has walked away from that agreement. In saying what he has said, my colleague the minister has defended the interests of workers.It ill becomes somebody who associated himself with a riot outside this building in 1996 to start getting up in this parliament and delivering lectures to a man who is seen throughout the blue-collar movement in this country in the forestry industry as being a better friend of the workers of Western Australia than any member of the Australian Labor Party. Wilson Tuckey is sticking up for the rights of the timber workers of regional Australia. What we had with that agreement was a balanced outcome. We had an outcome that represented an attempt, on my part, in the discussions I had with the Premier of Western Australia to accommodate his desire then to get a balanced outcome. What I am saying now is precisely in line with what I privately communicated to the Premier when he indicated to me a few weeks ago that he wanted to walk away from aspects of the regional forest agreement. These issues are difficult, but the cause of employment in this country is not served by any government caving in to a noisy interest group. The cause of balanced development in this country is served by supporting the regional forest process. And in the long run, the cause of balanced development in this country is served by governments honouring agreements.I am interested in this reference to `inciting people'. I listened, as I normally do, with great interest this morning to AM. There was a report of some remarks made by Ms Edwardes concerning Mr Tuckey. As I heard the grab, the objectionable remark apparently was - and this is how it was presented to me  by the ABC - that Mr Tuckey said there would be no RFA2. I did not think that was a particularly provocative remark. He was merely making the observation that, if you sign an agreement in good faith with the national government, you cannot expect, if you walk away from it, that you can automatically pick up another regional forest agreement.	Our position is very simple. We signed an agreement with the Western Australian government. It was a good agreement. It was a fair agreement. It was an agreement that protected environmental values. It was also an agreement that gave a great deal of help to the workers of the regional and rural areas of Western Australia.But we now have a clear situation in which not only is the state Labor Party in Western Australia, led by Gallop, against the interests of workers in Western Australia but also the Western Australian born Leader of the Australian Labor Party is against the interests of workers in Western Australia. The more that he attacks the minister for forests, the member for O'Connor, who also comes from Western Australia, the more he dishonours his credentials as a claimed champion of the working men and women of Australia - because on this issue, as on so many others, the Leader of the Opposition is a country mile away from the interests of the workers of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Aston for his question. I appreciate that the Labor Party asked one question on the issue today but, as usual, it takes the coalition to follow it up. I thank him for his genuine interest. -  - It is typical of you people - you talk about these issues but you never do anything about it. Mr Speaker, they have been out saying that the interjector from Prospect has had a piece of legislation that would have fixed this problem ages ago. That is what they have all been saying. But, for the Oakdale mine people, $4 million of the $6 million would never have been paid under her bill because it did not cover redundancies - something which I have said on the public record but you have had no follow-up. No sufficient interest in this issue other than to try to score a few cheap political points but not to actually do anything for the workers.I am very pleased to inform the House that the government will have legislation in the parliament this week to make available to those Oakdale employees funds from the long service leave fund to ensure that they are paid out their due entitlements. That is a good outcome for the employees at Oakdale. But it is also part of the broader package which the government has developed. We will also be putting out a discussion paper on that issue. This will be a significant extension - a quality extension - of the safety net for workers, something which we on this side of the House are proud to be associated with. We are proud of the fact that we are prepared to tackle difficult issues in the interests of not only those workers but also workers more generally.I am asked about the policy developments on this issue in the past. We had the Hancock commission in 1985 - no mention of employee entitlements and certainly no reaction from Labor. We had a Law Reform Commission report in 1988. It took Labor nearly five years to respond to that report, which was simply to give preference to workers over the Australian Taxation Office. It took you five years to do that. In respect of the Crosio proposition, the Labor government said this back in 1992:The report, namely the Law Reform Commission, recommended the establishment of a fund to pay employees back wages where a company's assets were insufficient on winding up. Overseas precedents are funded by a levy on solvent companies. This recommendation is not implemented as the fund would be a further imposition on existing successful businesses, and it would be better to  retain and develop, where possible, existing employee priority provisions.So you looked at the issue and you rejected it. We saw off the back of a truck not so long ago some advice to the Leader of the Opposition from John Angley who said of the Crosio bill:The downside of the levy is that it is another cost on jobs. If it is a state-wide fund like workers comp, the cost per worker in the form of premiums inevitably grows. It also reduces the responsibility of employers/owners to fix their own affairs rather than fall back on the fund.The fact is that for the 13 years the Labor Party were in office and for the period that they have been in opposition - until this year - they have basically been opposed to doing anything. The hypocrisy of these people knows no bounds.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question because, as he knows, Australia is building up to the introduction of a new tax system on 1 July 2000. It will be a new tax system which will sweep away the old Labor wholesale sales taxes and which will provide large income tax cuts, new Commonwealth-state relations and new family allowance. In implementing this scheme, the government has set up an advisory board called the New Tax System Advisory Board. It is chaired by Chris Jordan, a well-known accountant of KPMG, and private sector representatives make up the board. It is going to ensure that business is fully informed about the importance of the new tax system. In fact, the board has already released its first booklet for Australian business, called The New Tax System: here is how it will affect your business .In addition to that, a GST Start-Up Assistance Office has been established to disburse $500 million in assistance to small and medium sized businesses, charities and educational bodies. It will begin disbursing up to $130 million immediately to key industry and professional associations to deliver information and assistance to their members. It will also be administering a train the trainer program, which will allocate $7 million to increase the number of people able to train others in the implementation of GST. In addition to the $500 million of start-up assistance, late last week the government announced new taxation arrangements for small and medium sized businesses, which were very warmly received by small and medium sized businesses. The government's announcement was that small and medium sized businesses - those with a turnover of not more than $10 million - will, under new legislation, be able to get immediate deductibility of the following:Expenditure incurred on acquiring new plant or new software . . . associated with gearing-up for the GST, provided the expenditure is occurred before 1 July 2000.That is immediate expensing in relation to plant and software for small and medium  sized businesses. It is expected that the tax deductibility of that decision will deplete the revenue by about $175 million in 2000-01; that is, provide an additional extra tax help of $175 million to small and medium sized businesses. In addition to that, the Australian Taxation Office has announced that businesses with an annual turnover greater than $500,000 who already lodge income tax returns on a cash basis will be able to account on a cash basis for GST and there will be no need to separately seek permission to do that. In relation to businesses of $500,000 or less, they are already able to account for GST on a cash basis if they choose.Mr Speaker, for small businesses there are now direct tax incentives to go out and buy the new plant or new software required to gear up for GST. Provided they do it by 1 July 2000, it will be totally tax deductible; another $175 million to the small and medium sized businesses of Australia to help them gear up for a new tax system which will carry this country through the next century, promoting savings, incomes and, best of all, a stronger economy with more jobs.</DOC>

 - I have asked for a transcript of the Neil Mitchell interview. I have not got it yet, but I will in a minute. As I said in answer to the earlier question from the Leader of the Opposition, my recollection of the train of events was that, shortly after the change of government, I received an indication that Mr Barratt could be interested in returning to the Public Service. I certainly recollect having discussions with him. I certainly recollect his indicating that there were differences in the money that he was receiving from the BCA at the time and the money he might receive as a departmental secretary. I did not hear his interview on TheWorld Today  and the reference made to that interview by the Leader of the Opposition today is the first I have been made aware of that interview. But that is of no particular moment to me, Mr Speaker, because what he is saying is not necessarily inconsistent with what I put on the Neil Mitchell program and what I am putting to the House today.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and note his very real interest in this matter. In fact, he invited me down to have a look at the road very shortly after I became the responsible minister and we drove up and down. - I hear an interjection over there to the effect, did we get out? In fact, we did. We had a very close look at the road. We looked at it with considerable interest. -  - The benefits from the government's decision to commit $120 million to upgrade Geelong Road under its Roads of National Importance Program really ought to be self-evident even to those opposite. This is a program they did not have. This is being done under the Roads of National Importance Program. They did not have such a thing. They signed off on a deal in 1992 that precluded such worthy objectives.Under this program there will be a very worthwhile improvement in the efficiency and competitiveness of industry. According to an estimate by the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research, up to 4,500 jobs will be created under this package, both during the development and building of the road and subsequently with the improved economic performance that will flow from it.The federal government's funding, when combined with the Victorian government's contribution, means that a total now of $240 million is available to ensure that the road is fully upgraded by 2003. I believe that our commitment to this reflects the important role that the road plays in linking two of Australia's busiest ports, Melbourne and Geelong, and their commercial and manufacturing industries. It will help such manufacturers as Ford, for example, a very major outfit in the Australian context. Ford will benefit a lot from improved traffic flows and reliabilities between these two cities. High quality exporters will also have improved access to Avalon and Tullamarine airports, which is a very worthy and important consideration.I believe that today's announcement reflects well upon the Howard government's commitment to economic growth and employment and it is further evidence of this government's ongoing commitment to upgrade Victoria's road system.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, this is the statement I made on the Neil Mitchell program: `Well, the sequence of events was that he indicated a willingness to return to the Public Service and he was offered a job by my government.' That was what I had recollected having said and - having checked the transcript - that is what I did say. I do not deny having rung him; I have never denied having rung him. But I make the point that he had indicated a willingness to return to the Public Service and, 3½ years on, my recollection is precisely to that effect. I make no apology for having said what I said on the Neil Mitchell program. - It was a proper recollection of the sequence of events. I stand by what I said on the Neil Mitchell program.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. I wish to report to the House that the government has now further progressed its commitment to the National Forest Policy statement by the signing of a further regional forest agreement, the North-East RFA in Victoria, with the government. That, I think, would answer the interjection about what Marie Tehan would say.In making this announcement, I want to thank the member for McEwen, the member for Indi, the member for Corangamite, the  member for Ballarat and Mr Michael O'Connor of the CFMEU for putting the case for their constituents and their members as we progressed these negotiations. Their particular advice has been taken to full account and, as a consequence, in an area of the member for Indi's electorate, for the sawmill at Mount Beauty, the government has been able to make special offers to ensure that, in the environment of an increased reserve system - an increase of some 50 per cent - and in an environment of a change in their available timber supply, they will have the necessary equipment within their sawmill to maintain the employment of their full work force, in a town which has suffered considerably through other issues in the loss of jobs.There are other matters that we need to consider in answering the member's question, because we have introduced regional forest agreements on the basis of the National Forest Policy Statement, which was written in 1992 and endorsed by the cabinet - of which a prominent member was the Leader of the Opposition, who has said on radio today that he urges the Australian Democrats to support amendments to a component of that policy that they endorsed, which set out to gut the regional forest agreement legislation.We have further advice received from the Australian Government Solicitor that these particular amendments are very damaging to the reasons for the regional forest agreement legislation, one of which is to guarantee the security that is necessary to encourage either domestic or foreign investors to invest in this great industry, to turn woodchips into paper and to turn sawn timber away from the low value markets of green-sawn timber into the high value markets available to us throughout the world. That investment requires the security of government legislation backing the written agreements. I put it to you, Mr Speaker: if you were proposing a billion dollar investment and you had a piece of legislation that in fact made the agreement that guaranteed you that security subject to continuous litigation and subject to review by a Senate whose record of logic on these issues is already in question, would you invest your money here when other parts of the world  were prepared to give you legislative backing?The best advice I have for the opposition is that their members of the Senate committee that inquired into this legislation received a submission from the Labor Deputy Premier of Tasmania that it was the view of their government - who have already passed this sort of legislation without the sorts of amendments that are proposed by the Labor Party - that they wanted this legislation passed without amendment. I have previously drawn the House's attention to the letters that the Leader of the Opposition has received - and, no doubt, other members have received - from the AWU and the CFMEU, who claim that the regional forest agreement, as we have presented it to the parliament, was the deal they did with this government and this Leader of the Opposition, and they want it delivered without any amendment. The government has been advised that, what is more, the amendments are not constitutional and that the amendments furthermore -  - I think we have already publicised it, Mr Speaker. The government has the advice. I have seen it. Of course the government is, I think, quite willing to produce that advice. But let me put it to you that that advice goes further. It is an interesting aspect of these amendments that in fact you have a situation where three regional forest agreements are not to be included and - surprise, surprise! - one of them is Tasmania, where of course the state government demands this legislation.The interesting thing is that, apparently, if these particular amendments were to pass and become law, Tasmania would be excluded from the protection of a regional forest agreement. That is an issue for Senator Murphy, Senator Sherry and others to convince their own constituents of, but the fundamentals are that all we need is security and certainty to keep workers in jobs.The regional forest agreement that this government concluded in Western Australia guaranteed and delivered the highest ecological reserves of any regional forest agreement and met the criteria set down by the opposi  tion when they were in government. Further, it gained voluntary agreement from the sawmilling industry to accept cuts in their particular sawlog entitlements four years ahead of when they needed to do so. It was endorsed by the Western Australian Environmental Protection Authority's representative on the issue of sustainable yield, and - this is why they want me to sit down - it resulted in not one job loss. If anybody says that that is not a good agreement, I would put it to them that it is.There has been no change in our policy commitment that we gave prior to the last election, but I remind the House in closing that there has been a change in the policy commitment of the Labor opposition which they did not tell the voters of McMillan, they did not tell the voters of Braddon, they did not tell the voters of Paterson and they did not tell the voters of Bendigo about. When they find out, I predict they will take the revenge they are entitled to. - </DOC>

 - Mr Speaker -  - Mr Speaker, can I first advise the opposition that indeed it was a joint press release, and I certainly have policy responsibilities in this area. As the minister said last week, we will be totally exempting Defence personnel housing from reporting on individuals' group certificates. That is very good news for defence families, and it has been welcomed by this side of the House. I would also like to quote the Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Barrie, who said that the decision:. . . will address the primary concerns of ADF families about the effect on take-home pay due to loss of Government benefits and increased payments such as child support.As for other allowances, I agree with Admiral Barrie:. . . like all Australian taxpayers, ADF personnel should have allowances that are consistent with the rest of the community reported on their Group Certificates.The opposition pretends that they would have exempted all ADF allowances from being reported. If this is true, it is totally irresponsible, and it is certainly bad public policy. I very much doubt whether anyone could justify exempting a general's car that he has for private use as part of his salary package from being reported as a fringe benefit. If that is what you are saying, I do not think the public are on-side with you there. I do not intend to go through the detail of the large number of defence allowances and benefits in the House. -  - But I do want the House to be aware that there are allowances - like car parking, airconditioning in remote areas and entertainment - not reported on individuals' group certificates now. Others that are clear personal benefits, like cheap home loans and private use of Commonwealth cars, quite properly should be included in an individual's total remuneration package and be part of the assessment for other government benefits.This is a complex area, and I have certainly asked the CDF to provide comprehensive information to ADF personnel shortly. By exempting what is around two-thirds of Defence's domestic fringe benefits tax bill from being reported as a fringe benefit against ADF members' group certificates, we on this side of the House have put defence personnel in a uniquely advantageous position.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey for his question and also for his support for Work for the Dole in Whyalla, particularly a recent project sponsored by the University of South Australia that involves community research to produce data for planning social services and business promotion in the Whyalla area. This is one of the many Work for the Dole projects which completely gives the lie to persistent claims from members opposite, including the shadow minister, that Work for the Dole does not give people work related experience.Last week, I happened to be in the electorate of McEwen and I had the pleasure and privilege of launching the Healesville heritage guide. I challenge anyone who might say that Work for the Dole is mickey mouse to have a look at this guide which is a credit to the professionalism of its participants who learned skills in researching, interviewing, writing,  layout and marketing. I am advised that my department has just signed the 1,000th Work for the Dole contract with, in this case, Wollongong City Employment Training for a project for the Lake Illawarra Police Citizens Youth Club. This project will give participants training and experience in painting, plastering, carpentry, rendering, basic welding and tiling. This is not training for training sake, this is not the inappropriate and demoralising training referred to by the member for Melbourne, but it is work experience in extremely valuable and marketable skills. Training is important but attitude is everything, and Work for the Dole is giving young Australians the right stuff for getting a job. -  - A survey of Work for the Dole participants showed that 70 per cent thought that their involvement had improved their work skills. Eighty-five per cent thought that their involvement had increased their determination to get work. A recent Morgan and Banks survey showed that 57 per cent of employers were more likely to employ Work for the Dole participants; 83 per cent of employers said that Work for the Dole increased a participant's chance of getting permanent work. This is a great program. It is one of the signature programs of the Howard government. It is part of the government's mutual obligation principle, which is gaining increasing support from across the community. I noticed the other week that the member for Werriwa said that `unconditional welfare is a crime against the poor'. The member for Werriwa is absolutely right. If the Leader of the Opposition had any concern for policy development he would immediately put the member for Werriwa back on his front bench.</DOC>

He said that the decision `will address the primary concerns of ADF families about the effect on take-home pay due to loss of government benefits and increased payments such as child support'. That is from the Chief of the Defence Force. I also remind the opposition that it was the opposition that introduced FBT, and when they introduced it they specifically exempted the Defence Force from the payment of FBT as part of those arrangements. That was when you were in government but, apparently, in opposition, you have different priorities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his interest in our Tough on Drugs policy and the encouragement we are giving to athletes not only in Australia but right around the world to set a good standard and be good role models for others in our society. In that respect, I welcomed the IOC's recent announcement that blood samples will be collected at the 2000 Games. They are also funding validation studies for the detection of human growth hormone. Both of these measures are consistent with the measures the government has been taking in this area and has been calling for for sometime. The introduction of blood testing sends a clear message to all athletes that drug testing at the Sydney Games will be more thorough than ever. So, if you intend to cheat, Sydney 2000 is not the occasion on which to do it. ASDA will be increasing their tests - there will be up to 6,000 tests next year. In 1998-99, they completed 4,800 tests, which was about 500 more than in the previous financial year.ASDA are also receiving additional funding. In 1998-99, they received an additional $784,000, and they will be receiving an additional $1.1 million in the year 1999-2000 to cover drug testing and education programs in the lead-up to the Sydney 2000 Games. We are also making some very good progress in the detection of EPO, and we are hoping to move this project as well to the validation stage. Our discussions with the IOC at this stage have revealed that it is interested in cooperating with Australia on this project. So we look forward to seeing the last two substances which are options for cheats being closed down in a very tough, thorough and effective drug testing scheme for our Sydney Games in the year 2000.</DOC>

 - I checked this, as the Leader of the Opposition anticipated, in the time that the House has been up. The advice that I have is that, subject to any view that may be expressed by the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, it is quite open to the Auditor-General to have a look at all of this, and I am perfectly happy for him to do so. As far as I am concerned, that is it, and that indicates the transparent attitude of the government.I have also taken the opportunity of refreshing my memory on the advice that I received when I was presented with these recommendations by the two ministers. The advice I received from my department was that it would be appropriate to approve the projects. Furthermore, my department said that approving the projects would greatly enhance the heritage and other assets of the Commonwealth, and that is why I approved them. The Auditor-General is the independent auditor. It is open to him to have a look. He is free to have a look. If it is his judgment, and if the joint parliamentary committee adjudges that it ought to be given a priority look at, he will. That is the beginning and end of the matter.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank my colleague the member for Page for his question. The Ministerial Council on Consumer  Affairs met last Friday in Hobart and a number of items were placed on the agenda. The council is made up of the fair trading and consumer affairs ministers of all the states and territories, together with the fair trading minister of New Zealand and me in my capacity as minister for consumer affairs.The New South Wales representative, Mr John Watkins, asked that two items be specifically addressed on the agenda. The first one was to deal with minimum standards in banking and discussions about an AAPR, an average annual percentage rate - an apple by apple comparison of interest rates - which is in place in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. In the discussions, it became patently clear that the New South Wales Minister for Fair Trading was both ill informed and improperly researched. He obviously came to the meeting trying to use the ministerial council as a political forum rather than trying to find real outcomes in relation to minimum banking standards and petrol pricing. When the Minister for Fair Trading in New South Wales came into the meeting with a so-called 10-point plan on petrol pricing, it was pointed out to him that in fact he had failed three of the 10 points that he was putting forward.In the first place, he talked about mandatory boards outside petrol stations. Why did it take New South Wales three years to implement the recommendation of the ACCC report about the proper display of petrol prices? He was running around the country talking about this great initiative from New South Wales that had taken them only three years to implement, and he was lecturing other states about proper display of pricing in relation to petrol! Why is it that the zoning laws and proper opening hours laws in New South Wales at times lag behind those of other states? Why did Woolworths have to open up a petrol station for Albury 100 kilometres away in Tarcutta? Because they could not get proper zoning in Albury. Here we have the New South Wales Labor minister, John Watkins, coming into a federal council meeting lecturing his Labor Party colleagues from across Australia and lecturing me about proper petrol price disclosure when he in fact  failed his own test. It got to the stage where the Labor chairman of the meeting called Mr Watkins petulant. They were embarrassed. He and the Queensland minister were clearly embarrassed with the behaviour of the representative of the New South Wales Right. Clearly he had not gone to the member for Watson's academy on caucus behaviour.</DOC>

 - The answer to the Leader of the Opposition is that there is no embarrassment for the government on this issue. The only person who is talking embarrassment is the Leader of the Opposition. The projects were approved by me on advice. The projects were recommended to me by the two ministers after taking the advice of the departments and also quite properly, as they had indicated, taking the advice of the National Council for the Centenary of Federation, which is chaired by Mr Dick Smith. - The deputy chairman of the council is a former eminent member of the New South Wales moderate left, Mr Rodney Cavalier, who was an education minister in the New South Wales government. -  - The executive director of that council is a very well-respected former Federal Director of the Liberal Party of  Australia, Mr Tony Eggleton, and the council has on it representatives nominated not only by the Commonwealth but by the various state governments. Unless one takes the view that when you become a minister you cease to have any capacity to apply your own judgment and you must always accept rote-like everything that is put in front of you - I do not accept that view and no self-respecting government ever will: when the Labor Party was in government, it did not take that view - unless you take the view that you can never ever have a judgment of your own which is separate and different from the judgment that may be put forward, you would have followed the attitude taken by the two ministers.I repeat: the Auditor-General has a capacity to investigate. The Auditor-General is the keeper of the ring as far as the rules are concerned. I have indicated that, if it is the desire of the Auditor-General to investigate these projects, investigate them he will. If he decides to do that, speaking for myself and on all the information available to me, I have no concern about that whatever. If that is his judgment, that will occur and we will just see what he produces.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question and indeed his interest in this great tragedy. The Prime Minister has already made some comments about this and I do not really want to add much more to that, suffice it to say that within some brief period of hearing of the disaster we provided $1 million worth of assistance through the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent societies as well as the United Nations, and yesterday we announced that we would provide 1,000 tents, thirty 10,000-litre water tanks and 500 mobile toilets in response to a specific request from the Turkish government to our ambassador. I asked our ambassador at the end of last week if he would speak to the Turkish government  and see whether there was still more we could do over and above what we were doing, obviously taking into consideration the constraints of logistics for Australia, and that was the response. - Over the weekend, I despatched a senior official from Australia's aid agency, AusAID, to assist the embassy in Ankara and to talk to the Turkish authorities about what more we can do. - We obviously will be prepared to provide assistance wherever we can usefully. - Can I just say in conclusion that I do regret that the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs thinks this is a party political issue and an opportunity to have a shot at the government. - The fact that we cautiously look at ways of helping and do not wish to provide assistance in areas that are not wanted is clearly commonsense and commonsense on behalf of the Australian public. - You really are bad, aren't you? You really are low. You are just about as low as a politician gets. - I was only going to say that we look forward to a further report from the AusAID officer from Turkey. On the basis of any further recommendations he may make in consultations with the Turkish government, obviously the government will consider a constructive response. We want to do all we usefully can to help the people of Turkey at this difficult time, and I think it would be appropriate if as a nation we supported this cause not only through the government itself but also through private donations. If people make cash donations in particular, that is an appropriate way of providing support at the community level.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise his great interest in supporting Australia's exporters as they look for new and different marketplaces across the world in times of economic difficulty. Along with Australia's large traditional exports of coal, meat, wheat and dairy products, we are seeing new manufacturers such  as the car industry breaking through the $1 billion barrier in terms of exports. The wine industry has also broken through the $1 billion barrier in exports. The member asked about diversity of Australia's exports. Our government has an Asia Plus strategy for our exports. We are looking beyond the region and beyond Asia to expand our new markets. Interestingly enough, we are now exceeding $4 billion worth of exports into the Middle East market, and it is growing.All these good news stories appear in a new publication put out by Austrade called Trademark in which they identify some of the smaller exporters making headlines and inroads in the international marketplace. Companies like the Sydney based Bluefire Gas Ltd Co. are establishing a very lucrative LPG market in Indonesia. Companies like the Perth based Dome Coffee Shop Co. are establishing a network of shops right across South-East Asia and the Middle East, employing 500 staff worldwide. Interestingly, honey, which is an important commodity in the Middle East, is coming out of Western Australia. All these companies are doing their bit in developing and growing Australia's export marketplace. Our government is going to consistently support and facilitate those operations and work with them to expand our presence in the international marketplace.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde for her question. The company profits survey released last week showed that company profits in Australia are in a very strong state indeed. Company profits rose by 10.3 per cent through the year to the June quarter of 1999 and, on a national accounts basis, they now account for 24 per cent of GDP - one of the highest profit shares on record. Over the last year and a half, company profits have risen steadily, and that has promoted a lot of business confidence and employment opportunities. In addition, the strong position of Australian companies and their profits has underwritten Australians' in  volvement in the share market. Almost 32 per cent of Australians now hold shares, compared with 9.6 per cent in 1986. Total share ownership in Australia is now at 40.3 per cent, which I believe to be the second highest in the world.As profits have grown and increased the wealth of shareholders, they have provided a solid foundation for increased investment and underpinned strong consumption in the Australian economy. Members will be interested to know that the South China Morning Post on 16 August had a feature on Australia and described the Australian economy outlook in these terms:The Australian economy is expected to continue to outperform in a global context this year.Strong profits, low inflation, strong growth, a return of company confidence underpinning consumption, and employment growth means that the Australian economy will continue to outperform in a global context next year and speaks well for the prospects of Australian companies.</DOC>

 - As I have answered the question before, I will just outline it again. I am advised by the CDF that - to use his words - the ADF does have the appropriate medical capacity to support operations. That completely covers the issue as it relates to the  exercises in Australia. If I am advised by the CDF of the adequacy of medical officers, I rely on that. Secondly, I just point to the fact that there are some 74 surgeons and 24 anaesthetists in the reserve forces. These are the people who have contributed to all exercises we have undertaken in the last few years, including those put under command by the Labor government. It is exactly the same procedure and rules, and exactly the same people have been called up for the current exercises. The CDF tells me that he is quite satisfied with the numbers that he currently has.Beyond that, a series of questions was raised before and I might take this opportunity to say a few words. - There were a couple of other issues raised by the member for Cunningham - it was a wide ranging review, as if he had nothing else to do. For the last couple of weeks, he has mostly been attempting to put forward questions which are totally irrelevant. In relation to the early warning plane and the order we put forward with Boeing, that was done completely in accordance with proper procedures. I was briefed before the announcement.I happened to be ill in Brisbane for the final briefing, which is why Air Marshal McCormack did the briefing. That was to provide the technical expertise for members so that they would be fully briefed on the occasion. That information was in the press comment at the time so you should follow these things up and do your own homework before you make comments. - </DOC>

 - I have seen that Productivity Commission report. It vindicates the position the government has taken. We have for some time now been calling for reform in the industry. We have been doing so because we have been concerned at the very high levels of industrial action in the industry which undermines its competitiveness and productivity. It is quite clear from the Productivity Commission report that we still have problems of de facto compulsory unionism. The government is opposed to compulsory unionism and the law provides remedies for breaches of those provisions.We are also concerned that you have deals between big companies and the unions and that the people who get squeezed are the small businesses who, as the report notes, provide most of the employment in the industry. Further, when you read the report carefully, it notes the fact that you get high wage increases not tied to productivity. One of the consequences of this is that we do not have the level of employment in the industry that we might have with a more efficient system. This government has done a lot to promote job creation in the Australian economy and there is no doubt that in this industry more could be done, with a sensible approach, to see jobs created. In fact, as we have said before, we think more young people should be able to get their first job in the building industry. That would be good for them and good for the economy.Lastly, the report notes the importance of small business. That does not need to be said to this side of the House but it is a fact that, if you encourage small business, they go out and create jobs and create prosperity. Reform in this industry is justified so that we get a better deal not just for the taxpayers, who pay  for many of these projects, but also for our small businesses and the unemployed who deserve a fairer go - and a fairer go would be a benefit to everybody.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question, and I acknowledge his very deep interest in providing quality education for all young Australians. When this government came to office, we found that 75 per cent of young indigenous Australians could not read or write adequately. Without literacy and numeracy, it is almost impossible for these young Australians to participate adequately in the wider society. Their parents want them to be literate, but the fact is that these basic skills were neglected in their education. Attendance levels at school were low and were never effectively addressed by the Labor Party.The key things are good literacy, supported by attendance levels which are satisfactory. Attendance will never be satisfactorily addressed unless there is an effort to enlist the aid of parents, the wider communities and indigenous leaders. In April this year, the Commonwealth reached agreement with all the states and territories to undertake additional and concerted efforts to make rapid progress in literacy and numeracy and attendance for young indigenous Australians and to set proper performance targets so that young indigenous students could achieve satisfactory and equitable outcomes by the year 2004.This is a strategy based on the fundamentals of success in education for young indigenous people. It is a strategy which has strong support from indigenous communities, and not just from indigenous communities. I was interested to read in the press this morning the comments of a former Northern Territory Labor leader and former Labor federal minister, Bob Collins. Bob Collins said:This package is absolutely on the mark.He went on to say in a radio interview on Radio 8DDD:For the record, I strongly support Dr Kemp's package. The package is well directed and I may add again it has been welcomed across the Northern Territory from the most important people of all - that is, the Aboriginal teachers and parents that are vitally interested in getting better outcomes for their students.Labor lost the plot when it was in office. We are seeing in policy area after policy area former Labor ministers, and indeed some in the House, acknowledging the fact that it is the coalition that is finally putting in place the practical policies that will address problems that never achieved a satisfactory solution in 13 years of Labor government. The member for Banks, who I notice has just disappeared, would understand exactly what Bob Collins was talking about because we remember his comments -  - You can hear him somewhere. He is down there. Bob Collins has been honest enough to acknowledge the value of  what the coalition is doing in indigenous policy. The coalition is committed to policies that will achieve educational equity and excellent outcomes for all young Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his interest in this area. Aboriginal health is a priority to this government. It is an area in which we have been working away quietly but very hard to try and make a real difference to Aboriginal Australians. In my own travels, all I have ever heard Aboriginal people ask for in Aboriginal health is what many others in Australia take for granted. It is an area where it is easy to be gloomy, but there are also many things happening that make me feel very positive and hopeful. In the funding area, in the last budget, we announced $100 million of new funding over the next four years - $78  million specifically to expand existing services.On the issue of new services, when I became minister, there were 36 Aboriginal communities in Australia that had virtually no access to health care whatsoever. An example of one is in Oak Valley in the member for Grey's electorate. That has 150 permanent residents, but at some times of the year it goes up to 450 permanent residents. In the last three years, we have been able to put in 25 new health care services, with 11 further services being given approval to go ahead.A framework agreement is now in place with every state and territory government in Australia. This means that for the first time we have got a common planning process between the Commonwealth and states or territories. It means that for the first time we have got ATSIC and Aboriginal medical services at the table as legitimate participators. Health ministers only two weeks ago agreed to extend these framework agreements for another three years.We are putting a lot of effort and resources into training health workers, recognising that Aboriginal people do need Aboriginal people themselves to help with health care. We have got 12 new specialist emotional and social wellbeing centres. Three more are in the planning stage, with one of these in the Kimberley regional centres graduating its first certificate holders later this year. We have got 59 new counselling positions. We have got counsellors now for the first time ever in Tasmania working as part of the government's Bringing them home package response.There are coordinated care trials going on in four Aboriginal communities - Wilcannia, Katherine West, Tiwi and Perth/Bunbury. I must say I was surprised and delighted recently that people from the Tiwi trial came down to Canberra to see me just to tell me how well the trial was going, how it had transformed their community -  - The interjection just shows the cynicism and hypocrisy. I am trying to give a serious answer. - It shows the Leader of the Opposition's hypocrisy has no bounds. - The Tiwi trial has in fact been a great success but it was just that: a trial to go for two years. It has been so successful we are looking at arrangements for keeping it going beyond the two years, as the funding was only ever promised for that period of time. I might say the Tiwi trial is an example of something you were incapable of doing in 13 years of government. - Yes, the coordinated care trials were moribund when I came to government because you were incapable of getting the constituency together to do it. You were hopeless and you failed completely at it. For you to try and take the credit for it is contemptible. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I will try to ignore the unparliamentary interjections coming across the table. Finally, in a specific area like sexual health - something that was always said was too difficult to address - in Far North Queensland we now have 70 per cent of the participating Aboriginal populations in screening programs. That is over 1,200 people. Nganampa Health, again in the member for Grey's electorate, has instituted an STD program that has reduced by half the rate of sexually transmitted diseases in the last three years. All in all, it is not anything to be complacent about. There is plenty more that needs to be done, but it is an area where we do have many reasons to be hopeful.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper, because when we were consulting indigenous organisations over this policy initiative, he was very active in that process  and I know he is genuinely concerned about the issue. I should also say as a preliminary comment that the indigenous employment policy obviously stands on its own, but it is a much better policy, when it is complemented by the work being done by the minister for education or the minister for health, to really have a total solution to some of these problems.The community reaction to the employment policy has been very encouraging. As part of it, we have been trying to encourage Australia's big companies to get involved. Twenty-four major national corporations signed a public statement saying they were prepared to do more. Nine companies have actually signed a memorandum with my department in respect of specific projects. In that particular segment of the program, we are looking to get 1,000 new jobs, and we have got in the order of 395 firm commitments for job placements out of those major companies so far. That is a very practical, positive program to assist with job creation.The wage assistance arrangements commenced on 1 July. So far there have been over 100 jobs approved and a further 170 jobs in the pipeline through this initiative. That is going to take a bit of time to gather momentum, but we are well on the way with that. Tenders are currently being assessed for the next Job Network tender round commencing in February next year. That is important because in that next round we have some specific measures for indigenous Australians: improving coverage by creating smaller Job Network catchment areas, encouraging the establishment of indigenous employment specialists and requiring more providers to include indigenous servicing strategies in their documentation. We also have the national cadetship program. That has been sent out to employers. That is in its fairly early days yet, but we have had a very positive reaction to that. Again, that is a really practical thing for companies to do. They want to do it, and with government assistance we can make that program work. We are also making changes with CDEP with the incentive program. That is on track for commencement on 20 September. All this demonstrates that this government has an effective targeted program to provide practical assistance in a way that really helps. For most Australians, whether you are Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander or otherwise, if you can get a job it is a big help to you economically and a big help to you socially, and allows people the dignity of work. It is a long haul but we do have an integrated program. It is an area in which the government is very committed to seeing practical outcomes.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. As he asked me about the situation with the people who were evacuated to Australia from Kosovo, I take the opportunity first to simply say that it was an outstanding effort on behalf of the Australian community, a very professional effort on behalf of the defence forces and the various departments and non-government organisations that were involved, and a generosity of spirit by the Australian community as a whole. I would like to thank my counterpart in the opposition, as well as the patrons and co-patrons who have assisted in the continuing monitoring of their circum  stances here in Australia, for their assistance in the implementation of what I think has been a very significant bipartisan effort that has brought great credit to Australia.You will recall that we did put in place legislation that was designed to ensure that there was a temporary safe haven provided in Australia at the request of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Legislation was enacted to enable them to stay in Australia for a period of three months with provisions for extensions but did not provide opportunities ultimately for a permanent residence outcome. That was very deliberate in terms of the request of the United Nations to us and to support the effort to provide the possibility of a safe return.The fact is that now some three-quarters of a million people or more have returned to Kosovo. From Australia, some 1,200 people have already left and another 300 have indicated that they will be leaving at the end of next week. This is a time when the European winter is approaching. In the context that it is more desirable for people to return and establish their lives more quickly than they might otherwise be able to do, the government has determined that it will pay a winter reconstruction allowance to Kosovo evacuees who return by the end of October. The allowance will be $3,000 per adult and $500 for each child. It will help people who have been anxious about returning because of the loss of their homes, the very considerable destruction and the loss of livelihoods, farms and businesses to undertake rebuilding in the period before the European winter.It does have significance in terms of the costs for Australia. This evacuation has not been inexpensive. It has been an unusual arrangement. Costs have been larger than might ordinarily be the case for a permanent settlement basis in the short term while the costs would be very different over a longer term. So there are advantages to the taxpayer if more people take the opportunity to return now rather than to postpone their decisions.I want to emphasise that the returns have been voluntary. The allowance is not an unusual payment. It is similar to payments provided by other countries that evacuated  people from Kosovo to assist in their return. It does complement the other measures that the government has in place to assist with the rebuilding of Kosovo and to provide people with relevant training, particularly in mine awareness, and assisting in preparation for building and providing first aid skills. These are a range of programs that we have been implementing while the Kosovars have been here and I think they have been very much to their advantage.</DOC>

 - May I thank the honourable member for Robertson for his question and also for his representations on behalf of the poultry producers in his electorate who have  endured difficult times as a result of the outbreak of newcastle disease in his electorate. All honourable members will be aware that something close to two million chickens were destroyed and many farmers have been without livelihood for some considerable time.As a result of the representations by the member for Robertson, the government has taken a number of actions to support the local farmers. Indeed, much of this support has been unprecedented. There have been something like 17 significant disease or pest outbreak incidents in Australia since March 1996, but the Mangrove Mountain chicken growers are the only ones to have received special assistance. Since April, the government has made ex gratia payments available to these producers while their farms are in quarantine. Around 95 farmers have had access to benefits of welfare assistance to enable them to ensure that their families are adequately cared for during these difficult times. In addition, the Commonwealth has provided the largest share of the cost of cleaning up the affected areas and, as a part of the program that is in place - the cost sharing between the Commonwealth and the states - has met its share of the cost associated with the clean up.Some farmers may be eligible for continuing assistance through the Farm Family Restart Scheme. Centrelink has notified all of those farmers who are no longer eligible to receive the ex gratia payments because their farms are no longer under quarantine that they may wish to apply if they feel that they are eligible, and some farmers have taken up that option.There have also been calls in some quarters for exceptional circumstances declarations to be made for that particular area. There is no doubt that this has been an event which has caused considerable difficulties in the area. However, one of the criteria that have been agreed between the Commonwealth and the states is that, before an area can be declared to be under exceptional circumstances, the events must have a longstanding impact. It will take a couple of months before that really can be assessed in this instance. Certainly the government will stand ready to assess any  application that New South Wales may wish to make at that time.I compliment the member for Robertson on his representations on behalf of the growers. All Australians certainly feel for them, for the trouble that they have gone through. Newcastle disease is one of those horrific diseases that it is very important not to have endemic in the nation. There has been considerable cost associated with stamping out this outbreak, but we have also ensured that the growers, the individual affected farmers, have had access to special assistance to enable them to see their way through this tough time.We now call on the suppliers to readily and quickly restock these farms so that they can get back into production. That is a contractual arrangement between the various parties. We believe these properties can continue to produce chickens in the future in a successful and viable way.</DOC>

 - On a quick count through question time, I think this question is about the fifth or sixth on this subject - give or take a bit. You asked another couple yesterday. I simply repeat to the opposition that these projects were consistent with the guidelines for the program. My approval was given on advice. I have already indicated that, if he so chooses, it is open to the Auditor-General of the Commonwealth to examine it. I will continue to say that. That is the government's  position. If the Auditor-General wants to have a look at it, he is free to do so.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her interest in tourism and in growing jobs in regional Australia, especially given recent events in Western Australia, where we have seen jobs decline. This government has put a heavy emphasis on resurrecting jobs in regional Australia, and tourism is one of those industries that can do it. I recently announced the regional tourism guidelines for the 1999-2000 Regional Tourism Program. This is a $16 million program over four years which seeks to give emphasis to tourism product in regional Australia. It is about giving the private sector as well as peak industry bodies or regional tourism or development organisations the opportunity to put forward submissions for ideas which will increase the number of tourists in their area, which will increase the yield from those tourists and which will make them stay longer. That creates jobs in regional Australia.It is an exceptional program. It has been very successful to date. We have seen some significant projects occurring under that. In some areas of Australia, you often have to rely on various icons, such as Ayers Rock, the Three Sisters or Kakadu, to give your region a figurehead. Under this program, regions can get together and come up with an idea or a proposal that is an icon in the tourism industry to bring tourists to that area and develop major tourism industries. The spin-off to small business and employment in the regions is substantial. I recommend the regional tourism guidelines to all of the country electorates on this side of the House. - </DOC>

 - Yesterday the shadow minister for lands and mining in the Gallop state government opposition, the Hon. Mark Neville, resigned from the Labor Party, the Labor opposition and his shadow ministry and has chosen to sit as an Independent. On the ABC Online news, Mr Neville's case was reported in the following words:Mr Neville has quit the ALP after a long-term disenchantment with party decisions on issues such as native title and the forest debate. His decision to  sit as an independent will alter the balance of power in the Upper House and could help the Government pass key legislation.Mr Gallop is, of course, of the Oxford scholars faction, well represented in this place by the Leader of the Opposition. I go on with the quote:But Mr Neville says he still has his electorate in the mining and pastoral region to serve.That is because Dr Gallop thinks his only responsibility in parliament is to the Labor Party. It continues:`I will be representing the people who elected me,' Mr Neville said. `I will be able to represent them now because I can speak on a wide range of issues. I do not think my constituents or people in regional WA will be well served by Geoff Gallop's approach to native title or his approach to the timber industry.'They are the words of a leading and one-time dedicated Labor member of parliament. On the Sattler program, Mr Neville said:God help us - and he is talking about state politicians - they are all chasing the Green vote and they are all trying to out-green the Greens. You can't win all that constituency and not expect to lose a large chunk of blue-collar families and the women who work at home, but who are being totally ignored by the major parties in Western Australia, of course. They are the people who are flirting with - you know - the Pauline Hansons of this world, and they have no major political party representing them. I think that's a major problem. They are all fighting over the same bit of turf, which is not good for our economy, it is not good for jobs and it is not good for ordinary working Australians. - I was just about to say that none of those allegations could be levelled  against the Howard government in terms of our addressing the economy, our addressing jobs and our addressing the rights of all Australians. Mr Neville has given a message to a lot of people who sit opposite in this House that it is not a bad idea to put your working constituents first and not be subject to the rulings of the Oxford scholars faction. It is now clear that the Leader of the Opposition has more interest in the western suburbs of Perth - the salubrious suburbs of that city - than he has in the western suburbs of Sydney.</DOC>

I said in my earlier answer that the ministers had relied inter alia on the advice of the Council for the Centenary of Federation, and you made that perfectly clear in reading the excerpt from the question that I answered yesterday. They got advice from their departments; they got advice from the council for the centenary. In the process, I would correct the Leader of the Opposition when he said that the projects were approved outside the guidelines. Accord  ing to the advice I have, the projects were all within the program guidelines. The Leader of the Opposition should not play fast and loose with the truth.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question and also for his strong support for the Jobs East Area Consultative Committee of the Department of Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. Along with the member for Menzies, the member for Deakin is particularly supportive of Jobs East's coming forum on enhancing job opportunities for mature aged workers.The Regional Assistance Program is a $40 million fund to boost employment in regional areas and in areas of high unemployment by promoting new economic opportunities. It is not a `Canberra knows best' program; it is not public servants picking winners. The money is spent largely on the recommendations of a national network of 58 area consultative committees comprising local business and community leaders. All these committee members are volunteers. They have given up time from busy lives, and I want to thank them all for their contribution to building a better, more fully employed and more inclusive Australia.Last week I announced funding of $2.3 million for nearly 60 projects around Australia, including - I am sure members opposite will be pleased to know - seven projects to promote indigenous employment. These projects included, for instance, a duckweed waste water treatment system for the Boggabilla community in northern New South Wales which will produce a marketable commodity, duckweed, as well as irrigation water. It included a work skills and work experience program near Cloncurry to enable young indigenous job seekers to access work at the new phosphate mine there.The Regional Assistance Program complements other government programs, particularly the Indigenous Employment Program. It is a sign that this is a government in touch with the mainstream of the Australian community and drawing on the experience and wisdom of small business to create the jobs that Australians need.</DOC>

 - I will try to work my way through those five or six questions. Picking up the last question relating to whether we will rule out further changes, it is fascinating that even the opposition's spokesman in today's Financial Review  in a story by Paul Cleary is reported as follows:But the Opposition spokesman for communications, Mr Stephen Smith, said the move represented 'the thin edge of the wedge', which Labor would not have countenanced 'in this term of office'. He said Labor had made a commitment at the last election not to apply 013 charges, but he declined to say if this commitment would be retained in future. Fancy asking us. As he well knows, no-one gives open-ended commitments, including the opposition spokesman himself. - For the information of the House or those who do not know, and I suspect they are more on the other side, this proposal does not impose a charge on residential users. Any proposal to do so would be a fundamentally different proposition and we would take a very different view. The big point is that business can and should contribute to the cost of a business service. Telstra should not have to bear the cost of businesses using the service as a business tool and making hundreds of calls a day. After all, 80 per cent of 013 calls are made by nine per cent of phones.The impact on low level users will be minimal. This is a new charge on mobile phones and on business phones. There are exemptions and appropriate safeguards, as you would rightly expect. Apart from those fixed line residential phones, no charges will apply to directory assistance for a charity, not-for-profit organisations or from payphones. Disabled users will continue to have free access to the directory assistance disability hotline. Telstra have made a number of commitments in return for this new cost. They will answer 70 per cent of calls within 10 seconds. They will provide an Internet starter kit to assist small business to go online and access directory assistance services. Telstra have also undertaken to remove the advertisements from the directory assistance service, a move welcomed by consumer representatives.The simple question is: why should businesses, and farmers for that matter, subsidise the chronic users of the free service? Six out of 10 small business lines made no calls to directory assistance over a two-month period. Of those who did use directory assistance, 64 per cent made less than three calls per month. Some 68 per cent of farmers are residential users with fixed lines and 60 per cent of farmers made no calls to directory assistance  in May of this year. The majority of farming businesses who use directory assistance will pay around 80c per month. This is an eminently sensible and equitable measure with all of the proper safeguards built in.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forrest for his question. No commitment that I made on behalf of the coalition in 1996 was more important than the commitment to spend every effort to reduce the level of youth unemployment in this country. I am delighted to record the fact that, according to the most recent figures, the number of young people unemployed in this country has declined by 5.8 percentage points since March 1996. That achievement is all of a piece of other progress the government has made to reduce the level of unemployment in Australia. We have generated now in the last 3¼ years almost 500,000 new jobs. We have the lowest level of unemployment for more than a decade. We have the lowest number of young people looking for full-time work since 1978. We have the lowest level of long-term unemployed since 1991. In addition to that, we have fought consistently and persistently to achieve the preservation of youth wages to underwrite the simple proposition that, if an employer is required to pay a young person with little experience a wage not consistent with his or her age or experience, that employer will be disinclined to do so.We have argued very strongly that that principle has to be respected. I am delighted that the House of Representatives has now passed legislation that will effectively preserve the jobs of several hundred thousand young Australians. I want to express my thanks and admiration for the work of the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business who has consistently taken up the cudgels and argued the cause of a fair go for young Australians in relation to job prospects.The most important thing about what happened today is not whether one or the other side of politics has shifted its ground; it is that young Australians are the winners. In the end, what matters is whether we in this place do good things for the job prospects of young Australians. In the end, the young of Australia will judge us by that. They will not judge us by our rhetoric or our debating points; they will judge us by results.We are now dealing with a generation of young Australians who react to outcomes. They are not hogtied by ideology, they are interested in outcomes. One of the outcomes they want for their generation is the opportunity to have a job. That is why we committed ourselves to reducing youth unemployment, it is why the minister consistently argued for it, and it is why I applaud the outcome that came from this place this morning. It is an intelligent contribution to the future of young Australians, and that ought to be a source of pride to all of us, whatever our political beliefs.</DOC>

 - Of course I can confirm that GST does not apply to taxes. GST applies - as has been made entirely clear throughout the whole of this process - to goods and services produced. Services which are produced for a fee will be subject to the tax, as is provided in the legislation. In relation to carve-outs, in relation to financial transactions and the like, I have recently put out a discussion paper. We have indicated those matters which will be carve-outs, and I would have thought that, even for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, that would very clearly implement a very good policy, if I may say so - a policy which the Labor Party  has failed to produce. You have never seen a flatter opposition in this place than this opposition over the last week. - I do. Why is it that you have such a pathetic opposition in this place these days? It is because they stand for nothing, they have no policy. All they have been able to do is fight against sensible reform, and they are going nowhere.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. I am delighted to advise the House that legislation now passed through the House of Representatives has permanently exempted junior wage rates from antidiscrimination laws. After fighting this fight now for six years, we have finally achieved our objective: we have finally overturned one of the great mistakes of the Labor administration and finally achieved job security for hundreds of thousands of young  people, marking the culmination of a fantastic campaign which we have run in the interests of jobs for young people. Not only have we now reversed six years of Labor policy, but also for the first time in the history of workplace relations law we have introduced a requirement that the commission, in varying, changing or introducing awards, take into account the need for young people to have jobs and the consequences for young people of youth unemployment. For the first time in the industrial relations system in this country, we have taken the outsiders of the system and given them an official voice in the inside of the system. We have not only reversed six years of Labor policy back to 1993 but, with the introduction of these objects, we now have a better legislative system than that which Australia enjoyed in 1993.Further, we have also enabled the commission to introduce into awards, in industries where they do not currently apply, the system of age based junior rates. The job consequences of that are tremendous for young people, preserving their jobs but also improving their prospects for jobs in the future. This morning, in congratulating the government and enthusiastically endorsing this bill, the Australian Retailers Association said:Had this agreement between the government and the ALP not taken place, young jobs in Australia's largest industry - the retail industry - which employs 50 per cent of the Australian youth work force, would have been devastated.The association's research showed that up to 200,000 jobs would have been at risk had the prohibition on junior rates come into force in June next year. The ACCI, speaking on behalf of employers generally, said:The employment position of young people is already precarious and their employment prospects require strong protection. The agreement reached will provide this protection.This is a great achievement of the Howard government, really making practical reforms for the benefit of young people. Never let it be forgotten that when the Labor Party voted against a bill very similar to that which has gone through today - when they voted against the same provisions, when they voted against having objects in the act to protect young  people - the Leader of the Opposition, on 9 March 1999, said:Now, we had a great victory in the Senate yesterday on one of those things and we're really rather chuffed about it.You might have been chuffed then, but the fact is - and I give credit where credit is due -  - I have always been like that. Thank you, Prime Minister. The opposition will take a heap from the trade union movement. Dougie Cameron is withdrawing $350,000 from you. You are going to cop a lot of flak for reversing your position. You at least had the guts to do what had to be done, but it was only ever done because this government put political pressure on you. Mr Speaker, they were steamrollered by the Industrial Relations Commission. It completely flattened them. This is a great victory for young people.</DOC>

 - I will put the facts on the table. A few weeks after the Leader of the Opposition had made his remarks when the Industrial Relations Commission report came down, I went to the shadow minister and said, `We would be prepared to discuss this with you,' to see whether what he said then was fair dinkum. In the last two or three weeks, the shadow minister came to me with certain amendments and we had a series of discussions about those amendments. Those amendments were changed, as you well know, to reflect the fact that some of them -  -  - I will answer your point. We had legal advice on those amendments. You had to accept - as you did accept, and it is stupid for you to say otherwise - that your proposed amendments were a backdoor reintroduction of the antidiscrimination provisions. Those are the facts. Furthermore, in the amendments that have been accepted today, we not only reached a sensible understanding but also went further than we originally proposed in respect of traineeships and apprenticeships. We appreciated that we needed to enhance the protection from our first bill, and we have gone further in the amendments.The other point I make is that the Labor Party are running a campaign around the country saying, `Just say no,' but yesterday they said yes to us. They said yes to us because the force of our position was demonstrated by the Industrial Relations Commission report, which also demonstrated that their position was completely untenable. There was no way known that any Australian political party could sit back and see young people lose their jobs as a consequence of legislation supported and introduced by the member for Kingsford-Smith. This is one of the great wins that we have had. It is one thing to do a deal with the member for Dickson, but it is another thing to do a deal with the whole frontbench. For young people, it was worth it.</DOC>

 - Not only have we protected the jobs of hundreds of thousands of young people; we have also set up a legislative framework for the commission to examine the question of junior age based rates -  - Which we did want to do and which was part of our original bill. A simple fact which seems to have escaped you is that you can only require the commission to deal with matters of this sort on a case by case basis. We also secured the agreement of the opposition to amend the provisions of the act that relate to award simplification. This is an important matter. We will now encourage employers to make applications to the commission to insert age based junior rates, and the commission will decide those issues on the basis of objects of the act which encourage youth employment and the reduction of youth unemployment.We also have a provision, which you have agreed to - No. 9 - which says that in the award simplification process the commission will take into account particular criteria to protect the jobs of young people. This is spelt out in amendment No. 9. It means that we have a two-stream approach to junior award rates: firstly, by application and, secondly, through the award simplification process. That process is currently under way, and I will be seeking advice from my department on how the government can intervene in the award simplification process to ensure that, where we can quickly introduce junior age based rates into awards, we are able to do so.It is a tremendous outcome to now have a process by which we can proceed to spread age based junior rates where it is appropriate and within the discretion of the commission, as it always and must by law be, and providing an opportunity that was not available. It was not available in 1993. We have a better  policy outcome than was the law in 1993. That is another aspect of what is a great outcome that is not only protecting jobs but also opening the door for more jobs in industries where these award provisions have not been available. If that is a win for the opposition, it is a great win.</DOC>

 - If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition had listened for once in his life, he would have heard me say in answer to the last question that those services which are rendered for a fee are taxable. A fire service which is rendered for a fee can be taxable. I would have thought it was obvious. It is as obvious as buying insurance. It is a service for which you pay a fee and is taxable in the same way that buying a good is taxable - that is, not taxable to the extent that the Australian Labor Party would like goods to be taxable, at their rates of 12, 22, 32 and 47 per cent and the other rates that the Australian Labor Party loves to tax people at, but taxable in a flat rate on a broad base as part of a modernisation of the Australian taxation system to introduce in this country the largest cuts in personal income tax on 1 July next year. We do not shy away from the fact that this is the low tax party, the coalition. It was the Australian Labor Party that fought every inch of the way for the outdated, outmoded, backward looking wholesale sales tax with an outdated, outmoded, backward looking Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his question, and I acknowledge his great interest in assisting young people to get the skills they need to get real jobs. One of the reasons why the number of teenagers in Australia looking for full-time work is the lowest since 1978 is that the government has put in place a comprehensive strategy to address the needs of young people who have found it very difficult to get employment. Amongst those policies is a comprehensive set of policies that give young people the skills they need to convince employers to take them on and give them a job. Amongst those is the establishment for the first time of national literacy standards - standards which were fought all the way by the Labor Party. The Labor Party has never committed itself to the national literacy standards. The government has put in place apprenticeship reforms for the 70 per cent of young people who are not going straight from school to university. The Labor Party is setting out to attack those reforms again and again.The Labor Party have a disgraceful record in relation to youth employment. We have seen today a major backflip on the part of the Labor Party in relation to junior wage rates which they have fought and fought again for six years. The major backflip we have seen is reminiscent of the backflip they finally came to on Work for the Dole. After saying they would amend it to billyo, there was finally a major backflip over there on the other side of the table. They did a triple somersault with pike and changed the Labor Party's position, and that is what we have again today. In the end it shows that, with the government's leadership, the Labor Party can finally come  around to commonsense in the area of youth employment.We still need to see that commitment in relation to literacy standards. We still need to see that commitment in relation to the apprenticeship system. We still need to see that commitment in relation to Work for the Dole. We still need to see that commitment in relation to the Jobs Pathway program which this government has put in place to help school leavers get jobs. In the end, the leadership of this government can even have an impact on the policyless, directionless opposition. They know the basis of their policies is collapsing. They do not have anywhere to go, and perhaps in the end they will agree that we were right all the time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his question and in doing so acknowledge the work that he has done as the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration. Mr Speaker, you will recall that, when this government came to office, we entered into a new agreement for the conduct of monetary policy in Australia between the government and the Reserve Bank. Part of that new agreement was that the governor would make two statements during the year on the conduct of monetary policy and appear twice a year before the House of Representatives standing committee. That was a major step forward in promoting transparency in monetary policy in Australia. -  - The member for Werriwa interjects. I do not know if he still considers himself bound by Labor Party policy, but Labor Party policy was to sue the government for entering into the agreement. The great thinkers of the Labor front bench announced that they were going to take legal action to prevent that agreement from being entered into. - The committee met recently under the chairmanship of the member for Wannon and, I think in a probably glowing assessment of the conduct of economic and monetary policy, drew the government's attention to private savings. This is something that the government has given consideration to, and I would make a couple of points in relation to it. First, until recently, Australian households carried relatively little debt compared with other countries. The leverage of Australian households, even now, although it has risen recently, is below that of the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada. The leverage in the Australian household is now comparable to that of Germany, Sweden and Spain.The second point I would make is that, when you are looking at the leverage or the debt of Australian households, you do not look at it so much against income but against assets. There has been quite a substantial increase in the assets of Australian households over recent periods. From the end of the year to March 1999, household liquid financial assets, excluding super and life offices, stood at 115 per cent of household annual disposable income. With the inclusion of superannuation and life offices, the ratio is around 250 per cent. These ratios comfortably exceed the financial liabilities of 93 per cent. So when you look at the household balance sheet, you have to look at liabilities against assets. The assets of Australian households have been dramatically increasing: as Australian households buy shares, property values go up and the spread of superannuation increases, so you have seen some rise in leverage but a rise in leverage against increasing assets. -  - The third point I would make - which is a point that the governor of the bank made - is that one of the reasons why Australians are borrowing is that interest rates are so low. Interest rates are now as low as they have been in Australia. The Fed in the United States raised official interest rates overnight to 5¼ per cent, which is 50 basis points above official rates here in Australia, which continue to be low. Low official rates with low inflation and low mortgage interest rates give Australians the opportunity to borrow. There is one way to stop people borrowing, and no doubt this would be described by the member for Werriwa as the third way. - Labor very successfully stopped people borrowing in 1989 by putting the home mortgage rate at 17 per cent. That was a really successful policy. The Labor Party decided that they did not want people to borrow, so they whacked the mortgage  interest rate to 17 per cent. And boy, they fixed that problem! They whacked the overdraft rate to 22 per cent. Boy, they really fixed the borrowing problem then! As the then Labor Treasurer said, it was designed to produce a recession. One of the few policies that Labor ever succeeded in was in producing a recession. They set out to produce it and, when it came, the Labor Treasurer, in those immortal words, said that it was the recession that Labor thought Australia had to have. It really fixed the borrowing problem. It fixed the economy. It drove unemployment to 11.2 per cent. The then Minister for Employment was? The then minister for employment with unemployment at 11.2 per cent is the now Leader of the Opposition. Rewarded for his performance on unemployment, they made him Minister for Finance and he presided over two budgets for a cumulative $23 billion deficit. The good news is that, after the last three years of coalition budgeting and debt repayment, we have repaid $24 billion. In other words, in relation to savings, because we have repaid $24 billion we are now getting back to a pre-Beazley situation. It has taken us three years to undo the damage of Beazley as finance minister, but we are now back to a pre-Beazley situation. Of course, the best contribution to savings that a government can make is by building government savings.I received a newsletter recently from the Australian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association, AEEMA. It is a good magazine. It has an article on `Tax reform to boost e-commerce' and an introduction from the new Executive Director of AEEMA, Mr David Epstein, the former chief of staff to the Leader of the Opposition, who writes: `The secretariat of AEEMA is running well. As I write, the yearly accounts are being signed off with a sound surplus.' The only way a Beazley staffer ever gets to announce a surplus is in his post-Beazley employment. Mr David Epstein signing off on a sound surplus down at AEEMA, an opportunity he never had while he was serving the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

The committee comprises strong and independent men and women, led by a strong and independent chairman. I have no doubt that the decision they take will be in the best interests of the parliament.

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question and I also congratulate her on her contribution this morning in the debate. Employers around the country will be saying, as they have already started to ring my office, that this is a great decision for small business and it is a great decision for those employers who want to give young people a job. When you think that there has been a battle for six years to preserve the jobs of young people and to correct the mistakes put in place by the previous Labor government, then obviously from the employers' side they are very pleased with the outcome. Of course, the unions have a different view.  It was only last year, for example, that we saw the headline in the Melbourne Age  on 9 September: `We will scrap junior wage rates declares Beazley.' In fact, I remember that the Leader of the Opposition went to the shoppies union and declared his undying support for the shoppies union and its campaign.So it is no wonder that people like Joe de Bruyn have said what they have said on radio this morning. Joe de Bruyn is no left wing extremist. He is a respected right wing trade union leader who has a real interest in this subject. This is what Joe de Bruyn said this morning on AM:Well we are very disappointed because we feel we have been left high and dry by this deal that has been done.He went on to say something else, which goes to the heart of Labor's attitude dealing with its own constituency:I suppose it just goes to show that you cannot rely upon the Labor Party to represent your point of view in parliament because on this occasion clearly they knew they were going down a different path and they deliberately failed to consult us about it.Why did they deliberately fail to consult the trade unions? Because it was a huge backflip for you to abandon the position that you had. I would have to say that I was on tenterhooks all night. Do you know why? I knew the phone calls were coming in from the ACTU. The one thing I will give you is that at least last night you did not, as you usually do, respond and do the bidding of the ACTU. That I give you credit for. - The shadow minister was right to apologise to the trade unions, as he did in the debate this morning. The reason he did so is that it is a very difficult decision for the Labor Party to abandon a policy they have had for six years and do the right thing. It is a very sensible outcome for young people. But this is where the unions will get into you: it is not just that you have abandoned the  policy, it is not just that you have reversed the policy you have had for six years; it is the fact that you have agreed publicly to set up a better regime for the incorporation of junior rates into awards which currently do not have them. That is a sensible decision. It is the right decision. It means that we have not just corrected the mistakes of the past but we have put in a better policy decision. The reaction around the country clearly will be that this gives young people a chance of a job. That is the right reaction and that is why it is such a good result.</DOC>

 - I can answer the question and advise the House of where we have got to on this issue. I would certainly acknowledge that the member who asked the question has a real interest in it. He represents  an area that would dwarf the size of many European countries. There are people out there, living and producing in some extraordinarily remote parts of the world, for whom distance can now be shrunk to a degree that we would not have dreamt of being possible just a few years ago.I do indeed - as members of the House will - remember our election promise to amend the universal service obligation to provide a digital data service to all Australians of at least 64 kilobits a second. We made that commitment less than a year ago, so less than a year after we made it we have launched today Telstra's Bigpond Advance - a new satellite technology that delivers on that promise and more besides. This is not just a basic service. This is not the sort of service that means that somebody in Arkaroola in the honourable member's electorate who may be studying a course from Charles Sturt University in the member for Riverina's electorate is in a situation where they have to seek information and then wander off and make a cup of tea, kick the dog, and wander around the house, waiting for half an hour to get a response. They will get a response very, very quickly indeed. This is world standard stuff. It is leading edge technology, delivering information at speeds of up to 400 kilobits a second, if the customer so wishes.The government is, furthermore, now finalising the delivery of another part of its election commitment: the arrangements to deliver on our promise to reimburse half the cost of the necessary satellite receiving equipment for the four per cent of people without landline access. So those people will have access at half the cost that they might have been looking at with the commercially prepared purchasing arrangements that will be available. I believe that people will be able to freely access these arrangements without any significant financial pain at all.This subsidy is part of the USO arrangement. As I have indicated, four per cent of Australians have never had access to Internet. Now, all Australians have access, and high-speed access at that. I think this is a very welcome development indeed. It is the first time that a broadband product has been made  available Australia-wide, and for the same price for country people as city people. It is a great example of our commitment. It is a great example of the way we work as a government. It stands in stark contrast to the sorts of commitments we hear from the other side now - after they had 13 years to deliver on a whole range of things that simply never materialised but which are now regularly promised would have somehow or other appeared in the 14th or 15th year. We saw the problem; we have addressed it. I believe that that is the approach that regional Australia wants and needs, and I think that we can be very proud of the achievement we have racked up today with the launching of this commitment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is a very important question, particularly to the constituents in the electorate of Parkes, who so heavily rely on Australia's exports, particularly exports of agricultural commodities and perishable produce out of that food bowl in the centre of New South Wales. Later on this week I will be travelling to Argentina to represent Australia at the Cairns Group ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires, where Australia will chair the Cairns Group. It will be the 19th meeting of the Cairns Group, which is a group of agricultural free trading nations.It is important that we continue our commitment to the process that has been started in the Cairns Group and use this meeting as a vital staging point as we move into our preparations for the WTO meeting and the launch of a new round in Seattle. It should be noted that agriculture is still the most distorted sector of international trade, and that is why the Cairns Group is so important - because the Cairns Group's core goals are to see the abolition of export subsidies and trade distorting domestic support and an improvement in market access. That can only go a long way towards benefiting Australian agricultural and exporting industries.It is important to note that Australia's exporting industries sustain about 1.7 million jobs in Australia, and it is important that we continue to build on that base - particularly in agriculture, when 60 per cent of the jobs in agriculture today rely on exports. The Cairns Group meeting is going to be a vital plank in moving towards our position in developing  the argument for the launch of a new round of the WTO in Seattle, at the end of this year. It is interesting to note that, in the Uruguay Round, the Cairns Group was seen as one of the critical players, along with the US and the EU, in developing the outcomes of that round. I am certainly determined to see that the role that the Cairns Group plays is just as vital in this upcoming round, in launching a new and comprehensive round. It is interesting to note some of the comments that have been made by opposition members with regard to -  - We will come to that in a minute - with regard to what should be achieved out of this round and what should be achieved out of the launch of the WTO round at the end of the year. It was interesting that at the Longreach NFF conference the opposition spokesman on agriculture, the member for Corio, stated that agricultural trade reform needs to be dealt with in isolation, not combined with other sectors like financial services in the next round. The farm sector immediately rebuffed that comment, and the farm lobby group said that agriculture is the most difficult area to reach agreement on and that a sector by sector approach could see agricultural trade reform left in the too-hard basket.Interestingly, that point of view from the farm groups got agreement in another fairly famous speech that the Leader of the Opposition gave at, I think, Monash University, where he said that a political strategy should be under way to ensure that those WTO negotiations are initiated and that they are broadly based. That is a difference of opinion between the Leader of the Opposition and their spokesman on agriculture. Of course we are going to enter into those negotiations to get the best possible deal for Australia's exporters, in the national interest of Australia, because Australia's exporters support those 1.7 million Australian jobs and we want to see those grow by seeing the development of freer and fairer trade, particularly in agricultural commodities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I was delighted recently to announce that the federal government would contribute $300,000 towards a pre-feasibility study of an inland rail link between Melbourne and Brisbane. The Melbourne-Brisbane leg will be the first stage of a proposal advanced and backed by the Australian Transport Energy Corridor Pty Ltd - or, as it is known, ATEC - for a railway from Melbourne to Darwin, a private sector proposal but one which we believe many people would very much like to see happen.The need for a study was identified in fact by a federal government committee established in March of this year. That committee involved Kay Hull, the member for Riverina; Tony Lawler, the member for Parkes; and Ian Macfarlane, the member for Groom. It was very capably chaired, in fact, by the honourable member who asked the question, the member for Longman, Mal Brough. I would  like to take the opportunity to thank the committee for the outstanding work that they have done. They have worked through some very complex issues. They found, I think it is fair to say, huge support in the inland for this proposal - a real belief that, as was said in the Toowoomba Chronicle recently, the project has the capacity to change the face of Australia by bringing population and industry across the Great Dividing Range and regenerating the social and economic future of the inland.As I say, this is a private sector proposal. It is one that crosses state borders and jurisdictions, and is therefore one of national significance. So it is appropriate that, along with the stakeholders and the private sector, the Commonwealth plays a role in helping to coordinate the pre-feasibility stage. I can say, therefore, that we will be setting up a steering committee to work with those stakeholders and with the relevant governments.I would also like to make mention of the fact that the Brough committee very accurately identified that a stumbling block to this and other major projects, particularly in the area of rail, has been a lack of cooperation between the states, the territories and the federal government. This government is determined to overcome those problems. There is a challenge there for the states and the territories. We have been struggling to make progress in some areas of revitalising rail, because we have not had the full cooperation of some of the other governments. I do urge them to look to the national interest as well as to what they perceive to be their state interests in this regard, and to follow the Commonwealth's lead as we look at an estimated doubling of the national freight task - and that cannot all go on our roads - over the next 20 years, as we look to lead a recovery in the future of rail in this country.</DOC>

 - I do thank the member for Robertson for his question because I know of his concern for carers who are looking after people who are in need, particularly respite for the carer who puts in such a tremendous effort to make some quality of life available for the person for whom they care.In the budget we announced a further amount of $82.2 million to provide additional respite care for carers. There will be a $3.8 million allocation each year for four years under this strategy to extend respite care centres, which have proved so effective and so popular with carers to the extent that we have successfully met 50,000 applications for care through those centres. There will be a further allocation of around $14 million per year for each of four years to provide respite for carers who look after people with dementia and particularly challenging behaviours. This is going out to tender to various organisations so that we can see innovative services which will provide care in rural and regional Australia where there is no normal or permanent service. It will allow people to have a mobile service go in and give them care overnight or for a couple of days, which will allow them to go to family outings - the sorts of things that are currently denied them. The third allocation of $1.5 million over four years is to give additional training to volunteers so that the people who assist the carers  in their homes are up to scratch with the latest care available to assist them in that ongoing responsibility that they bear for the people they love.I have to say that with our ageing population, with one in five people over the age of 80 having some form of dementia, this program which we have put in place is innovative, it will be effective and it is certainly much needed. It is part of that emphasis that this government is putting on social policy to improve the quality of life for all Australians.</DOC>

 - We know that the Australian Labor Party will try to jump at every perceived negative, but I am afraid that they draw a blank again, as per usual. The Australian economy is growing at about 4.8 per cent, which of course is faster than the United States, Britain, France, Germany, the OECD, G7 and all of Asia. The government has forecast that in the course of 1999-2000 economic growth will `slow' to about three per cent. Such a slowing would still make Australia probably the fastest growing developed country in the world. The CAPEX figures which were released today illustrate the reason why the government forecast a slowing in the economy. After record years of business investment in the midst of the biggest downturn in the economy that we have seen since the Second World War, the government forecast in its budget that CAPEX would slow in 1999-2000. In fact, we forecast that the rate of increase would be zero. For all those economists who have been saying in recent times that the government would be exceeding its forecasts in 1999-2000, the business investment figures which we see today reinforce the forecast which the government put out. - We forecast this. We did not expect it; we forecast it. - You open up your budget papers, turn to that part called `forecast' and you read it. - That is normally what shadow Treasurers do rather than get themselves engaged fixing up problems with the ACTU, which is comprehensively left out in the cold by the Australian Labor Party. As stated in the budget, the weak international environment has affected business investment,  particularly those parts of the economy exposed to overseas markets. This comes after six years of strong growth which carried business investment as a share of GDP to historical highs. Positive fundamentals continue to underpin investment with strong corporate profits, business confidence and low interest rates. I said yesterday in the House that official interest rates in Australia are now some 50 basis points lower than in the United States. Of course, home mortgage interest rates -  -  - Mr Speaker, he is a hereditary peer! - Mortgage interest rates are at 6½ per cent or a little under from the 10 per cent plus that they were when the government came to office. Data released next week are expected to show that the current account deficit in the June quarter will be somewhere in the sixes as a percentage of GDP, again consistent with a budget forecast of 5½ per cent for 1998-99 as a whole. From 1 April 1999, coking coal producers are receiving prices on average 17 per cent lower in US dollar terms than they were in March, with steaming coal prices down by about 13 per cent on average.Following two years of very solid growth in excess of four per cent on a one per cent inflation rate, with unemployment the lowest in the decade, with mortgage interest rates the lowest since man walked on the moon, with nearly 500,000 new jobs created over the last three years, with a budget now in surplus, with $24 billion of Beazley debt repaid and with a path to eliminate Commonwealth debt by 2003, a slowing in 1999-2000 to around three per cent is forecast before a pick-up with the international economy in 2000-01,  with the introduction of the new taxation system, with personal income tax cuts and with a modernisation of the indirect tax base - all reforms which this government has been putting in place and which will carry Australia into the next century.</DOC>

 - I do have good news for regional Australia. I particularly have good news for the people of Eden-Monaro, who are so magnificently represented in the national parliament by the member who has just asked me the question. I am very pleased to say that the Commonwealth and New South Wales governments have now concluded the Eden Regional Forest Agreement. This is the sixth regional forest agreement to be signed during the time that the government has been office. Between 1992 and 1996, there were no regional forest agreements signed. We have been able to balance the interests of the environment and the interests of employment and industry. We always do, because we believe in jobs. We believe governments have a responsibility to protect and, where possible, to generate jobs in regional Australia. That will happen in relation to the regional forest agreement that has just been signed.Of the six regional forest agreements that have already been signed, almost 1,500 direct jobs are expected to be created, with many more indirect jobs to flow. The six RFAs have added around 850,000 hectares of new reserves, and almost $360 million of new investment in Victoria alone can be traced to the RFA signed in that state. Some 100,000 hectares of new reserves come out of the RFA for Eden. Fifty new jobs will result. Once again, we have achieved a balance between jobs and the environment. We are not unbalanced in our approach. We seek balance. We believe in the environment, and we believe in jobs. We are hitting runs on both grounds. We are hitting boundaries in both games. We are  creating jobs and we are looking after the environment.The reason we do that in regional Australia is in no small measure due to the quality of regional representation in the government ranks. When I look around behind me, I see all of these people who represent in a magnificent way the regional electorates of Australia. There is no finer example than the member for Eden-Monaro, who has campaigned tirelessly for the interests of the people whom he represents. This regional forest agreement is good news for Eden-Monaro. It is more jobs, more investment, more reserves and more win-win outcomes for the people of Eden-Monaro. He deserves a lot of the credit for what has been achieved.</DOC>

 - This man never learns. Part of his problem is that he has bothered to pick up an elderly report - and I use the word advisedly - in a newspaper but has not bothered to follow it through to see what the response is. The response is very simple. The Department of Health and Aged Care gives no such advice. An allegation was also made that there was some evidence that Centrelink had given some advice along those lines. The fact of the matter is that there is some confusion - and obviously in your mind as well - that Centrelink could well be advising people in accordance with the instruction that, where some people are still partnered but are separated by illness, a separate payment  is made to those people which increases the pension entitlement they have.Just so you will know for future reference and you can deal with it, for a single home owner with a family situation where no pension is paid and where the assets are above $250,000, that threshold rises to $426,000 where a person is partnered but separated by illness. In other words, a person who is partnered but separated by illness is treated with compassion, is treated as being in that difficult circumstance for the purposes of the assets test and is in no way conditional upon somebody purporting to be told they have to divorce, which is clearly not the case. - What is required here is that the member who asked the question needs to apologise to the elderly whom he is confusing and upsetting. And, of course, we have a long record of that, don't we? We have a long record from the Labor Party, which went around scaring all the people with mistruths and lies to the extent that the dimmer of the glimmer twins is still trying to learn from the former -  - I would simply say to the opposition that, if they really had the interests of older Australians at heart - particularly those who are separated by illness - they would learn some compassion and not seek to fill them with fear. They should let them know the facts, let them know the truth, so that they are not misled by those who simply want to peddle fear.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her question and interest in this historic process in East Timor. Members of the House will be aware that on Monday the people of East Timor will have a once in a generation opportunity to resolve the problem of East Timor. I can say to the House that there are risks, of course, but the government is cautiously optimistic about the ballot itself on Monday. We are very proud of the role that Australia has played in this historic process - from the Prime Minister to the secretary of my department to our ambassador in Jakarta to the task force in my department and to the many other officials in Australia and abroad who have helped with this process. We are also very proud of the Australians in East Timor including the 107 Australians in the United Nations mission, UNAMET. Those people are very much in our thoughts and we will continue to fully support UNAMET after the ballot has taken place.A difficult and possibly dangerous period still lies ahead. Continuing levels of militia violence and intimidation, especially in the western part of East Timor, are unacceptable. I told Foreign Minister Ali Alatas on Monday  evening that it is absolutely critical that the Indonesian authorities take decisive steps to stop militia violence. The world is watching events in East Timor very carefully and Indonesia's international reputation is very much at stake. In this difficult environment, we are particularly concerned about the safety of the many Australians in East Timor and we are advising them of the potential threats to their safety. The Australian government has also made clear to the Indonesian authorities that any threat of death or injury made against Australians in East Timor is completely unacceptable and that the consequences of any harm befalling an Australian would be very serious indeed.Let me make one final point: this is a tense and difficult time. I urge members of this House and the Senate and the media and other commentators to avoid statements and claims which may be excessive and inflammatory. This is not a time for hyperbole or beat ups for the sake of a headline by anybody. We want to see this ballot happen and happen successfully. We want to see the issue of East Timor, after a generation, resolved once and for all.</DOC>

 - Yes, I am aware of that story that was heard on the press. I am also aware of the action that was taken. Indeed, that particular person, who was in a hospital and was looking to be moved from a hospital to an aged care facility, was offered first -  -  - I find it quite appalling that these people on the other side find that amusing. This 100-year-old veteran was offered alternative places where he could have gone. They were not found to be satisfactory. Subsequently, one was found that was satisfactory, but the veteran has subsequently passed away. That is a cause of sadness for his family. But the fact of the matter is that, before that occurred, he was offered a place but the family did think that they wanted something else. So it was a question of choice. Finally one was found, but unfortunately the veteran died. In other words, proper action was taken -  - No, the place was offered prior to the radio, but the family did not like the place that was offered. Subsequently, one they did like was offered but, unfortunately, he then passed away.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. Only this morning the member was in my office pursuing a defence issue, and I am very appreciative of that. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has made clear, we hope that the upcoming ballot in East Timor will be conducted peacefully and we are generally optimistic about the prospects. However, the security situation in East Timor is tense. There has been continuing violence and intimidation in many parts of East Timor and there is a real risk that the violence could become more widespread in the lead-up to and after the ballot date.There are many Australians in East Timor at present, including those participating in the United Nations mission, aid workers, journalists and, as of today, official observers. The government is concerned about the possibility of violence directed at Australians, and we continue to urge restraint on all parties. Both the foreign minister and I have emphasised to the government of Indonesia in recent days that ensuring security in East Timor remains the responsibility of the Indonesian army and police. The government has urged the Indonesian government, on many occasions, to take the necessary steps to restore law and order in the province and to ensure the safety of Australians. We have also been in close consultation with the United Nations on the situation in East Timor. In addition, the government is taking prudent precautions to ensure the safety of Australians. I have today as a matter of routine precaution directed the Australian Defence Force to be prepared to assist in the evacuation of personnel from East Timor, should that be needed. We are informing the Indonesian government and the United Nations of these preparations. I want to stress that we are making these preparations to allow us to respond in the event that we are called upon to secure the safety of Australians, as we have done in the past whenever unrest in our region has put the safety of Australians at risk.</DOC>

 - In one word, the answer is no. Indeed, the Accreditation Agency can inspect a facility when they wish. Yes, they may take a letter with them but, no, they do not have to give an extended period of notice. They can go when they wish. -  - No, they do not have to give notice. The fact of the matter is this government will not tolerate what you as a government tolerated. This government is demanding that there be a proper standard of care. Under the Labor Party - let me remind the House that in 10 years they closed down four homes. Not only did they not meet their own benchmark for the right number of places to be in place and left us 10,000 places short, which we are making up, but they now have the sheer hypocrisy to come into this place and try to defend a system that they had in place, which left people in nursing homes which quite frankly I will not tolerate. The new system of accreditation has the strong support of the consumer groups. I am delighted to say that I am obliged to the Democrats for working together with us to have a good outcome, so that the new accreditation principles will be in a position to be signed - in all probability - next week. Then we will have in place the new system, which will simply  outlaw the sorts of conditions that you people let stay in place.Let me tell you from a very personal point of view that, having looked at more nursing homes than you obviously ever did when you were in power, there are places where you simply would not have someone you loved be placed. If it is not good enough for my family or your family, it is not good enough for anybody else's family either. That is precisely what, once we have our new system in place, will no longer be tolerated. I welcome these sorts of questions because they allow me to expose the sheer hypocrisy of these people who put up with these sorts of conditions for that length of time and who did nothing about looking after older Australians - their welfare, their dignity and their quality of life.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The practical implications are that we will see the preservation of existing jobs and also the prospect of more jobs being created for young people - and that ought to be welcomed by everybody in the House. This is a very high priority of the government.I thought it was very well summed up by a young lady,Tamarin Herich, who is quoted in the Advertiser  this morning. Talking about the decision on junior rates, she said:I think they should leave the system as it is. It's an incentive for employers to hire young people.She is on a junior wage and sees the benefit of that system in her own circumstances. I think she speaks on behalf of a lot of young people who take the same sensible attitude. Timothy Piper from the Australian retailers said:It's a recognition that the retail industry is helping young people get started. We employ 48 per cent of people aged between 15 and 19. Those figures  wouldn't have been maintained unless this arrangement had gone through.That decision, that policy direction and that leadership of this government have protected literally hundreds of thousands of jobs. We have corrected a mistake made by the Labor Party six years ago, and it is a fantastic win for young people. The Australian Financial Review  said as the heading of its editorial, `A sensible deal on junior pay'. It remarked in passing:The world is moving on. Only the unions are left behind looking ridiculous and irrelevant.Clearly, the unions are not happy. Doug Cameron said that it was a `reprehensible decision'. One of the things that I think annoyed Joe de Bruyn, who is a well respected leader of the largest union in the country, was that the Labor Party was simply not prepared to sit down and have a fair discussion with the ALP affiliates. They did not tell them; they did a deal with us before they even talked to their own mates in the trade union movement. Don Farrell, the national president of the shoppies, said that he was `shocked and appalled' at this decision of the Labor Party.We welcome the decision. Clearly, one of the practical consequences is that it has set off a few ramifications within the Labor Party. I was interested to note this morning that we had the full range of emotions within the Labor Party backbench. First of all, there was confusion. As one Labor backbencher has been reported as saying, `I had people screaming at me down the phone.' We know that was coming from Swanston Street and the ACTU. - On one hand, confusion; on the other, reality. One backbencher, one senior Labor Party figure, has said, `We're not a union bosses party,' - well, that is news to us - `we're a party for workers and their families and they want junior wage rates.' - Mr Speaker, I will happily keep the pain to a limited level: confusion on the one hand, reality on the other and seriously, because it does go to the policy issue, opposition within their own ranks. As one who was not prepared to be named said anonymously, `We're supposed to be on the same side' - referring to the trade unions. There is a pressure on the Labor Party to reverse this position. It seems that the Labor Party has stuck to the agreement that we have got. In fact, so keen is the Labor Party on the agreement that the Leader of the Opposition yesterday said that the words in the amendment were his words. I am happy to accept that; it is not actually true, but if he thinks the words that we have drafted are so good that he is prepared to personally endorse them as  his own that is excellent. Now the trick for him is to stick to it.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would also like to thank the member for Lilley for his question; it has only been 74 questions before I have had one, so it is terrific. I did have a graph myself - but I will not table that - which outlines the cost. It is interesting that the member for Lilley should talk about the rising cost of child care, because for the last three years that the Labor Party was in government the cost of child care went up by 8.5 per cent, compared with four per cent in the last three years we have been in power. The other interesting point - which I know the Prime Minister knows only too well - is that we have actually spent $3 billion over the last three years, which is 20 per cent more than when the ALP was in government. Further, the red on this graph is actually the Labor Party. I do not want to embarrass you -  -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The point I was emphasising is actually that the coalition government have spent more in child care in the last three years - an extra 20 per cent more - than the Labor Party did when they were in government. Further, in the next four-year period there will be $5.3 billion spent in child care - and an extra $600 million when the child-care benefit comes into play at the beginning of the new tax system. So it is absolutely outrageous to say that fees have been increasing more since the coalition have been in government than when the Labor Party were there. My final point is that an extra 230 child-care centres have opened up since we have been in government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and for his interest in the subject. Lifetime Health Cover is a system that rewards people for getting into health care early and maintaining private health cover throughout their lives. It is an important structural reform that will lead to some stability in this industry and help improve the profile of people who have private health insurance. It is a fair system in that it maintains a system of community rating, whereby people are not discriminated against because of their sex, because of their claims history, because of illness or because of age, other than the actual age at which they enter the fund for the first time.I must say that early on I was surprised to have the Labor Party give in-principle support to this. I thought it might be an end to their carping, negative, opportunistic interventions in health. But I must say that I should not have been surprised, because the Labor Party - true to form - is in fact proposing amendments that would destroy the very nature of the proposal. It is very simple, but it does not appear to be something the Labor Party understands: if you are going to offer discounts for people under 30 years of age, you cannot quarantine that to new entrants; you have to give it to existing members as well. There are some 500,000 people under 30 years of age with private health insurance. To give many of them a discount of two per cent a year would mean that you would have to put up premiums for other members to pay for it, because the money that would be forgone by reducing one lot of premiums would have to be paid for by another lot. So the fact is you would put up premiums about three per cent for everyone over 30 years of age to introduce this. That would mean an  other $80 per year for the average person paying for private health insurance if the Labor Party's proposals were implemented.One should not be surprised by this because the Labor Party, of course, have form on putting up the cost of private health insurance premiums. They abolished the bed day subsidy, they took $100 million out of the reinsurance pool, and they reduced the Medicare rebate from 85 per cent to 75 per cent for inpatient services - all of which put up health insurance premiums 30 per cent more than they would have been otherwise. This is another example of the Labor Party not understanding health, and certainly not understanding the private health care sector and, in the words of Graham Richardson, `They really do not like private health.'</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, it is nice to see that the member for Dobell retains his interest in education. I wonder what has provoked the question. The federal government strongly supports quality education for all Australian children in government and non-government schools and so, I believe, does the Kennett government. In fact, the Kennett government is at the forefront of Australia in promoting reform within the government schools sector. As members of the House will know, this government is very strongly committed to making sure that every young Australian can read and write at an adequate level. When we came into office, some 30 per cent of young Australians could not read and write at a satisfactory level after 13 years of Labor.The Victorian Liberal government has put into place what I believe to be the strongest program in Australia to lift literacy levels. In fact, every young Victorian is now required in the early years of schooling to do two hours of study on literacy every school day. I believe that is as a result of the leadership that the federal government has given in this vital area for young Australians. I have also been very pleased to see the commitments by the Kennett government to increased expenditure on schooling in vocational education for the 70 per cent of young people who are not going straight from school to university.The shallow attempt by the opposition to raise the issue of education spending and performance in government schools, in the context of the Victorian election, will be seen for the utter hypocrisy that it is. Unlike the Labor Party, the Liberal Party - state and federal - is committed to results. It is committed to performance and to making sure that young people have opportunities. I am very confident that the Victorian people will be strongly supporting the education policies of the Kennett government.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to receive that question from a very good regional member, the honourable member for Barker. As I indicated to the House last week, during the pre-registration phase of Telstra some 1.8 million Australians pre-registered for the Telstra 2 share offer. That is in addition to the 1.3 million existing shareholders who are automatically pre-registered. This means that some 3.1 million Australians will receive details of the offer, with the prospectus, in a short time. The government will announce details of that offer some time next month.In addition to that the government has, for the first time, appointed local stockbroking firms in regional Australia. This will ensure  that access is given to Australians living outside of our capital cities to participate in the offer. A Western Australian firm, Hartley Poynton, a broadly based Queensland firm, Morgan Stockbroking, and 15 other stockbrokers have been appointed - through a very competitive process - to ensure that regional Australia is given that opportunity.Those regional broking firms have networks that stretch from Cairns and Townsville in the north, right down the east coast to places like Rockhampton, Ipswich and Bundaberg, into northern New South Wales to Ballina, to Newcastle and Erina on the Central Coast and from Wollongong down to Mornington. Going across to the West, Hartley Poynton have offices in Bunbury, Albany and elsewhere in Western Australia. That gives access to people living outside of capital cities, should they wish to participate in the Telstra 2 share offer. The other thing the government is doing to give Australians access to shares is that on this occasion they will be allocating shares through the Internet. That complements the launch by the Deputy Prime Minister yesterday of Telstra's new high speed digital data service Big Pond Advance. This is a major step forward for 19 million Australians because it will give them the opportunity - in terms of price and in terms of speed - to buy shares through the Internet in Telstra 2. This again demonstrates that this government is constantly aware of the needs of regional Australia, and is always willing to respond to those needs, including with the Telstra 2 share offer.</DOC>

 - May I welcome the shadow minister to the dispatch box for the first time since I became Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. - It has taken a very long time for him to get any agricultural issue whatsoever through the Labor Party's question time brief. Of course I am aware that the Victorian government have announced that they intend to deregulate the dairy industry in that state from 1 July next year. That announcement was made very publicly and very loudly, including at the meeting of agriculture ministers in Sydney recently. The dairy industry is responding to that decision and is putting together some proposals as to how the industry should respond to the new regulatory regime that will apply in the nation as a result of Victoria's decision. The government will naturally deal with that package when it is put to us. There is a lot of work being done on it at the present time, and we will deal with those issues at the appropriate time. - Perhaps it might be appropriate, if the honourable member wants to make a constructive contribution to this debate, if he could declare where Labor stands on this matter. - What is their reaction to the regulation of the dairy industry? I can tell you that the state ministers have varying positions, and it would be very interesting to know what your position is. So, when you have got a constructive contribution to make, we will be happy to listen to you.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume for his question because I know of his concern that residents in nursing home or hostel care need proper standards. This report related to a home called Alimar. It was found by the accreditation board to be producing substandard care in October last year. By December last year, we had already put in place sanctions which resulted in funding for eight beds being revoked. An administrator was put in place in January. All the residents were moved to alternative care in February. The home was sold, and it is now being refurbished by new owners. It was certified on 19 August, and there are now patients in that facility. In other words, under this government we are making sure that those people who produce substandard care do not remain in the business - but I need the accreditation principles. Again I say that we have worked with the Democrats to get accreditation principles, and I am very grateful to them for their helpfulness in this endeavour. We look forward to having those in place in about a week's time and then the proper accreditation processes can begin.With regard to the remarks made by the shadow minister about accommodation bonds, I spoke earlier today about hypocrisy - I will  mention it again now. He was concerned with what happens to accommodation bonds. The shadow minister made a comment that he was concerned about the proper use of accommodation fees; that they were being used for capital improvements when they should not be spent for that purpose. And yet this same shadow minister is holding up the legislation in the Senate which provides precisely for the insistence that those accommodation charges be spent on accommodation, retirement of debt or, indeed, care if there is no need for the other two. He has the hypocrisy to complain about protecting the spending of that money when the very bill that provides for its proper expenditure is being held up by the Labor Party. My voice is not going to hold any longer but, believe me, my determination and my anger at the hypocrisy of that lot have no bounds. - </DOC>

On that heroic assumption, the answer to the question is: I would not have thought so but, as you know from other answers I have given, what the Auditor-General does is a matter for the Auditor-General.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for the question. I do not think parliament would be complete this week without some mention of Australia's outstanding sports performance, starting with Greg Alexander's retirement from the Penrith Panthers on Sunday, Kostya Tszyu's great performance, and the world athletics championships in Seville. -  - In relating our performances, special mention must be made of Australia's very own `Thorpedo', Ian Thorpe. He produced a world record beating performance on four occasions this week. In the 400 metres freestyle, he set a new world record of 3 minutes 41.83 seconds. In the 200 metres freestyle he set two records, finally setting a world record of 1 minute 46 seconds. He was joined by his team-mates Grant Hackett, William Kirby and Michael Klim in busting the world record by three seconds in the 4 x 200 metres freestyle to set a new world record of 7 minutes 8.79 seconds.Often when those sorts of world record breaking performances occur at international meets, all sorts of allegations are made regarding those performances. Can I assure the nation that, when we celebrate our victories in the pool, any athlete seeking selection in Australia to be part of the Australian Olympic contingent in the year 2000 and who elects to train in the Australian jurisdiction is subject to the most rigorous drug testing regime in the world.Our athletes' performances are pure performance, and we can celebrate that in a way that is of particular concern to the Australian constituency in this day and age. We are doing everything to ensure that, at the 2000 Games, we provide a very level playing field for our athletes who elect to train in Australia and abide by our rules as opposed to those from other nations.It is appropriate to mention a number of our other athletes in the pool, not just our major names, and they are: Susie O'Neill, Simon Cowley, Regan Harrison, Matthew Dunn, Elli Overton, who has also performed outstandingly well, Josh Watson, Sarah Ryan, Lori Munz, Rebecca Creedy - the list goes on. The Sydney 2000 Games is going to be Australia's year in the pool, and it is going to be pure performance.</DOC>

 - I am very pleased to have a question because I would love to give some analysis of that. The shadow treasurer stands up here, and I am not sure whether it is deliberate or whether it is ignorance, and talks about nominal dollars as if that proves some kind of point. By his analysis, he would be saying the highest GDP ever, in nominal terms; more jobs than ever in Australia, in nominal terms; highest wealth ever, in nominal terms; and highest household savings ever, in nominal terms. One thing we can say when we measure these things in proportion to the economy is that in 1990 we did have the worst current account deficit ever. In 1990 when, we recall, the Labor Party had the economy in recession, the current account deficit was at 6.6 per cent of GDP.I do not want to underestimate the current account deficit today, which is at 5½ per cent of GDP as forecast in the budget, but I would  rather have 5½ per cent of GDP than 6.6 per cent of GDP. In 1990, when the current account peaked at 6.6 per cent of GDP, inflation was at 8.6 per cent. So, to peak a current account and inflation rate of 8.6 per cent, mortgage interest rates were at 17 per cent and unemployment was soon to go to 11 per cent. If we were to have pressure on our current account, I would rather do it on a one per cent inflation rate and I would rather do it on a seven per cent unemployment rate. But, more importantly than that, today's current account deficit showing a peak, as I forecast in the House last week, at 6.2 per cent, is the combined effect of a weakness in export prices and a strong domestic economy. The volume of goods and services exports remained the same but prices were down, by and large. As I said last week in the House, falls in contract prices for bulk commodities, which came into effect on 1 April 1999, were largely as a consequence of the East Asian downturn and the recession in Japan. The yearly current account deficit was, as forecast by the government, at 5½ per cent. And, whilst the government believes this quarter and the next quarter to be the peaks in the current account deficit, we expect the position to improve as Asia picks up during the course of the next year and as the world economy generally picks up in the course of the next year.It is important, at a time when you have pressure on a current account not caused by any domestic imbalance but by a weak external front, that the government maintains a strong savings position. The government is forecasting this year its third year of surplus, having rescued the national accounts from Labor's $10 billion deficits. We are forecasting lifts in productivity and, as the world economy picks up, we would expect this year to be the peak in the current account deficit with the current account deficit unwinding during the course of 1999-2000. It is important that we keep confidence in the domestic Australian economy. I note that the Australian Chamber of Commerce released today a statement in which its chief executive said that `business optimism continues to build'. Business optimism I expect to remain strong  as the world economy recovers, helping our export prices.I want to conclude by saying this: the fact that during the biggest economic downturn of this generation, the biggest economic downturn since the Second World War, Australian exporters maintained their volumes is a massive credit to Australian exporters. We on this side of the House would like to pay tribute to Australian exporters who have, in the face of the biggest international downturn of a generation, maintained their export volumes, done Australia proud and helped contribute to the strength of the Australian economy in an international onslaught.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question and for his unstinting interest in the issue of East Timor and the work that he has done on this issue. As members of the House will know, today is indeed an historic day. Today is the day when the people of East Timor, after a quarter of a century of strife, have the opportunity to express their own views about the future of East Timor. We hope that the day will proceed smoothly and that the great problem of East Timor will finally be resolved through these democratic means.The polling stations opened this morning at 6.30 Dili time - that is, 8.30 Canberra time - across East Timor, so they have now been open for around six hours. The preliminary reports I have received, including a telephone conversation just before question time with Tim Fischer, the leader of the Australian delegation, have been encouraging - that, overall, the situation in East Timor is relatively calm. Apparently voters lined up this morning in great numbers, well before the polling booths opened, to cast their votes. There has been little sign so far of violence or intimidation, particularly in trouble spots such as Maliana. Mr Fischer told me that the  voting procedures are operating very smoothly. Clearly, in terms of assessing the fairness of the ballot, the nature of the procedures is a very important component of that.The government warmly applauds the determination and the resilience of the United Nations on the ground in East Timor for bringing this ballot to fruition. I would single out two people - the leader of UNAMET, Mr Ian Martin, who has done an outstanding job, and the leader of the United Nations civilian police operation, our own Alan Mills, who has won the respect and admiration of all who have dealt with him in East Timor. He is one of many Australians who can be very proud of the role they have played in bringing this ballot about. We should also think of the large number of Australians who are involved in UNAMET - 107 or 108 Australians are involved in UNAMET - and who have worked in very difficult circumstances. They have worked tirelessly to try to help the people of East Timor find themselves in the situation they are in today, able to determine their own future.This is an issue of very great importance to Australia and it is an issue of considerable importance to our part of the world. It will mean a great deal to us if it is resolved in a satisfactory and democratic way. Today is indeed a very historic day and we hope that, by the end of the day, the people of East Timor will have been able to express their views about their future. We will not know what their views are for quite some time as it is our expectation that the results of the ballot will not be announced until around 7 September. </DOC>

 - I am very happy to come in here and talk about how to meet the forecast, I thought I just did. The forecast is 5½ per cent of GDP and last week I said that this quarter it would be in the sixes. In fact, the markets received it as a good sign because it was less than they were expecting. If we want talk about forecasts: how about this for a forecast? `The budget is in surplus.' That statement was made by none other than the then finance minister during an election, when he knew it was $10 billion in deficit.After the 1993 election, when Labor had won an election by fraud - and I was very interested to read Neil Blewett's comments about what was happening in the Cabinet when they knew they were giving out tax cuts that could not be afforded - they commissioned a report by Mr Fitzgerald who said that the most important thing a government could do is build national savings. It was on the back of that that the Labor Party then said they had a mandate to break their election promises - did I say election promise? No, it was not a promise: it was l-a-w, a mandate to break the law, to take away those tax cuts.After they broke the promise about those tax cuts, and after they increased wholesale sales tax, what did they do to increase savings? In 1994-95, as part of an increased savings strategy, after they had taken away tax cuts, they produced a deficit of $17,000 million. In 1995-96, after they had taken away the income tax cuts and increased all wholesale sales tax, they produced an outcome of $10,000 million of deficit. That is a world record performance by the then finance minister - $27 billion in two years - and he said during the campaign that this was a budget in surplus. That is one of the most fraudulent statements in Australian history and the Labor Party rewarded him with its leadership.Since this government has come to office, building national savings to cushion Australia against the current account deficit, we have nearly got rid of the Beazley debt. We have  nearly paid off $24 billion of the Beazley Labor debt. If the Labor Party would get out of the way, and let the country run, we could get rid of Commonwealth debt altogether. The one thing that the Fitzgerald inquiry and report made clear, the one thing that the Labor Party would agree with, is that building public sector savings is the best thing that a government can do in the face of a current account. There you had an experience of $27 billion of deficit and here you have an experience of $24 billion of surplus, with a plan to take Australia into the future and to cushion Australia.I ask this question: where would Australia have been throughout the biggest downturn in our lifetime if Labor had had its hand on the tiller running a $10 billion deficit? Where would Australia have been? The one thing that the Australian people recognise is that, in a time of external challenge, it is much better to have some economic managers in government than the people who brought nothing but fraud and completely false promises to the Australian electorate.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Grey. He has a significant interest in the matter since he represents the people of Port Lincoln and other significant fishing communities in South Australia. Late on Friday night, Australian time, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea handed down a landmark decision calling on Japan to stop its experimental fishing program for southern bluefin tuna. The decision is an important win for Australia in its attempt to conserve and protect the stock of this fish, and this is the first time the tribunal has made an order of this kind. It effectively stops Japan from unilaterally taking thousands of tonnes of tuna beyond previously agreed limits.Members will recall that Japan carried out a unilateral experimental fishing program for southern bluefin tuna last year and again this year, despite Australian objections. But, as I put to the tribunal when I opened Australia's case in Hamburg on 18 August, the experimental program is nothing but commercial fishing under the guise of science. Japan's action has the potential to adversely affect the southern bluefin tuna stocks, which are at historically low levels. In a great step forward that balances protection of the species on the one hand with legitimate managed fishing on the other hand, the tribunal has quite properly prevented Japan from unilaterally increasing its catch beyond the agreed limits.Australia's relationship with Japan is one of our most important international relationships and the government believes that the tribunal's decision will not affect the strength of the relationship, but our action in taking this matter to the tribunal has been vindicated by the tribunal's decision. In concluding, I would like to pay tribute to the team of advisers from the Office of International Law, from the Office of General Counsel within my department and from AFFA who prepared and ran the case.</DOC>

 - Can you see why we love him? We say that the current account deficit will be 5½ per cent and all of a sudden he has discovered that - guess what? When the results came out, it was 5½ per cent. -  - Good heavens, isn't that a terrible thing to do! Just imagine if we had said the budget was going to be in surplus and it came out as a $10 billion deficit. Imagine all the fun you would be having then. This was a finance minister who, during a campaign in February before the March election, said the budget was in surplus. - Three days after the election, Treasury came to me and said the budget was $10 billion in deficit. I looked at them and said, `How could Mr Beazley have possibly said what he did?' and there was an embarrassed silence because nobody was ever sure that Mr Beazley knew what was going on in any event.In relation to the current account deficit, when you are running a strong domestic economy and you are in the biggest downturn of your time - meaning that export values are low - you would expect pressure on your current account. We forecast it. We do not control the prices for Australian commodities. - Are you surprised by that, are you? - In case you didn't know, we are not in charge of the coal price in Japan, nor are we in control of the steel price in Korea, nor are we in control of the nickel price -  - I thought the chief of staff of the Leader of the Opposition would have had a few remedial classes to tell the Labor Party frontbench that we do not control these prices. So, in relation to international export prices, at a time of the biggest downturn in our generation you will get weak export prices. You could try to control your current account - and this was, for a time, Labor Party policy - by running your domes  tic economy into recession. But how would that help people?It has been important to keep our domestic economy running strongly because of external weakness, not to run it down in the face of external weakness. For the Australian economy to be growing at plus four per cent at a time when Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore and New Zealand were in a recession is testament to the importance of running a strong domestic economy. - Why is it that we forecast the current account to come down next year? Because the international economy will pick up. The Australian growth rate will be lesser but the international economy will pick up. That is why, as I said last week, we would expect quarterly current accounts in the sixes in this particular quarter and also in the next quarter but for the year's average to come down.I think any Treasurer would also say that the best thing a government could do at a time of international crisis, apart from keep their domestic economy strong, is keep their budget in surplus. We should never underestimate the importance of putting the Australian budget back into surplus in advance of the Asian downturn. It was one of the best financial decisions this country ever made. It was opposed every step of the way by the Labor Party, who took cheap, populist attacks in relation to expenditure restraint and then said after three years that they had always been in favour of a surplus budget - they just had not been able to produce one.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for this important question. This decision certainly has very significant implications for Australia and for international fishing. May I begin by congratulating the Attorney-General - the Hon. Daryl Williams AC, QC, MP - and his team on this outstanding win. With his characteristic modesty, he underplayed his own role in this very important decision, but he certainly led the Australian team with great dexterity and conviction.This indeed is a landmark decision. It is the beginning of a new era for international fisheries management, and I think Australia can feel well proud of its achievements in this regard. The decision certainly confirms Australia's view that southern bluefin tuna is subject under international law to conservation and management. The challenge for Australia now is to ensure that the fishery is managed in a sustainable way so the Australian bluefin tuna industry can continue to fish the species responsibly, as can other countries around the world which have a legitimate interest in bluefin tuna.The decision is also an important boost to Australia's reputation as an international manager of fisheries, and our standing in this area and our responsibility for managing the fisheries, particularly on the high seas, will be strengthened and become even more important in the years ahead. This decision is also important not just to those who are choosing to fish bluefin tuna but to others who fail to honour the spirit of the agreement in relation to the orange roughy fisheries in the South Tasman Rise and to others who are seeking to ignore the obligations that we all have to ensure that the world's fishing stocks are sustainably managed.No country in the future will be able to claim that they can take greater than their entitlement on the grounds of experimentation. Indeed, Australia will be looking to other nations - Japan, New Zealand and our other colleagues - to work constructively together to ensure that fishing stocks are managed properly in the future.One final comment I would like to make in this regard is that this decision gives new force to the United Nations fish stocks agreement which is currently open for signature. Later this week, I will be introducing legislation into parliament which will be the forerunner to Australia's ratification of this treaty. We will indeed have globally a new management regime in place to ensure that fish stocks, even on the high seas, can be managed sustainably in the interests of all fishing nations of the world.</DOC>

 - I wonder if the Leader of the Opposition could tell me when there was an Asian financial crisis. In 1983? - In 1984? - In 1985? - In 1986? - In 1987? - In 1988? - In 1989? - In 1990? - Mr Speaker, do you know the thing that really was the piece de resistance in Labor Party management? It was when they put the Australian economy into recession in 1990, put the unemployment rate at 11.2 per cent and blew the current account deficit out to 6.6 per cent. Do you know the Asian economic financial crisis in that year? It was a boom. The Labor Party produced a recession in an Asian boom. Imagine what they would have done in an Asian economic crisis!It would have taken consummate skill to produce a recession while Asia was booming, but it is consummate skill which did not  overcome or go past the Creans, the Keltys, the Beazleys and all of the people who were sitting in the Blewett cabinet then reporting on it. Consummate skill: an Asian boom and an Australian recession. Imagine what these guys could have done in an Asian recession. Really, it absolutely defies the imagination. What was the situation of the Australian accounts when we came to office in 1996? After five years of growth, how big was the surplus? The accounts were $10,000 million in deficit.It would strike you passing strange, I would think, that when you can have commentary in the South China Morning Post talking about the strength of the Australian economy, when you can have Paul Krugman calling this the miracle economy of the world, when you can have the Economist -  - When Paul Krugman can call this the miracle economy, when the Economist  can show that we are the fastest growing OECD nation outside small nations like Iceland and Belgium, when the ACCI can say business optimism continues to build, when the whole of the Asian region goes into recession and Australia booms, when our unemployment rate falls to a decade low, the only people who think the Australian economy is going no good are the genii on the frontbench of the Labor Party. I have often said this: people often say that the economic understanding of the Labor Party lies with the member for Werriwa. It is only by comparison. With a frontbench like that, even people like the member for Werriwa are beginning to look like they have understanding.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. In relation to today's net foreign debt figures, members of the House will have seen that net foreign debt in the June quarter fell from $234 billion in the March quarter to $228 billion in the June quarter. Of course, one has to be careful about these amounts, because they bounce around as a result of currency adjustments and the like, and one would not want to refer to nominal terms in relation to foreign debt. If one did, one would have to observe that foreign debt -  -  - Since the Leader of the Opposition interjects as he always does at the critical time, foreign debt in nominal terms between March 1983 and March 1996 increased by 662.4 per cent, but one would not want to rely on that. One should look at foreign debt as a percentage of GDP. The good news is that foreign debt as a percentage of GDP appears to have stabilised. When the government was elected, the net foreign debt to GDP ratio was 38 per cent. Now it is at 38.8 per cent. It is instructive to look at how foreign debt -  -  - He always interjects the loudest when he's going the worst. - When the government was elected, the net foreign debt to GDP ratio was at 38 per cent and it has increased to 38.8 per cent. In 1983, when the Labor Party was elected, the net foreign debt to GDP was 14 per cent and it increased over 13 years to 38 per cent. - Triple! To go back, the Fraser government was elected in 1975 and the debt to GDP ratio was three per cent and increased to 14 per cent under the Fraser government. - The Treasurer who presided over an 11 per cent increase was none other than the member for Bennelong. But let us ask a real question: who presided over a 24 per cent increase from 14 per cent to 38 per cent of GDP? These are not nominals; these are comparing debt to GDPs. What gave this country a problem with foreign debt was the increase from 14 per cent of GDP to 38 per cent of GDP. It was all done under one government. It was done under the government that brought you the recession, the highest unemployment rate, the biggest current account deficit, all measured in percentage terms - the Beazley-Keating Labor government.Having said all of that, there is some good news in addition to the stabilisation of foreign debt. Foreign investment in Australia is still continuing to increase. We would regard that as a positive thing. The debt servicing ratio is low by historical standards. The lowest was in the March quarter of 1999 at 8.8 per cent. Today's debt servicing ratio is about 9.1 per cent, which is well below the peak of 20 per cent in the September quarter of 1990. Having said that, I emphasise again that it is important for the government to build savings in this country. It is important that the government is in the business of savings at a time when there is pressure on the current account and at a time when there is a debt position, even at levels at 38 per cent.The best thing a government can do to build savings is to run surplus budgets. Nothing could be worse for Australia than for the Commonwealth government to be in the business of dissaving as it was from 1990 to 1996. At a time of growth with the budget now in surplus, we have the obligation to maintain our surpluses and to retire debt. We have an opportunity to retire all Commonwealth debt by the year 2003 and all it will take is one little stand of courage from the Leader of the Opposition to say that he will  join hands to build savings. While he opposes the privatisation in relation to Telstra and while he opposes the balancing of the budget, the Leader of the Opposition is no part of the solution. The Leader of the Opposition is the problem.</DOC>

 - As I have said on numbers of occasions, debt servicing ratios were, firstly, higher and, secondly, let's have a guess: was the government in the business of saving or borrowing in 1995? Let's all have a guess. What was the government doing in relation to debt in 1995? -  - As I recall, in 1995 the budget surplus was -  - The budget surplus, as I recall, in 1995 was minus $17,000 million. I repeat, Mr Speaker, minus $17,000 million. - Mr Speaker, he was the man who was in a government which had a $17 billion deficit in the middle of a foreign debt build-up and a current account deficit. Here we have a government which has a budget in surplus and which is retiring debt. It has put $24 billion on the table and has a plan to wipe out Commonwealth debt.The record of the Labor Party defies belief. It defies belief that, at a time when they want to claim about foreign debt, they were adding to debt. They as a government added to debt through their budget position by $17,000 million and that had to be borrowed on domestic and foreign markets.What the Labor Party should have been doing in 1995 - and the Leader of the Opposition knows it - is that it should have been doing what it said it was doing: putting the budget into surplus. That was the right policy. It was only the absolute deceit of the Australian Labor Party to pretend they could do it when they could not; to boast that they had done it when they had not; and then to fight the measures to get the Australian economy back into the situation when they did not.Let's not forget that in 1996 when this government said it was going to build a surplus budget, the Leader of the Opposition appeared with the then Leader of the Democrats in a ride outside Parliament House protesting against expenditure restraints; protesting against a balanced budget - the thing which was required to bring the Australian economy back into the stability which has seen it sail through the Asian financial crisis better than any other economy in this region.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I would like to acknowledge the tremendous work that she does in the electorate of Gilmore in helping young people get good job opportunities. The government has put a particular focus on building up the quality of Australia's vocational education and training system and in expanding opportunities. I am aware of recent comments on the government's achievements in this area. They have come from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which represents 350,000 businesses nation  wide, including the top 100 companies. The chamber has publicly recognised the value of the government's reforms. Mark Paterson, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said:The new national training framework represents a major step forward for this country in giving business access to quality training.Mr Speaker, our record speaks for itself. Nearly 62,000 young people will be assisted through the government's Jobs Pathway program this year. The JPET program will assist 13,700 young people at risk of unemployment to get back to school to get the skills they need, particularly literacy and numeracy skills. The government has put a range of initiatives in place, particularly through the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation through its workplace coordinator projects. Of course, we have noted in this House that youth unemployment is now at its lowest level since records were first kept for teenage full-time unemployment in 1978.I am very pleased to be able to inform the House today that I have just received the latest figures for enrolments in the government's new apprenticeships. At the end of March 1999 there were 232,000 new apprentices in training, up from 204,000 at the end of December. That is an increase of 33,000 in the March quarter. That is some 87,000 more than when the Labor Party was in office. - Thank you, Prime Minister. That is a colossal expansion of opportunities for young people through the government's new apprenticeship system. This achievement is in stark contrast, of course, to what happened when the Labor Party was in office. As we know, in the last year of the Labor government the number of young people in apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades.The Labor Party, in conjunction with the trade union movement, set out to destroy the apprenticeship system by placing the trade unions in charge. They said to the small businesses of this country, `You can't take on a trainee or an apprentice unless you unionise  your business', and businesses in this country were not prepared to do this. They knew Labor's shocking record on vocational education and training. We now know, of course, what the attitude of John Dawkins was to this. He knew the Labor Party was throwing out of school onto the unemployment queues young people who never had the opportunity to do apprenticeships and enter into apprenticeship training while still at school.This government has remedied these problems. We have addressed the huge policy failures that the Labor Party left us when we came to office in 1996. We have remedied the betrayal of a generation of young Australians by the Labor Party, and these latest figures confirm the success of the government's programs.</DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable gentleman's question is no, I have not seen that report. But I am aware of the arguments that have come from the Australian Industry Group about measures relating to research and development, so I will, on this rare occasion, not to be taken as a precedent, accept the representation of the report by the opposition frontbencher without personally checking it. He asks: where are the leading edge exports to come from for the next century? I would say, first and foremost, that they will come from a strongly performing econ  omy. They will come from an economy that follows pro-competitive policies. - He says they're not now. The most remarkable feat of the economic miracle that has been Australia over the last three years has been the capacity of Australian exporters to switch their exports from Asia as Asia went into recession to Europe and North America. That has been as a consequence of the skill of macro-economic management both by the government and by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Overwhelmingly, if you are to build export capacity, you want an economy which is strongly performing, a tax system that takes costs off exports, an industrial relations system that takes costs off exports and a business investment climate which encourages risk taking.The honourable gentleman is aware that, in giving consideration to the recommendations of the Ralph committee, we will want to ensure that we have settings of taxation policy - not only in relation to the generic levels of corporate taxation but also in matters relating to capital gains tax - that encourage risk taking and the accumulation of venture capital. I take heart from the honourable member's question because it means that the Labor Party on this occasion may be constructively engaging itself. It may exercise a hands-across-the-table exercise -  -  - Well, I live in hope! I am in a very charitable mood. I was greatly warmed by Australia's victory on Saturday night in the Bledisloe Cup, and I am feeling very optimistic. All I can say in response to the shadow minister opposite in really saying in code, `We're prepared to sit down and make sure that we have the most pro-investment taxation system coming out of Ralph,' is that I would be delighted if that were his attitude, and I would be delighted to hear the views he has to make certain that we have the most pro-competitive taxation system in this country. The more competitive your taxation system, the greater will be your exports. That is why we brought in the GST, that is why you were wrong to oppose it and that is why you ought to rethink your negative attitude  and join us constructively to have a look at the Ralph report.</DOC>

 - We have had some good questions and some very good answers on this subject. I thank the member for Cook for his question and for his strong support for this great signature program of the Howard government, which is attracting increasing support from all around the community. `I like the scheme,' said a typical Generation-Xer in Saturday's Sydney Morning Herald . Not everyone is as glowing in their support for Work for the Dole as this particular lady,  but I would like to quote from a letter recently sent to the member for Longman byMrs Karen Gryce as an example of what this program can do for young Australians. Mrs Gryce said of one of her sons:. . . had been out of work for 6 months and would just stay at home, sleeping-in till midday . . . His self-esteem and confidence was wearing away as he felt worthless and useless . . . She goes on to say:I would like to let you know - that is the member for Longman - what the program gave our son - he is now a happy, confident person who has not only got a full time job . . .Our son would not have been able to do that one year ago without the confidence and character building this program has given him. My husband and I hope this program can continue to help a lot of other people find their way in life, and just give them a chance.The member for Batman must be getting a lot of letters like this too because he used to call Work for the Dole evil. Now he says that Labor thought of it first. Labor did not think of Work for the Dole or mutual obligation. It thought of Working Nation and programs such as New Work Opportunities with their emphasis on inappropriate and demoralising training. These programs conned people. They conned people into thinking that they had a job when they were on them and they conned people into thinking that they would get a job when they had finished.Last week, my department released the request for tender for the next Work for the Dole tender round to be run by community work coordinators as part of the expansion of this great program to 50,000 places a year. This is part of a big increase in the scope of mutual obligation to cover 300,000 long-term unemployed job seekers every year. As part of this expansion of mutual obligation, school leavers who have been on a benefit for three months, under-25s who have been on unemployment benefits for six months and under-35s who have been on unemployment benefits for 12 months will be required to demonstrate that they are engaged in some form of useful community activity as well as simply looking for a job.Why are we doing this? We are doing it because the best thing that government can do for the long-term unemployed is to restore the social contract and re-engage these people in the mainstream of the community. That is exactly what is happening under this great policy and principle of mutual obligation.</DOC>

 - My department has been in contact with Ferrier-Hodgson, who are the chartered accountants and, as I understand it, the receivers or administrators in respect of Selwyn Mine. The advice I have today is that it is highly likely, but not yet certain, that they will be paid their entitlements. We have sought confirmation from the accountants that the full entitlements will be paid. I can also advise the House that the member for Herbert has been involved in this issue, taking up the concerns of workers. We have had discussions with him and hope to get a resolution of that particular issue sooner rather than later. I should say that this particular mine is not in the coal industry, so it does not fall into the Oakdale situation where the long service leave fund is available for the entitlements.Lastly, I would also say that the government has, as it said it would, released a discussion paper on the question of a national scheme. This is the first time that any government has advanced the cause of workers to set up a scheme which would provide them with  recourse to some of their entitlements. This is a policy direction that no Labor government in 13 years was ever prepared to do anything about. This government has seen not only more jobs for workers but also higher wages for low income workers. Now we are looking to put in place an extension of the safety net scheme, something that we on this side are proud of. We are proud of the fact that we have a government that has an economy working well -  -  - looking after workers interests and providing an appropriate national scheme.</DOC>

 - Might I thank the member for Blair for his constant interest in his areas where there is substantial forestry interests. The Kilcoy council and others have been well represented in their concerns. The Maryborough Chronicle  and the Courier Mail  in Queensland have today reported on the Labor Party's UMR research which set out to survey some 1,200 voters - a very substantial sample - in the Labor held marginal seats of Maryborough, Glasshouse, Mount Ommaney and Springwood. The 1,200 people were asked, amongst other things, how many job losses they would be prepared to accept -  -  - as a balanced outcome of the regional forest agreement process. In the marginal Labor seat of Maryborough, 52 per cent of respondents said that they wanted no job losses. Of course, that is in the context of a sustainably managed industry. Let me say that I can with confidence add another 80 people to that number of 52 per cent - they being my colleagues on this side of the House who also want to deliver regional forest agreements under the rules of the National Forest Policy Statement, and of course with no job losses. They are the circumstances that we will continue to follow.We find now that we have some new senators in the place, including the son of Mr Bill Ludwig, Mr Joe Ludwig from Queensland. He in fact is like some other members I wish to refer to who simply have one message for the electorate and another message down here. Senator Ludwig, prior to his arrival in the Senate, put out a series of press releases telling the workers how committed he was to their cause, but I note that he now is not only voting `for' in the Senate on Labor's unconstitutional amendments to the  Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998  but also speaking, presumably trying to convince himself, about these issues - issues that the Australian Government Solicitor has quite properly identified as mechanisms to kill off the regional forest agreement - and portraying them as some way of trying to fix it. All they have to do is follow the advice of their own colleague the Deputy Premier of Tasmania and pass the legislation without amendment.In closing, let me further point out that in the Examiner newspaper, published in Tasmania on Wednesday, the 25th, the member for Lyons is also in this business of having one message for the electorate and another for this parliament  where he sits in the caucus and votes one way while telling people he is voting in another. What I am talking about is:Lyons Labor MHR Dick Evans [sic] has broken ranks with his federal colleagues to express concern -  - I continue quoting:Mr Adams said that in Labor's Caucus room debate he opposed the proposed amendment that would enable the Democrat-controlled Senate to disallow future agreements.. . .              . . .             . . .'I am talking about future RFAs, and they are in for a rough ride in the Senate,' Mr Adams said yesterday.Premier Jim Bacon - the Labor Premier of Tasmania - said yesterday that Tasmania had a legally binding forestry agreement with the Commonwealth and it would be honoured.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Lilley for his question. -  - Obviously the opposition is not keen to hear the answer, because there is so much disquiet here. But the facts are that, with the disability support pension, the greatest growth rate in people on disabilities  actually happened when the Labor Party was in government in the last three years. This is the whole irony: it went up 22.8 per cent, and in the last three years there has been a growth rate of 15.7 per cent - one-third less, Prime Minister, over the time we have been in government. This is the interesting thing with this great debate which is raging with the Labor Party about DSP: the Labor Party did absolutely nothing about it in its term of government. The great hypocrisy!We do recognise that there are a lot of people on DSP. We want to help these people to maximise their potential to move back into the work force. Indeed, not only will we be looking at encouraging these people through the Employment Assistance Program - and there have been a lot more people on that program in the last three years than when you were in government - but also we want to see those people maximise their potential to move back. There is no such suggestion that we are encouraging people to go on DSP to avoid unemployment. The facts show that, if you are on DSP and looking for work, you are included in the unemployment figures, Member for Lilley.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his question. The member for Mallee can boast of two Bendigo community branches in his electorate, and that is good news for the people of his electorate. The other members that can boast of it are the members for Ballarat, La Trobe, Flinders, Gippsland, Riverina and Farrer - and the member for Farrer particularly asks to be noted because he also has two Bendigo community branches. Before the Labor Party  starts calling for the Auditor-General to investigate the Bendigo Bank, it has also opened up branches in some Labor electorates. The Bendigo Bank now has 13 community branches in both rural and metropolitan areas of Australia. They are opening five new ones in October and they expect to have eight opened by the end of the year.Bendigo Bank together with the credit unions that are opening up new branches across Australia are providing a valuable community service. They are responding to the needs of the local community. That is something that has been a fair allegation against some of the larger banks in Australia over the last few years. That point was made by the Hawker committee in its recent deliberations into the provision of financial services in rural and regional Australia. The good news in this statement is that we have a highly competitive banking environment, and the more competitive it becomes the better off the consumers are. We have a new arrangement involving a supermarket, Woolworths, which will have 650 retail outlets for financial institutions over the next few years.There has been a dramatic change in banking services to the community over the last 10 years. In 1989, there were 30,000 access points for Australians to banking across the country. Today, there are more than a quarter of a million access points for Australians. Saving products have increased from around 600 in product range to around 1,800 in product range. And, importantly, for all those battling home owners out there, in 1989 there were 26 mortgage based products and today there are over 1,700 mortgage based products. That is a dramatic improvement. The best way to do that is to have competition.It is this government that has delivered greater competition through the Wallis reforms, which have proven to be landmark and benchmark reforms and which have been adopted in London as world's best practice. We are delivering to Australian consumers one of the most competitive financial services environments across the world. In the new global environment, Australians can rest  assured that access to local community banking can only get better and better.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank, as always, the member for Lilley for showing interest in this area. This is the report that he is referring to. - I will table it. But, as always, do not let the truth get in the way of good facts. He claims that this particular program had an 80 per cent success rate, but that could not be further from the truth. In April 1999 around 43 per cent of the people in this pilot program actually left the pilot program and only 4.5 per cent obtained work outcomes. You come into this parliament and talk about an 80 per cent rate. You could not be further from the truth. Of course we are looking to try to help people with disabilities and we will have more pilot programs. But we also want to ensure that the pilot programs are best suited to those people to ensure that they can reach their maximum potential.There is obviously this confusion within the opposition not only between the Left and the Right, between the old guard and new guard, but also within the Labor Party. I note that `Melba' - a very reputable column in the Australian - says, `Swan takes a dive'. We know there is this internal struggle between the member for Werriwa and the member for Lilley and maybe the member for Perth, but there is one even within the ALP. This par  ticular article talks about a massive conference they are having. Guess who they are inviting? The shadow minister for family and community services, Wayne Smith - he is obviously making a big impact. And that is a publication from the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Parramatta for drawing to my attention a newspaper report which refers to `Sharing the nation: Telstra float rings in change for investors'. The best part about this newspaper report is the first paragraph, which states that lower income earners and young investors are set to make Australia the world's leading share owning nation.When the Australian Stock Exchange made its annual report recently, it reported that the number of 25- to 34-year-olds investing in the stock market has increased from 32 per cent to 42 per cent in the past two years. Importantly, it added that, over the past four years, the number of women owning shares directly has doubled. Now, 5½ million Australians own shares. That has doubled over the past five years. That means, of course, that we are the second highest share owning nation in the world.The member for Parramatta asked me what initiatives the government has that can further encourage share ownership. The first and  most important initiative is that we are pursuing our privatisation program. Demutualisation and privatisation have had a profound impact on the level of share ownership in Australia. That is good news for people who live in the electorate of Parramatta. The hard work of the Minister for Finance and Administration continues to deliver record numbers of first time share owners. But the most significant initiative that we can put in place for share ownership is to abolish the stamp duty on the transfer of shares.Why is it that, every time we come up with an initiative that delivers more shares to Australia's battlers, the Labor Party opposes it lock, stock and barrel? Stamp duty on the transfer of shares? Labor wants it in; we want it abolished. Distributing more Telstra shares to the people of Australia? We want it in; the Labor Party wants to stop it. Every attempt we have made to increase share ownership to give greater wealth to Australian people has been opposed by the Labor Party. Their form is poor. Our form is good, and that is delivering greater share ownership to Australia's battlers.</DOC>

 - Indeed, I do enjoy the member for Lilley's questions. In fact, my response in question time yesterday provided the latest information from my department - as opposed to your information, member for Lilley, which was based on 1997 figures. The 80 per cent successful completion quoted by the member for Lilley from page 27 of the interim evaluation released 19 May 1998 is based on only 28 individuals having exited the program. - Just to recap: the 80 per cent successful completions, quoted by the member for Lilley from page 27 of the report he has just waved which was released in May 1998, is based on only 28 individuals who had exited the program out of 187 who had participated at August 1997. The information I quoted yesterday - that is, 30 August - reflected much more recent data from the pilot. In April 1999 there were 1,500 MIFS clients, and at that date only 4.5 per cent had obtained work outcomes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. The government was delighted with the ballot that took place in East Timor yesterday. All members of the House, I am sure, will have seen scenes on television last night and early this morning of people queuing to vote. I think it is fair to say that it is rather a moving thing to see people show such a great passion for democracy. We also applaud the extraordinarily positive atmosphere in which voting took place. There were, I understand, around seven incidents during the course of the day which could be described as incidents of a security nature. But, generally speaking, the voting took place in a very positive atmosphere. Honourable members might be interested to know that there was a very high voter turnout. But they might be particularly interested to note that, according to the United Nations assessments that we have just received, voter turnout was 98.6 per cent of registered voters. That is, I suppose, higher than we would get in a general election here with compulsory voting.Let me continue by paying a couple of tributes. One of them is to the United Nations mission in East Timor, UNAMET, which did so much to make the ballot a success. Let me also say that the Australian government very much appreciates the work that the Indonesian government did, in particular that of President  Habibie, to make this ballot possible in the first place. When it came to polling day, the behaviour of the police and of the Indonesian military was consistent with the obligations that Indonesia undertook on 5 May, under the tripartite agreement.Of course, this is not the end of the process. The counting of the votes will take a week or so - somewhere in that vicinity. Then, from that point onwards, the process moves into the second phase. The Australian government will be happy to provide the United Nations with assistance through the second and the third phases. There will be an increase in United Nations civilian police personnel from around 260 or 270 to 460 in phase 2 - and that begins from this week. Also, there will be an increase in the number of military liaison officers from around 50 to 300. So in the very short term there should be a significant increase in United Nations personnel on the ground of a police and military nature. Over and above that, we will continue to work with the United Nations, the Indonesians and others to see what other sort of role the United Nations can play in East Timor. In conclusion, I am sure all members of this House are simply delighted with the way the ballot was conducted yesterday. We look forward to ensuring that the process moves forward successfully in the future.</DOC>

 - I am glad the member for Lilley has such a keen interest in this. The parliament should be aware that the document he is reading from was the evaluation of that program in August 1997 - over two years ago. The figures that I provided yesterday and the figures that I provided a few minutes ago were from April 1999, and the work outcomes were 4.5 per cent. In a press release issued yesterday the member for Lilley asked, `Which is it, Minister, you can't read or you can't add up?' I have given the figures but the interesting thing is that at least I know what day of the week it is. Do you know why? Yesterday he issued a press release - yesterday was 30 August - and on the press release was Tuesday, 30 June. As far as the MIFS program is concerned, we will continue to evaluate it when the pilot ends in the year 2000.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. As she would know and as members of the House would know, on 1 July 2000 the new tax system comes into effect for Australia. This is the biggest tax overhaul that we have had in federal history. In addition to abolishing wholesale sales tax and replacing it with GST, there are substantial income tax cuts and state indirect taxes will be abolished.It is important for small business and other people to start working now on compliance. The government has set up the New Tax System Advisory Board under the chairmanship of Mr Chris Jordan to work on educational materials. The government, after taking advice from small business and the board and after representations from the members for Longman, Moreton, McPherson and others, has decided to help small business by doub  ling the existing cash accounting turnover threshold to $1 million a year.The New Tax System Advisory Board identified this as something that would be of assistance to business. It means that, if you have a turnover of $1 million a year, you will be able to account for GST on a cash basis. What that means for small business - up to 100,000 small businesses could benefit from this measure - is that they will be taking in the GST, holding it and getting the cash flow benefit of it before they remit it on a quarterly basis. Unlike the wholesale sales tax that the Labor Party is so enamoured of, won't that be a wonderful thing for small business? This is an improvement in relation to small business. Those people that currently do income tax on a cash basis will be able to use that for GST. In addition, the commissioner, either by a class order or individually, will be able to give the right to businesses to account for GST on a cash basis where their turnover is over $1 million.The government has set aside $500 million to assist small business in the implementation of the new tax system. We announced last week another $175 million in immediate write-offs for business for new software or hardware implemented before 1 July to cope with the new tax system. The government's educational campaign is continuing.Nobody would pretend that the biggest tax changes in Australian federal history can be done overnight or can be done without the rearranging of some accounting systems. The government is making sure that every facility is available to small business to make the new tax system one that works not only for small business but also for Australia and creates a modern and efficient tax system - one that can take us through the next century and put behind the outmoded, outdated, complex and inefficient system that we have been carrying since the 1930s.</DOC>

 - I have to confess that I did not see that interview. I am sure it was conducted with the normal skill and panache which characterises that minister. I am absolutely certain that it was. It is true that the government asserts, and I will repeat that assertion today, that over the years a number of states, in response to increased injections of federal money - and I think it is fair to say that on one or two occasions this occurred under the former federal Labor government - have taken money out. You will be aware, Mr Speaker, that on occasions I have had cause to defend the federal government against unreasonable attacks from state governments. I am not going to be deterred from defending the federal government by from attacks by state governments, no matter what source those unreasonable attacks come from or at what time of the year they come. The fact is that I assert on behalf of the federal government that we have done the right thing by the people of Australia so far as health is concerned. We have put more money into states for public hospitals -  - It is a 17 per cent increase. The member for Jagajaga says that is rubbish. We have put a $1.6 billion boost into private health insurance and, for the first time since the middle of the 1980s, we are actually seeing the number of people in private health insurance increase. We have foreshadowed in the Treasurer's budget a doubling of the expenditure on health and medical research in Australia. We are doing our job. As to the particularities of individual state expenditures, I do not carry them in my head and, if there is anything I need to add on the question, I will. </DOC>

 - I am very happy to provide the House with information on innovative new strategies for helping job seekers through the government's highly successful Job Network. These are strategies designed to get employers to think of putting on workers. In particular, I am aware of a number of successful jobs drives in local areas where Job Network members, together with local employers and local media, have tried to provide additional jobs to local job seekers. With the enthusiastic support of the member for Hume, the Goulburn Chamber of Commerce recently ran a `$1 million worth of jobs' drive. The chamber aimed to find jobs paying wages of $1 million a year and they in fact found jobs paying $3 million a year. Since October there have been three jobs drives in the electorate of Gilmore, involving Job Network members, Radio 2ST, the Shoalhaven Area Consultative Committee of my department and local employers. Naturally enough, the excellent local member has lent her prestige to these events. These jobs drives have found 300 jobs worth $8 million a year in wages. There have been two jobs drives on the New South Wales Central Coast, strongly supported by the member for Robertson - drives which have found jobs worth $11 million a year. There has been a jobs drive at Albury-Wodonga, supported by the member for Indi, which has found jobs worth $2 million a year.I should point out that, in all of these areas, unemployment has fallen over the last 12 months. This is what can happen in any electorate; this can happen anywhere. I would appeal to members opposite to support their local Job Network. I would appeal to members opposite to forget the carping of the Leader of the Opposition and support the Job  Network. He might be `large in body and mind', according to Neal Blewett, but he is `flawed by a streak of most un-Churchillian timidity'.I have been asked about obstacles to the success of Job Network, and one of them is the gentleman opposite. Blewett said that, for so outwardly aggressive a figure, Mr Beazley is `extraordinarily timid - fearful of the students, fearful of the bishops, fearful of the public servants'. I say to members opposite that he would be scared of them if they were prepared to support the local Job Network to do the right thing by the job seekers of Australia.</DOC>

But I will add further to that answer by saying that, as far as the relative performances of the Victorian and federal governments are concerned, I have persistently argued that Victoria has had a very fair deal from the federal government, and any criticism made by Mr Kennett of the federal government's performance will, whenever Mr Kennett makes that criticism, be repudiated by me.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mallee for his continuing interest in the pig industry and acknowledge his representations in support of that industry over the years. I have to say that I share his enthusiasm about the future of the pig industry in Australia. Pig  prices are at an 18-month high, and there is new talk of investment in the industry. There can be no doubt at all that the government's $24 million Pork Industry Development Program has played a key role in the turnaround in the pork industry. Last year there was plenty of pessimism, including from many of the industry's own leaders. The ALP opposition spokesman, the member for Burke, was very quick to cry doom and gloom, and he was predicting the demise of the industry. He and the ALP must certainly be feeling a little embarrassed at the present time. I notice the member for Burke hiding up in the back benches. He has even taken to wearing a disguise because of his embarrassment on these issues. -  - The National Pork Industry Development Program has provided real benefits to the Australian pork industry. A $1 million domestic market development program has reversed the declining local consumption of bacon, and in fact local consumption was up by a creditable 3.7 per cent last year. But it has perhaps been in the export development program that we have seen the most spectacular successes. A $106,000 program in Japan has resulted in $12.4 million worth of extra sales of chilled pork. Indeed, we expect to sell about $30 million worth of pork products to Japan this year. In Singapore last year Australia sold only $205,000 worth of pork; this year we expect to export more than $30 million worth. These are indeed outstanding achievements and really demonstrate the turnaround in the industry. I am pleased today to announce $1.5 million of funding for a new program for the pork industry to further help boost its international competitiveness and to build a stronger export focus. This program will help develop alliances and networks and will especially help the smaller farmers to take advantage of the new export opportunities that are opening up. I would like to encourage the pork industry to maintain its focus on the expanding markets overseas. The facts are our domestic market is largely mature and the real chances for expansion rest overseas. Any Australian industry that confines itself to our relatively small domestic market limits its potential. So it is in these wonderful export opportunities that the future of the pork industry rests. I would like to commend the member for Mallee and indeed many other members on the government side who resisted the temptation to pursue populist lines when the industry was in trouble a year ago and who recognised the importance of building this export focus. The government's pork industry plan has clearly worked, and it is great to see the pork industry looking at a more optimistic future than it had in the past.</DOC>

 - The doorstop on the Victorian election today speaks volumes for the relevance of the opposition to national political debate. The Leader of the Opposition asked me a question about funding. Do I recollect what Mr Kennett said about Medicare? Yes, I do. I recollect it very well, and the House will recollect the response that I gave. What are we doing to stop anybody who might be minded to undermine Medicare? We are, for example, rejecting national inquiries by the Productivity Commission. We are reasserting our support for Medicare. We are putting $1½ billion into private health insurance. We are adding massively to public investment in medical health and research. In other words, the true  guardians of the Medicare system are those who sit on this side of the House.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Indi, who of course had a major flood in his electorate in 1993. A number of other members have had storm related damage in their electorates including, of course, the member for Cowper in Coffs Harbour and the member for Herbert in Townsville. I will also acknowledge that the member for Cunningham had storm related damage in his electorate only recently. We as a government welcome the statement from the NRMA that it is going to include storm related flood cover in its general insurance policies. It is a very important step forward in a highly competitive market where the NRMA has 20 per cent of market share across Australia and, I understand, over 30 per cent in New South Wales. Storm related damage has a substantial impact on a community, and until now there has been a constant battle between insurance companies and clients about whether their insurance would properly cover the damage inflicted by floods during the course of a storm or after it.I urge other insurance companies to follow suit, to follow the NRMA and introduce storm related cover. I also acknowledge the NRMA's comment that it will be looking at flood related damage and the cost of that being passed on to consumers - which is appropriate - in the form of premiums.The initiatives here come about because of competition in the marketplace; they do not come about because of any detailed proscription from the federal government or state governments forcing insurers to take uncommercial decisions. The best pressure that comes about is because of competition. It is about consumers marching with their feet - going to alternative insurance companies if  they are not providing appropriate levels of cover.The Commonwealth government has undertaken a number of initiatives in the last few years to assist with flood related damage. We have put in place long-term flood preventative measures under the national Landcare program, we have allocated over $3 million per year for risk management and mitigation studies and, as a 1996 election commitment, we have delivered $20 million over three years for flood mitigation measures in rural and regional Australia. The best answer to some of these problems will always be competition in the marketplace. We welcome NRMA's initiative, and we urge other insurers to follow suit.</DOC>

 - This is typical, Mr Speaker, of the sorts of lies that  the Labor Party chooses to put around in this area. - The member on this side is interested in the truth, which is in contradistinction to what the other side is interested in. Only the other day Senator Evans, the shadow minister responsible, and for whom the dimmer of the glimmers acts, put out a press release saying that there were 8,000 places fewer than under the Labor Party. The truth is that we have added, with this current round, close to 6,500 new residential places - that is, 4,000 places already in situ and allocated - and close to another 2,500 that are in this current round. In addition to that, we have increased the number of community aged care packages from around 4,000 places under the previous government to now, with the current round, around 18,000 places. I have introduced a graph in this place on a previous occasion showing how the Labor Party, when they brought in the test of having 100 places per 1,000 people over the age of 70, were 98 per cent compliant. By the time they got to 1996, when they lost office, they were down to 93 per cent compliant. In other words, they left us 10,000 places short.The bottom line is: we have been working to fix up the Labor Party legacy and, by the time we get to the year 2002, we will be over that benchmark and up to 103 places per 1,000 people over the age of 70. In other words, this is an opportunity to put the facts on the record and stop the Labor Party trying to peddle fear, and to say that this government is once again fixing up the mess left by the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - Not only can the dimmer of the glimmer twins not get his facts right but he cannot even draw a decent graph. The fact is that in the last budget of the Labor Party they spent $2.5 billion on residential care. In this last budget, under this government, we have spent $3.5 billion on residential care. That has resulted, as I have said, in an increase of nearly 6,500 residential care places plus an increase of - just to help you with your lack of counting - 4,000 in CACP packages -  - To continue the information which the other side clearly needs -  - If you had listened to the answer to my last question, I told you that we will exceed the ratio. As I said, the Labor Party pulled out $1.5 billion in expenditure, left us 10,000 places short, which we are making up -  -  - Indeed, by the time we reach 2002, we will have 103 as the ratio. -  - In other words, for the increased expenditure from $2.2 billion to $3.5 billion we are fixing up the legacy that this lot left.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Menzies for his interest. He was the chairman of a committee that brought down the excellent report To have and to hold , and he has a very keen interest in family issues. It is true that some recent ABS figures showed an upward movement in the marriage rate, which is encouraging, but an increasing rate of divorce - I note though that the divorce rate declined in 1998. Nevertheless, the government, and I hope the opposition, would like to see the high level of divorce reversed. What the coalition government is all about is trying to secure stronger families and stronger relationships.To that end, the Howard-Anderson government has committed an extra $17.5 million this year for family relationship counselling, which will help over 100,000 people to access the service; $4.2 million for marriage and relationship education to assist couples to prepare for marriage, which will help about 30,000 people; $2.2 million for family relationship skills, which will help around 12,000 people using the service; and $2.1 million for adolescent mediation and family therapy. We anticipate that 18,000 young people and families will utilise this service. We are very much committed, and I certainly am in this portfolio, to ensuring that there are stronger families, which will lead to stronger communities, which is a goal this whole parliament should endorse.</DOC>

 - The answer that I gave you previously is the correct answer. Let me tell you why it is necessary for spot visits to take place. I am very pleased to see that the opposition leader can read. That is very pleasing. Unfortunately, his comprehension does not seem to be as good as his reading. -  - Let me tell you why it is the case. In 10 years, the Labor Party closed down only four homes. There are nursing homes that exist today that ought not to be open. The reason we will continue to have spot checks and the reason I will continue to have published on the Internet the names of residential facilities that do not meet the standard is the same reason that we want exposed the fact that we will not tolerate such care. - Just so that the opposition understand it and understand it well, unlike you when you were in government I will use all the tools at my disposal to ensure that substandard care for older Australians in residential care is not permitted. That includes what we are talking about here - that is, the need for spot checks and publishing on the Internet the names of those people who give substandard care.</DOC>

 - The member for Cowper asks an excellent question. I am very happy to advise the House that earlier today I announced an expansion of Child Support Agency services to regional and rural Australia, from which many members of the coalition and many members of the opposition now will benefit. I am pleased to advise the member for Cowper that the expansion of child support services will dramatically improve the access and availability that parents have to child support agencies. Over the next six months, 20 new child support sites will be set up in Centrelink offices right across Australia. This will significantly benefit the child support clients living in regional and remote  areas and give them face-to-face access with child support officers in the Centrelink offices. This gives it that personalised customer focus where in the past they may have had to travel large distances to metropolitan areas.That fits well with the government's commitment particularly to regional and rural Australia, and indeed to all families and all parents who have to go through the Child Support Agency. This does improve access dramatically. It is a worthy objective, and I certainly encourage all members of the House to contact my office if they wish to know whether they have one in their area.</DOC>

There is no change in the way in which spot checks may take place.

 - The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has received advice from the Australian Government Solicitor and has directed that advice to me as it deals with matters for which I am respon  sible. The department requested of the Australian Government Solicitor advice on amendments put to the Senate by the Australian Labor Party in particular for the obvious reason that, in dealing with this legislation, it is a good idea to know whether, for instance, those proposals are constitutional. I have here that advice and I intend to table it, notwithstanding it has been issued to interested parties already. Amongst other things, in referring to a motion put in the Senate to make all regional forest agreements before a certain date subject to disallowance, item 8 of the Australian Government Solicitor advice says:The bill, if amended as proposed, would then confer on the houses of parliament an unlimited discretion whether to permit the Minister to enter into any particular RFA. In these circumstances, it is likely that the bill would be regarded by the High Court as authorising the giving of preference to one region over another contrary to section 99.He goes on to give a reference: Giris Pty Ltd v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1968-69) 119 CLR 365. The bill, if enacted in that form, would then be invalid. He goes on at item 9 of the advice:There is, in our view, no way consistent with section 99, that the existence of an RFA for a region can be made to depend on the RFA surviving a process of parliamentary approval or disallowance. This is the case whether all, or only some, RFAs are subjected to that process.That is a very definite piece of advice from none other than the Australian Government Solicitor in response to a request from a government department. It would seem that that in fact, as other parts of this advice state, could blow the regional forest agreements act out of the water in terms of its intention - and the Labor Party still runs around the electorates in Tasmania and other places saying it actually supports the principles. Of course, it is the CFMEU and others, including the Deputy Premier of Tasmania, who are saying that they support the bill unamended because they too have had similar advice.Further to this, and in answer to the member's question, the fact is that the shadow minister has gone as far as to say that, first, we had the government mislead its legal advisers. I point out to you, Mr Speaker, that  this advice was provided at the request of the department, so that is misleading the public. Secondly, the opposition are running around the place saying they have legal advice contrary to the advice of the government's senior legal advisers, signed off I might add by two persons in that office.There is a simple solution to this problem: let the Labor Party produce their advice under a heading similar to this. They have said before to me, `Where is your advice? Will you table the advice?' Well, here it is. The fact of life is that it is an effort from the Australian Government Solicitor and it can be read by all and sundry as the opportunity arises. As the shadow minister knows, he has got a copy of it now. But okay, what about it? Are you going to put up your advice? I submit this advice to the House.</DOC>

 - I think I might know a bit more about estimates than you do. Let me tell you, just so you understand: the aged care principles are subordinate legislation pursuant to the enabling act. I just read out to you the relevant section of the subordinate legislation which governs the way in which people may behave. As you also know, through you Mr Speaker, government makes policy and bureaucrats carry it out. The policy is that there will be spot checks and that the enabling legislation and the subordinate legislation enable that to take place, as confirmed by the section I just read out to the House a moment ago. I stand by the original  answer I gave as correct, legal and the way it will in fact be carried out.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. One of Australia's significant challenges is to take maximum advantage of the rapid changes in technology in the information arena. I believe that Australia is very well placed to meet that challenge and reap the economic rewards. We do have to recognise, however, that there is a worldwide skills shortage in information technology and telecommunications.Last December the government and the IT industry held its first information technology skills summit. Following that summit, the government announced a package of measures on 29 April to help industries improve their skills base. This package included strategies to gain a better understanding of the IT&amp;T industries' problems, promote IT&amp;T careers, enhance education and training outputs and facilitate immigration of IT&amp;T specialists. Since then, I have recently launched the IT&amp;T training package, which is going to provide flexible options within the area of vocational education and training. The IT industry has recently conducted a survey of skills shortages in the industry, and on Thursday Senator Alston and I will be meeting with industry representatives at the second IT skills summit here in Canberra.I am pleased to report that Australia's higher education and vocational institutions have responded to the challenge already. Commencements in IT&amp;T higher education courses rose by 26.6 per cent in 1999 and are now 148 per cent higher than they were in that year. In vocational education and training, commencements in higher level courses rose by 57 per cent in the four years to 1998  and at all levels there were approximately 120,000 commencements in IT&amp;T courses. This gives confidence to everyone that Australia will meet the challenge of providing the skills to support the IT&amp;T industry in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question. Today's national accounts for the June quarter showed that growth had moderated for the quarter to 0.2 per cent but showed an average growth throughout the year of 1998-99 as a very strong 4½ per cent. Four and a half per cent was a little above the government's forecast in the May budget of 4¼ per cent and indicates that during the year 1998-99 Australia grew faster than G7, OECD and regional economies. The government has been anticipating a slowdown from 4½ per cent plus rates of growth in 1999-2000. In the May budget, we forecast growth of the order of three per cent. The 0.2 per cent for the June quarter came on the back of a revision upwards of the March quarter to 1.4 per cent, showing trend growth of around 0.9 per cent, which is consistent with those forecasts for 1999-2000.The good news is that the national accounts show that inflation remains subdued in Australia, with the household consumption deflator rising only 0.1 per cent in the June quarter for 1.1 per cent through the year. The government has forecast a slowing in 1999-2000 ahead of a world economic pick-up in 2000-01, which will give external impetus to the Australian economy and allow it to resume somewhat stronger rates of growth in following years as the world economy generally picks up. Today's result is very much consistent with the budget forecast which the government put out. The government will be considering its official forecasts, however, in the context of its midyear review, expected this year to be released in November.</DOC>

Indeed, I am aware that there are a number of documentations, including Social Security Appeals Tribunal documents, which I might add are also given to customers and not just to Centrelink officers. These were found in these wheelie bins. I have asked that Centrelink ensure that there are no breaches and that there are adequate and secure disposal procedures.

 - Our understanding was that the Senate would deal with this matter this week and now we find that, to the convenience of the Labor Party, this issue is not going to be dealt with by the Senate. The shadow minister said this morning that he is having discussions with the Democrats. -  - Why would you be having discussions with the Democrats if you were going to support the legislation, as it went through this House last week? We find that the Labor Party has been having meetings with the ACTU. What do the ACTU say when asked to comment on the meeting? They say, `No comment.' We are entitled to be suspicious about your approach to this issue, particularly when only a week ago you were getting a dusting over by the very same ACTU that yesterday said `no comment' on the issue. There are four members of the shoppies union in the Senate - three of them in the Labor Party, two ex-state secretaries; people dependent on the shoppies for their preselection - and there is every reason to believe, as we believe, that the Labor Party is looking at what it can do to backtrack on last week's deal. - I take the interjection. He said that last week he agreed to his amendments. - Your amendments. Let us accept that they are your amendments. Why would you be contemplating with the Democrats what will transpire in the Senate if you are not thinking of moving away from your so-called amendments? I think it is great that you think they are your amendments. - If they were fair dinkum on this issue, this bill would have gone through the Senate this week, as understood, without any question about the Labor Party supporting Democrat amendments. The shadow minister said this morning that the Labor Party will not be moving any amendments. But, of course, that is not the game, nor is it the proposal from the shoppies union. It is a simple plan: get the Democrats to plant a poisoned pill in our legislation and in that way claw back from the position that you had. - I will tell you the words that we did agree that were your words. Those words were that we would give an undertaking that, once this issue was dealt with last week, that would be the end of the matter. Those were the words that you put to us. It was fair enough that we would agree to them. Why wouldn't we? We got what we wanted. Why would we not want to see certainty in this issue for employers and young people, knowing that the legislative regime was properly in place? Now we find the Labor Party scurrying around the backdoor talking with the Democrats about what amendments the Democrats are going to be moving. - There is no hiding behind the fact that the Labor Party are under a lot of pressure. We know the Leader of the Opposition, from the words of Neal Blewett, has a long history of giving way to the latest bit of pressure put on him. He has had a heap of pressure from the trade union movement and he is sulking around the corridors of this place looking for a clawback for the ACTU as usual. - The member for Batman said:In the world I was brought up in, it also means that when you give your word you honour your word.  - Mr Speaker, this is a pretty simple issue -  - We had an agreement with the Labor Party. I simply make the point that we would like to see the agreement that was reached in this parliament and which was announced publicly, an agreement effectively with the Australian people and particularly young people - Motion (by Mr Beazley) put:That the member be not further heard.The House divided.

 - I am grateful for the opportunity that the question by the Leader of the Opposition presents to set the record straight in this regard. When the concerns of the AFP personnel deployed to East Timor, which are reflected in the article in the Australian  referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, were brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Customs, she immediately asked the Federal Police Commissioner to review them as a matter of urgency. I am advised that the AFP is seeking a further review of the threat assessment, which determines the level of mission allowance paid to not only police but also defence personnel deployed to UNAMET. Travelling allowance will be paid in accordance with the determination of conditions of service made by the commissioner, on which members were fully briefed prior to their deployment. It should be understood that some components of the UN allowance cross-relate with the Australian government allowances. These need to be separated. The short answer is that the members will in fact receive further payment.I am also advised by the commissioner that the AFP did not receive any UN mission subsistence allowance during the member deployment to Darwin. The UN paid the appropriate allowance direct to individual members, in accordance with their normal practice. From the information I have received, AFP personnel have displayed considerable professionalism and courage in the work they are doing for UNAMET. I have been assured that the members will receive  their full entitlements and recognition for the important role that they play.</DOC>

 - First, can I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his question. Let me begin answering his question by saying that the ballot that took place on Monday was an outstanding success, and we are all aware of that, but let us remember one other thing: that ballot cannot be undone. That success is there forever, and we look forward to the results of the ballot being announced, probably over the weekend. To get to the point of the ballot taking place took enormously delicate diplomacy on the part of many countries, obviously from Australia but also from the Secretary-General of the United Nations down. Of course, over and above that, we in this country, as elsewhere, are very concerned about the violence that has taken place over the last couple of days. It is the view of the Australian government that the TNI, the Indonesian military, can and must do more to stop the rampant behaviour of the militias. This morning, our ambassador Mr McCarthy, who is still in East Timor, met with Major General Damiri, who is the commander of the military region which is responsible, inter alia, for East Timor. He is also meeting in the course of today with the military district commander for East Timor, Colonel Muis. In both of these meetings - certainly in the first, which has taken place - he has made and will make very strong representations to the TNI about the events of the last two days.The honourable member asked about peacekeeping. Of course, there has been some discussion and consideration of that issue in this country and in many quarters around the world. Let me make two points about that. The first is that it was always our view and the view of the United Nations and others  that, if we as an international community had made the ballot conditional upon a peacekeeping force over the last six months, the ballot would never have happened. We cannot prove the past, but that was the assessment we made, and I think it is fair to say that that assessment would be shared by the United Nations.It has not been easy to get to the point of the ballot - for a quarter of a century there was not one; finally there has been one and it was, in our view and in the view of the very distinguished observer group from the Australian parliament and from other parts of the community, a pretty good ballot. They will be producing their report, which we hope to publish next week. I do not think we would have ever got there if we had made that ballot conditional upon the insertion of a peacekeeping force. It is important to understand - and it was a point emphasised to the Prime Minister so graphically in Bali at the end of April - that the Indonesians were fiercely opposed to a peacekeeping force being inserted.The ballot, though, has now happened and we are in a particularly sensitive period over the next few days in the lead-up to the announcement of the results. As I said, it is possible that those results could be announced over the weekend. We do need to be very careful what we say during this delicate period, but I do want to say something a little further about this process. If the vote is for independence, there is planning taking place for a United Nations security presence to be brought in place in East Timor. That is a point I have made on a number of occasions. We obviously have been deeply involved in those discussions, and we obviously are prepared to participate in that security operation at whatever level is felt appropriate. The timing of such a presence is obviously a very delicate matter and depends on discussions with and agreement by the key players. The key players are, first and foremost, the parties to the tripartite agreement of 5 May - that is, Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations Secretary-General. This is also a matter that will have to be considered by the United Nations Security Council, but let us never  forget that it will of course have to be subject to the agreement of the Indonesian government. I note in a radio program today that that was a point the Leader of the Opposition - frankly, quite rightly - made.Though I am not accusing the opposition of this, there are some who say a peace enforcement operation should be sent into East Timor. A peace enforcement operation sent into East Timor against the wishes of Indonesia would be tantamount to a military attack on Indonesia, and that is not something this country is going to even contemplate. I do not think any member of this House would want to see us get into that kind of confrontation with Indonesia, and of course it is not sensible.	We are concerned about the security environment. This so far admittedly very difficult process in bringing to fruition the problem of East Timor has been pretty successful, but we are absolutely determined that it can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion because that is in our interests, that is in Indonesia's interests and that is in the interests of the security of our part of the world.</DOC>

 - The government is of course aware that there are difficulties for people who as employees find themselves in the situation where a company goes insolvent and their entitlements are not met. I do not have all the particulars of that case and I have not  myself spoken to the lady but I am very happy to do so. - Where the government is able to assist immediately in these situations, then we are very keen to do so. - For example, in the case of Cobar, the government took the action available to it and something like 85 per cent of entitlements in that case were able to be recovered. It is a fact that in most industries in most situations, unlike Oakdale where there is an industry fund which can be made available - and I am pleased to say to the House that the Oakdale legislation has now passed the Senate so those workers will receive their entitlements - there is not an industry fund available, nor is there a national scheme available. The reason there is no national scheme available is that, when the Labor Party was in office for 13 years, you did nothing about it. In fact, on our calculations, for the 13 years that Labor was in, there was something like $1,800 million of employee entitlements and not one cent was paid. Not one cent - and you people call yourselves the supporters of the ordinary worker. You never lifted a finger. Not one of Labor's industrial relations ministers was ever actually prepared to stand up and do something for workers. On this side, we have a proud record of looking after the interests of workers. Not only have workers had higher pay in the time we have been in; we have reduced the unemployment rate now to the lowest level it has been in nearly 10 years.Let us not have the hypocrisy of Labor backbenchers talking to us about workers' rights. This government at least acknowledges them. Let me say it would be abroad in the Australian community for people to say, `It doesn't seem quite right that you could be a highly paid executive, leave a company in a parlous state and walk away with millions of  dollars; yet if you are a worker who has done the right thing, worked hard in your business and made profits for your shareholders, in the end you get dudded.' We say that is not right. We say it is time something was done about it, and we intend to do something.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I am most certainly aware of the controversy in New England because of the very strong representations by the member for New England and also by the Deputy Prime Minister to me personally about what is a most outrageous situation. It started four weeks ago when the chief executive officer of the New England Area Health Service issued a memorandum. Miss Christine Kibble made the following claims:The Area Health Service receives no Commonwealth funding under the Australian health care agreements for aged care accommodation provided in public hospitals. In particular, hospitals are ineligible for funding under the Australian health care agreements for care provided to nursing home type patients - that is, people who have been in hospital for more than 35 days and who are not having acute care.She went on to say:Aged persons who require non-acute care only or aged care accommodation should no longer be admitted to public hospitals.So concerned was I about this that I asked for legal advice as to the status of the health care agreements. I would like to read to the House some excerpts from the legal advice I have obtained. It states:.	 public hospitals administered by Area Health Services must admit patients requiring non acute care. While these patients may be charged a fee after 35 days, public hospitals are still required to provide these services.It goes on to say:. 	 the funding provided under the agreement does cover the provisions of care for such patients.One would have to ask themselves why on earth are a chief executive officer and a chairman of an area health service saying things aggressively, openly and publicly that are blatantly wrong and that they know to be blatantly wrong. I have had passed to me a copy of the New England Area Health Service aged care report dated December 1998. This is their own report. It is only nine months old. In this report, one of the items is headed `Nursing home type beds'. Let me read from the report. It says:The issue of nursing home type beds was raised at all site visits. If responsibility for these beds was transferred to the Commonwealth, the facilities would no longer be viable for the state.Two points come out of this. First, the New England Area Health Service's own report of less than nine months ago shows that quite clearly nursing home type beds are their own responsibility. So what the chief executive officer and the chairman are publicly saying is wrong by the report of their own area health service. Second, what Mr Jim Maher and Miss Kibble wish to do, again according to their own report, would make these hospitals no longer viable.The only consequence of doing what Miss Kibble and Mr Maher want to do is the closure of small country hospital beds in the New England Area Health Service area. They know this by their own report and they are dishonestly and unethically trying to shift the blame to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth will not cop this. The very strong representations from the Deputy Prime Minister and the member for New England know this not to be true. Mr Jim Maher has been described to me as a Labor stooge. He should go and talk to the Labor government in New South Wales and get them to fund their responsibilities.</DOC>

 - The fact is that if this business had gone broke when you were in they would have got absolutely nothing. In fact, they would not have even got a recognition that there was a problem if the Labor Party had been in. I did meet with these workers yesterday. We had a long discussion, for an hour or so. To inform the House, for those on this side who are interested in these circumstances, we have been in discussion with the administrator. He is obviously an independent officer. There is some uncertainty about the extent of the assets available. There will apparently be a sale next week. The administrator has said to us that the assets - I presume on a book value - are worth $1.06 million. Obviously, there would be some expectation it will be less than that when the sale is finalised.In terms of the entitlements, his advice to us is that the entitlements were $75,000 or thereabouts for annual leave, $252,000 or thereabouts for long service leave and $347,000 for redundancy, but there is some dispute about the redundancy amount outstanding. The union says it is much more, but the administrator - and I emphasise he is an independent officer - believes it is less, and he has also told us that he is seeking legal advice on the extent of the entitlements. At this point in time on the information we have, there are some assets in the business but we do not know what is likely to be realised. The extent of the outstanding entitlements is yet to be clarified. We would hope that all of the entitlements are paid, but we will not be in a position to know whether that is the case until  the administrator has been able to seek further advice.Of course we share the concerns of these workers. It is a very difficult situation for them. In the agreement, which I have seen part of, there was an agreement struck with the union that there be a fund established. This agreement is six months or eight months old. - They used the agreement making provisions of the act to establish a fund. The employer put $50,000 in and the company had a commitment to put in $5,000 a month. So they did have concerns. Their concerns unfortunately have been realised with what has happened in the last week or so. We will certainly do all within our power to assist them and where the Office of Workplace Services can take the matter further they certainly will. I said to the workers yesterday that we would continue to keep in contact with the administrator to see what assistance we can provide.In respect of the national scheme, we have released a discussion paper. We do take a safety net approach. We think that that is the right way to go. There will be others responding to the discussion paper who will want to put a different point of view to us, but our inclination is obviously a safety net approach. It is also our thinking that that scheme would be prospective in operation. We are hoping to have the matter settled sooner rather than later. Certainly, I would hope to be back to cabinet in due course with a further set of recommendations to deal with the matter.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question and interest in this area. In a debate in the House last  Tuesday some most extraordinary and quite inaccurate comments were made by the shadow minister for health. The basic thesis that was made was that the Prime Minister has stood feebly by while Jeff Kennett has dismantled his hospitals. It is interesting to compare this with the facts about what has happened in terms of hospital funding and hospital outcomes over the last three years. We are interested in outcomes, not merely processes.According to the Commonwealth Grants Commission's figures, since the beginning of the 1996 financial year Victorian government hospital funding has gone up by about 20 per cent in real terms. It is true that hospital funding in Victoria did decline - in the period 1991-92 to 1995-96, when it in fact declined by one-third. The only people who sat feebly on their hands when hospital funding declined was the then Hawke-Keating government and the finance minister, the now opposition leader. He admitted as much in 1996 during the election campaign when he said, `As fast as we put money in, the states pulled money out.' We have been able to overcome this problem. The 20 per cent increase in Victoria's own funding to hospitals in that period bears that out.Rather than total amounts of money, we are far more interested in outcomes. I would like to inform the House of the outcomes in Victorian public hospitals over the last three years. The latest figures only exist to December 1998. - </DOC>

 - The initial question asked by the member for Corio included a statement that is approximately correct. Certainly the Minister for Agriculture in Victoria indicated that it was the intention of that state to deregulate their dairy industry from 30 June next year. There are many members of the government who have concerns about the future of the dairy industry. It is inevitable that, when there is substantial change proposed in an industry, that causes not only some concerns for individual growers but creates anxiety in dairy industry communities. Members of the government are noted for faithfully representing and putting forward the concerns of their farmers and making sure that they are adequately considered when the government addresses issues.The government is working with the dairy industry to develop a response to the decision of the Victorian government to deregulate the industry and the likely subsequent deregulation of other state industries at about the same time. We are working actively on that package. The industry is proposing some innovative ways of addressing those issues. I would expect that once that package is finalised we  will have discussions with the various states about how it can effectively be implemented in the interests of the Australian dairy industry and the rural communities that are so dependent on that vital Australian industry.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes, we have. The answer to the second part of the question is that the government has to date not decided to allocate resources to publicise the case. One of the factors taken into account - one of them - was that the proposition in the ultimate received overwhelming support in the parliament. In the interests of always ensuring that the electorate is fully informed on these matters, I will give thought to the suggestion that is inherent in the honourable gentleman's question. But I would enter a caveat to that response by saying that if the level of disagreement within the parliament is a measure of community view on this issue and also on the issue of a republic, then there is a difference. And, with no disrespect to the honourable gentleman - who, of course, voted against the preamble resolution - my recollection is that it ended up being passed with a very heavy majority in this place. - The caucus is not this place, I am relieved to note. Let me put it another way in terms that even the member for Banks can understand. It is my understanding that the federal parliamentary Labor  Party is not going to oppose the preamble. Is that right? - That is right. So, if the federal parliamentary Labor Party is not going to oppose it and the government is going to support it, I think that is different from the stance taken in relation to the issue of the republic. I will give consideration to what the honourable gentleman said, but I do have to make the point to him that, for the reasons I have outlined, there are some differences. I want the preamble carried because I think it will very effectively express the views of the Australian people on a wide number of issues. I am very keen that it be carried, but I am equally conscious that public money is public money and that none of us should capriciously commit resources to these matters without being satisfied that the expenditure is entirely justified.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for La Trobe for his question, and I acknowledge his continuing interest in quality education for his constituents. The government is very proud to have initiated a major program for quality teaching which will provide professional development for Australia's teachers in a rapidly changing environment. Yesterday, the member for Dobell tried to deliver a killer blow against the government, claiming the government was not going to fund this program. -  - We were terrified to answer these probing questions from the member for Dobell. In fact, he presented me with two  very sharp questions. Why, he asked, was there no money for the program in the schools legislation that came before the parliament yesterday and, secondly, how would the government meet its -  - He is trying to guess what I am going to say. The answer to the first question - why there was no money in the schools legislation before the parliament yesterday - is that the money was appropriated in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) following the budget. Let me just make it clear, in case anyone thinks that we are trying to treat the opposition unfairly in this matter, that following the budget I had my officers brief the member for Dobell on this very point. In June, not satisfied with that, my office sent further briefing material to the member for Dobell clarifying the fact that this appropriation was in Appropriation Bill (No. 1).We realise that the member for Dobell has got a very difficult task. He is carrying solely and alone the Pezzullo-Angley education policy for the Labor Party, the one that the member for Werriwa would not have a bar of. The member for Dobell has got the burden of carrying this. There is a lot of homework to do in the portfolio. Indeed, I see that a small article in the Australian this week said that Michael Lee has found the education portfolio `requires plenty of homework'. Following yesterday's performance, I prescribe two hours of homework a night for the member for Dobell. For the next week, I would start him off on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and, if he does not get up to scratch, the member for Fremantle may find the opening she has been looking for on the front bench.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Indi for his question and his interest in the wine industry. As the honourable member would know, when the High Court struck down state business franchise fees, the Commonwealth, at the request of the states, put a surcharge on wine of 15 per cent - which included for the first time cellar door sales. The money which was recovered from that was paid to the states, and the states, in order to maintain the privileged position of cellar door sales, operated a rebate scheme. As a consequence of the new taxation arrangements, the Commonwealth has guaranteed to the states all revenues that they would have got under the old tax system, including the equivalent of the revenues from the wholesale sales tax, including that tax on wine.As a result of that guarantee, the states are therefore funded to continue to operate their 15 per cent rebate schemes. Every state is funded to continue its 15 per cent rebate scheme on a cellar door sale. Yesterday I wrote to all state Treasurers, indicating to them that the Commonwealth expected them to continue those schemes and to continue them in full. In addition to that, the government agreed, in an exchange of letters with the Australian Democrats back in June of 1999, on a tax exemption for cellar door sales up to $300,000.	The Commonwealth makes it clear that it expects the states to run its 15 per cent rebate in full. In addition to that, where there are cellar door sales which are up to $300,000 and the rebate scheme does not entirely cash the wine equalisation tax out, the Commonwealth will top up the remaining 14 per cent on $300,000 of sales so that, on cellar door sales, all wineries will get the equivalent of an exemption of the 29 per cent up to $300,000 of sales - paid, firstly, from the 15 per cent rebate and, secondly, from the Commonwealth top-up. Where the 15 per cent rebate scheme amounts to the equivalent of the 29 per cent wine equalisation tax on $300,000 of sales, the Commonwealth will not be required to top up.The consequence of this is that cellar door sales will be protected. There will be additional Commonwealth advantage for small wineries who have wholesale sales up to the exemption limit of $300,000; and it will be good for the tourism industry. I want to pay tribute to those people that were active in securing such a fine outcome for the tourist wineries: the member for Indi, who made representations to me; the member for Grey, who made representations; the member for McEwen, who has made many representations; the member for Farrer; and Liberal and coalition members from Western Australia, both in the House and in the Senate.I notice that the member for Kingston, a wine grower, was active on the radio. I found his arguments totally unpersuasive in relation to all of these matters. He failed to disclose, at any stage whatsoever, his own financial interest in the wine industry when he was making those comments and failed to disclose that he was a wine grower. But he informs me that he grows a good red. As befitting the Labor Party, we would expect good reds to come out of the Labor Party -  -  - Now that they are liberated from having any influence. The Leader of the Opposition is like Me and Bobby McGee : `Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose' - with appropriate acknowledgment to Mr Tony Wright of the Age  newspaper, who coined that: Bomber Beazley, Me and Bobby McGee. I want to pay tribute to all of those coalition members who were so influential in securing such a good outcome for the wine industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley for his question and, to put it into context, I will recap where we are. The member for Canning asked me on 26 August:Isn't it a fact that the Commonwealth can no longer carry out surprise inspections of nursing homes and hostels . . . How can you claim to be cracking down on poor quality homes when you have effectively nobbled the powers of the Commonwealth to properly investigate complaints made by residents?The second question was from the member for Lilley on 31 August when he asked:Do you recall telling the House that Commonwealth officers do not have to give notice when carrying out surprise inspections of aged care facilities to look into complaints for poor quality care?My department said in an estimates answer that `conducting 'surprise' visits is not within the spirit of the new collaborative arrangements.' The Leader of the Opposition then took up the theme. - About those things, I have three points I wish to make. The first is that the department was speaking about only one of a range of monitoring powers that is done in cases other than serious cases, as was predicated in the question from the member for Canning when she spoke about poor quality homes - that is, where residents' health or wellbeing is at risk. I did not deal with the range of investigative and access powers available to the Commonwealth but I will in a moment. The second point I want to make is that, where the provider was a good provider, notice is given, and this reflects the cooperative spirit as mentioned in  the response from the department. But where there is a case of real risk, where the health or the wellbeing of the resident is under threat, then unannounced visits are available under the Aged Care Act and under subordinate legislation. The third point I want to make is precisely what those powers are. The first one is the one I mentioned in the House yesterday: principle 1.7 under subordinate legislation under the Aged Care Act allows an assessor to make an unannounced call carrying a letter with him or her and proceed with the visit. The provider is obliged to give access. The second power relates to Commonwealth authorised officers being given access to aged care premises at any time of the day or night under section 91 of the act. The third power, if we require it, is the ability to obtain a monitoring warrant, from a magistrate, which will allow an officer access at any time or at a specified time with assistance, and force supplied as necessary.I have outlined those powers and they are important for people to know. Where a provider is a good provider, we exercise the policy reasonably and sensibly. But where there is a home where people are at a risk the unannounced visits are part of our policy. I repeat what I said a few days ago, that we will use all and any tools at our disposal to ensure that we do not allow individuals to be at risk.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I would like to recognise two things at the outset. The first is that all of us in this House acknowledge that trade is very important. The second thing is that Mark Vaile, the Minister for Trade, following in a very proud tradition of good trade ministers in this place, has just chaired the 19th Cairns Group ministerial meeting in Buenos Aires - for which, I must say, the foundation was laid at the meeting in Sydney a little while ago at which the previous trade minister played such a critical role. I think it is worth noting that the communique that arose establishes some very clear and important principles regarding the forthcoming WTO negotiations on agriculture.Cairns Group members have reaffirmed their commitment to end discrimination against agriculture by bringing agriculture under the same WTO rules and conditions that apply to trade in other goods. It is very important that we continue to do everything we can to end the elimination of export subsidies and trade distorting domestic support devices. It is also very important that we do everything we can to seek major gains in market access. This is very important to Australia, Mr Speaker, as you will well know, coming from the electorate that you represent.The fact is that agriculture remains subjected to profound and costly distortions. OECD farmer support in 1998, for example, totalled $US362 billion. Despite that, it has to be said that the result has been lower prices for our farmers - and for everyone else's farmers - and the same sort of net loss figures in terms of farm communities and farmers moving on. So it has not worked. The group has sent a clear message that developed countries must practice for agriculture what they preach for other sectors.For a country like ours, this is extremely important as exports equal jobs. In fact, it is estimated that nearly 1.7 million Australian jobs depend upon exports that are either induced by or tied up with our exports of goods and services. In agriculture and fisheries it is 260,000 jobs or 60 per cent of the total. In mining and services to mining, it is 89,000 jobs or 90 per cent of all jobs. In food  and beverages it is 70,000. In manufacturing - food manufacturing and fibre manufacturing, value adding, are the biggest sectors of the Australian manufacturing industry - it represents something like 430,000 jobs. In the case of transport and storage it is another 150,000. In tourism it is 170,000 jobs and indirectly a further 70,000 or 80,000 jobs.Mr Speaker, exports are vitally important for jobs in this nation. The more we can, through mechanisms such as the Cairns Group - so ably led in the past by ministers like the member for Farrer, parliament's best known middle bencher, and now by the Minister for Trade, the member for Lyne - the better for this nation. We want to get the so-called playing field tilted more fairly towards Australia. We will leave no stone unturned in our quest for that objective.</DOC>

 - The way in which the celebration of the international year has been planned is that the first half of the year was very much for grassroots functions. We had an organisation called Coalition 99 whereby over 1,000 groups across Australia have been involved in grassroots activities to bring about what I want to see as a cultural change in the way that older Australians are portrayed, and they see that we value them for their ongoing contribution. -  - The second part of the year has a much greater government focus and involvement. For instance, the first of the community service television advertisements went to air last Sunday evening on Channel 7. The older Australian awards involve members finding 20 people within their electorate nominated by others and chosen by a committee they established to seek one person who will come to Canberra on 30 September. In fact, the kits were delivered to all members at the end of July and you received a further -  - Thank you, Mr Speaker. Indeed, I had a call from one member of the opposition around the date when they were delivered asking, `Did we get them on the same date as all government members?' I was able to say yes, because they were all delivered at the end of July. I had another note from another member of the opposition only in the last few days, and I can only say that perhaps you had better look at the way you run your office, because this particular member -  - The long and the short of it was that many members have used their federation committees to select those people. - This is a very important program and it is very important to older Australians. I am very disappointed to see the way the opposition is treating the year. -  - Indeed, Senator Evans, the man who has responsibility for the opposition, rose in the Senate only the day before yesterday complaining about the fact that he did not think there was enough happening. Yet I am very disappointed to have to report that yesterday there was a forum for 25 senior Australian women scientists. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am very disappointed in the attitude -  - As I said, I am very disappointed in the way the opposition is treating this. As I said yesterday, there was an important forum of older women who are scientists and who ranged in age from 73 to 90. I must say Senator Evans was invited to attend to honour these older Australians -  -  - The point I wanted to make about these distinguished Australian women scientists is that Senator Evans was invited to the forum and he was invited to the cocktail reception. He neither replied nor attended. In other words, he was not bothering to honour older Australians. -  - I will conclude the answer by saying this is a very good and important program. I would ask the opposition to get behind it as the government members have.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert, who is one of the members that represents the great Australian sugar industry, for his question. Townsville is a very important sugar exporting centre and is the service centre for many of the sugar growing areas of Far North Queensland. In a previous answer the Deputy Prime Minister referred briefly to the Cairns Group meeting attended by the Minister for Trade during this past week.I was very delighted to hear from Minister Vaile and to report to the House that Australia has reached agreement with Brazil, the biggest sugar producing country in the world, to work cooperatively in the lead-up to the world trade talks in Seattle in an endeavour to establish a much fairer trading regime for sugar. Countries like those in the European Union and the United States have put on tariffs and quotas which place barriers on the export of Australian sugar and indeed on exports from Brazil into their markets. They are major users of sugar, yet their trading policies have denied access to the biggest sugar producers of the world.Yesterday the Australian minister briefed his Brazilian counterparts on the work undertaken by the federal government and the Queensland Sugar Corporation on the positive impact on the world sugar industry if trade barriers could be broken down. Brazil is anticipating a much smaller crop next year in  response to the declining world prices, and I suppose that is something of good news to the Australian industry. There was some further good news for Australian farmers in that Brazil have indicated that they will be increasing the ethanol from sugar content in their transport fuel - from 24 per cent to 26 per cent in petrol and up to three per cent in diesel. This will divert more sugar cane from the world market into their fuel production industry and should have a positive effect on the Australian sugar price.It is important that Cairns Group nations like Brazil and Australia work together to break down the trade barriers that are distorting agricultural trade and significantly disadvantaging Australia's efficient industry. I welcome the support of the members of the government who represent these sugar seats in putting forward very strongly Australia's case to break down trade barriers that hurt only efficient producers like the Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. Members of the House may remember that I announced to the chamber on 30 March this year that an independent review panel would review the recommendations for the six Vietnam veterans on the End of War List Vietnam. I am pleased to place on the record today that the Governor-General has accepted the government's recommendations and that these six veterans will receive Medals for Gallantry, which is in line with the recommendations of the Independent Review Panel. This decision means that these soldiers will receive the same medals as officers on the list who were recommended for the Military Cross at the time of the conflict.The Military Medal is an imperial award and was no longer available under the Australian honours system when the Vietnam End of War List was finalised in February last year. The review panel found that the Medal for Gallantry rather than the Commendation for Gallantry - which was initially offered to these soldiers on the End of War List - was an award equivalent to and more appropriate than the Military Medal. What was at stake, I believe, was an intrinsic Anzac virtue, and that was fairness - and I think most Australians agree with that. The panel's recommendations have maintained the integrity of the Australian honours system and I think ensured that the system has remained, and will continue to remain, truly egalitarian. The offering of awards under the Vietnam End of War List to 81 veterans is the finalisation of an election commitment made by the coalition in 1996 and I am pleased that we have accepted the Independent Review Panel's recommendation on this issue.I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the members of the Independent Review Panel: Peter Phillips, the National President of the RSL; Clive Mitchell-Taylor from the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia; and Noel Tanzer, the former secretary to my department. I thank them for their report, but I would also like to take the opportunity to thank members of the parliament on both  sides of this House who have raised this issue with me and, importantly, were also active in their own communities as the panel went around Australia taking evidence on this very important matter. I have sent a number of reports to members of the opposition with an interest in this matter. The report will be available on the Department of Defence's Internet site and I would recommend that to members who have an interest in this issue.</DOC>

The reason I need that name is so we can make all the arrangements for plane travel and hotels so that they can be here on 30 September -  - I am saying that we need the name of the individual by next week in order to make arrangements for the dinner on 30 September, at which there will be a celebration and the announcement.  If individual members have difficulty in getting names to me and they contact me accordingly - as a number of folk have done - then we can mark down the places for them to be and you can let me know the times. The date of the function, of course, cannot be altered. The date of the function is the eve of the International Day for the International Year of Older Persons.

 - We understand that today the government will secure through the Senate the passage of our workplace relations reforms in respect of young people. That will see for young people the fulfilment of a promise which we gave in the last election, and that is that this government would work hard, would work tirelessly and would not rest until we had achieved a better system for young people to protect their jobs and to provide new job opportunities in the future. This is therefore a great day for young people in not only protecting up to 200,000 jobs in the retail sector but also opening the door for new jobs in new industries where the Labor Party and the unions had closed down junior wage rates in the awards. This is an important part of this legislative initiative. Not only have we now protected existing jobs but also we have hopefully opened the door for new jobs as the commission in the next 12 months and beyond takes applications and is able to consider the matter.It is an important day because, six years ago, the Labor Party inserted this anti age discrimination. They did not then appreciate what they were doing. It was an agreement made in the Senate without a proper understanding of its consequences. It was immedi  ately seen by employers as being a disaster for young people, and it has taken six years of hard work on this side, and particularly the last three years in which this government has been in office, to finally achieve a fantastic outcome for young people. I want to pay tribute to those who have worked very hard for this outcome - the backbench committee, led by the member for Longman, and members right across the coalition who have been genuinely concerned that we finally get a decent outcome for young people.Lastly, we have a strong economy, we have unemployment down to the lowest level it has been for 10 years at seven per cent and the figures in respect of young people are some of the best figures we have had not just in the last decade but in the last two decades. This is a tribute to leadership, tenacity and a sense of direction which we on this side have exhibited all through this. Credit should be given where credit is due: the Prime Minister has taken the lead on this issue and, as a result, young people will now find their jobs secure, and they will have the opportunity of jobs in the future. It is worth reading out a quote from today's Australian which would be of interest to members:On Sunday Mr Bevis contacted the Democrats' industrial relations spokesman, Andrew Murray, and asked to see the Democrat amendments . . . Of course he asked for them, because he knew they had been worked up with the ACTU. In reference to the amendments, it goes on to say:. . . which the Democrats took as a sign of possible change from the ALP.The fact is they threw a wobbly at the end of last week and over the weekend. They were looking to see whether they could plant a poison pill in our amendments. They were flushed out yesterday, as they should have been. As a result, they did not see the light; they felt the heat of public opinion on this issue. This is a great day for young people and a testament to our Prime Minister's leadership.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is difficult to know the number of internally displaced people both in East Timor itself and in West Timor - and remember there are some others who in the very early days straight after the ballot were shipped beyond the island of Timor altogether, some apparently to Irian Jaya; some to, one might say ironically, to Ambon; and some to other parts of Indonesia. It is clearly very difficult to know what the figures are. We were having a discussion in my office not half an hour ago about these numbers and trying to estimate the number of internally displaced people in West Timor. The figures range from as high as 270,000, which is a figure that has been produced by the Indonesia military, by TNI. There are some NGOs, though, who think that TNI has  done some double counting and the figure may be nearer to 150,000, but it is very hard to say.Whilst we are obviously endeavouring to assess the number of internally displaced people in East Timor and from East Timor, it is extremely hard to get an accurate figure. I think that for both East Timor and West Timor 200,000 would probably be too low and 300,000 might be reasonably closer to the mark. Obviously, we will keep monitoring that. We are happy to provide information to the House as it comes forward to us.We will get more information both on that and on the second part of the honourable member's question - the number of people who have died - more readily once the international force is established. We really have no numbers on the number of people who have died. There are some who say between 10,000 and 20,000. There are others who say that the numbers are in the hundreds. I do not think it would be right for me to speculate. I can only say to the House that I do not know. I think we could assume the numbers would be pretty high.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I know that she, like all members of this House and indeed all Australians at this time and over recent weeks, has been and is disturbed by the devastating violence that has been visited upon the people of East Timor since the announcement of the result of the ballot on their future, which was just over two weeks ago. It was this violence and the threat that it posed not only to the lives and property of East Timorese but to their future aspirations so clearly expressed in that ballot on 30 August that impelled the government to work energetically for the creation of a multinational force under the United Nations auspices to be deployed there as early as possible.This morning the first of around 2,000 Australian troops landed in East Timor as part of that multinational force, constituted under a United Nations resolution, to restore peace and security there, to protect the United Nations mission and enable it to carry out its functions, and to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance. As I have mentioned, the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Democrats have been in Darwin today farewelling some of those troops.The constitution and deployment of this force, INTERFET, has been accomplished extraordinarily quickly thanks to the leadership of Australia demonstrated by the personal intervention of the Prime Minister at the highest levels of government around the world. I should also mention the untiring, around-the-clock efforts of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence, not to mention officers of their departments and the skill and preparedness of the Australian defence forces.We are pleased that a large number of other countries, including a number from our own region, will be participating in this force. That demonstrates the level and strength of broad international interest and concern in this issue of East Timor. Last night - as I think most people will know, as most people will have watched and listened to him - the Prime Minister addressed the nation on this deployment of Australian armed forces abroad. He underlined that the government has taken the solemn decision to contribute to this force not only because it is the right thing to do but because it is in Australia's national interest. As he explained, instability of the kind that we have witnessed over recent weeks in a territory so close to Australia could have serious consequences for us in the long run.Let me repeat that this operation is dangerous and that there could be casualties. However, let us also remember that our forces are well trained and we have every confidence - and we should have every confidence - in their ability to do the job. As the Prime Minister said last night, they go with our goodwill and our total support, and we say with him, `Godspeed and a safe return home.'</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I was aware of the statement. Of course, I have been aware of an enormous amount of material over some months now about the situation in East Timor. This statement, along with less inflammatory and sometimes as inflammatory statements, was a characteristic of the whole evolution of the East Timor question, not just in the context of the outcome of the ballot. It was always our view that the process leading up to the ballot would be very difficult and that the security environment would be hard to control. It was also our view at that time - and, I suspect, for longer than that - that the most dangerous period in this process would be the period immediately after the announcement of the result of the ballot. Of course, that turned out to be true.There were many different assessments of what would happen in that period - from the assessments that we thought were unrealistically optimistic to assessments that were extremely bad. The one the honourable member quotes is at the outer extremity of the negative assessments that were made. That is why we took the view that, given it was going to be the most difficult period, it was the period where the United Nations would have to make a maximum effort. We worked very hard to see, in the confines within which the international community had to operate, a significant increase in United Nations civilian police and military liaison personnel. I can assure the House that an enormous  amount of effort was put in just in getting the Indonesians to agree to that, which they did. In the end, you have to make on-balance judgments about what will happen.I think it is fair to say that the international community, on balance, thought that the situation would be pretty bad after the announcement of the result, but I do not think the international community quite expected - and Kofi Annan has made this point in the last week or two - the rampant destruction that took place during that period. I do not think the international community, in the end, concluded that people could ever behave that badly. In light of that, and given what did happen, the international community responded - I have to take the opportunity to make this point - with what would have to be pretty close to record speed to get a resolution through the Security Council and to get a multinational force, known now as INTERFET, onto the ground. I would say, off the top of my head, that doing that in just over two weeks - I could be corrected here - would pretty much break a world record.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston for his question. I very much appreciate the interest that he has taken on this issue since the announcement of the change in the government's policy on East Timor and the evolution of this issue more generally this year. In the face of the appalling violence that I was just talking about in answer to a question from the member for Kingsford-Smith, Australia did marshall all of its diplomatic resources to enable a multinational force to be deployed in East Timor as soon as possible. As I just said, I think history will judge that that was achieved in the shortest time ever. The Prime Minister spoke repeatedly to Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General, and to other world leaders.  I think it is worth making the point that we happened to be fortunate in that APEC was scheduled to meet and we were able to use the APEC meeting to very good effect in marshalling that international support for a force and, more to the point, in getting the international community to put increasing pressure on Indonesia to allow in that force.I left to go to New York on Monday of last week and I did so both to secure Australia's leadership of this force, which we saw as important if the force were to be truly effective because we had already in place the troops to do that, and to do what I could to help ensure the passage of a strong and robust United Nations Security Council resolution, which turned out to be resolution 1264. This is an important and strong resolution. I do not think honourable members should have any illusions - and I am sure they do not - about how difficult it is to get robust resolutions out of the Security Council. To provide a chapter 7 authority, which is sometimes colloquially described as a `peace enforcement authority', was a great achievement. I should say that particular credit should go to the British government, which did the bulk of the drafting of this resolution and which was enormously cooperative with us through that process. Also, the United States and a number of other countries were very helpful.This resolution gives the multinational force or INTERFET, as it will become known, the authority to restore peace and security in East Timor, to support UNAMET activities and also to facilitate humanitarian assistance. In time, INTERFET will be replaced by a fully-fledged United Nations peacekeeping operation. Our expectation is that that will take between two and three months - probably nearer three than two, if the assembling of such types of operations in the past is any guide - and that will be after the ratification of the ballot by the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly, the MPR.Australia has played, and is playing, the leading role in INTERFET, but once the United Nations peacekeeping operation is put into place the international security presence will take on a different character. The role that Australia will play at that stage is not  determined yet. We have officers from the Department of Defence, both military and civilian, in New York at the moment discussing with the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations the shape of such a peacekeeping force and Australia's role in it. Obviously, we will have more to say about that as things go on.I conclude by making the point here that the multinational force, INTERFET, does genuinely need to be a multinational force. It is led by Australia and Australia has been the driving force behind it. But I have particularly appreciated the support of our regional partners in their participation in this force - clearly New Zealand, but let me pay particular tribute to the Thais. Their foreign minister and their Prime Minister have been stalwart supporters of this exercise. A Thai major general has taken on the position of the deputy commander of INTERFET. Thailand has been strong and unwavering. So too have other ASEAN countries - the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. We have enjoyed very strong cooperation from those ASEAN countries, as well as from some of the North Asian countries - Korea, interestingly enough China, and Japan which, whilst it will not deploy peacekeepers, has indicated that it will provide very strong financial support for INTERFET.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. We have of course spoken about this publicly on many occasions, obviously with a degree of appropriate diplomatic caution. We have made the point that there are clearly links between members of the TNI and the militias, and that is not a matter that is debated any longer even by the TNI itself or by the Indonesian government. That has been a matter of very deep concern for us all along. I do not have very much to add to what I have said publicly on many  occasions in answer to that question, which is a big issue. It does lead to a debate about whether the withdrawal of TNI would lead to the dispersal and disappearance of the militias. That remains to be seen, but we hope in any case, with the insertion of the multinational force and with the move towards the United Nations taking over control of East Timor, that we will see the rather rapid dissolution of the militias. Whether or not that will happen I am afraid remains to be seen.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I can indicate that we have been kicking goals on business taxation all weekend, unlike a certain football team, the name of which the Acting Leader of the Opposition interposes. It was a fine performance from the Essendon football club throughout the year, although unfortunately they lost on the weekend. I congratulate them for a fine year.Prior to the election last year, when the government announced that it would reform the indirect and personal income tax system, Commonwealth-state relations and family allowances, we indicated that in addition we would seek to reform business taxation in this country. The government appointed three leading Australian businessmen - Mr John Ralph, Mr Rick Allott and Mr Bob Joss - to review the business taxation system and to make recommendations on its simplification and improvement and on how it could be reformed to enhance economic objectives.The report has been with the government since, I believe, the end of July, for most of August and for the first part of September. The government has given the report very serious consideration. The commission received 370 submissions, conducted 42 focus group meetings, held 16 public seminars, gave 51 presentations and met with 151 organisations and individuals. They listened to what  business had to say and in many cases actually road tested reform proposals. The government has completed its consideration in relation to the Ralph report and expects to be in a position to make an initial response and release the report tomorrow.From the government's point of view, we have to look at this tax reform, like all tax reform, from an overall perspective. Just as reforming the indirect tax system had huge national benefits and had to be looked at as a whole, so too reforming the business taxation system should be focused on national benefits rather than individual industries. We have to make sure that we have a business taxation system which will enhance economic objectives, which is robust and which still makes a contribution to the revenue to fund those social services which we all hold dear.It is important that Australia continue the momentum for tax reform. We have begun the great historic tax reform on the indirect and personal income tax front, to complete it in relation to business tax, to simplify it, to get lower rates and to harmonise to economic objectives - objectives which will set this country up well for the future and which will make a major contribution to its economic benefits.</DOC>

 - The simple answer to that question is that the members of the Security Council, particularly those who were proactive in assembling this resolution and countries supporting them, such as Australia, wanted the resolution to get through the Security Council and get through fast. If the Security Council resolution had required a renegotiation of the 5 May tripartite agreement between Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations, it would be my judgment - I am sure it would be the judgment of those  lead members of the Security Council who did the work on the resolution - that the resolution would have had no chance whatsoever of getting through. I don't think there is any doubt that a number of countries on the Security Council would have vigorously opposed the renegotiation of the 5 May agreement, obviously - particularly if Indonesia had opposed it, which I think we can take as a given.But it is a fair question in the sense that it does raise the issue of whether it is realistic for TNI to remain in place while the multinational force is going in. I thought there might be a question about that. It might interest the House to know that today General Wiranto, the Indonesian Minister for Defence and the chief of their defence force, said that after they - they being the multinational force, INTERFET - have entered East Timor TNI troops will be pulled out in stages and will hand over the responsibility for maintaining security in East Timor to the multinational force.It is also worth drawing the House's attention to the fact that Foreign Minister Alatas said on 15 September - so it was last week - that TNI would have no active combat role and that overall responsibility for maintaining security would be passed to INTERFET. So we do have indications that there is already and will continue to be a fairly rapid draw-down in TNI numbers. That is the answer to the question.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McEwen for her question. Obviously, in relation to the tragedy that has occurred in East Timor, Australia has wanted to respond appropriately, generously and compassionately. Last week we evacuated, in addition to UNAMET staff and their families  and some locally engaged staff of UNAMET, a total of some 1,850 East Timorese people to Australia. These evacuees have been provided with initial care and health assessments in Darwin. They have been granted what is now becoming known as a safe haven visa. It is, in fact, a temporary entry humanitarian permit. That will be for three months. It is capable of being extended and it is subject to the provisions that were enacted to enable us to provide sanctuary for the people from Kosovo.In that sense, it is a new form of visa arrangement. We have some 1,500 of the evacuees being offered places in three safe havens around Australia, including Puckapunyal in the member's electorate, Leeuwin in Western Australia, and East Hills. Each of these centres has previously been used to accommodate people from Kosovo. At this stage I think some 2,100 people have returned and we have indications from about another thousand that they intend to go back before the end of October. That has enabled us to utilise the premises that have previously been used to house Kosovos in Australia.We have been undertaking medical screening and processing in Darwin. As that has been completed we are progressively moving people to the longer term and secure accommodation in the safe haven centres. There will be 604 East Timorese at Puckapunyal. They went in on 18 and 19 September. Approximately 400 will go to Leeuwin. That will be on 24 September. The remainder will go to East Hills at the end of the month.The East Timorese will have access to the same range of services that we provided to those from Kosovo. That includes basic necessities such as health care, food and education. It also ensures that they get professional torture and trauma counselling and language services and a weekly allowance of $27 for adults and $10 for children. It was important, I think, to make that provision on exactly the same basis. There have been some suggestions from time to time that people from Europe, from some parts of the world, are treated differently from people from other parts of the world. The measures are being implemented in exactly the same way.I am grateful for the cooperation that the Commonwealth is receiving from state government agencies and non-government agencies in delivering effective care, particularly the large number of volunteers, around the Catholic Church in particular, who want to assist with the East Timorese community. Obviously they are welcome to stay in the broader community if they wish, but the provision that we are making will be within the safe havens themselves. People are free to move in and out.There is one other matter which the House might wish to know about. Members may have seen reports that one of the people that we evacuated had connections with the paramilitary organisations in East Timor. When that was established, he did not receive a safe haven visa. He was formally refused immigration clearance. He was placed in immigration detention until his removal could be arranged and that removal took place last Friday, 17 September.</DOC>

I gather that Major General Cosgrove was very satisfied with the discussions he had with the TNI leader yesterday in Dili. Of course, we would not want there to be any exchange of information which would in any way jeopardise the safety of our troops.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. I am aware that some members of the Defence Force who are residents of her electorate will in fact be going to East Timor. The question gives me the opportunity - and I am sure that all members of the House are interested - to outline what allowances and also what coverage our force in East Timor will receive. Personnel who are deployed in East Timor will receive a tax-free salary and allowances during their service as part of the multinational peace enforcement operation. In addition to their usual allowances and benefits, troops will receive a set of tax-free allowances which are related to the deployment which will total $125 per day. These include deployment and field allowances as well as a new East Timor peace enforcement allowance of $40 a day.ADF personnel who are deployed in East Timor are covered by the Commonwealth Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Military Compensation Scheme. I know that all mem  bers of the House, and in fact all Australians, I am sure, will pray that all of those who are deployed to East Timor will return safely, unharmed. These two entitlements, the VEA and the Military Compensation Scheme, provide compensation coverage to personnel and families in the event of injury or death of a service man or woman whilst they are serving in East Timor. The Veterans' Entitlements Act coverage will also entitle these personnel to service pensions.Deployed personnel will be entitled, on deployment, to additional leave of 1½ days per month of service, additional home loan assistance, the waiving of the five-year qualifying period and an increase in the maximum period of the loan's subsidy to 20 years. There will also be available pre-embarkation leave or reunion leave with a partner where it is practical before deployment.This package of allowances and entitlements is designed to be as comprehensive as possible, to provide support for our Defence Force personnel and also to offer some comfort, I think, for their families because this is, as the Prime Minister has said, an operation that does have dangers. I know that each and every one of us will want to see the safe return of all those who are deployed, but it is important to have on the public record the set of allowances and the coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and Military Compensation Scheme should anything happen to our Defence Force personnel whilst in East Timor.</DOC>

 - I think I will confine myself to some general remarks to the effect that, plainly, what was to take place after that  poll just a little over two weeks ago, in terms of its extent, in terms of its ugly nature and of the violence that was attended to it, could not have been reasonably foreseen by anyone. That is not to say that we were not prepared for some uncertainty, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has made quite plain. But I do not believe that anybody could reasonably have been expected to have foreseen precisely what has unfolded or to have fully anticipated the relationship, as we now increasingly understand it, that has emerged between the TNI and the militias.In terms of the actions taken by the government, I believe that we have responded quickly and appropriately. At every point in time we have sought to ensure that our response - and the international response - has been appropriate. I am not quite certain where the opposition is seeking to lead with this matter, but I believe that the mandate that we have successfully negotiated, which reflects great credit on the Prime Minister, is an appropriate one. It is, under the circumstances, what the Australian people would have expected us to have sought in that it confers upon the international force the powers and the rights that it needs to address the situation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. This is a very significant day because today the single rate of pension will be increased by $5.10 a fortnight and the partner rate of pension will increase by $4.30 a fortnight for each partner. This specifically comes about because of the legislation that we put in over two years ago to link pensions not only to CPI, as they had been, but also to male total average weekly earnings. For single pensioners, the increase is made up of $1.10 a fortnight in line with the CPI increase and another $4 a fortnight to meet the government's commitment to benchmark the single rate at 25 per cent of male  total average weekly earnings. For partner couples, the increase is 90c each a fortnight in line with the CPI and $3.40 each a fortnight to meet the government's male total average weekly earnings commitment. What we are doing here is ensuring that pensioners are protected. Not only have we produced a low inflation environment but also we are linking pensions to salaries and wages.In addition, next year there will be a four per cent increase, which will be compensation to pensioners due to the tax package we are putting into place. The four per cent supplement will not form part of the pension, ensuring that the 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings is calibrated in it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and his tireless efforts on behalf of his electorate to pursue this issue of extending telecommunications infrastructure. There are indeed very significant benefits for rural and regional Australia  arising from the sale of Telstra, which the Labor Party opposes. The Labor Party opposed the $1 billion from the sale of the first tranche of Telstra for the Natural Heritage Trust Fund. That meant that they opposed the $250 million from the first tranche sale of Telstra for networking Australia - the regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. That means that, from the second tranche of the sale, they also oppose the $250 million extra for Networking the Nation, which builds the basic and necessary infrastructure for telecommunications in rural and regional Australia. It means that, from the second tranche of the sale of Telstra, the Labor Party opposes $150 million provided for untimed local calls in remote Australia, $150 million to extend SBS and to eradicate television black spots, $36 million to provide local Internet points of presence, $20 million to improve telecommunications to remote island communities, $70 million to build additional rural networks, $45 million for local government projects, $28 million to extend mobile phone coverage along major highways and $70 million to establish rural transaction centres.So there is no doubt at all that the 49.9 per cent sale of Telstra has materially benefited rural and regional Australia, all of which were opposed by the Labor Party. Indeed, the member for Fraser recently reiterated Labor's long-term opposition to the highly successful regional telecommunications infrastructure fund. So where would you find that more than $1.5 billion that we have spent directly on rural and regional Australia?During the last election campaign, Labor vowed to freeze Networking the Nation and spend the rest of the money - redirect it into general expenditure. In summary, Networking the Nation is an essential program for rural communities. It provides those concrete benefits. The coalition will continue it. The Labor Party will oppose it and abolish it and put nothing in its place.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. It is the convention of Australian governments - and probably has been since 1901 - not to discuss intelligence matters, but I can say that Mary Robinson intends to remain in contact with the Indonesian authorities on the issue of the establishment of an international commission of inquiry into human rights violations in East Timor. She will take the initiative in launching such an international commission if needed. So she is still discussing this matter with the Indonesian authorities. This is entirely consistent with the government's view that allegations of human rights violations should be investigated through a coordinated, UN-wide response based on the Security Council resolution which, as honourable members may recall, in its first operative paragraph, I think, condemns and calls for the immediate end of all acts of violence in East Timor and demands that those responsible be brought to justice.Pending the outcome of Mrs Robinson's discussions with the Indonesians and of other work in the United Nations, our immediate priorities remain the improvement of the security situation in East Timor through INTERFET and to ensure that humanitarian assistance is brought to the population of East Timor. Consistent with established principles on the handling of intelligence material, the government will cooperate as fully as possible with any UN investigation into human rights violations in East Timor and do whatever is appropriate to ensure that those who are responsible are brought to justice.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her excellent question and for her support for Job Network. The government recently called for tenders for the Return to Work program. This is a $24 million program to help some 8,000 job seekers a year over the next four years. The Return to Work program supplements programs available under Job Network. It is available to any job seeker, including job seekers not on unemployment benefits, who has spent the past two years caring for children or other dependent family members. Obviously, this program is pitched towards women who want to re-enter the work force after a period as full-time mothers. Under the Return to Work program, these job seekers will receive career counselling. They will receive job search skills and IT familiarisation and access to training.As I said, the Return to Work program complements Job Network, which is consistently putting 50 per cent more eligible job seekers into work than the old CES. Behind every statistic there is a human story. I recently received a letter from a Job Network member on the Central Coast about a job seeker who had been on the dole for 17 years. I quote from this letter:On a daily basis he regaled us with stories of how he had been able to stay hidden within the system, telling us that for a full eight-year period he managed to live his life on the dole with no direct accountability to the CES.After participating in the intensive assistance program, his attitude changed. He has had one short-term job already and I am told that he is on the verge of getting another one. Not all interventions are as successful as this, but it shows what can be done under Job Network. The Australian people are this country's greatest asset and the government is determined to ensure that they do not get trapped inside the welfare system.</DOC>

 - I would not want to comment on one report that the honourable member happened to get hold of and then flaunted around the media a bit. I do not think you should do that sort of thing, by the way. Secondary disclosure, when you were in government, was going to be made a criminal offence. Remember that? This particular report was one assessment by a DIO analyst. That is of course one assessment; there were dozens and dozens of assessments. But I said in answer to an earlier question today that obviously the role of some elements of TNI in working with the militias was a matter of very great concern to us, and we expressed that - as diplomatically as we could of course - publicly. Obviously this was a matter taken up by us, I can say without being too indiscreet by the Americans and by a number of other governments but particularly by our two governments, on many occasions with the Indonesians. Obviously it was a matter of great concern.You read out a reference to General Wiranto. This has been a great debate here in Australia: what did General Wiranto know and what didn't he know. It has been impossible to be conclusive about precisely who knew what, when, how and why. Intelligence assessments are such that you can very seldom be conclusively sure of these things, but I think the conclusion one can draw, which we would have drawn then and is a view we have held for a very long time, is that there are at least some elements of TNI that were working with the militias, and that was a matter of very great concern to us. That explained why we made so many strong  representations to the Indonesians over such a long period of time, and also why we worked very closely with people like the Americans, encouraging them, as if they needed any encouragement - I am sure they would have done it off their own bat in any case - to make appropriate representations as well.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to inform the honourable member for Blair, and in fact all members of the House, that Australia's largest ever share offer opened today and that Australians who want to invest in the Telstra 2 offer can now apply for their shares. A couple of weeks ago I announced that the minimum application would be 150 shares and that retail investors would be paying $4.50 per share as a first instalment. That represented a discount of 25c for the first instalment. It means that Australians can take a stake in Telstra for as little as $675, meeting the government's commitment to make Telstra 2 shares available for all Australians affordable and accessible.The second instalment will be determined by the price of Telstra shares in the week prior to listing on 18 October next, and they will be discounted by at least 15c per share. Payments of the second instalment will not be due until November next year, that is, after the Sydney Olympics. This means that retail investors will get a discount of 40c per share as well as the benefits of paying by two instalments over one year. Already more than three million Australians have pre-registered, and they will receive, or have already at this stage received, their public offer document, which contains a personalised application form.It is not too late to join in. Anyone who has not pre-registered may still acquire an application for shares and a prospectus by ringing the  telephone information line for Telstra, by obtaining that information through the Telstra web site or by picking up a prospectus and application at any Commonwealth Bank branch. That form must be accompanied, when they apply for shares, by a cheque for the first instalment, although you can pay using the electronic banking system known as B-Pay. This option makes it very simple to participate in this offer.The government hopes that many Australians, including first-time investors, will participate in the Telstra 2 share offer and become owners of one of our largest and most dynamic companies. They will also help make Australia one of the greatest share owning nations in the world.</DOC>

 - Can I begin by saying that you should not read out intelligence assessments. When you were in government you said that secondary disclosure should be a criminal offence and you wanted to put people responsible for secondary disclosures in jail. - If you thought it was such a serious matter, why when you were in  government did you think it should be a criminal offence and now you think it is something that can be used for a debate? I make that as a first point, because that is a serious point you need to think about.The second point I would make is that I do not comment on individual intelligence assessments. You quote one which professes to hold one view and you quote another that professes to hold another view. I think I could probably stray into saying this to the House: if you read the number of intelligence assessments that I read and no doubt the Prime Minister reads and the Minister for Defence and others read -  - Somebody grazing back up there would never get to read an intelligence assessment unless Laurie leaked it. - If you read a large number of intelligence assessments, this illustrates the point. There obviously are a variety of views in those intelligence assessments. What was the Prime Minister referring to? He was referring to the commitments that were made by President Habibie at the Bali summit. Obviously, as Prime Minister, he is not a commentator on everything that is happening in the world but, as Prime Minister, he was articulating the assurances that had been given to him and to the Australian government by the Indonesian government at the Bali summit.Needless to say, this exercise exposes a point that I have often tried to make to people: that you get all sorts of assessments with all sorts of views in them. You do not just get a single stream of assessment all of the time; you get a lot of different views expressed over a period of time. But, at the end of the day, our firm conclusion is that there were certainly links between some elements of the TNI and the militias. That was a consistent view we held. The details of those links - how far up the chain they went and that sort of thing - are very hard to assess. I am certainly not wanting - and I never have wanted - to get into public specu  lation on what those links are. I do not think that is right. But we have made the point that there have been links between elements of the TNI and the militias on many occasions. Obviously, the honourable member has made that point as well. That has been a matter of concern here in Australia - to us, to the opposition, to the media and to NGOs. It has been of widespread concern throughout the international community.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge her very real interest in rural and regional Australia. Last week I announced the membership of the Regional Women's Advisory Council. There will be nine members and each state and the Northern Territory will be represented. Those members all have expertise in the key issues facing rural and regional Australians. There is no doubt that they can play a lead role in improving communications between the government and rural communities. I think it is fair to say that rural women are particularly strong in the area of coping with change. There is a lot of change in rural and regional Australia - some of it we might prefer to go away, but it is not going to. Wherever possible, we have to be able to turn the challenge of change into opportunity.The inaugural chair of the committee is Kathy McGowan from Victoria. The council will be charged with the responsibility of advising on matters of importance to rural and regional Australia. The issues themselves will be defined not only by the council through consultation but also through research and the expertise of individual council members. I see it facilitating leadership, business development and the participation of women in decision making. It carries further forward the process  of engaging women in rural, regional and remote areas of Australia in decision making through mechanisms such as the Regional and Rural Women's Unit in my department, a roundtable I held here that quite a few women on this side of the parliament attended recently and such events as a rural women's workshop held at AgQuip in Gunnedah very recently.This council will be invited to attend the regional Australia summit to be held here at the end of October. They will be covering such important themes as communications, infrastructure, health, community, lifestyle, wellbeing and what have you. I want to say that I believe that these nine women, carefully chosen, with great expertise and a great deal to contribute, will help bring a new dimension to the coordination and delivery of the many programs that this government has put together and is now seeking to deliver for the benefit of rural and regional Australians.Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper.</DOC>

 - The great news yesterday was that the government announced reform of business taxation - for the first time in this country. The reaction of business groups has been very, very supportive indeed. I notice that the opposition, which completely sidelined itself in relation to tax reform, is desperately saying, `We'd like to be part of the process.' And what does it do? This opposition which wants to be part of the process, which wants to get out of its marginalisation, cannot even help itself for the first question in question time today and comes in here trying to fernick its way around and trying to be critical rather than support broad-ranging, great reform which is great for the Australian economy and, most particularly, great for farmers and small business, and that is going to create new jobs.The measures which I announced yesterday are completely funded in this year and next year, and over the course of the forward estimates, without any additional measures, will have an effect of around $2 billion. Let me put this in context. On the current forward estimates, the government forecast is for a cumulative surplus of $28 billion over the next four years. If there were no further measures additional to those announced yesterday, those cumulative surpluses would be $26 billion. That is the big point.Let me compare it with recent history. The last four budgets before this government was elected - bear in mind we are comparing to $26 billion of cumulative surpluses - were cumulative deficits of $57 billion. So we now have the opposition getting up and saying, `Well, our big objection would be that, having taken the budget from a four-year cumulative deficit of $57 billion, you are only going to have a cumulative surplus of $26 billion rather than $28 billion.' I think that is the point that the opposition is trying to make.In addition to that, as I forecast yesterday, it can in fact be completely funded and we can return to full surpluses, with the additional matters that the government has indicated its agreement to and on which it is consulting on design and implementation. That will put Australia in a strong position - strong surpluses, a new indirect tax system, a dramatically  lower personal income tax system, new Commonwealth-state financial relations, new family allowances and, best of all, a new tax system for the small business and business community of Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. It is appropriate that the last word in the question was jobs, because the fundamental purpose of tax reform is to generate more jobs in Australia. What we have done, as a government, over the last 3½ years in particular in reforming the Australian taxation system has been to create a climate where there will be more jobs as a result of that reform. Taxation reform is not an end in itself. It is only a means to creating a stronger and more competitive Australian economy that will generate more jobs.I take the opportunity of congratulating the Treasurer on behalf of the government for the outstanding job that he has done in putting this taxation reform package together. I want to thank all of my other colleagues on the front bench who have played such a cooperative, constructive role - which is the habit of this government - in putting together this major reform package.The reduction in the company tax rate will give to Australia one of the most competitive corporate tax systems in the world. The good news for small business and farmers has already, in the space of just over 24 hours, become almost legend as far as this taxation package is concerned. I have read a lot of news releases from the National Farmers Federation in my life - it is part of the job - and I have read a lot of news releases from small business organisations in my life, but I have never heard anything quite so praise  worthy and lyrical about a taxation reform as the response of the National Farmers Federation.And so it should be, because this taxation reform will do more for the battling farmer of Australia than any other change made by any government since World War II. This is a major boost to the struggling farmers of Australia. Of all the messages that come out of this building to the farmers of Australia and to the rural people of Australia, none is louder and none is less ambiguous than the message from this government that we care about small business in rural communities. We care about the farmers of Australia, and that is why we have given them a remarkable reform so far as capital gains tax is reform. And when you add to that the enormous benefits by way of lower fuel costs - benefits that the Labor Party opposed - the farmers of Australia have an enormous benefit from this government.I notice that there has been some reference in the odd column since the policy was released that in some way this is just a policy for people at the higher end of the income bracket. I find that an extraordinary proposition, particularly when you look at the enormous benefits that it gives to small business and farmers. I point out to the House that a better capital gains tax regime, which halves the rate of capital gains tax for individuals and small businesses, will improve incentives to save and invest. The Australian Taxation Office figures for 1996-97 reveal that 77 per cent of all individual taxpayers who pay capital gains tax in fact earn less than $50,000 a year. In other words, 77 per cent of the beneficiaries of this taxation reform are Australians who will be earning less than $50,000 a year. That completely gives the lie to the tawdry argument coming from some of those opposite.They cannot quite make up their mind whether they are for it or against it. They would like to be for it but they think maybe there is a bit of a political advantage in being against it for a while. We will see over the days ahead whether they put the national interest ahead of political expediency or whether, as they did on the GST, they are  going to do the exact opposite. I invite the opposition to support it. Let me say on behalf of the government that if the opposition comes out in full support of this taxation package there will be no criticism and there will be no gloating. There will be a ready embrace of the willingness of the opposition to put the national interest ahead of political advantage and come on side for a remarkable taxation package which is great for the farmers of Australia and great for small businesses all around the country.</DOC>

 - The reception of the tax reforms which were announced yesterday has been very strong and very positive. I would like to thank those members of the business community - Mr Ralph, Mr Allert and Mr Joss - who worked so hard in preparing a blueprint which the government has adopted to try and reform Australia's business taxation system. This is the biggest reform to Australia's business taxation system that we have seen in Australia. It complements the reform of the indirect tax system, the reform of the personal income tax system and the reform of Commonwealth-state relations. Yesterday Rio Tinto welcomed the decision to reduce the general rate of company tax, which they said will underpin the international competitiveness of Australia's tax system. The Australian Institute of Company Directors welcomed the new business tax system. They said:The proposed changes to capital gains tax and to offer rollover relief are key elements in removing barriers to growth in the Australian economy.The Tourism Council yesterday welcomed the new business tax system. They said it was `investment friendly' and encouraging of  future growth within the sector. The Investment and Financial Services Association said:Overall, the review has produced a set of proposals that greatly enhance the capacity of the economy to produce improved savings.The NFF said most of Australia's farmers would be more competitive. They said the removal of capital gains tax on assets held for more than 15 years was the highlight of the package. The Society of Certified Practising Accountants said:The government has listened to the calls of small business to reduce the compliance costs that they are facing. Of particular benefit will be the simplified taxation system.The Australian Superannuation Funds Association, the Financial Planning Association, the Vice-Chancellors Council and the Property Council also welcomed the changes yesterday and called on the Democrats and the opposition to support them. The Property Council said this:The Ralph reforms are a win-win situation for the community and industry and should be supported by the opposition and the Democrats.So here we have business organisations right across the spectrum of Australian industry welcoming tax reform, calling on the opposition and calling on the Democrats to join the government in the historic reform of business taxation. This is something that the opposition, the Democrats and government can do for the nation. As the Prime Minister said, we would welcome the bipartisan support of the opposition if it could rise to the challenge of supporting national interest reform.Of particular interest yesterday was the simplified taxation system for small business. What it means is that, for  the first time for small business, those that have turnover of $1 million or less can go onto cash accounting. They can immediately write off any expense up to $1,000. They can pool their plant and equipment and depreciate it 30 per cent. They get relief in relation to capital gains tax - a 50 per cent disregard. If they are individuals, they get an additional 50 per cent cut in their capital gains tax liability and, if they hold an asset for 15 years, they can roll it over capital gains tax free. That is something for the small businesses of Australia. It is something that  rewards saving and initiative. It is great for the farmers. It will be good for jobs. It is one of those things that taxation reform can deliver in national economic benefits.</DOC>

 - The Prime Minister says that, if we had been waiting for the Labor Party to come up with these measures, we would have been holding our breath for 13 years - 13 years in government and they never once came up with the idea. It took this government to lead again and to come up with the idea. We have described the proposal and in the announcements that we made yesterday we said that the proposal will come into effect from 1 July 2001.	 It would come into effect from 1 July 2001 to give business breathing space in relation to tax changes. They are coming through the Y2K bug on 1 January; they are coming through the GST on 1 July 2000; that are coming through pay as you go on 1 July 2000; and we stage into the changes on 1 July 2001 - also, interestingly enough, the day on which company tax would come down to 30 per cent. I will make this point - and for those on the Labor back bench who are thinking of economic policy, I would urge you to consider this - you will find it much easier to introduce entity taxation on a lower rate; it is one of the benefits. One of the benefits of entity taxation will be that it would not be at 36 per cent but it would be at 30 per cent - another reason for the Labor Party to actually support the government's reforms.In relation to the timetable with Mr Anderson, I said to Mr Anderson - I think it was yesterday, and I have been faithfully report  ed - that I would be expecting feedback in relation to matters that are stage 2 during the month of October to enable the government to finalise its position on stage 2 thereafter and hopefully in November.</DOC>

 - The government announced a number of measures yesterday to protect the taxation system and to prevent tax avoidance. Many of those measures date from 22 February, when the government gave notice that it would be making an announcement backdated to that date to prevent particular tax avoidance measures.The measures the government announced yesterday to deal with avoidance included measures against lost duplication based on excess mining deductions, artificial debt forgiveness, new measures in relation to duplication of unrealised corporate losses and new measures on the disposal of loan assets within majority owned groups. We also announced measures to deal with defects in the continuity of the corporate ownership test and new measures to deal with non-commercial loans from members to closely held entities. We announced yesterday measures against tax avoidance for loss duplication on the transfer by corporates of revenue losses and taxing the full consideration received on disposing of interests in leased plant or leases. In addition, we announced changes to the prepayment rule, a rule which had allowed a prepayment of 13 months to be deducted in advance of income. Those changes go a considerable way to paying for the reduction together with the accelerated depreciation of reductions in corporate tax rates.The government has been very tight on making sure that those opportunities for tax avoidance which have been identified are dealt with, and yesterday we had all of those  measures announced as part of the response to the business tax review. In addition, we have followed the same principle that we did in relation to indirect tax reform. If we broaden bases, reduce the opportunity for haemorrhaging in the system, take out those concessions which give unfair advantages, such as the prepayment rule, you can lower overall rates. One of the great things about the government's business tax regime will be broader bases, lower rates, and the opportunity for companies doing the right thing to get a tax cut, as we broaden the base to bring in those concessions which are the directing investment not to the best economic return but to the most tax effective concession.</DOC>

 - The differential rate between the corporate tax rate and the individual tax rate has existed for quite some time. Those people who could find an arbitrage in the difference would have, I would have thought, done it long before now. If you want to reduce the arbitrage between rates -  - For those companies that are getting a lower corporate tax rate, they get a lower corporate tax rate in relation to both income and capital. A capital gains tax applies to a corporation as much as to an individual. Of course, if you do not reduce  the corporate tax rate, you would not be reducing the rate of capital gains tax on a corporation's assets. That is the first point I make and another reason for the Labor Party to support the government.In relation to capital gains tax for individuals, we are moving to a system where we trade off indexation and averaging for a taxation system in relation to nominal capital gains for a half rate. This is an enormous advantage to individuals. You get rid of all the complexity and the compliance because you do not have to index your cost base on a regular basis - nor did individuals have great scope to take advantage of averaging - and, in return, we get a much reduced level of capital gains tax. This is the great breakthrough in capital gains tax. This is the first reduction of capital gains tax for individuals in Australia since capital gains tax was introduced by Labor in 1985. This is the area that has been crying out for reform. As the Prime Minister said, 77 per cent of individuals paying capital gains tax earned $50,000 or less.As we create a shareholder democracy in Australia - we are now the second largest share owning democracy in the world - mums and dads have come into Telstra, AMP and National Mutual. With Telstra 2 we expect - perhaps I had better not say because I would breach the prospectus - hundreds of thousands of new people, mums and dads and people who are saving, to come into shareholding in Australia. Now, for the first time, there is an opportunity to reduce that heavy burden of taxation coming on their savings vehicles.What is more, this now puts Australia back in the game. We have been running capital gains taxes at 48½, the Americans have been running them at 20 and the Brits have been running them at similar levels. Australia is now back in the game. We are internationally competitive. Mum and dad shareholders will get tax relief on their savings. That is great for them, and it is great for the government's attempts at encouraging saving and shareholder democracy. It has been warmly welcomed and, again, I ask the opposition to rise above politics and to stand for bipartisan support of  good reform, in the national interest, which will create a better economic environment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, representing as he does such a huge area of rural and regional Australia, and representing it very well. I think the simple answer to his question is that there is no doubt that the improvements the Treasurer announced yesterday - and I join the Prime Minister in complimenting him and thanking him for his hard work and his great diligence in working through a lot of issues of real concern for many of us over the last few months - represent a great series of improvements for rural and regional Australia, especially when combined with the reforms that will flow through next year from the introduction of the goods and services tax and the abolition of Labor's wholesale sales tax and the fuel excise.Let me come to some specifics. Firstly, accelerated depreciation for small businesses and farmers has been very widely welcomed as being important for small business and the farm sectors. What is more, the reality is that it will be simplified and more workable from July 2001. There will be considerably less paperwork; it will indeed be a simplified tax system for many of the people who need access to accelerated depreciation.Secondly, we have lifted the dead hand of Labor's capital gains tax from the family farm and small business. This has been a real bone of contention for a long time. We are now in a situation where postwar generation farmers and small business operators can look forward to retirement with much improved security. Capital gains tax need no longer be an issue for them. If you look at the broader reforms  on capital gains tax, people in small business will get a further 50 per cent small business exemption plus they will be able to apply the remaining 25 per cent capital gain towards a $500,000 capital gains retirement exemption. In addition - as has been referred to here, this has been widely welcomed by the National Farmers Federation - if they have held the asset for more than 15 years it will be totally exempt in any case. There is no doubt that it is a magnificent package for small business and for farm retirees. That is why we have seen Ian Donges reporting very well on it. The Queensland Farmers Federation has said simply, `It seems the government has listened to the concerns of farmers.' On special treatment for small business, the Courier-Mail said:This is good news for Queensland, given the state's reliance on a thriving small business sector to ensure the overall health of its economy.The Albury Border Mail  editorial said:A simpler tax system will reduce the tax burden on business, therefore generate business investment, the end result should be a significant increase in the number of jobs.They are the sorts of comments that have been made. Thirdly, I think it is worth mentioning that removing the capital gains tax from scrip to scrip takeovers will provide a great boost to small innovative Australian companies that want to stay Australian. This is something that comes up a lot when I move around rural and regional Australia. It will mean that if you start a small company in Australia and grow it into a bigger company, you can do so without being crippled by Labor's capital gains tax. It encourages innovative fast-growing companies to continue their development in this country rather than relocating offshore, as we hear too often. There has been a very interesting endorsement of our approach from none other than the Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie. He said:These capital gains tax changes will allow fledgling Australian companies to tap into the huge investment resources of the US pension funds and Australian superannuation funds.The Labor Premier of Queensland said:Hopefully, the regular stories of good Australian ideas being lost overseas will be a thing of the past. Amen to that. Rural, regional and remote Australia clearly want and need more investment and more jobs. I have no doubt that this package delivers those things. In the sense that it provides a further valuable instalment on our reform program, it will make a difference in rural Australia because it will boost existing industries and it will help us to attract new industries.</DOC>

 - As part of its pre-election policy, the government announced changed arrangements in relation to life insurance. When I came to government, one of the things that was sitting on my desk as far back as then was a decision which had been deferred by the Labor Party - that the tax arrangements in relation to life insurance had to be streamlined and improved. I have referred to that in subsequent budgets. We have had the opportunity to do that and to finally make sure that we clear up the situation.Life insurers, depending on the class of their business, can currently be taxed at a rate of zero, 33 per cent, 37 per cent, 39 per cent and 47 per cent, according to whether the product is a statutory fund, an investment product, a life product, superannuation or some other part of their business. We announced, as part of the new tax system, that we would move to an entity tax arrangement which would have the same tax paid by life insurance companies on the same business as is paid for by investment companies - they will be paying the same in relation to superannuation as is paid by superannuation. This is a reform that is well and truly overdue. There have been transitional provisions, in relation to life policies, which provide for a  five-year transitional period. That will protect policy holders and annuitants. This, again, is worthwhile reform - simplification which those who really had an interest in tax reform would be supporting.</DOC>

 - I appreciate getting the question because it emphasises the fact that this is a package which is relevant to small business. Whilst the Labor party has its shadow treasury spokesman asking questions, you never hear a question from the shadow minister for small business. That is because the Labor party is not interested in small business and has not got the vaguest idea what is necessary to assist small business. The Taxation Institute of Australia has an idea of the importance of small business. Their press release says, `Small business the big winner under business tax reforms, says Tax Institute'. One of the reasons that they have picked out this package as being beneficial for small business is that it is a genuine attack on the red tape problems facing small business. Anybody who has run a small business - and there are plenty on this side but I do not think there are many on that side - would know that.It is a simple point: if you are running a small business, you want to spend more time running your business than filling out red tape for government. So the tax institute makes the point that the cash accounting regime, which is a measure announced yesterday, is much more straightforward and is less costly. Obviously, it saves time for small business. The tax institute said:.	 A simpler and more generous depreciation scheme will dramatically streamline the asset records of small business; So it is a good deal on the tax side, but it is also a good deal in terms of reducing compliance costs on small business. In relation to stocktakes, as the tax institute says, something like three-quarters of small businesses do it themselves. The idea of having to spend your weekend bringing in the kids to help with the stocktake are days you will only remember from when Labor was in office. The red tape theme was picked up by the Society of Certified Practising Accountants. They say:The Government appears to have heeded calls from the small business sector who have been drowning in red tape.That, again, is a fair comment, reflecting the big change we are making to red tape. But they go further. About capital gains tax reforms, the CPA says that they `should assist in the growth and employment generating capacity of the economy as a whole.' That is a sensible point that anyone who has been associated with small business would know. Senator Murray, for example, is quoted in the Sydney Morning Herald  this morning as saying:That gives you the idea that certainly jobs will be generated out of it because we all know small business looked after do produce jobs.Again, this is something we know. That is why we have been working hard on unfair dismissal. That is why we have been working hard to improve the climate for small business, because it will create jobs. The society also said, and it is a very important point of this package:The government has listened to the calls of small business to reduce the compliance costs they are facing.It goes on to say:It has shown it is prepared to listen to the concerns of small business and provide meaningful reforms to cut red tape and recognise the compliance burdens they face.The headline from COSBOA, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, says it all. It says, `Drought breaks in small business tax.' This is very good for small business. It is good that it has been wellreceived by the small business community; that is no surprise to us. You should not forget also, Mr Speaker, that it comes on top of the ANTS package, the new tax system,  where we did some great things for small business. Never forget: it was this government -  -  - I take the interjections. Those opposite say in a cynical tone that it was a ripper. We are abolishing provisional tax, and anybody who has been in small business knows that provisional tax has sent a lot of businesses broke over the years. We are abolishing it. This is undoubtedly good news for small business, and that means good news for jobs.</DOC>

 - One of the great things about cutting company tax rates is that companies have more cash - more cash to reinvest and more cash to engage in R&amp;D. This idea that you would actually help companies by raising the company tax rates so that the 125 per cent concession is worth more is called Labor economics. Let me turn it around the other way. I think the argument is that the concession is worth less because the company tax rate is lower. So that would mean, of course, that if you were actually putting up company tax rates you should reduce R&amp;D concessions to maintain parity. Let me give you an example. Before the 1993 election the Labor Party, as I recall, promised to reduce company tax. After the 1993 election, like the l-a-w tax cuts, they actually put it up. When they put it up, did they reduce the R&amp;D concession to maintain parity? Of course they didn't. These people have form. Some of us  were actually here prior to the 1993 election. There are a lot of people who forget that, not only after the 1993 election did the Labor Party increase every wholesale sales tax -  - The Labor Party pulled it down before the 1993 election. After the 1993 election, they increased every wholesale sales tax rate. They took away the income tax cuts and they increased company taxes. I didn't notice them readjusting the R&amp;D concession.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his very important question. Clearly, as the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister have said, these new tax arrangements are great news for farmers. In the words of the Queensland Farmers Federation, the government is listening to farm concerns, and we have responded in this package. It is fairer, it is simpler and it will certainly provide real benefits to Australian farmers. The House will be familiar with the benefits that have already been provided to the rural sector through the ANTS package - the new taxation system - and these reforms in business tax will build on those benefits.Farmers in particular will appreciate the simplified system. They will appreciate the slashing in capital gains tax. Most farmers will pay only about 25 per cent maximum on their capital gains, and in many instances  even that will be able to be deferred because they will be selling one item to purchase a replacement asset. A retiring farmer or an incapacitated farmer leaving the farm at age 55 will be able to dispose of their property, if they have held it for 15 years, capital gains tax free. What an enormous contrast that is compared with the record of members opposite in relation to capital gains tax. They invented capital gains tax in the first place, after faithfully promising the people that they would never introduce a capital gains tax. And they have not learned the lesson. At the last election, the Labor Party actually promised to increase capital gains tax. By contrast, we are slashing capital gains tax, so that farmers will be able to retire without having the benefits of their labour taken away from them through high levels of capital gains tax. 	Farmers will also have access to the new, improved accelerated depreciation arrangements. Virtually all farmers will benefit from those arrangements, which will be a significant improvement from the point of view of simplicity and the real tax benefits that will be provided. Is it any wonder that the NFF and other farm organisations have given this package such a warm welcome? The President of the National Farmers Federation said:Farmers will be more competitive because they will be operating under a simpler and fairer system. The NFF welcomes the new simplified tax system for small business. Use of cash accounting will lower compliance costs while the enhanced depreciation provisions for small business will mean that many depreciation rates for common items of farm plant will actually increase from 1 July 2001.Congratulations, Mr Treasurer, on an excellent package - a package that farmers will justly welcome.</DOC>

 - The member would obviously remember that the responsibility for reserves falls with the assisting minister. Could I say, while I am here, that the deployment going on in Dili at the present moment is an excellent example of the professionalism of the Australian defence forces. This is the third day in which activities have been taking place there. They have been undertaken in an extremely professional manner, and they have been well organised on the ground. To date, they have been very well received by the local people in Dili, and, as the defence forces are deployed outside the township itself, they are meeting a great welcome from the people who are there. - As I was saying, this is an excellent opportunity for people in the House to get a report on what is actually happening on the ground in Dili today. I thought you may have been interested in that, because only yesterday we spent the entire day discussing it in this House, with your support. Because of that, I am appalled that you guys have paid so little attention to what is going on in Dili today.As I was saying, some 3,000 troops will be deployed in that province in the very near future, with full equipment, food, fuel and resources. As I said, the question dealing with the reserves should be addressed to the minister assisting. The question of rotation will be dealt with when that becomes relevant.</DOC>

 - As a result of initiatives that the government passed through the parliament in June and as a result of our discussions and our recent trip to New York, Merryl Lynch has announced the launch of 12 international funds out of Australia over the next few months. These 12 international mutual funds will raise in excess of $US1 billion from Australian mums and dads for global investment. This is an excellent initiative. It follows on the expansion over the last six months of operations in Australia of Dow Jones, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale, Deutsche Bank, the Asia Loan Market Association and the Financial Intelligence Agency.It is no surprise that the Labor Party would choose not to listen to this, because the Labor Party has had absolutely no hand in helping to deliver jobs to the Australian people. It is no surprise that a company like LookSmart - Australian innovation; Australian product - has gone to the United States to try to raise in excess of $US230 million to fund their operations. Good, smart Australian companies have had to go the Nasdaq and launch operations in the United States to get ahead. LookSmart now employs over 500 people in the United States. As a result of the initiatives announced yesterday companies like that will have the opportunity to employ Australians and to raise capital in Australia.Mr Speaker, it is no surprise that the Labor Party has been flailing today in its analysis of the Ralph review from yesterday. Do you  know why? It is because the Labor Party gets its tax policy advice from the union movement. Mr Speaker, I do not know if I can reveal my sources for that. -  - Well, if I am being pushed into it: the source of the Labor Party's tax advice is none other than the union movement. That was best explained by Peter Walsh. Do you remember him? Peter Walsh, former finance minister of the Labor Party, said in the 1980s:The ACTU, as usual, was a significant obstacle to fair and just tax policy.John Edwards in Keating: The Inside Story  said:The ACTU had an influence that approached an effective right of veto over the new tax.When it comes to initiatives in the financial centre and when it comes to taxation initiatives to attract businesses to Australia we get our tax advice from the people who pay tax - the business community. That is the big difference. You get your advice from the union movement. - </DOC>

 - I would be perfectly happy to examine that report and perfectly happy to get advice on it. If there is anything further that I can add, I would be very happy to provide that to the House. I do not immediately have the answer. I must say that, although I read things very carefully and I try to keep across the paper that comes to my desk, I do not retain in my mind the travel movements of every diplomat who represents Australia abroad. I would be very happy to check that out, and if there is anything I can provide to the Leader of the Opposition and to the House I would be very happy to do so.The question asked by the Leader of the Opposition is of a piece with the proposition that continues to be advanced that, in some way, it would have been possible to inject an international peacekeeping force into the situation in East Timor in advance of the holding of the ballot. All roads lead to that Rome as far as this particular argument is concerned. It is a proposition that the opposition advances, and they are entitled to do that. But we are equally entitled to make the obvious point that no less a person than Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations - who, arguably, along with the leadership shown by Australia, played a bigger role than anybody else in bringing about the insertion of the peacekeeping force that is now there - not only cast doubt on the peacekeeping force into Timor before the ballot was held but also made it very plain that, if the international community had sought to marshal an international peacekeeping force before then, the ballot would not have taken place.If there is one thing that we can be absolutely certain of it is that, if this government - or indeed any government around the world - had done anything to prevent the holding of that ballot after the 25 years of pain that the people of East Timor had gone through, we would have been condemned from one end of the country to the other. Those who would have been loudest in condemning us would have been those who sat opposite. Those who now say, `You could  have got peacekeepers in,' are being completely wise after the event. Nobody who understands this situation seriously believes that it would have been possible to have got the peacekeepers in, to have got the support of the Indonesians for that to have occurred and to have preserved the timetable of the ballot. Indeed, if the world had made to inject peacekeepers before the holding of the ballot, Dr Habibie would have, in my view, run away from the proposition he put at the beginning of this year, and we would now be debating the point that East Timor's independence was as far away as it has ever been over the last 25 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and appreciate his concern about the humanitarian situation that the people of East Timor are now facing. As the House knows, hundreds of thousands have lost their homes and are in urgent need of food, shelter, medicines, water, sanitation and protection. Australia is playing a key part in the coordinated international effort to help these people. Australian logistical support has been critical to ensuring a quick international response to the humanitarian crisis in Timor. Provision of warehouses in Darwin provided a base for aid agencies to pre-position supplies for delivery to Timor. Australian funded commercial transport are carrying food, shelter, materials, medical equipment and supplies to East Timor. An Australian funded barge will leave Darwin for Dili either today or tomorrow carrying 130 tonnes of humanitarian relief supplies and also some vehicles. An Australian funded transport plane is also moving personnel and equipment for the United Nations relief coordinator to Dili today.Emergency aid drops, as the House would know, began last Friday following approval from the Indonesian authorities for the flights late on Thursday night. I am pleased to say  that, after a period of flights not being possible because of the arrival of the multinational force, flights have now resumed. Four flights are due to take place today using Australian Defence Force and other international military aircraft as well as a World Food Program C130. These flights will drop emergency ration packs and high energy biscuits, and the combined drops will feed over 40,000 people. It is important that the House understand that the situation in West Timor, not just in East Timor, is very grave and that it is very difficult to get access to the displaced East Timorese in the refugee camps in West Timor. The international community is working to free up access to these camps to provide relief and protection. The Australian embassy in Jakarta's representative is today visiting camps in West Timor with a United States led international mission. These are initial contributions only. The government is committed to the needs and the development of the East Timorese people. This is, of course, going to be not a short-term task but a long-term task. It is a task to which we are committed.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is yes. The answer to the second part of the question is no. If the member for Kingsford-Smith is unwilling to accept my version of the discussion that I had with Dr Habibie perhaps he would be willing  to accept the version proffered by the spokeslady for Dr Habibie, Dewi Fortuna Anwar, who not only said that I raised it on one occasion; she alleged that I raised it on three occasions during the Bali summit. I think most members of the parliament would see no inconsistency between that and what the foreign minister has said.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, his summary of the thrust of that letter is broadly right. It is true that our position was - as he knows, because he criticised it - to argue for autonomy for a period of time in advance of independence, if that was what people ultimately wanted. The catalyst for the letter was that for the first time an Australian government was advocating to the Indonesian government that there should be an act of self-determination by the people of East Timor.We were the first ever to have done that. The Keating government did not do it, the Hawke government did not do it, the Fraser government did not do it and the Whitlam government did not do it. So, broadly, our proposition at that stage was that there should be this period of autonomy. In reality, I do not shy away in any way from saying that our position was initially that there should be a period of autonomy followed by a process that could have led to independence. At the time we were criticised by both the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Kingsford-Smith. Both of them said at that time, `No, that is not going far enough. You should go to independence.' They themselves, of course, in government, under Mr Keating, failed to do that - that government having been the most acquiescent of all the Australian governments towards the Suharto regime. There is one thing that can never be rewritten and that is the acquiescence of the Keating government towards the Suharto government.The other point that I would make to the member for Kingsford-Smith is that it is true, as I indicated in my speech yesterday, that Dr Habibie went further than what was advocated in that letter, and in the process - as I argued yesterday, and it is undeniably the case - created an absolutely irreversible dynamic. The proposition that an Australian government - the President of Indonesia, unexpectedly, for the first time for a quarter of a century having said, `I will allow an act of self-determination that involves the option of independence' - should then turn around and argue, after all that had been advocated in this country and all that had been advocated  around the world, and from within large sections of the Australian Labor Party in particular, that, `No, this is going too far - please stop,' is a ridiculous proposition. It is not a proposition that was seriously argued at the time.But it does not alter the fact that the letter that I wrote on behalf of the Australian government represented a historic change in the attitude of Australian governments because for the first time we advocated a move away from the perpetual sovereignty of Indonesia over East Timor. We argued not only that should they engage the leadership of the East Timorese people but also that they should have an act of self-determination. We had argued for that in a way that the previous government had not done so, and it represented a historic change in Australian attitudes.It is true that Dr Habibie, to the surprise of many, went further - I think to his credit. I remain of the view that Dr Habibie has displayed great courage and that he has not received the praise around the world that he is entitled to, both in relation to the leadership he showed on democracy and also in relation to the giving of a vote to the people of East Timor. So I say to the member for Kingsford-Smith, yes, your broad analysis of what that letter said is correct, and the situation is as I have outlined it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. She represents a very important naval and defence installation. I know that she, along with many other members of the House, has taken a very real interest in what Defence and government are doing to ensure that those families and next of kin are supported whilst the troops are deployed in East Timor.The National Welfare Coordination Centre has been established and that is going to provide a 24-hour point of contact for families and the next of kin of ADF personnel who are deployed in East Timor. The National Welfare Coordination Centre tasks include, firstly, providing the Defence Community Organisation with details of families of deployed soldiers so that they can establish contact and assess the families' needs and, secondly, developing family support plans in conjunction with the regional Defence Community Organisation officers. This may include assistance in areas such as home maintenance. For the benefit of members of the House, the contact number for the centre is a 1800 number. Many members may be interested in it because they may get calls from constituents. The number is 1800 801 026.Further to that, the centre supplements the usual support provided to families by Defence Community Organisation officers and the Family Information Network. Already in its first day of operation, the centre responded to some 270 calls. That is a measure of the importance of this centre. The Family Information Network for Defence took some 140 calls. They are certainly being utilised for the reasons they were put in place. Equally important, the families will be given contact details of regional defence community organisations. Obviously, officers in regional areas are also very important to families out in those areas.The Defence Community Organisation will also sponsor social gatherings which will promote networking and also reinforce the valuable role that spouses and families play - one that we should acknowledge as a parliament. On top of this, the Department of Veterans' Affairs will provide automatic treatment for post traumatic stress disorder, and personnel and their dependants will have access to the services that are provided by the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service, including in regional areas. Many parts of regional Australia do not have a Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service but, with agency arrangements that are in place, some 300 counsellors are in regional areas across Australia. We are not forgetting the regional  dimension of where defence personnel so often are drawn from.Also, some seeding grants will be made available under the Defence Family Support Funding Program for groups with initiatives that are designed to support families while personnel are on the deployment. Further, we have had a lot of inquiries in relation to mail deliveries to those deployed into East Timor. Arrangements are being made for regular mail deliveries. I ask the House to understand that defence personnel have only just arrived in East Timor and are establishing their base and the security of the area. When those arrangements are put in place, they will be made available to the families. Also, that information will be available on Defence's web site.</DOC>

 - Next week the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be at the United Nations, at which time he will contact all the relevant foreign ministers who have indicated support for the coalition forces and make sure that there is a follow-up on the commitments that have been made. In the meantime, I have spoken to some of the ministers concerned in defence, the VCDF has travelled in South-East Asia in contact with a number of his interlocutories and we are still receiving contributions from coalition partners this day. Being deployed into Townsville at the moment are some Filipinos. I anticipate that the build-up of the coalition forces will take some time. In the meantime the ADF, the New Zealand contingent, elements of the British and elements of the Gurkhas are deployed in East Timor, along with some American elements. That force is doing a particularly good job, and I would like to pay a very big compliment to General Cosgrove.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Lindsay for his question. As the member for his particular seat, he has responsibility for the Lavarack base -  - I said his seat. - I will rephrase that. I thank the member for Herbert for his contribution in asking the question. He does represent the Lavarack base, which is one of the main  contributors to INTERFET - International Force East Timor - that is currently being deployed in East Timor. Therefore, his particular contribution has proved very much welcome.I am able to inform the House today that we have deployed 2,468 ADF personnel to East Timor and another 987 are serving in ships in the operation. The speed and smoothness of the build-up of these forces, along with the very welcome contributions of our coalition partners, is most heartening. I am particularly pleased to be able to report that the current level of deployment includes 282 personnel from our coalition partners. As I said before, I think the people of Australia should be very proud of the way in which we have been able in three weeks to put together a coalition force, to land them in East Timor and to be operating in that country today.The situation in East Timor remains very dangerous. We have been tragically reminded of this by the death of a Dutch journalist there in the last couple of days. I want to take this opportunity to convey to journalists and to their editors that East Timor is, and will remain for some time, a very dangerous place. INTERFET cannot provide protection for all individuals who travel to East Timor. Its priority is the safety and security of the people of East Timor themselves. INTERFET is able to provide protection and support for a small number of accredited journalists chosen on a pool basis. Others travel strictly at their own risk. I urge non-accredited journalists, and especially their editors, who should take responsibility for their safety, to stay out of East Timor at this time.Clearly the scale of the deployment to East Timor is posing a major challenge for the ADF. However, because of the decision we took in February this year to raise the readiness of a second brigade, we have now available to us sufficient forces to deploy and maintain on East Timor a contingent of up to 4,500 personnel for about a year. This includes sufficient forces to allow for rotation of units. The government has been advised by the ADF that they will spend no more than nine months on deployment, and if possible less. These are operational matters, and the  government is in very close contact with the leadership of ADF and will naturally act on its advice on these important matters. We are also conscious of the families at home of our troops in East Timor and, within the bounds of the operational requirements, we will try to provide as much certainty to these families as possible in regard to the duration of the deployment.Our present force will also allow us at the same time to maintain significant forces to deal with other contingencies that may arise and to ensure that we have the forces for critical national tasks such as a counter-terrorism response for the Olympics. That is most important. We hope that within a year the situation in East Timor will have improved to the point that our forces can be withdrawn or at least significantly reduced, and we are certainly working with the United Nations to ensure that this occurs. But the government recognises that there is a possibility that they may need to sustain deployment for longer than that. We are therefore developing plans to provide the extra forces that would be needed to sustain a deployment of 4½ thousand personnel beyond the initial 12 months. That will involve raising the readiness of a number of additional battalions.The government will be taking decisions in the near future about the ways in which this can be best done to ensure that the preparation of these forces can begin early so they can be as well prepared as those currently there. At present reserves are not required to meet our main personnel needs for the deployment in East Timor, although we will seek reservist volunteers for some specialist areas, such as dental and engineering services, as we have often done in other deployments. We have not yet decided what call there will be on the reserves to help provide the extra battalions we will be preparing to support the longer term commitment. This is one of the issues that will be considered over the next week.I reject totally the scaremongering of the opposition on this matter. We do have sufficient forces to deploy and maintain a contingent of 4½ thousand in East Timor for at least a year. That includes sufficient forces for  rotation of units. The government is working closely with the leadership of the ADF to ensure our deployment to East Timor is adequately resourced. That is the case at the moment and will continue to be the case. The government is committed very much to the forces of the ADF.</DOC>

 - I am aware of the comments made by General Glenny. I disagree. We are in a position, because of the foreplanning of the government in raising a second brigade in readiness, as I said just a minute ago, to keep 4,500 Australian forces in East Timor for at least a year and rotate. That is genuine forward planning and it does not show any shortage of personnel or resources.Some members of the Reserve have volunteered to go to East Timor; some have volunteered to join the permanent force. Those elements of the reserves that we have asked to serve in that area are doing so on a purely voluntary basis. In the meantime other questions of direct detail about the reserves should be directed to the assistant minister.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. The government's Defence Reform Program has produced a Defence Force more combat ready than it has been for a quarter of a century. The coalition's focus on combat capability has seen a shift of resources from the administrative areas to the sharp end. Because of this there are more regular Army personnel in combat related roles than when the coalition came to government. These are the facts. We have brought a second brigade sized group - 1 Brigade in Darwin - to a higher state of readiness at 28-days notice to move. In December 1997 we introduced to the Army individual readiness notices. What that means is that personnel must now meet set fitness requirements and be ready to deploy, focusing on the individual soldiers and their need to be combat ready. So we are in a very strong position to support this deployment.The deployment is relying primarily on our regular forces, although reserve specialists like medical officers are a vital component. Of course, in our overall defence capability reservists do fill an important role. We have at the moment some 23,000 regular Army personnel who have the basic soldiering skills required for deployments like East Timor. Our active Reserve numbers are significant. The Army has some 20,000 personnel, the Navy some 1,300 and the Air Force some 1,600.Over 2,500 of the Army reservists are recent trainees who have been through the same level of basic training as our regular forces, through the common induction training. This means that they are available and are useful if needed. We do have a sizeable pool of skilled personnel to draw on in our Reserve ranks. Having said that, we will continue our existing recruiting program for reservists and also for regulars, particularly at this time of the year as the school year and the academic year ends. It is obviously an ideal time to be out there recruiting, as has been happening for many years, and looking  for the skills that are needed in a modern defence force. In the medium and longer term, an increased recruiting effort and more flexible training will continue to ensure that we have sufficient part-time and regular ADF personnel to meet our nation's needs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. I begin by saying that I am sure all of us here were very saddened by the death of the Dutch journalist, Mr Sander Thoenes, and I wish to express the government's condolences to his family. His death and the recent attack on two other journalists are, however, tragic reminders that the situation in Dili remains extremely dangerous and unstable. While the arrival of INTERFET is having some impact on improving security, particularly in and around Dili, the risks involved should not be underestimated.The government has stressed that the post-ballot period would be difficult and dangerous, and we have made clear, without any  attempt to underestimate the task, that our forces would be going into a potentially dangerous situation. There are now around 300 international journalists in East Timor, which is a very large number, as well as a significant number of humanitarian and NGO workers. These people need to be very alert to the enormous risks that they face. INTERFET cannot guarantee the safety of foreign nationals who move beyond the force's area of immediate control.The advice of the government to Australians, for whom we obviously have a particular responsibility, but this does apply to foreigners generally, is that the situation remains extremely dangerous and Australians are advised not to travel to East Timor. We recognise there are Australians who want to travel to East Timor to do humanitarian work there, but too large an influx of Australians and foreign nationals will make the work of INTERFET more difficult, not easier. As I said, those people will be at risk. The government's concerns at the risks, especially for journalists, have been very long held. Indeed, members may be aware that earlier this year I wrote to the major Australian media outlets warning them of the very great risks to journalists in East Timor. We had discussions with newspaper editors, and their representatives, and other media outlet editors just before the results of the ballot were announced to once more underline the risks involved and to advise of the contingency plans to get people out. The important point for all Australians in East Timor, or who wish to go near East Timor, and to foreign nationals is that this situation is extremely dangerous, and they should act with the greatest caution and avoid East Timor if they possibly can.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and obviously I am aware of a large amount of information that was available both before the ballot took place and after the ballot took place but before the result was announced. I have said on many occasions, including publicly - I recall an occasion at the end of July in Jakarta when I did that and it was widely publicised in the Australian press - and also privately in conversations with other foreign ministers, including Madeleine Albright, that the most dangerous period in this East Timor process would be the beginning of phase 2, after the result of the ballot was announced. And we have never had any illusions about that.It is okay to make party political points, and I am not knocking you for that because I accept that is the nature of the system, but I would have thought the fact that the Australian Defence Force was ready for such a contingency - that is, a contingency where it would have to go in as the lead element of a peacekeeping force - was a pretty clear demonstration of the measure of our concern. I remember the newspaper headlines earlier this year, when the brigade was established in Darwin, about Australia getting troops ready for East Timor. Obviously we were concerned that these headlines might not play very well in Jakarta but, nevertheless, that was very much the motive behind the establishment of the brigade, that we would be ready in the event of a contingency.I also draw the honourable member's attention to the fact that we had in place a very sophisticated and a very successful  arrangement to evacuate people from East Timor in the event that the sorts of circumstances that did arise arose. I would have thought just the fact of the readiness of the Australian Defence Force, both in terms of the brigade in Darwin and the contingency plans for evacuation - which, by the way, worked very well - demonstrated the depth of our concern as to how things could change for the worst and what could happen. There are obviously a range of assessments, and the honourable member quotes one, and many others, of one kind or another, have been quoted to me. All I can say is that we now know what happened. We could not precisely predict the future, and no-one ever can, but we did make available and put in place contingencies in case what happened did happen.When the history of this issue is written, one of the things which people will regard as remarkable will be the speed with which we were able to get this multinational force onto the ground. Member countries of the United Nations have been enormously warm in their congratulations for what Australia has done in putting together that multinational force so quickly. Whatever the debate may be here in Australia, I can assure the House that, out there in the international community, this country has won enormous admiration for what it has done to get that force onto the ground so quickly. I have been told by long-serving Security Council diehards - and the honourable member can check this in New York next week to see if it is right - that the resolution got through the Security Council in record speed. We stayed there, I recall only too clearly, until after 3 a.m. to get that Security Council resolution through.To get that force onto the ground as quickly as we did demonstrates that (1) we were ready if the worst happened, which it did, and (2) our diplomacy was effective in making sure that a multinational force could be deployed within three weeks.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. As members of the House would be aware, the government announced during the week the first overhaul of Australia's capital gains tax system. This has the opportunity to cut capital gains tax by half for all individual taxpayers. It means that taxpayers who elect to go into the new system after 30 September 1999 get the option to pay capital gains tax at half the rate.I saw some commentary in the paper today from ACOSS saying that this was too generous and, on the other hand, I saw some commentary from the Real Estate Institute saying that it was too tough. I want to make it entirely clear that the changes involve a trade-off. For those people who elect to go into the half-rate system, it will be on the nominal gain; there is a trade-off for indexation and averaging. For those people who want to keep the benefit of indexation, they keep that benefit until 30 September but will have to pay at the full rate in relation to gains.Yesterday the New South Wales Treasurer, Mr Egan, said - and I recommend this to members of the Labor Party; he is one of its own Treasurers - to the Legislative Council:I do not often do this and I do not expect I will do it often in the future, but on this occasion I would like to give the Federal Government and . . . the Commonwealth Treasurer, high marks: somewhere between a credit and a distinction. The New South Wales Government welcomes the Commonwealth's response to the final report of the review of business taxation.No wonder we have this constant baying from the Labor Party frontbench. It is yet to take a position in relation to business taxation. These changes to capital gains tax are due to start on 30 September, and people will be making decisions from 30 September on the basis of this new taxation system.Either Labor can follow the lead of Mr Egan and endorse the package, in which case people will know, and there will be certainty in relation to the taxation system, or Labor can continue to search around looking for an opportunistic or populist issue to try to avoid  the crunch. I commend Mr Egan's comments to them:The New South Wales Government welcomes the Commonwealth's response to the final report of the review of business taxation. It believes that the changes proposed by the Commonwealth will, overall, have a favourable impact on business in Australia and, as a consequence, jobs growth.</DOC>

 - Let me begin by saying that I regret the attack on John Dauth by the member for Kingsford-Smith. Mr Dauth was chief of staff to the member for Holt at one stage, and he served the member for Holt with loyalty. He has also served me and the government with commendable loyalty as a deputy secretary and, before that, as first assistant secretary in my department. I remember when we were in opposition that, if there was any sense of criticism of a senior public servant from the opposition, there was enormous outrage from the Labor Party. I think the Labor Party should be reminded of that point. - Funnily enough, I was not actually at the Senate committee meeting nor, my friend, was I quoted. On the more specific question of the relationship between Kopassus  and the militias and the activities of Kopassus, as you can imagine this is always - as Mr Dauth's carefully chosen words illustrate - a very delicate and sensitive question because Kopassus is the special forces element of the Indonesian military. Any bold assertions and claims one way or another can raise questions about the source of that sort of information and, of course, has political implications as well. Let me put it to the House this way: there have been concerns expressed from time to time about the association between not just the Indonesian military but specifically the Indonesian special forces and the militias. Putting this into some sort of context, the House may be aware that this government suspended the joint exercises that we used to have with Kopassus, which were set up by your government.</DOC>

 - The end of the financial year for 1998-99 was, of course, on 30 June 1999. At the time of the budget, which we did in May, we estimated that the outcome would be a surplus of $2.9 billion. I have been advised by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Finance and Administration that the actual outcome, the underlying cash surplus, for the year completed 1998-99 will not be the estimated $2.9 billion but in fact will be $4.2 billion, exceeding the estimate made in the May budget. In addition to that, in the 1998-99 budget the Commonwealth reduced net debt by over $24 billion. That was, of course, principally from the proceeds of asset sales and, because the budget was in underlying surplus, every last dollar of asset sales went to reducing Commonwealth net debt. Mr Speaker, that compares with the 1995-96 budget which, you will recall, the Labor Party said would be a surplus but ended up as a $10.6 billion deficit some months later.Obviously, in relation to 1999-2000 and the following year, 2000-01, there will be addi  tional new expenditures that were not forecast at budget time, principally in relation to East Timor. As a result of Australia's commitment in military and humanitarian terms, there will be considerable new expenditures to maintain the force in East Timor and to engage in the humanitarian aid that is required. We expect that those expenditures, which were unforeseeable at the time, but are absolutely necessary - and the government has given a commitment that the Australian forces in the field will not suffer from a lack of resources in any way whatsoever in relation to that - will have to be funded as new expenditures under the budget. We expect to be able to announce some of the impact of that when we do the mid-year reviews in November of this year. But, of course, one of the measures that allow us to make that commitment in East Timor is the fact that the budget is now in surplus. If Australia had not been able to run a strong economy in the last couple of years, we would not have been able to mount the operation that we have and, consistent with those requirements, the government is still determined to exercise a strong fiscal line in the years in front of us.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Let me begin by saying that our immediate priorities obviously remain the improvement of the security situation in East Timor through INTERFET and to ensure that humanitarian assistance is provided to the population in East Timor because, obviously, the suffering and the killing must end and end quickly. We have said that we would support an investigation of human  rights abuses through a coordinated, United Nations-wide response based on the existing United Nations Security Council resolution. Consistent with the established principles on the handling of these sorts of matters, the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva will be considering this matter on 23 and 24 September. Honourable members may know that Australia is not a member of the Commission on Human Rights so we of course cannot vote on any resolution that may be introduced into the special session. A draft resolution is being prepared for this special session by the European Union and that is being circulated now for consideration by other members. In relation to this process, it will be important for the effectiveness of any resolution to have the broadest possible support among members of the Commission on Human Rights. This would not be an occasion for grandstanding but for ensuring that there is genuine assistance to the people of East Timor.Any decision to, for example, examine crimes against humanity will, I think you will find Mr Speaker, flow first and foremost from this resolution and then in turn be considered by the Security Council. I have been advised that this is a procedure that has been followed on previous occasions and is judged by the United Nations to be the appropriate way to carry this forward. I understand the honourable member's quite sincere concern about this, but next week when he is in New York it will be an opportunity for him as well as me to take these procedures up. Of course, by then we will know whether the European Union's text has been accepted by the Commission for Human Rights in Geneva. I think it is likely that it will be. I am not going to foreshadow what that text says, but that does provide a course of action for taking this matter forward.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question, and know of her real interest in the importance of infrastructure. There is no doubt that the future of our infrastructure industries in this country will be heavily dependent upon private sector investment. I was surprised to learn recently that of the 100 biggest economic entities in the world today, more than half are not nation states, they are private sector business entities and, increasingly, they have an interest in providing infrastructure. I believe we as societies have an interest in facilitating that investment. 	 One of the tasks faced by the Ralph committee was to look at how this country could best mobilise the resources of business to contribute to the infrastructure development which is so essential to the future development of economies and jobs such as we see in Australia. In fact, I am told that the total transport task in Australia - the total volume of goods to be moved around and the weight of those goods - will double over the next 20 years, which is faster than economic growth and certainly much faster than population growth in this country. That gives some idea of how urgent the task will be in relation to, in particular, transport infrastructure.To invest, business needs an environment that encourages rather than hinders investment in infrastructure. A business tax system is therefore needed that is simple - not complex - and tax law that is certain both in its application and administration and eliminates, as far as possible, doubt. The government announced on Tuesday that it would deliver, very strongly against those objectives, a world-class tax system that will provide a major stimulus to investment in infrastructure, and through an internationally competitive company tax rate reward that investment. I believe that private infrastructure investors should feel very confident about the encouragement these changes provide for them to add to the country's productive capacity through basic infrastructure investment.The current tax regime - Labor's tax regime - includes a series of complex interlinked mechanisms which have often acted together to dissuade private sector investment in infrastructure. Our announcement that  accelerated depreciation will be replaced for those outside the simple tax system regime by an effective life based regime, at the same time as we indicated that we will consider providing investment allowances along with an expanded strategic investment coordination process for major projects, means that decisions will be taken in due course on how this target assistance will be provided and what form it will take.It also led the Ralph committee to recommend that, if accelerated depreciation was replaced by effective life depreciation, section 51AD of the Income Tax Act - which has created some problems for infrastructure investment through public-private partnerships - would no longer be relevant, and simpler arrangements could be put in place and could be applied to leases over major depreciable assets such as infrastructure. I believe that we are looking at a major simplification that will really encourage investment by the private sector in infrastructure in this country. I think that is a very good thing for taxpayers, for the community at large and for jobs.</DOC>

 - I have got to give the Leader of the Opposition full marks for a surprise question. I really do have to give the Leader of the Opposition full marks. That came like an Exocet missile on an unsuspecting Prime Minister, that is all I can say. Mr Speaker, having been caught utterly unprepared and having been caught totally by surprise by this question, cunningly devised at the opposition tactics meeting this morning, let me take a moment to reflect upon the capacity of those who sit on the front bench of the government. I look immediately behind me and I see the Treasurer. The Treasurer has had the major responsibility for presiding over a remarkable transformation, to the great benefit of the Australian nation, of the books  of account of the Commonwealth. He inherited as Treasurer of Australia -  -  - Yes, it is, and I would like to prolong the humour, Mr Speaker. -  - Mr Speaker, the Treasurer has presided, in a quite remarkably skilful fashion, over the transformation of the books of account of the Commonwealth - inheriting a deficit of $10½ billion and, a year ahead of schedule, turning it into a surplus. In that respect, I cannot think of a performance that has been surpassed by any other Treasurer, and I give him full marks for that remarkable achievement. - `Indispensability' goes to quality, and he is quality. I move on and look further behind me, slightly to the right, and I come to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. Of all the  difficult issues that my government has had to handle over the last 3½ years, none has involved more sustained pressure on the responsible minister than the remarkable transformation of the Australian waterfront. I want to pay tribute to the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business for the tremendous job that he did. -  - He displayed both strength and grace under great pressure, and I pay him an unstinting compliment. Then I move to the Deputy Prime Minister, the now Minister for Transport and Regional Services. If ever anybody was responsible for beating off the scourge of One Nation, it was John Anderson. John Anderson beat off that scourge. John Anderson stood there against those unacceptable attitudes in the Australian bush, and I give him full marks. Then I go to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. -  - The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been an absolute ornament to that position. -  - Gee, I like question time. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been an ornament. -  - Not only did he play an absolutely indispensable role in putting together the international peace force but, Mr Speaker, if you go back over the 3½ years that the minister has been occupying that position, you will find that he was also responsible in a very major way for the ban on landmines. He played a very major role in  relation to the ban on landmines. He has played a very major role in rebalancing Australia's foreign policy. - I have previously spoken very warmly of the skill, tact, diplomacy and ability of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I want to say to the House that he has done a remarkably fine job in that position over the last 3½ years. And his colleague the Minister for Defence: we are able to play a lead role in East Timor because of the foresight of the Minister for Defence. If the Minister for Defence had not come to us and given us advice to get that brigade into a state of greater readiness, we would not have been able to respond immediately. We would not have been able, to the great pride of Australia, to assume leadership of that mission. Then I go to my colleague the Minister for Finance and Administration. -  - The Minister for Finance has presided over a most remarkable program of privatisation. He is responsible for the fact that we now have the second largest share-owning democracy in the world. Next to him is the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. He has been responsible for bringing back apprenticeships to Australia. The Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has rebuilt the Australian apprenticeship system. Along with his colleagues Senator Vanstone and the Minister for Employment Services, he has played a major role, an absolutely major role, in designing a world first - that is, the market based employment services of Australia. That is a world first.Then we have the Minister for Aged Care sitting next to him. I tell you what: one of her remarkable achievements has been to put the  member for Lilley in his place on numerous occasions. Then there is the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Amongst the things that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has done is to carry on, in an extremely dignified way, representations in the interests of veterans in Australia and also Defence personnel. I might remind the House that only last Friday this government increased, by almost 50 per cent, the tax-free operational allowance of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are serving in East Timor. That has happened under the authority of that particular minister.I move then to my colleague and friend the Minister for Employment Services. The Minister for Employment Services, in his engagingly laconic style, has played a major role in selling to the people of Australia the great benefits of the new deregulated labour market in this country. He has demonstrated, in a short period of only a year in that job, what a great grasp he has of that portfolio and his great concern for the young unemployed of this country.Then we have the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. There is no minister in this country who is a greater friend of blue-collar workers than the Minister for Forestry and Conservation. If the blue-collar workers of Australia want a friend, Wilson Tuckey is their man. Then there is the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, who is carving out a new horizon, leading the charge to make Australia a world financial centre, already attracting investment from firms like Merrill Lynch and many others.His colleague the Minister for Sport and Tourism I think is bringing great skill and great charm to a very important portfolio - that is, the portfolio of the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games. As for the Minister for Community Services, of all the people that I have seen cut their teeth early as a minister on a series of allegedly difficult opposition questions, none has come through with more flying colours than the Minister for Community Services. -  - I would not like anybody over here to be left out. Mark Vaile has, in  the two jobs that he has held in this government - particularly in the grasp that he has quickly acquired in relation to the Trade portfolio - demonstrated a great understanding of the diverse trading interests of the Australian community.I now turn to the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation. The Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation did have a short period of time on the interchange bench, but he has come back with tremendous skill and flair. The Minister for Health and Aged Care has presided over some of the major reforms in the Australian health system and I am immensely proud of him. The Attorney-General personally led the Australian case before the first major decision of the international tribunal testing the provisions of the law of the sea treaty and he won a resounding victory in relation to the Japanese incursion in relation to bluefin tuna fishing. -  - I move with very great deliberation and seriousness to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. I think even those who might disagree with the minister politically will acknowledge the self-evident decency and compassion that the minister brings to a very important portfolio.Finally, that brings me to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, who was another one who faced an overwhelming assault from the forces of One Nation in rural Queensland at the last election. He took a brave and principled stand in relation to the  allocation of preferences. He is bringing very great determination and skill to his job. The answer to the Leader of the Opposition's question is: they are all indispensable.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. Australia has been very good at producing ideas out of its research. We have not been nearly so good at developing those ideas through to successful commercialisation. Knowledge is mobile and too often good ideas have had to go overseas to be properly developed. One of the reasons for this history has been the uncompetitive capital gains tax that we have had in this country discouraging venture capital investment. Changing capital gains taxation is crucial to investors putting their money in longer term ventures that will deliver gains over the years ahead.The capital is available. The key thing is to have a taxation regime which will encourage  people to invest that capital. As a result of the government's taxation reforms announced by the Treasurer, the incentives for venture capital investment have been dramatically changed. Overseas pension funds that are tax exempt at home will be tax exempt here when selling investments in venture capital enterprises. Australian widely held superannuation funds will be provided with an exemption when they receive income from a pooled development fund representing gains on the disposal of eligible venture capital investment. This is going to further encourage the pooled development funds to engage in such investments. I have no doubt that these changes are going to significantly improve the availability of venture capital for Australian ideas and Australian research.I was very pleased to see Hugh Nile, the Manager Director of the pharmaceutical group Biota, welcome the reforms by saying:I think the tax reform puts Australia on an equal footing with other countries. The Australian capital gains tax system is now internationally competitive.The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee has also welcomed the lowering of the company tax rate which, it says:. . . gives companies increased scope to think about the medium- and long-term benefits of higher investment in research and development. This is essential if we are to encourage more and better linkages between business and our research centres.These decisions are an important complement to the green paper on research and development and research training which I have released. These initiatives of the government are going to make sure that in the years ahead more and more good Australian ideas are developed in Australia and do not have to go overseas to be developed.</DOC>

 - The full costings are in an 800-page report. There is no great secret about them. Since the release of the report, you have been able to look it up and find it out. If you open up the book, the costings are all there in the tables. We have taken them from the tables that were put to us by the Ralph review. Not only that, but we have actually accepted the recommendations of the Ralph review in all key areas, including in relation to capital gains tax and the assumptions that underpin them. As I said earlier, we have announced changes to capital gains tax that apply from 30 September. From next week people will be making decisions based on the new taxation system.What is the Labor Party going to be doing about that? Is it going to be trying to create an area of uncertainty so that people who are trading next week have to run the gauntlet of Labor Party oppositionism? Or will the Labor Party, as I thought it was going to do on Monday night, come along and say, `We accept this decision. It is a good decision. This is a great reform of business taxation and we support it,' so that people have certainty? That is a critical choice. The lead that has been given to you is the lead of Mr Michael Egan. He gave the Commonwealth government somewhere between a credit and a distinction in relation to business taxation.What is the Labor Party waiting for? Here you have an opportunity to be relevant to the tax debate, to endorse the government's decision and to get on with capital gains tax. All we say is: let us do it before next Monday because then people will be able to get on, make their decisions accordingly and take the benefits of a great new taxation system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. The taxation reforms announced by the government this week will unambiguously assist to improve the circumstance of Australia's exporting industries. They will also assist in jobs growth in export industries. In Australia, 1.7 million jobs rely on exports, that is, one in five Australian jobs. In America, it is only one in 10. This tax package unambiguously supports our export industries. Our farm exports account for $25 billion of exports; minerals and energy exports are worth $40 billion; manufactures are worth $22 billion. In the New England electorate alone, the wool industry, the beef industry, education services and manufacturing industries will all benefit from the lowering of the corporate tax rate to 30 per cent by this government. The lower tax rate will make the Australian economy and Australian exporting industries much more competitive.Australian companies will enjoy a rate which is 14 per cent lower than Canada's, 12 per cent lower than Japan's, five per cent lower than the rate in the US and equal to the rate in the UK, Germany, Europe, Thailand and Korea. Through modernising our taxation system, we are making the Australian economy far more competitive with the rest of the world. We want Australia's economy - in which Australia's exporting industries operate and use as a launching pad - to be seen as one of the world's most competitive economies for the new millennium.</DOC>

 - The assumptions on which that is based are the changes to capital gains tax generally and the fact that this will be such a significant cut. This is a halving of the actual Labor rate. As a result of the inquiry and the costings that were put to it, the Ralph committee said that it would lead to greater activity. Of course it will lead to greater activity, not only for the millions of Australian shareholders but in relation to scrip for scrip rollover and the opportunities that you will have to grow a small business big again, and the capital gains tax relief. Of course you will get much greater activity.I do not know where this is leading, but if it is leading to the point that the Labor Party opposes capital gains tax cuts, why doesn't it just say so? We are quite happy if the Labor Party stands up and says, `We are opposed to capital gains tax cuts.' But the Labor Party does not do that. The truth of the matter is that the Labor Party cannot bring itself to support a good government policy but it cannot bring itself to oppose it either. After we announced the change to business taxation, we had the extraordinary situation where the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said, `It's a good basis for negotiation.' No, it is a good basis for legislation. That is how you actually get good tax change. If the Labor Party wants to come out and stand for higher capital gains taxes, we would be happy with that. We will explain to the Australian people that that is consistent with the view the Labor Party took before the election. Remember? The Labor Party wanted to tax all pre-1985 capital gains. It would be totally consistent for the Labor Party to oppose cuts in capital gains tax.I think you will remember that it did not get you anywhere in the election. Afterwards, the Labor Party came to the view that this was not consistent with aspirational politics - and this is aspirational politics for the millions of Australians who own shares. We are quite happy to say that we support cutting the capital gains tax burden. If the Labor Party is opposed to it, say so. We will make sure that we negotiate these matters with the  Australian Democrats. If the Labor Party is in favour of it, come out and say so positively. Make it clear, because people are going to want to take decisions on 30 September and they deserve to know what the taxation treatment is going to be.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes for his representations on behalf of the primary producers in his own electorate. I am sure that they have given him the same enthusiastic response to this new tax package as other government members have noted in their own electorates. Yesterday the House heard how the National Farmers Federation have warmly endorsed this proposal. One of the major rural weeklies had as its headline today `Tax reforms to benefit farmers'. There has indeed been a very generous and warm response to the government's new tax arrangements, particularly with regard to the way in which this new package will reduce the compliance burden that faces farmers. There is nothing farmers hate more than paperwork. This new tax system will provide real benefits from 1 July 2001. Most will have access to cash accounting and the simpler arrangements for depreciation.Amongst the many media releases that have welcomed this proposal is one that particularly attracted my attention. This media release said that it supported the simplification of taxation arrangements for small farm business. It supported the objective of lowering the company tax rate for incorporated farm businesses. It was pleased that the government had decided to retain tax concessions for Landcare. It said that removing capital gains liability for farm assets held for more than 15 years will benefit a number of farmers planning to retire. It welcomed the decision to introduce new measures for venture capital - an outstanding endorsement. It may surprise  you to know that that endorsement came from none other than the member for Corio, the shadow minister for agriculture. There is quite a deal of confusion on the opposition benches, but at least the shadow minister for agriculture wanted to play himself into the field and to make it clear that there were many good measures in this proposal.Of course, he did like to have two bob each way; I will be fair to him. There is one group of people he is concerned about, and that is the small group of farmers who have a turnover of more than $1 million a year. The Labor Party well and truly lost its touch with the battlers in the bush. Their concerns are about the agribusinesses with turnovers of more than $1 million. The shadow minister is upset that they may not have access to some of these benefits. What he forgets is that these are the sorts of people who will benefit from a tax cut from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. That is a pretty worthwhile business benefit for anybody in agriculture, no matter how big their operation is. He complains that the government has not done enough, but I am sure all the farmers of Australia know full well that in 13 years Labor did nothing like this. All they did was put up taxes. Farmers well and truly know that under Labor they will get higher taxes; that it is only the coalition that delivers tax reform and real benefits to the rural sector.</DOC>

 - The Labor Party is apparently worried about productive investment; it wants productive investment and, just  to encourage it, wants a 48.5 per cent tax rate on it. The Labor Party has been running a 48.5 per cent capital gains tax on productive investment and stands here and says, `We are worried that, if you actually cut it, it might decrease productive investment.' If you cut the rate in half on productive investment you are worried that might decrease investment? We have heard a lot of propositions come out of the Australian Labor Party, but this has to be one of the great ones. Somebody behind me - I think it was the member for Adelaide - handed to me earlier a press release from the Financial Planning Association:The government's new business tax system reforms provide great incentives to invest and save, with effective CGT reform, support for superannuation, help for small business. The reforms will provide great support for Australia's investors, including retirees and small investors, through reductions in corporate tax rates, substantial improvement to the capital gains tax structure and benefits provided for business.What did Mr Egan say? Somewhere between a credit and a distinction. What was the Labor Party saying yesterday? I will go back and read the Hansard , but I thought the Deputy Leader of the Opposition came to the dispatch box yesterday and said he supported capital gains tax cuts.The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is remembered for two things in the last election. One is that he was going to tax pre-1985 assets and the other is that he was going to put up tax on Land Rovers - the memorable grab that he gave us about the Toorak tractors. He was the man who was going to chase the Toorak tractors off the road. Then we got elected and he decided that both of his policies were wrong. Lucky he wasn't elected to government.What this country needs are reductions in tax rates. It needs greater business tax reform. We need to get company taxes down, we need to get out concessions, we need to give small business relief, we need capital gains tax relief for small business. We need to cut the capital gains tax. This is the biggest review of business tax that we have had in Australia's history. It is an opportunity for Labor to dance the waltz of cooperation - with apologies to Mike Seccombe. It has been  a great tax reform, it has been a great reforming government, led by the Prime Minister. On behalf of all of his indispensable ministers, I would like to mention the indispensability of the Prime Minister, the leadership he has shown and the way the government is committed to reform. All it needs is a little bit of cooperation and a little bit of leadership from the Leader of the Opposition. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Forde. I well know her interest in these matters and how she appreciates that information technology and communication companies have embraced wholeheartedly the tax reforms the government has delivered, for they knew how uncompetitive the tax system was and how that drained investment in Australia and how it also led to innovation and innovators going overseas. It did not matter how much they pleaded with the previous Labor government: there were no changes to that uncompetitive tax regime.We have seen a lowering of the rate of capital gains tax. That is very important for foreign pension funds, which are the largest source of venture capital. They will now be able to invest tax free in Australia's early and expansion stage venture capital market. Attracting investment from them has also been successful in countries such as Israel in developing a successful growth strategy.Australian superannuation funds will receive a similar benefit in relation to investments made through pooled development funds. The Venture Capital Association now says that the amount of venture capital funds flowing into  Australia could double or triple in the next few years.For rural and regional Australia, the great potential of information technology and telecommunication industries is that people can work in remote areas. We are already seeing that with call centres and software development businesses being established in regional towns. So our policies are designed to coordinate this growth and development throughout Australia, including rural Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question, which gives me an opportunity to comment about both the article in which the expression was first used - which I might say is a very good article in the Bulletin  magazine - and the way in which comment has subsequently been made about that article by other correspondents. I make it clear that the government does not see Australia as playing the role of a deputy for the United States, or indeed any other country in the region, and neither does the government see the United States itself playing a role as a regional policeman, although continued American involvement in the region is vital to our security. That expression was used in the interview by the correspondent himself. As happens, such words can mean different things to different people. I want to make it clear, therefore, that it does not accurately represent my position, particularly in the context in which it has been used subsequently by others who have been critical of the government's foreign policy stance in the light of the failure of earlier foreign policy approaches to Indonesia over Timor.The situation in East Timor was that security in that area had broken down with the most appalling violence, destruction was being carried out, deaths were occurring on a wide scale, and my view - and the view of the government - was that the region could not wait for the United States to take the lead in restoring security: it was a regional problem  that the region itself should take a lead in managing. The government had increased the readiness of our armed forces in case peacekeeping was required and Australia was willing and able to cooperate with other regional colleagues in restoring order on East Timor and allowing the UN process, agreed with Indonesia, to go on.The government has made it clear throughout that we would not send forces to East Timor except at the request of the United Nations and with Indonesia's agreement. The government does not currently envisage other situations in the region that would require a peacekeeping response. Each and every situation has to be looked at on its own merits. East Timor was an exceptional situation: 80 per cent of the voting age population had opted for independence and their choice - as well as their lives - was threatened. Australia and the region, and the world as a whole, could not stand aside.As I made very clear in the Bulletin article, Australia makes absolutely no apology for the lead that it did take in relation to the East Timor situation, but it was, and remains, a lead taken in cooperation with our friends and neighbours in the region. An important characteristic of the multinational force in East Timor is that it is, as the name implies, multinational. The deputy commander of the force is an officer from the army of Thailand. In the past few days elements of the Philippines defence forces have appeared. There are contributions from the military forces of many other countries.It is worth reminding the House that at the very beginning of the crisis period of the very tragic East Timor saga a few weeks ago there were some in this country who were advocating that Australia should adopt a unilateral role - in other words, Australia should act alone; Australia should go in there irrespective of the consequences. We stood out very strongly against that. The course of events has vindicated the cool attitude that the government adopted at the time and the wisdom of the approach that was taken.It is also worth reminding the House that many of those, including some in the opposition who are now raising their voices in  criticism of government policy, were themselves directly complicit in 13 years of foreign policy failure and neglect which, more than anything else, has created the situation that is now faced in East Timor. The reality is that no serious attempt was made by the former government to address the problem. It has been left to a coalition government to reverse 25 years of over-accommodation to Indonesia by governments on both sides of politics in this country.</DOC>

 - In answer to the Leader of the Opposition, I would have said words to that effect in 1985 and I do not deny that for a moment. I have said before in this House, and I will repeat today, that I think over the last 25 years governments of both political persuasions have got it wrong in relation to East Timor. I do not exclude myself from  that, nor should you exclude yourself from your complicity in your government's failure.If we are to have a remotely serious discussion in this parliament and in this nation about issues of this kind, it would be helped by people on both sides acknowledging occasionally that the views they may have held some years ago have been demonstrated by the passage of events to have been wrong. There has been a bipartisan view in this country for a long period of time that, if push comes to shove on East Timor, you give in to the Indonesians. If we are honest with each other, that has been the attitude. That was the view that was taken by earlier governments. I think it is fair to say that the government which immediately preceded the current one practised this with rather more vigour and enthusiasm, and rather more weight was placed upon the relationship between Australia and Indonesia, no matter the cost, than could be said perhaps of either the Hawke government or the Fraser government.Events have moved on. Indonesia has changed. There are democratic stirrings in that country, which of course played a role in the change of heart of Dr Habibie when he decided, surprisingly to many, in February this year to have a ballot on either autonomy or independence.The Leader of the Opposition is perfectly entitled, in the nature of political combat, to drag up some remarks I made in 1985, and I do not walk away from those remarks any more than he should seek to walk away from remarks he made in earlier years. We can have a debate about the past; we should also have a debate about the present and, most importantly, a debate about the future. What has happened is that the world has changed, both in Indonesia and in our region. As a nation and as a parliament, we have to try to come to grips with that.As a country, we have sought - under the supervision of the United Nations, with the acquiescence of the Indonesian government and in cooperation with our regional friends and neighbours - to play a constructive role in East Timor. We can spend the next few weeks and months in the blame game or we can endeavour to come to terms with the  changed strategic reality that now faces this country.We are a nation that has a permanent interest in and a permanent commitment to this region. We also need as a nation to have a close relationship with Indonesia. Of course it is a matter of concern to me as Prime Minister, as I know it will be to the Leader of the Opposition, that relations between Australia and Indonesia, at certain levels, are under strain at the present time. That is something that in different ways different members of this parliament will endeavour to address. That strain was inevitable, given the stance that we took in relation to East Timor. We took a balanced approach. We endeavoured to engage the rest of the world about the fragility of the situation in East Timor. When it became apparent that the Indonesian government, through a combination of circumstances, was not doing enough to restore order and security in East Timor, we set about securing the support of the United Nations for the intervention of a peacekeeping force.It has to be said that if you look at the other peacekeeping force exercises of recent years, on this occasion the Security Council acted with remarkable speed. It acted with a speed which far exceeded the speed with which it acted in relation to trouble spots in Europe, in Africa and in other parts of the world over the last decade. That is a tribute to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. It is also a tribute to the diplomatic work of the foreign minister of Australia, who has displayed a very considerable professional application on this issue.Can I say again we seek good relations with the people of Indonesia. We seek a close relationship with that nation of 211 million people but as I said when I became Prime Minister in March 1996 and in relation to the rest of the world, that although we sought good relations with all countries, we had certain values and attitudes as a nation to propound and defend. We have continued to do that. We do not seek ever to impose our views on other countries; we do not seek any kind of regional police role. We seek rather to act in concert with friendly nations within our region to achieve mutually shared objec  tives. Peace and security in East Timor is a mutually shared objective of Australia, of the Philippines, of Malaysia, of Thailand and of many other nations in our region, and I remind the House again that it is very much a multinational force. Australia is proud to be able to lead it but it is a multinational force, and I pay tribute to those nations that have made major contributions to it.</DOC>

 - The answer to that question is yes, it has. Can I inform the House that Senator Newman will be delivering a major speech on welfare policy this Wednesday. It will canvass a lot of the broad issues affecting welfare policy. I would not be the least bit surprised if some of those who sit opposite find a certain resonance in the speech. I think the member for Werriwa will find something in the speech for him as will quite a number of others. If we can have a sensible debate about welfare policy the country will be enhanced as well because you may find a little bit of common ground there about some common mistakes that have been made in the past about some of the dangers of ultra dependency on welfare. So come and join a very sensible debate.Can I make it clear there has been a lot of unfounded and inaccurate speculation about the speech's contents. Contrary to reports, it will not contain any specific proposals regarding individual income support measures. The government remains very strongly committed to a compassionate, effective social security safety net, and the speculation of recent days ought to be seen in the context of that ongoing commitment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I should say at the outset that I believe the government's new business tax system will make a very significant contribution to an already very sound taxation and investment climate in this country which in fact is probably at its best for many years. This will undoubtedly build on that very real platform. Of course, that investment and the appropriate climate that we are now seeing is having a very positive impact on job creation as well as improving prosperity in real terms. We are seeing an improvement in people's living standards and a real improvement in prosperity of a sort that we have not seen for a very long time in Australia.This is good news that ought not be lost in the current climate. It will add to the significant gains that will flow from the removal of indirect taxation - of a sort that Labor wants to defend - from their broken tax system, the wholesale sales tax, and it will also see an improvement building on those big cuts in personal income tax that will come with the introduction of the GST next year. When you  couple that - from the point of view of rural and regional Australia, which goes to the heart of the question asked by the member - with the very substantial cuts in diesel fuel for the transport sector, you really get quite a shot in the arm for the bush. It is an initiative that Labor's spokesman for transport and regional development, the honourable member for Dickson, absurdly dismissed a little while ago as a $7.8 billion pollution boost over the next three years. That is Labor's view of the sort of major taxation reforms that we are now introducing. Perhaps it could be said that if she does not understand the value of these enormous cuts in the cost of fuel, and therefore transport, in regional areas, rural and regional Australians do understand their value. They do understand the benefits that will flow.The capital gains tax changes announced last week are also profoundly important. They will be of great benefit to all small business and to farmers. Not only will the rate be halved - slashed - but 75 per cent of any capital gain on active assets will be exempt from CGT. This will very significantly alleviate the tax liabilities that often arise when it is time for the transfer of a family farm from one generation to the next. This tax burden often prevents the transfer from occurring before the death of the owner, and it is good farm policy to turn that over.In addition to that is the reform that has been widely welcomed in rural Australia and right across the community, particularly by the small business sector. If a farmer or a small businessman disposes of an active asset that has been held for 15 years or more by, say, selling or gifting it to a child and he or she is 55 years of age or more and intends to retire, the whole gain is exempt. Moving around rural areas over the weekend I found that has been incredibly widely welcomed. It is a very good reform. It means that the dead hand of the ALP's capital gains tax regime has been lifted - only presuming that they cooperate with good policy and pass it.This builds on the government's very good record of assisting with the intergenerational transfer of family farms. For example, the retirement assistance package for ageing  farmers, which gives farmers in difficulty immediate access to the age pension or similar benefits where they gift their farm to the children, is very useful. To their credit, the states have helped as well with exemptions from stamp duties.Suggestions that somehow or other this important set of reforms might be resisted or tampered with ought to be exposed for the very opportunistic approach that they represent. The acid test on the Leader of the Opposition is to pass these measures expeditiously -  - I said the acid test is to pass them expeditiously and to ensure that the benefits flow and flow quickly.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. There is no doubt that we have to get on with these reforms and have them implemented as a package. There is also no doubt, as the member will well know, that there has been a very positive  reaction from the small business community and they naturally enough want to see these reforms supported widely through the parliament. That is hardly a surprise to the member. She is very active on small business issues within her electorate. She regularly raises small business issues. Like members on this side, she has had a bit of experience of small business and knows that if our small business community does well then that is good for the country as a whole. It creates more jobs and provides more opportunities.The package provides a halving of the rate of capital gains tax. What a fantastic boon that is to the small business community. We are going to halve Labor's capital gains tax figure. There will be total exemption from capital gains tax for small business for those who have held active assets for 15 years or more and are retiring - a complete exemption. That is putting incentive back into being a person in small business. There will be substantial cuts in the company tax rates, to 30 per cent. -  - On this side we all take credit for a great package. I do not mind saying that everything that comes into the cabinet gets the small business ruler put over it. When the Prime Minister asked one of his cabinet ministers to be the minister for small business, it was the first time we had had a small business minister in the cabinet. That means that you get good decisions for small business. That means jobs and investment, something that you on the other side were never able to produce. So we have encouragement for venture capital industries. That is great wherever they are throughout Australia. I was at a function in the ACT last week. They are working very hard on the IT industries. That is great for this region - again more jobs. We have a similar exemption for Australian widely held superannuation funds through a pool development fund - another positive.Another measure which is great for small business is that we are reducing red tape for small business. Red tape is the bane of the life of anybody running a small business. Its reduction is great because small business people want to spend time running their  businesses instead of filling out red tape, and we are delivering on that commitment.I will give you another example, 75 per cent of small businesses will not have to worry about the annual stocktake. Again, that saves them time and saves them having to get the kids to come in on a weekend to help out with the stocktake. That is a real benefit to the small business community. Of course, we have kept a very good scheme for depreciation for small business.Wherever you might have been in the country in the last few days, Mr Speaker, you will have noticed that small business want this package. What they want from the Labor Party is for the Leader of the Opposition to finally have a policy. We want him to stand up for something, and the something we want him to stand up for is the policy we have for small business. He is probably harking back to Labor's last campaign on capital gains tax in the last election, when they wanted to increase capital gains tax. It might be a hard decision for him to agree with us to cut capital gains tax by half, but it would be in the interests of small business - and that means jobs.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. -  - I was asked a similar series of questions - one in particular on 16 February - about the contents of the discussion of this meeting. At that time, I said of the college that:. . . in very general terms they put a point to us, but we did not tell them what we intended to do.That is absolutely correct. I have a letter - which I will table - from the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists dated 15 May, three days after the budget, in which Acting President Dr John Earwaker states:The agreement has been endorsed by the College Council with several reservations, which were communicated to you by the President, Professor Sage . . . at your meeting last week.Therefore, my statement in parliament is backed up by the letter three days after the budget. It was discussed in the most general of terms, and the college did put concerns to me. However, I have seen the allegations in yesterday's Sunday Age , and they are incorrect. I now table a statutory declaration, signed today, from a member of my department, Penelope Rogers, who attended that meeting. Amongst other things, it states:Some participants at the meeting tried to press the Minister for details, including issues around the supply side of the measure. The Minister made it clear he understood their interest in these issues but, as his Department had repeatedly advised the RACR, that was a decision for the Government and he was unable to disclose details of the measure.Further, I received an email - that I will also table - from my staff member at the meeting, who no longer works for me. It states:He - meaning the minister - agreed that details of any proposed restrictive measures would not be revealed until after the budget was announced, and at no stage during this meeting were the details of the restriction of MRI machines discussed. At no stage during the meeting was the mechanism for how the budget would be restricted divulged by the Minister.She finishes her email by saying:I will be seeing my solicitor tomorrow morning to put this into a stat dec.I will make that available to the House when it becomes available to me.So Dr Carr's comments are therefore incorrect. I also say that his comments that he had  a conflict of interest are not correct. He did not make such a divulsion at the meeting. That is in the email from my staff member, and it is also my recollection. I would be deeply concerned if I knew that someone at the meeting had a potential conflict of interest. I was advised by the Health Insurance Commission just several minutes before coming into question time that, under this circumstance, they could advise me that Dr Peter Carr himself is under investigation by the Health Insurance Commission and his comments should be seen in that light.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon, who, amongst many other things, serves as chairman of the backbench government committee on the wool industry and certainly takes a very keen interest in wool industry issues. He, like all members of the government, is aware and concerned about the future of the wool industry, which has been going through very difficult times for some years now. The government commissioned the Wool Industry Future Directions Task Force, led by Ian McLachlan, which has made a number of recommendations about the future of the industry. Mr McLachlan acknowledged that about 80 per cent of what he had said in his report was made up of direct messages to growers so that they could make decisions about the future of their own wool growing businesses and the other 20 per cent involved industry restructures and would require some response from the government.Wool grower organisations have got together in a forum to talk about these issues,  and they have made recommendations to me as to how the McLachlan report should be progressed. I am pleased to inform the House that last week I released an eight-point plan to deliver on the McLachlan report recommendations, and the industry has responded warmly to the proposals that we act quickly to determine growers' desires in this matter and to put in place an appropriate structure to service their needs in the future. There will be a grower ballot conducted on or about 25 February next year in which growers will have an opportunity to assess their requirements for the future and to make a decision about how much they are prepared to pay towards research and development, promotion and the other activities that are necessary to support the industry.A task force is being established to help prepare the questions for the ballot and to develop a business plan for the sort of services company that the industry may need to support its requirements in the future. I have also announced that I propose, subject to the outcome of the ballot, to lower the wool tax levy from four per cent to three per cent by 1 July 2000 and, if the ballot decides accordingly, there will be further reductions at the time that the new services corporation is established. So we are moving quickly to implement the McLachlan committee recommendations. Indeed, the timetable I propose is shorter than the task force recommended. We will also be giving the growers an early chance to indicate their desires in this matter so that there is no unnecessary expenditure on establishing structures which may not meet the growers' needs. This progress will be appreciated by growers. They will have an early opportunity now to decide on the future of their industry so that they are able to make decisions about their own businesses and the future of what has been arguably Australia's greatest industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. The decision by the Industrial Relations Commission to effectively abolish tallies is a landmark decision for the entire beef industry and the meat processing industry. The practical consequence of that means more exports and more jobs, and that is fantastic news for rural and regional Australia, and it just demonstrates that, when it comes to significant reform, this government is on the job and we are doing things which are practical and worth while for rural and regional Australia. The decision does away with 43 pages of prescriptive and inefficient work practices in the federal meat industry processing award -  -  - The interjections just show you that the ALP, as usual, was backing the AMIEU and the ACTU, even though it was costing jobs and denying rural and regional Australia investment. It just again demonstrates that when it comes to looking after rural and regional Australia there is only one side of politics -  -  - You don't need a former secretary of the teachers union to be telling rural and regional Australia how to run a -  - The ACTU and the ALP are very disappointed at a decision which is great news for rural and regional Australia. The reason they are disappointed is that this is another example where the government's policy of award simplification is producing real benefits. It was only commonsense and good sense that the member for Dickson agreed with the government over its Workplace Relations Act to set up a framework of reform that would actually deliver real benefits to people in rural and regional Australia. The cattle council and the NFF said last week:Sanity prevails at last. Industrial Relations Commission sinks tallies in the meat processing industry.They went on to say:The Australian beef industry has been working towards this result for over a decade. We were not prepared to rest until this archaic, inefficient and impractical method for determining pay levels was removed from the award. We are delighted with the outcome.They went on to say:Removal of the tally system will allow much greater flexibility within the workplace, contribute to greater competitiveness for the meat processing sector and ultimately impact on the viability of processing establishments. A stronger, more financially secure processing sector delivers greater profitability for the entire beef-cattle industry.Instead of whingeing about the result, the Labor Party ought to acknowledge that this is a great win for rural and regional Australia and they ought to desist their ridiculous  campaign against a process, namely award simplification, that is providing real benefits. This is just a great win. The government nominated meat processing as one of our key areas for reform. We have achieved a major breakthrough in a landmark decision and it is great news for jobs in the country.</DOC>

 - I did see those comments by John Ralph yesterday. I can indicate that clearly an important area of tax minimisation is where individual employees incorporate or where they are paid as contractors. It is a fundamental principle, I would have thought, of all tax systems - certainly of our tax system - that income that is derived from the personal exertion of an individual cannot be diverted to an interposed entity in order to reduce that individual's tax liability. It would be inequitable if some taxpayers could reduce their tax liability by using those interposed entities to divert income while ordinary wage and salary earners pay the correct amount of tax.Australia currently relies upon the general antiavoidance measures of part IV(A) of the tax act to combat those practices. What the Ralph review recommended was that all personal services income derived in an employee-like manner be taxed under the PAYE system. That in fact was recommendation No.  7.2. This would stop individuals from incorporating or being treated as contractors to reduce their tax liability. I understand that the Treasurer, at his press conference on releasing the Ralph report on business tax reform, indicated at that time that the government has given in-principle support to a measure which has been delayed for implementation until 1 July 2001. In other words, the government will not stand by and allow this to occur. Because of the need for further consultation with business and other interest groups, the Treasurer announced that the date of implementation for ensuring that this did not occur would be 1 July 2001.The honourable member indicated that there was a cost. The advice I have received is that the cumulative revenue cost of not undertaking recommendation 7.2 is estimated within the Ralph review to be about $2.5 billion over five years. That is up to 2004-05. So, yes, the government believes that part IV(A) at the present time covers this situation, but we will not stand by idly and allow tax avoidance or tax minimisation to occur in that way. That will be acted upon appropriately at a later point in time, and the legislation will show that.</DOC>

 - I am happy to respond to the honourable member for Makin by advising that the Treasurer and the Minister for Foreign Affairs today announced that Australia will make a new contribution to an initiative for the world's poorest nations so that they might escape the burden of debt. The Treasurer, as the Prime Minister announced earlier, is in Washington attending the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank and he has announced today that Australia will provide an extra $35 million to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. This in  fact will more than double our existing pledge. This initiative is a multilateral plan to provide debt relief to the world's poorest countries, provided they are pursuing IMF and World Bank supported reform programs. The additional funding is aimed at providing these countries with faster, deeper and wider debt relief to ensure that it more directly contributes to poverty reduction.The world's developed economies have a historic opportunity to help some of the poorest nations in the world to escape from crippling debt burdens. Writing off unpayable debt will free resources for poverty alleviation and will help these countries on the path to economic growth, which ultimately is in Australia's best interest. Of course, debt relief should not be at the expense of broader efforts to reduce poverty in developing countries. After all, lasting reduction in debt and poverty requires nations to adopt policies and to generate sustained economic growth.It is worth remembering that Australia is in a position to fulfil its regional and international obligations only because this government is managing the economy well and running responsible monetary and fiscal policies. If we were still running budget deficits, we would not be able to help our neighbours through means such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. That would be bad for our less developed neighbours and, ultimately, that would be bad for Australia.</DOC>

 - I would have thought that the honourable member would have taken note of the Treasurer's statement in regard to major projects. I can recollect that the major projects scheme, in terms of support from this government, started from a report which the Prime Minister released at the beginning of the second week of December in 1997 under  the then minister for business's initiative, Investing For Growth. A number of announcements have been made in the interim period where there has been a need to address what is good in a very major way for investment in Australia and for the jobs that flow from that investment. The government has been prepared to stand by those initiatives. The Treasurer, of course, recognised that, if there were a reduction in accelerated depreciation, that may have some impact on similar sorts of projects in the future.The program that was announced by the Prime Minister in 1997 has had funding; it is in the budget. As I said, a number of announcements have already been made, and that has been dealt with, from time to time, with initiatives that have come in. The initiatives to date have come through the Mansfield committee. Mr Mansfield, as I am sure all honourable members know, has played a very major role - and, dare I say it, a very significant role - in cutting through what might be described as red tape, in cutting to the chase and recognising what business wants and in putting forward what is good for Australia. The recommendations and suggestions that have been made have been taken up by the government.It is not the intention of this government to allow such projects to lapse in the future, and that is what the Treasurer has announced. As I have indicated, there is funding currently in the budget for similar projects. As and when such projects are forthcoming, rest assured that this government, in a sound and responsible manner - as it has operated its accounts to date - will deal with such projects as it has dealt with them in the past.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. She has a lot of interest in this subject, not the least because she has two very important Defence bases in  her electorate - the home of the soldier at Kapooka and Forest Hill at Wagga Wagga. I am sure that many members of the House are concerned as to how mail will be delivered to our troops in East Timor and how mail will get back from East Timor to Australia. Historically, it has always been an important link with loved ones back home, but mail always is that link to family and friends back home, and that has been the case with every deployment that Australia has been involved in.I am delighted to be able to announce that Defence will be paying the cost of personal mail sent both to and from our service men and women in East Timor. This will include letters as well as packages with the normal rules applying in terms of those sizes. Defence are in discussion with Australia Post in relation to the establishment of a freepost system, and that will be in place as soon as Australia Post can logistically put that in place. Of course, they will be sending the account for that postage to the Department of Defence.For the benefit of the members in the House, the mail should be addressed to the individual soldier, and their serial number or their rank is also important, if you have it. It should be sent to:Op StabiliseArmed Forces Post Office 5International Mail CentreSydney NSW 2890I give you those details because I think it is important that all members share the information as quickly as possible because it is important that we support both the members in East Timor and the family members - and I have met a few over the last few days - who are now well aware that their spouses are in East Timor. We should give them every support we can to ensure that they can maintain their links with family, friends and loved ones.</DOC>

 - The Treasurer, as I have indicated on a number of occasions this afternoon, has released an enormous amount of information relating to business taxation reform. One of the proposals of the government in that reform is to get commonality and consistency with business entities to ensure that there is uniformity of taxation.The honourable member's question related to farms the title of which, I presume, is held by a trust. The honourable member may have been getting at the business of farming and whether that was operated by a trust. That was certainly my interpretation of that particular question. I can only say again that it is the government's intention to ensure that there is uniformity of business entity taxation, and that very much is what the reforms that were adopted by the government in the announcements made by the Treasurer last week actually get to.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Macquarie for his question, and I want to acknowledge the great interest that he has in the government's programs to help young people. Yesterday, the Prime Minister announced the membership of the government's Youth Pathways Action Plan Task Force. This task force underscores the very substantial commitment by this government to making sure that every young Australian has a pathway from school to employment and from adolescence to adulthood.The Youth Pathways Action Plan Task Force will be chaired by Captain David Eldridge of the Salvation Army, who, as we know, did such a magnificent job as chair of  the Prime Minister's youth homelessness task force. The members of the task force have been selected from a broad cross-section of the community representing business, government, academia, non-government and community based groups.The government has done a great deal already to build pathways for young people - from establishing for the first time an effective literacy strategy for young people in the early years of schooling, through rebuilding the apprenticeship system through New Apprenticeships, through the promotion of school industry programs and vocational education in the senior years of schooling and through programs such as the Jobs Pathway Program, Work for the Dole and mutual obligation programs. No-one can doubt the determination of this government to give every young person in this country the opportunities that they deserve. It is a matter of satisfaction to us that we are now seeing that teenage full-time unemployment is at historically low levels. This reflects the effectiveness of the government's programs in many areas, including the very strong stand we have taken in relation to junior wage rates.But more needs to be done. As we know there is a core of perhaps some 30,000 young people who are coming out of school with inadequate literacy and numeracy standards who are unable to get employment and who are experiencing very long-term unemployment at the present time. These young people need to have a proper pathway through school, and very often their problems need to be dealt with at a very early stage. One of the major objectives of the Youth Pathways Action Plan Task Force will be to advise the government on initiatives that involve early intervention to make sure that this group ceases to come out of school only to fall into the problem of longer term unemployment.The task force will strengthen existing pathways for young people. It will advise the government on improving early assistance to young people at risk. It will support families and communities to help young people and expand economic and social opportunities for our youth. We look forward to this task force to map out new approaches to tackling disad  vantage and social problems. It is a measure of the commitment of this government that the Prime Minister has announced this very significant initiative at this time, given what this government has in place, because we are determined that every young person in this country will benefit from the government's concern for young people.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is no. The ASX has conducted a study on capital gains tax options for Australia. That study was undertaken by one Alan Reynolds, a senior fellow and director of economic research at the Hudson Institute. The study was funded by the ASX. It was an ASX study. It was not the Treasury's nor was it the Ralph committee's study, and the ASX study did not delay any finalisation of the Ralph committee report, as was suggested, I noted on Saturday, by the Sydney Morning Herald . The Ralph committee considered advice from a number of sources, and in considering that advice it ultimately formulated the estimates that were contained in the Ralph report. So I repeat again: it was an ASX report, it was funded by the ASX and in fact it was only one of a number of studies which were taken into account by the Ralph committee in getting to its conclusions.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his constant contact with me. He has three sawmills in the town of Gympie alone and his concern is with the welfare of the people employed there and the small business owners. As of about ten days ago, the Queensland government made an announcement relative to its position on the regional forest agreement process. As I stand here today, we have not received from the Queensland government, through its officials or through any other advice, any detail relevant to that particular proposal other than what has been seen in press releases and things of that nature. However, I have now available to me the agreement that was signed between certain interested parties and Mr Beattie, and that does give me some information. Also, last Friday, after about a week of federal officials contacting their counterparts in the Queensland department and not even having their phone calls returned, the officials had a meeting which in fact delivered very little information whatsoever. The Queensland officials were not too keen on having a return visit from our officials tomorrow.However, a few points of information are worthy of note. Under the agreement signed between three Green activist parties, the timber board and the Premier, we have been able to get the following information. First,  all native forest harvesting is to cease after 25 years. This proposal is not consistent with the National Forest Policy Statement, which, as one of its authors, I am sure the Leader of the Opposition would confirm.Second, native forest reserve areas are to be increased immediately by 425,000 hectares and approximately 100,000 hectares are to be retained as production forest for the next 25 years to meet the Queensland government's promise of no reduction in sawlogs to the remaining sawmills after the Queensland government buy-out of Boral over the next two years. My advice from more perceptive sawmillers is that the 100,000 hectares retained for harvesting contain limited species, are of low quality and include significant areas that have been recently harvested. Their location will require excessive additional road transport for many existing mills, including those in Gympie. The Queensland government is to plant 10 million hardwood tree seedlings in plantations over five years to substitute for the resource loss through the total closing of the native forest area. -  - The hear, hears came a little quickly. Ten million trees sounds a lot, but it represents plantings of just 2,000 hectares per year and approximately 30 jobs for two months each year. So, 500,000 hectares of native forest are to be closed to logging and replaced by 10,000 hectares of plantations. The private sector in Western Australia alone is planting at ten times this rate annually. For whatever reason, the private sector has shown little interest in hardwood plantations in south-east Queensland. It could be, on advice I have received from foresters up there, that the trees when planted do not grow very well. Furthermore, normal plantation practice to produce sawlogs requires thinning over the life of the plantation, which will reduce the original 10 million trees to 2.5 million at maturity. That is not making any allowance for fire or pestilence that might attack those trees during their growing period. Whilst the period to harvest must be 20 to 25 years -  - Oh, is it? Queensland has yet to prove that it can grow local species that produce millable and marketable saw and hardwood timber in under 50 years. I will let these facts speak for themselves. - The other area of concern is that when we look at the figures, we see that in fact 328,000 hectares of forest were estimated to produce 84,000 cubic metres of sawlog. But the Queensland government now says that it can get that quantity for two years, 60,000 cubic metres for nine years and then a lesser quantity for 15 years - out of a mere 100,000 hectares of native forest. Of course, the government has international commitments in this regard and it is not surprising that they want to harvest every tree over 40 centimetres in diameter in this process. There is a grave threat to the sustainable yield situation. Finally, this is fairly evident when one reads the agreement where, under clause 2.15, notwithstanding that the Queensland government says it will guarantee quotas and make them tradeable, it is also taking up a first option over any sawmill or quota that any company chooses or attempts to sell. That means there can be only one buyer in Queensland and, of course, when the government buys those quotas, all the workers will be sacked. That is where this real agreement made in heaven is coming from.</DOC>

 - In the House yesterday I had some remarks to make about the characterisation of my views on the role of this country in the region, and I do not intend to recapitulate those remarks except to make the obvious point that what has occurred over the past few weeks does represent a very significant change in the climate in which foreign policy is conducted in this country. Those who are interested in a serious debate on that will not indulge the sort of rhetoric that the  Leader of the Opposition has indulged but rather might take a little notice of what some of the foreign ministers in the region have said. Talking on CNN today, the Foreign Minister of Thailand had, amongst other things, this to say in relation to the attitude of Australia:We have no differences, but we think it is the collective responsibility for all of us in the region to make sure that any trouble spots that need our collective help . . . certainly we will respond and we have responded very swiftly.It was in that same interview that the Foreign Minister for Thailand confirmed the commitment of an infantry battalion by Thailand to the multinational force. As the House is aware, the deputy commander of the multinational force is a member of the Royal Thai Army, and I think it is important that the contribution being made by Australia be seen in the context of collective action with our neighbours and friends in the region. It was in no small measure that the friendship between Australia and Thailand, and the common attitude that Australia and Thailand has to developments in the region, led to Thailand making the contribution that it has made, and I welcome that contribution. It is a very important one and, along with the contribution of forces from the Philippines and other countries in the ASEAN region, it is an extremely important element in the multinational force.Over the past few weeks this country has assumed both a diplomatic and, as far as participation in the multinational force is concerned, an undoubted leadership role. It has not been a leadership role tinged with any sense of triumphalism but rather a leadership role which is born of the responsibility we carry in the region to work with our friends and neighbours. The action taken by the government has been not only the right action but also an action that enjoys considerable support in the Australian community. Far more importantly than any of those considerations, it enjoys the respect of the international community. - I am interested to hear that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is  asserting that the action taken by Australia does not have the support of the international community. Even Gareth Evans contradicted that at the Press Club, and that is saying something.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question, and it happens that I can draw the attention of the House to some comments that have been made on this very subject by none other than Dr Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System of the United States. He was addressing the World Bank group and the International Monetary Fund program of seminars in Washington yesterday, under the heading of `Lessons from the global crises.'I do not think anybody in this House would dispute that Alan Greenspan more than anybody else has been responsible for the remarkable economic performance of the United States. When Alan Greenspan talks about matters monetary and matters economic, he speaks with the immense authority of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System of the United States. As always, I had a look at Dr Greenspan's remarks. They are always worth reading. He has a lot to say about the contribution of information technology to economic growth and, on this occasion, he had a lot to say about Australia's performance in the face of the Asian crisis over the last year. Amongst many other interesting things about the global crisis, he had this to say:Australia serves as an interesting test case in the most recent Asian financial turmoil. Despite its close trade and financial ties to Asia, the Australian economy exhibited few signs of contagion from contiguous economies, arguably because Australia already had well-developed capital markets as well as a sturdy banking system.In other words, the chairman was drawing attention to one of the underlying strengths of  the Australian economy. We bring many assets to this region, and one of them is a very strong economy. I am prepared on this occasion, as I have been in the past, to give in particular the Hawke government credit for some of the steps it took in relation to the Australian financial system, but since we came to office the government has taken a large number of steps to further strengthen the Australian banking and financial system.The Wallis inquiry, whose recommendations were overwhelmingly implemented by this government, has really given Australia a world-class banking system. We have given to the Australian banking and financial system a degree of integrity and prudential supervision that is second to none around the world. We have established a single prudential regulatory agency; we established the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to adopt the corporate regulatory functions of the Australian Securities Commission; we have strengthened and made more transparent and accountable the regulation of the payment system under the Reserve Bank; and we are working to introduce the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program, a comprehensive initiative designed to enhance the efficiency of the economy while maintaining investor protection and market integrity.Whilst I have been prepared today, as I have on other occasions, to give the former government some credit in this area, can I say that the Labor Party does itself no credit at the moment in obstructing the passage of the CLERP legislation through the Senate, because this legislation will further strengthen Australia's financial framework. It has now been recognised at the highest economic level in the world what a strong, robust, well-run and well-regulated economy is Australia's. The contribution of a strong, well-supervised banking system to the strength and resilience of the Australian economy has been very important. It is another piece of evidence of the careful and prudent management and leadership of the Australian economy by this government over the last 3½ years.</DOC>

 - I am very surprised that the shadow minister for defence should seek to interpolate into a legitimate political debate matters of an operational kind. -  - No, there is a line. It is perfectly legitimate of the Australian Labor Party to indulge in political rhetoric about this, but there can be no argument that, at an operational level, we are acting under the sponsorship and mandate of the United Nations. The United Nations has invited an Australian to command a multinational force, and the arrangements for command involve a Thai officer being the deputy commander. The advice that I have, as recently as this morning, is to the effect that the Thai contribution will go ahead and that the arrangements that have been worked out between Australia and Thailand are most satisfactory. I have no doubt that there will be a strong working relationship in the future, as there has already been between General Cosgrove and General Songkitti of Thailand. I think it would serve the interests of parliament and of the multinational force if the opposition did not seek to generate differences where they do not exist.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I note that he was himself in fact a meat processing worker for some 32 years, that he ran a meat processing works for some years and that he knows a great deal about this matter. He clearly recognises that our side of parliament has a capacity to deliver for not just the processing sector but for the workers in it. - Thank you very much for that interjection, because the point being made was that we have been attacking workers with our pursuit of the abolition of the tally system, and that is what I wanted to talk about today. -  - Mr Speaker, yesterday in this place the minister -  -  - We will come to the question of who is defrauding who in a moment. Yesterday in this place the minister for workplace relations and small business told the House of a vitally important milestone in industrial relations reform and for jobs growth in rural and regional Australia - the ending of the tally system in Australia's $6 billion red meat industry. That has been welcomed by the NFF; it has been widely welcomed by the Cattle Council of  Australia and by all in the industry. It is a welcome breakthrough all round. It is interesting to note that the Industry Commission said in 1994 that these reforms were vitally needed, certainly for farmers, because our beef industry is competitive on international markets only because Australian producers are paid less than their competitors internationally. That was overwhelmingly because of high processing costs in Australia. That is what they said: low prices here in Australia because our processing costs were higher than America's, higher than New Zealand's and higher than Ireland's. In fact they then expanded the study and found we were still the most inefficient of five nations. They also said that processors were losing out. -  - I heard somebody talk about Aberdeen. The Industry Commission, when Labor was in power, said we needed these reforms to keep the processors going so that places like Aberdeen would still have jobs. -  - Exactly! Four hundred jobs lost because Labor would not introduce the reforms that were needed to save the jobs. -  - The Industry Commission actually also said that these reforms were vitally needed for the workers in the processing sector. Under Labor the Industry Commission,  as it was then constructed, said that workers needed these reforms. Despite the catcalling from those on the other side and despite the fact that they would not deliver, the Industry Commission said `improved efficiency in processing will encourage an expansion of livestock production and meat processing and so will increase the demand for labour'. That is what they said.Indeed, in those days it was authoritatively estimated that processing efficiencies could potentially result in savings of about $1½ billion. They reckoned that about half of that could go to the country's cattle producers, about a quarter to the processors and about a quarter to the workers. I would have thought the workers would have liked that sort of improvement in their bottom line in extra jobs. So reform has benefited livestock producers and brought better returns for farmers, more jobs for regional areas and better paid jobs. The interesting thing about this of course is that the ultimate rub - forgotten now by the ALP - is that in 1991 the ALP supported the abolition of the tally system. They supported it! The Commonwealth made a submission to a full bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in 1991, when Peter Cook was the Minister for Industrial Relations, and it said `it would be preferable to move away from the tally system altogether and introduce alternative payment systems'. How far they have slipped! With all of their rhetoric about how they care about regional Australia, with all their talk about being interested in regional jobs and improving prosperity in the bush, all we see is opposition to everything - opposition to tax reform, opposition to cheaper fuel, opposition to the very industrial relations reforms that will produce better outcomes for the workers in rural and regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I am glad the Leader of the Opposition has asked me an additional question on this subject and I will just take each of the remarks that he raised one by one and deal with them. It is true that Gerard Henderson, who worked for me as far back as 1986 -  -  - Yes, he was on my staff. Of course he was; I am quite aware of that. I think it is fair to say that since leaving my employ and becoming a commentator he has been a fairly consistent critic of mine and a fairly strong supporter of the foreign policy stances pursued by the Keating government. That is his right - it is a democratic society - but I do not think somebody should be able to dine out on the basis of a past association when their posture and their writings ever since have been largely in the opposite direction. So of course Gerard Henderson said that. Gerard always wanted me to read speeches, so it is not surprising that he always gets upset when I do not use a prepared text. Anyway, we will just let that go by now. -  - I saw Mr Garnaut's remarks. I do not know about that, from what I saw of Mr Garnaut's remarks. I have a lot of respect for Ross Garnaut. Amongst the other very intelligent things he has said in the last few months is that Australia is now in the middle of the third great era of economic growth since Federation, and I think Ross is absolutely spot on about that.It is a serious question, and I am perfectly happy to take as much time as the House allows to give a detailed answer. From what was quoted to me by the Leader of the Oppo  sition, I have no particular argument with what Ross Garnaut had to say. So far as the remarks of Mr Kevin are concerned, I do not agree with his assessment, and if the material quoted by the Leader of the Opposition is in any way drawn on the article by Mr Kevin in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald, I certainly reject his assessment. His assessment proceeds on the basis that, somehow or other, miraculously, what should have happened was that Australia should have huffed and puffed, and we should have brought about a miracle transformation in East Timor. We should have been able to persuade, without hindrance from the Indonesians, the assembly of an international peacekeeping force. We would have been able to persuade the Indonesians in advance of the ballot to allow that international peacekeeping force to enter East Timor. There would have been no bloodshed and the ballot would have still gone ahead.Mr Kevin, as I understand it, was actually implying - or perhaps even directly asserting - that we should have argued against the holding of a ballot in East Timor after Dr Habibie said he would have a ballot on independence. Much of the criticism of the government is based on the proposition that, when Dr Habibie said, `I will have a ballot on independence,' we should have gone to the Indonesians, both privately and publicly, and pleaded for them not to hold a ballot about East Timorese independence. That would have been an absolute absurdity. It would have been seen as a betrayal of the interests of the Indonesian people, and it is certainly not a course of action that we would have embraced. May I say, without any fear of contradiction, that if we had adopted that course of action the most strident criticism of us would have come from the Australian Labor Party. The Australian Labor Party, led by the member for Kingsford-Smith, would have gone all over Australia saying, `For 25 years we have begged and prayed and hoped that the people of East Timor would be given a vote about their future. The miserable Howard government, when that opportunity is within their grasp, are trying to stop it happening.' That is exactly what the Australian Labor Party would have said.So much of what the Leader of the Opposition said in his question reeks of a person who is clutching for some kind of political opening, recognising that on this particular issue this government has been able to achieve an outcome that has done great credit to Australia internationally, an outcome that is strongly supported in the Australian community, and an outcome that is justified by the two things that should always justify foreign policy approaches: the evident national interest of Australia and the fact that what we are doing is right. What we have done in East Timor is not only in Australia's national interest but is also overwhelmingly right, according to any moral judgment that one would seek to bring to the situation.While I am on my feet, I would like to add to the answer that I gave to the member for Cunningham. Since answering his question, I have had a look at the transcript of the interview conducted on CNN earlier today with the Thai foreign minister. The foreign minister was actually asked a question similar to the question asked of me by the member for Cunningham. The journalist asked, `Is Thailand scaling back its troops in East Timor, and why?' The implication in the honourable gentleman's question was that the scaling back was due, in some way, to Thailand's unhappiness with our foreign policy stance. That was the context of the member for Cunningham's question. Let me read to you very carefully what the Thai foreign minister had to say:We have sent our advance logistic team down there since the 19th of this month and we have made some consultations down there with many other colleagues, and they have come back, and now they are working on the details. We certainly were ready to send about 1,500. Right now with the result of the consultation, they think they will probably need about 1,100. The details are still being worked out in Bangkok, but all this are the results of the consultation with our colleagues down in Darwin and Dili.Who are colleagues in Darwin and Dili? The Australians.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. As he indicated in the question, Victoria - and, for that matter, a number of other states - are considering deregulating the farm gate prices, and they are considering other issues associated with their dairy industries. It is anticipated that, if there is to be deregulation in the states, it will have a considerable impact on dairy farmers and the communities that they support. Incomes are expected to fall as prices drop to close to either manufacturing level or export levels. This is certainly going to have significant social impacts. The dairy industry has come to the federal government and asked us to assist with a restructuring package, should the states wish to support deregulation.I am pleased to advise the House that the federal government has agreed to implement an approximately $1.8 billion structural adjustment package for the dairy industry should the states decide to proceed with deregulation. This would be the biggest structural adjustment package in the history of agriculture in Australia. If the deregulation occurs on 1 July 2000, as the industry is projecting, this would be the biggest single deregulation in the history of Australian agriculture.It is proposed to fund the package through an 11c a litre levy on all retail milk sales. This levy is unlikely to have an adverse effect on milk sales and milk prices, because there are already considerable consumer transfers in the milk market. Indeed, since 1928 there have been consumer transfers, and in fact the deregulation is likely to halve the level of consumer transfer, and this levy would of course be the last consumer transfer to occur in that industry before the normal market forces would prevail. It is intended that payments would be made to farmers over a period of eight years at the rate of 46.23c a litre for market milk and 8.96c a litre for manufacturing milk. Those payments will help farmers to make a decision about whether  they want to stay in dairying, whether they want to adjust to some other form of agriculture, or whether they want to move out of agriculture altogether.I want to emphasise again that the decision about deregulation is a matter for the states and the dairy industry. The federal government, however, stands ready to provide adjustment assistance should the industry move in the direction of deregulation. I would like to commend the honourable member for Corangamite, who is chairman of the government's dairy industry committee, and other honourable members of the government who have participated in the negotiation of this package. The future of the dairy industry is in its own hands, and this decision by the government today demonstrates that we are prepared to provide assistance to adjust to the social changes that will inevitably occur if the industry decides to deregulate. This is a major initiative, and I wish the industry well as it considers its future over the next few months.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. Obviously, the member represents one of the most significant mining electorates, along with a  number of others, in Australia; indeed, in the world. Independent experts have forecast that the mining industry will receive gains of better than six per cent from the government's tax reform package that has been announced. Let us bear in mind that Australia's mining industries are key export earners. In the past 12 months we have exported around $40 billion out of the mining industry, and that generates around 90,000 jobs in Australia. At the end of the day, the government's strategy of modernising the Australian economy and making it much more competitive with the rest of the world is about securing and generating new jobs for Australians. So, 90 per cent of all jobs in the mining industries rely on Australia's exports from mining products.It is interesting to note some of the benefits that will flow for the mining industry, which will strengthen their position and competitiveness in terms of the international marketplace. There will be lower company tax rates, immediate deductibility for removal of overburden and immediate deductibility for prospecting and exploration. From 1 July 2001, spending on export market development becomes immediately deductible and spending on native title will be deductible. From 2001, mine closing costs will be deductible. It is interesting to note, if we go back a few years, that the Industries Assistance Commission estimated that the sales tax on lubricating oils and diesel fuel excise payable in an open cut coalmine added about 40c per tonne to costs.We need to ask ourselves these questions: who put these charges on, and who maintained these charges on the mining industry? Who put the sales tax on the miners? Of course, it was the Labor Party. Who put fuel excise on the mining industry? Of course, it was the Labor Party. But it is certainly not going to be the Labor Party that is removing them; it is going to be the coalition government that is removing them. I go back to where I started: the strategy that our government has embarked upon is about modernising the Australian economy through taxation reform and certainly making it much more competitive on the international scene, and that includes Australia's all-important export mining sector.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. When the government released the new tax system package, it indicated that there would be a number of impacts on various industry sectors. One of those sectors was the air and space transport industry, which includes international air travel and the domestic legs of international travel, which, of course, are GST free. It also includes general aviation, domestic and various international transport components, and transport generally. So the amount stated in the tables in respect of the new tax system documents relates to the broad industry. We know, of course, that international air travel will in fact reduce in price as a result of the goods and services tax on the basis of the impacts, provided, of course, that the airlines themselves take up the fact that the GST component is exempt from international air travel.The two domestic airlines announced yesterday - this is what the honourable member for Dickson is referring to - that there would be a 7½ per cent increase on 1 July next year on domestic air travel. Of course, that is certainly less than 10 per cent. All we ever heard from Labor was `10 per cent on everything.' I also make the point that as a result of the government's new tax package there is a considerable benefit to every Australian in the tax system and a greater affordability of airfares and many other things as well.I note that some tables that flowed from the announcements that were made yesterday in respect of the airlines increasing their domestic fares by 7½ per cent indicated that business airfares would increase by a certain sum, et cetera. Business class is usually occupied by businessmen, and they of course have a right to a refund on the GST component on any fares that they might pay. -  - We acknowledged all along that certain things would have an increase attached to them, including domestic airfares, and we have seen the results of that. I do commend both airlines because they have voluntarily agreed to ensure that they abide by the guidelines that the ACCC has put forward. Of course, if there is any stepping outside of that, it is up to the ACCC to act, as they have been given the authority to do so. I thank the honourable member for her question, and I sincerely hope that that heavy load is not weighing her down too much.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for that very important question and acknowledge his particular interest in family farmers, who make up the backbone of our agricultural sector. About 99½ per cent of our 85,000 broadacre and dairy farms in Australia are family owned. Like all other small business operators, farmers have little time to do paperwork, and they are looking forward to the new tax system which will sweep away much of the administrative costs that have been associated with managing their business. For instance, with respect to depreciation - a tax concession which has to date been unnecessarily complex for farmers and small business - under the new tax reforms announced recently, farmers will be able to manage their depreciation on a pooled basis with a 30 per cent rate of depreciation. That rate is equal to or better than they have been able to claim in the past and it is certainly a far simpler system for them to operate.In addition, assets costing less than $1,000 will be able to be written off immediately. Labor's capital gains tax, which placed such a burden on the rural sector and certainly saw farm assets swept away when people wanted to retire, will be significantly relaxed. The complete removal of capital gains tax on assets held for more than 15 years by individual retiring farmers will be a particular bonus. The President of the National Farmers Federation has pointed out that around 70 per cent of farmers have owned their properties for 15 years.So that is all very good news. I am sure that honourable members who are in regional areas and those opposite who occasionally visit regional areas very much appreciate the message they are getting from people about what a wonderful reception this package has received. I would think that, particularly, the member for Dickson would be interested in these matters because she has not had much time, she tells us, to visit regional areas lately. So I am passing on this information to her to save her the trouble. I also know she has not had much time to visit her electorate. So perhaps the small businessmen there have not had a chance to pass the news along. But I want to assure her, in case she has gone to sleep over the last week or so, that there has been some very good news in the regional sector. Graham Richardson was complaining this morning that the honourable member for Dickson seems to have disappeared and nobody can find her. She has disappeared off the radar screen, according to Graham Richardson.</DOC>

 - I have noted the question with respect to the car industry. I presume it flows from a statement that was in this morning's Age  and other newspapers relating particularly to the Ford Motor Co., which indicated that it was intending to stand down a number of workers. I can indicate that, since day one, the government has been monitoring developments in the car industry ahead of the introduction of the GST. The simple facts are - and I am sure that the honourable member for Kingston will not like this - that to date there is  little evidence that consumers are putting off the purchase of new vehicles in anticipation of lower prices after the commencement of the GST. In fact, the industry data for August show that sales for 1999 continue to lag just behind the 1998 record sales level and they continue to be ahead of the 1997 levels, and that of course was the previous record year. Total sales for the first eight months of 1999 were 2.3 per cent lower than 1998 but 13.4 per cent higher than 1997. Total sales for August 1999 are 3.9 per cent lower than August 1998 but 11.1 per cent above the August 1997 figure.I note that Holden's Director of Sales and Marketing, Mr Ross McKenzie, was quoted in the Australian Financial Review of 7 September last as saying that it was the car maker's best August result in 20 years and, if there was a GST downturn, Holden was not being affected. Clearly the evidence contradicts very much what the honourable member for Kingston was implying in his question. What we will see is the GST enhancing competitiveness of the Australian vehicle industry and the component manufacturers through reduced costs arising from the abolition of a range of inefficient taxes. This will enhance the competitiveness of this industry both here and abroad.I understand that the Ford Motor Co. has given a number of reasons for its stand-down. It has been put to me - but far be it from me to make a judgment - that the current model Falcon has not been a very good seller and that has had a pretty big impact upon just how the Ford Motor Co. is travelling. I can  only point again to what Mr Ross McKenzie of GMH has said in terms of their sales and the facts which come from the industry which indicate that there has been no downturn in sales of motor vehicles during this year in any significant way whatsoever. Therefore, it is not correct to suggest that the GST is having an adverse impact on the car industry.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. We are now seeing the benefits of improved employment growth and lower unemployment in regional Australia, and the member has referred to his own area. Since the coalition came to office, according to those small area labour market survey figures released yesterday by my department, we have seen unemployment in the Parramatta region drop from double figures to just about five per cent from the 1996 period. We are also seeing this elsewhere across rural and regional Australia. The Sydney Morning Herald  had an article this morning with the headline `Jobs revival for battling west suburbs' and the Age  had another, `Jobless crisis ease in bush'.If you look at the numbers, in Auburn, going further into Sydney, Sydney west's unemployment has fallen by four per cent from 13½ to 9.5 per cent. In Gosford, up on the coast, the rate has fallen from 6.5 to 5.3 per cent - well below the national average and a great testament to the work of the local member. Going elsewhere around the country and up to Queensland, Wide Bay-Burnett - this is in the 12 months to the June quarter - recorded an increase in employment of 8.9 per cent. This contributed to a fall in the unemployment rate of 5.4 percentage points to 9.7, a tribute I would think to the minister who is a very strong reformer - and strong sensible reform equals jobs. For the member for Groom, Darling Downs recorded an increase in employment of 6.2 per cent and a fall in the unemployment rate from 5.3 to 3.5 per cent - again, testimony to good representation encouraging our great rural industries and our small businesses in regional Australia, and giving them the confidence to go on and give people jobs.This government is genuinely interested in rural and regional Australia; in fact, we are out in it all the time. None of our members are too tired to get out and do the things that have to be done. -  - We have moved into camera range now; this is one way to lift the profile. The government has the policies, and those policies are providing real benefits to rural and regional Australia. When we look to see what the Labor Party are doing, not only do they oppose each and every measure that we have introduced; when you ask them what is their policy, their usual response is to say that there will be a discussion paper. So, we only have to go back to July - not far back - or you can go back to March. In March we were promised a discussion paper; we got one in July. I will tell you what was in the July document. The Leader of the Opposition said that he would be pursuing new economic reform agendas. He said, `I will be launching a more detailed policy discussion paper in September.' He went on to say, `At that time I will be launching a new blueprint for the employment outlook over the next decade.' It  is about time that we had some policies from the Leader of the Opposition, and we would like to see what is in this outlook paper. I can tell you what it ought to include; it ought to have something about unfair dismissal to provide encouragement to small business. - The minister was asked a question about unemployment in both urban and regional Australia and I believe he was responding to that question. - I was also asked about other relevant policies which would encourage this good growth that we have seen. The point I make to the Leader of the Opposition is that he has made a promise to produce a policy position paper by the end of this month. You have two days to go. -  - That was your statement. I am simply asking you whether or not you are going to stick to that promise. It is reasonable to say if we are going to promote employment in rural and regional Australia, those businesses that are going to provide those jobs want to know what your position is on capital gains tax; they want to know what your policy is; they want to know what you are going to be prepared to do -  - The minister is obliged to address his remarks through the chair, and businesses are not particularly interested in the chair's view of capital gains tax. - Mr Speaker, I am very happy to address my remarks through you, because you would know in your electorate that the policies that we have introduced have provided real job opportunities. It is time that the Labor Party, instead of opposing every sensible reform measure that has given us these good figures, actually produced a policy of their own.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question but, sadly, he continues to confuse ownership with levels of service. Quite frankly, it is misleading to do so. - The member for Perth! - The government has welcomed the Australian Communications Authority decision to formally investigate Telstra's quality of service. We believe that Telstra's performance is fundamentally unsatisfactory in a number of areas. -  - The member for Perth is warned. - Senator Alston, the minister for communications, has said this in the last couple of days following the June quarter release of figures showing Telstra's performance in meeting customer service guarantee standards. Whilst there are a number of areas of improved performance in the June quarter, according to that survey, the ACA's bulletin shows that Telstra's performance remains extremely low in some areas and is getting worse in others. In the major  rural areas of the Northern Territory, Telstra met the customer service guarantee time frame in providing new connections to customers where there was no existing infrastructure only 42 per cent of the time. Performance was similarly poor in Tasmania. Nationally, Telstra's performance fell 11 percentage points in providing new connections to customers in urban areas where there is no existing infrastructure.The government - it must be remembered at all times - has  established and recently enhanced arrangements to deal with the problems concerning the customer service guarantee in legislation giving the ACA power to direct telephone companies to improve their performance. Under the legislation introduced by this government - absent under the Labor government - outcomes of the ACA investigation could include a remedial direction under section 118 of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act. Telstra would have to comply with such a direction or face fines of up to $10 million. Not only is the government providing for rural and regional Australia by way of the social bonus but we are holding Telstra to customer guarantee standards through a legislative guarantee empowering the ACA to act in that regard.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question and for the interest she takes in the Job Network members in her electorate. I am aware of a report by the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia released last week which provides independent confirmation of the sound performance of the government's $1 billion Job Network. This report says that in principle and largely in practice the move to the Job Network has been a good one. There is an overwhelming view among survey respondents that the system has been a success. The  report says that 75 per cent of respondents felt that the Job Network was the same or better than the former CES and that 92 per cent of job seekers say that the Job Network has been adequate to very good at providing assistance.These findings reflect great credit on the 300 private sector, community based and charitable agencies that comprise the Job Network, and they deserve the gratitude of all Australian seekers. The report also reflects credit on the architects of the Job Network: the senior officers of my department plus my ministerial predecessor Senator Vanstone and my distinguished colleague the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs. The report also said:There is a widespread feeling that the media and some politicians have been irresponsible in providing a distorted view of the Job Network to date.The report does not name these irresponsible politicians, but I am sure it has not entirely escaped the attention of the House that between May and November last year the member for Batman issued 30 press releases attacking Job Network, describing it as `a hopeless fiasco', `a farce' and `a mess'. I am pleased to see that since then the member for Batman has been maintaining a dignified silence. -  - The report concludes that there are no inherent flaws in the Job Network. It notes the difficulties faced by indigenous job seekers. These have been very substantially addressed by the package recently announced by my senior colleague the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. It also notes the high cost of the delivery of Job Network services in regional areas, but the government expects this to be addressed by the bids under the new tender round. No system is perfect. The government is always looking at ways to improve the Job Network. But it passes the one test which really counts: it is far better than the alternative - the old bureaucratic monolith, the CES, which it replaced.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. As members will be aware, last night the amended Public Service Bill 1999  passed through the House of Representatives with the support of the opposition. This in principle agreement between both sides of the House should, subject to several outstanding matters, secure the passage of the legislation through the Senate. The Public Service Bill is the biggest overhaul and reform of the Australian Public Service in more than 75 years. Let me make it clear that we would have preferred the bill in its original form. It was brief, it was simple and it had a focus on principles that was appreciated by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. Nevertheless, the amended bill reflects a significant step forward in the organisation of the public administration of this country. It complements the government's reforms in the economic and industrial area. The bill reflects the contempo  rary realities of the Australian Public Service. It is less than one-fifth of the size of the old act. It has been totally rewritten in plain English and it is a simple and easy to follow piece of legislation.On behalf of the government, I welcome the approach that has been taken by the opposition in discussions on this piece of legislation. We realise that it has not been an easy matter for the Labor Party to reach agreement on this bill. In particular, we welcome the fact that the Labor Party has come to accept that the  Public Service Bill 1999  must be complementary to the Workplace Relations Act and must not undermine the considerable advantages that have already been achieved through the application of the Workplace Relations Act in the Public Service, particularly in relation to the application of Australian workplace agreements. The amended bill is a sound basis for the enterprise based approach that is embodied in the Workplace Relations Act. It gives agency heads full power for engaging staff as well as power to determine their remuneration and terms and conditions of employment, subject to the workplace relations framework.Members of the public will also be interested to know that the bill provides protection for whistleblowers raising allegations of code of conduct breaches. It ensures a secure parliament-endorsed legislative framework for the values and code of conduct, and it removes the compulsory age 65 retirement and the concept of office from the Public Service which currently results in significant rigidities and complexities. This legislation allows for a flexible, dynamic, modern Public Service with proper accountability, which is vital for good government and for providing sound and effective services to the people of Australia.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of the information offered by the honourable member. She may be correct. As the Health Insurance Commission said in the Senate estimates, they will release the information when they finish their investigations. My understanding is that they have not finished their investigations; it will take some time longer. I am aware that one case has been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I am told by the Health Insurance Commission that that involves an alleged case of backdating a contract. Of course, if someone had advance knowledge of it, you would not need to backdate the contract, would you?</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his very real interest in the various programs that the government runs as we seek to do everything we can to upgrade services and to create new investment and job opportunities in rural and regional areas. I note that that contrasts in some ways with my opposite number, who, rather to my amazement, indicated yesterday that she had not been quite certain of how to target me and that this had had a fair bit to do with the fact that I hadn't copped any questions. She conceded that, yes, it was true that she hadn't actually spent a lot of time going for me. She said:Well, John Anderson, interestingly enough, has been mucking around too, changing the structures and making it harder for us to know where we want to apply the pressure. He's just finished doing  that. I think it's clearer now where we need to work.In light of that I was absolutely astonished to have had the sort of revelation that `We now know where to target attacks' on me. But it goes straight past me to the Acting Treasurer. I think it is terrific that the member for Parkes is interested in what we are doing. Just the other day we saw the announcement of a significant number of new programs. So far, a total of 182 projects under the rural communities program, worth about $21 million, have been funded. Last week the Macquarie Rural Advisory Service in New South Wales, in the member's electorate, received $107,000 to employ a health liaison officer who will carry out a networking advocacy and liaison role between rural families and health and welfare services. Then there is the Gin Gin and District Community Alliance in Queensland, with funding of over $5,000 to provide a community services directory, which will list a range of valuable services. The post-polio network in Tasmania, I believe in the electorate of the honourable member for Lyons, will have $23,000 to employ a coordinator to administer the activities of the network and enable the network to service a range of objectives.I should mention Rural Plan. It has been a very popular program, with grants of up to $200,000 to help regions map out a strategic direction for their future. We have announced a significant number of those now. Some $1.144 million of them are so far approved. Whether it is the Murray-Mallee in South Australia, the Far North Queensland project or the Northern Rivers, there is no doubt that these programs make a real difference in helping people at a time of enormous change in rural and regional Australia to plan and develop strategies and then implement them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. Yesterday I announced a further set of reporting exclusions from the fringe benefits tax for Australian Defence Force personnel. It is really in recognition of service mobility and the effect that this has on our defence families. As a result, the exclusions that I announced yesterday include reunion travel for members and their dependants, education assistance for school-age children in critical years of schooling. and allowances paid to defence families with special needs. On top of that, the elements of the overseas -  -  - I thought this was an issue for the other side of the House, but obviously they don't want to hear. - By any standard, that was a quite unnecessary outburst from members of the opposition. I ask them to exercise more restraint. - The element of the overseas living allowance that compensates for cost of living differences will also be excluded from reporting. Yesterday's announcement followed the government's announcement last month that housing assistance provided to ADF personnel in Australia will be totally excluded from the fringe benefits tax reporting requirements. What this means is that ADF personnel now have the widest and most comprehensive set of exclusions from the fringe benefits tax reporting legislation in the entire Australian community. That demonstrates the government's recognition that ADF personnel are required to serve in demanding and difficult environments.This review of fringe benefits tax reporting for ADF personnel is comprehensive and completes what I believe is a very appropriate exclusion for members of our ADF right across Australia. I thank the member for Herbert for his question. He has a very important defence installation in his electorate - 3 Brigade, the rapid deployment force, at Townsville. I know that this measure will be welcomed by all members of the ADF and I hope it will be welcomed by the opposition.</DOC>

 - I have seen the interview on television with Mr Cohen, and it is important to remind the House that what he said was, `The answer is no, no formal request for such a commitment.' As I am sure the Leader of the Opposition knows, in a relationship such as that between Australia and the United States a formal request that is made is of those assets that you know you are going to get. The reality is that it was made very clear to us in discussions between me and President Clinton - and there were three such discussions - and also in discussions between Mr Moore and Mr Cohen that, although the United States would provide significant assets, the United States - for domestic political and other reasons - was very reluctant and in fact felt unable to provide combat troops. That was the position that was made clear to me. -  - It is a serious issue and it deserves a careful answer, and if the Leader of the Opposition has any further questions I would be very happy to respond because I want to make it very clear that we regard the American contribution that has been made as very effective. The American support is very effective, it is very welcome, and I am in no way critical of the contribution that the Americans are making. It is very valuable  indeed, and it is being provided to the complete satisfaction of the Australian Defence Force.I should make it clear that when I first discussed this matter with President Clinton on 6 September I indicated to him that the Australian government and the Australian people expected an American involvement. He immediately made it clear to me that that involvement to the extent of involving combat troops would be extremely difficult. He pointed out that the Americans already had 14,000 troops in Kosovo, that the Congress was unsympathetic and that, although he would take on board all of the requests that we had made, that that would be difficult. In a subsequent conversation between me and the President an exchange to a similar effect took place and, in discussions between Mr Cohen and Mr Moore, Mr Moore canvassed the possibility of an American troop contribution, and a similar response was given.So the situation very plainly is that there was no doubt at all in the discussions that took place between the President and me and between the defense secretary and the defence minister that an American troop contribution was canvassed. But it was made equally clear to us by the Americans that, for a combination of reasons, they felt unable to provide combat troops on this occasion but would provide a large number of other assets.There were discussions between the military of the two countries and the assets ultimately provided and ultimately contained on the list that was sent to the Americans were to the complete satisfaction of the Australian Defence Force. That is why, Mr Speaker, you will note the secretary has used the expression `no formal request for such a commitment'. The reality is that in a situation such as this you have a lot of discussions in advance. You formally request what you know you will actually get. You do not formally request something which you know from earlier discussions, for a combination of reasons, is simply not going to be available.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moreton. Like many colleagues on this side of the House, the honourable member has a very deep interest in intelligent, long-term reform of Australia's social welfare system - the sort of reform that protects the weak and the vulnerable and also provides incentives for people to get off welfare and to break the cycle of welfare dependency.My colleague the Minister for Family and Community Services announced at the National Press Club today that the government proposed to establish a reference group to develop a green paper on further welfare reform. I know that this announcement will be very widely welcomed by many in the opposition - the member for Lilley, the member for Werriwa and many others - who have spoken very regularly over recent months of the importance of fundamental reform to Australia's welfare system: a reform, I repeat, that continues to keep in place the safety net, a reform that continues to protect the weak and the vulnerable but a reform that recognises the need to break welfare dependency, that recognises the need to entrench the principle of mutual obligation in our society.I am pleased to announce that the chairmanship of the reference group has been accepted by Mr Patrick McClure of Mission Australia. Mr McClure is a well-known and respected figure in one of the major welfare organisations of this country. Mr McClure, along with officers from Senator Newman's department and others, will provide a marvellous reference group for the development of this white paper. The preliminary findings will be delivered to the government by early in the year 2000, with a final report in June of next year.The reference group has been asked to consider reform proposals against a number of principles. They include maintaining a strong social safety net where those who are in genuine help will always be supported, the  principle of mutual obligation, prevention and early intervention, reducing welfare dependency, encouraging self-reliance and capacity building, establishing better incentives, and maintaining current budget policy. The group will seek submissions from interested groups and the broader community. In this way the broader community will be part of the social coalition examining further reform of the welfare system.This government has already trailblazed many welfare reforms. We have put an end to excessive rorting of the welfare system. We have provided additional benefits to Australian families. We have reduced the withdrawal rate applying to many low income families. We have reversed the previous incentive for people to remain welfare dependent rather than go back to work. That is one of the great advantages of the taxation package that was passed in the teeth of opposition from the Australian Labor Party a few months ago. It is now time, on the eve of the new millennium, to move on to a newer and better debate about the future of welfare in this country, a debate that does not argue for a moment that the poor and the vulnerable need help and assistance but a debate which is designed to reduce the debilitating impact of welfare dependency within the Australian community generally. That has been recently recognised by leaders of the Aboriginal community such as Senator Aden Ridgeway and Mr Noel Pearson, both of whom have spoken eloquently and feelingly of the impact of welfare dependency on indigenous Australians. Their words apply with equal force to other sections of the Australian community. It is a forward looking debate. It is one the community needs to have. I hope all sections of the Australian community join it enthusiastically.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He comes from one of those electorates that is very dependent on having an efficient capacity to export. So the jobs and so forth that they need to continue to promote in places like New England are very dependent upon us having an effective waterfront. Despite the opposition's consistent opposition to everything that we have sought to achieve, from the establishment and achievement of the seven benchmarks that were laid down in April of 1998 through to the general objectives of a highly competitive waterfront, the reality is that the government, the stevedores and their employees have pushed ahead with the reform.Today we see that we have managed the elimination of overmanning and restrictive work practices, with the voluntary reduction of 1,400 people. We have seen sustained and real improvements in waterfront reliability, with the statistics for the March and June quarters 1999 showing that berths were available within four hours for more than 90 per cent of the vessels that arrived here. Those who remember such things as the `Wran navy', they called it, off Sydney Heads and for months off Newcastle, will realise what an incredible turnaround over time that is. We have seen record average rates for container movements as well.Just today, the June quarter 1999 Waterline edition has been released. It provides some very important further evidence of the progress we have made. It shows that the five port crane rate has again reached a new record high. The June quarter is the highest ever recorded in Waterline. It breaks the record set in March. The rate is now over 20 movements per hour, up from 19.9 in the March quarter and 18.9 in the December 1998 quarter. These are always a long way in front of anything that was managed when the ALP was in power. In fact, it is the first time that the rate has exceeded 20 movements per hour, and those champions of the working class regard it - all those jobs that depend upon us having an efficient waterfront - as something to guffaw about.The reality is that, having laid the foundation in a very substantial way, the future rates, particularly from P&amp;O, who are just completing their redundancy program, will show a significant improvement from now on. It is all up from here. The opposition seems to be unable to grasp the simple reality - that to be successful exporters need to enjoy an established reputation for being reliable suppliers. Reliability on the waterfront is something that was never achieved by Labor. Despite having achieved these very desirable ends, we now find the Labor Party is into continuing its opposition. We now find that it seeks to cut in half the additional funding required by MIFCo, from $100 million to $50 million.The fact is that the government's waterfront package embraces a range of elements, not just redundancies. We believe that there is scope for further improvement in a range of areas, from occupational health, which the opposition would surely support, to safety regimes, new technology and improved training. That is one of the reasons that we seek an extension of around $100 million. The opposition wants to cut it in half. I would have thought that it would have recognised the value of pursuing those objectives and the essential correctness of the principle that the waterfront industry ought to pay for it, rather than the taxpayer.The government have always made it plain that we would deal with redundancies first -  in the approach laid down by my colleague, the minister right behind me - and would then move on to implement other worthwhile reforms. That is what we continue to seek to do. The fact is that the opposition's proposal to reduce the appropriation by $50 million will create administrative uncertainty. It may very well create uncertainty for the financiers of the Maritime Industry Finance Company - MIFCo - and it may also mean that the government would have to come back for a further appropriation. That is not in the interests of anyone - least of all the people in this country, the workers across this nation, who depend upon an efficient waterfront for their future prosperity.</DOC>

 - The situation, as the member for Cunningham said, is that the commitment is for up to 4,500 troops. The deployment at the moment is in the order of 2,000 and, depending on circumstances, it could rise. I indicated yesterday, so the House was in no way misinformed, that the original figure of $500 million was on the basis of about a six-month deployment. If the 2,000 goes on longer than six months, obviously the $500 million will be higher, and if the number increases for a longer period, that will be higher again.What is happening at the moment is that I am having work done by the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance and Administration about the precise projections on future costs. I do not have those figures ready yet, and I do not think there is any reason why we should. We are dealing with a situation that was not reasonably contemplated with the degree of precision that would be required to answer your question now when the budget was put together. It would be quite unreasonable for the government to be able to produce that figure out of thin air. We are working on it and, as soon as we are in a position to inform not only the parliament but also the Australian public of the likely cost scenarios, given possible outcomes and levels of troop deployment, we will certainly do it - and also how it relates to other areas of government spending and revenue, to the extent that we can. That would certainly be something that would at least have to await the context of the mid-year financial and economic assessment.It is no secret that this troop deployment will cost this country a lot of money. We are perfectly happy to acknowledge what it will cost when we know the full extent of it. We are perfectly happy to explain the relationship of that to the other obligations of the government. There will not be any reluctance on the part of this government to do that. I note that the opposition has already indicated its support for increased defence spending, and I welcome that. We will try to do this thing in a constructive, open fashion. I am the last person in this country who wants to hide from the Australian people the reality that our involvement in a very important issue in this region is going to cost us money. I am pleased that the accounts of the Commonwealth are strong and in surplus. I would hate to have Timor on my lap with a $10½ billion deficit.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. We have today released details of one of the most partisan and ideological policy proposals coming out of a state Labor administration and its bosses in the state labour council. -  - The proposal - I deduce, from the heckling, that it is clearly supported by the frontbench of the Labor Party - is that people in New South Wales who have elected not to be a member of a union will be required to pay a fee of $250 to $500 a year to the trade union movement in New South Wales. People who have exercised their basic right to decide whether or not they will be a member of a union will be penalised as a means of gathering up a huge slush fund for the Labor Party and the unions in New South Wales. It makes a mockery of the Labor Party - who talk about concern for the battlers and in circumstances where a person is required to pay $500 - that with one stroke of the pen, pushed by a trade union leader, they would take close to the entire benefit of the safety net living wage increases which they have had under the federal coalition government. It is an absolute outrage. This morning, when referring to the government's Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 1999 , the member for Paterson said this about a $500 charge:. . . to the breadwinner of a family $500 can be a month's repayment of the mortgage. It can mean being able to eat that month or not, it can mean the family having a holiday at Christmas or not and it can mean having something in the Christmas stocking or not.Yet his party is proposing a charge which could bring to the coffers of the unions in New South Wales between $400 and $500 million a year. Not only would we see this charge imposed on more than a million  workers in New South Wales but also they had the incredible audacity to put up a proposal which would see the same charge being placed on people running small businesses as independent contractors. You might ask: was this proposal put to the people of New South Wales before the last state election by the Labor government? Of course, the answer is no, it was not. What was their policy? Their policy was to have a review of industrial relations policy after the election. That is exactly the same deceptive tactic that is their policy position today; that is, slug millions of workers with a new charge which will fill the slush funds of the ALP and the unions.I can assure the New South Wales Labor government - as I have already done - that the federal government is totally opposed to this particular measure. We will take all necessary steps to prevent the implementation of such a measure. I say to workers in New South Wales who have exercised their basic democratic right to decide not to be in a union that, if they want some relief from this onerous obligation which is about to be put on them by the New South Wales Labor government, if they are within the federal law they are of course safe from such heavy-handed practices by the Labor Party and the trade unions. If the Leader of the Opposition has the guts to stand up to the trade unions, we would like him to give this parliament an assurance that it will never be part of Labor's federal policy to impose this new tax on people for exercising their basic freedoms.</DOC>

 - It is true that I did say on television this morning something which I have said frequently in the past - it is something which I imagine everyone in this House would agree with - that is, that Australia should contribute a significant amount to East Timor's future. After all, it is hardly reasonable to support a country's aspiration for freedom and then run away from it when it has an appalling living standard. - I do not have a precise figure and I am not going to just grab one out of the air. What we are going to do, bearing in mind that East Timor is in a state of political transition at the present time - it is still part of Indonesian sovereignty and will be until the act of separation from the Indonesian state occurs - is, in consultation with the United Nations, Australia will join in an international effort. There will need to be an assessment made of the needs of East Timor. On the basis of what I have been told, I can say that the infrastructure has virtually gone and the living standard is very low. When it does become independent, it will have one of the lowest living standards of any country in the world. The number of professional people there in the nature of doctors and teachers will be very low indeed. Overall, the territory will need a great deal of support and a large volume of resources. It will take some time before an intelligent figure can be compiled through international collaboration.Flowing from that, it will also take some time before the precise size of a contribution from Australia can be calculated. But I can assure the House that just as soon as we are able to say what that figure is and what the government is willing to contribute, we will make that figure public. If what the honourable member is getting at is that this will have budgetary implications, the answer is yes, it will. I am not going to disguise that for a moment, but I do not know what those implications are. I do not think it is reasonable for the government to be required now to nominate a figure. What is reasonable is that the government should be asked whether we remain committed to helping an independent East Timor and the answer is yes, we are. We  made it clear months ago that we were willing to do that and I have made that clear to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.Just as this country was prepared to play a major role in the multinational force, we are prepared to play a major role in the reconstruction of East Timor. But we are not going to play a solo role in the reconstruction of East Timor; we will expect the rest of the world to make healthy contributions as well. To ask me now to nominate precisely what that figure is, with great respect, is wasting a question.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Robertson for his concern for the retrenchees of BHP, some of whom live in his electorate. When BHP announced two years ago that it was finishing up steel making in Newcastle, it marked the end of an era. But was it a portent of Newcastle's industrial decline, or was it more a sign that the Hunter was joining the information and service economy, as a former Labor member of this place suggested that it might? As the furnaces have finally closed, there is nostalgia, there is sorrow and there is some anger - but there is also some appraisal of where the Hunter goes from here. This is not the first economic blow or the heaviest that Newcastle has suffered: BHP shed 9,000 jobs in the 1980s. But these job losses are acutely felt because they come at a time when much of the country is enjoying very buoyant economic conditions.I am advised that just under 1,500 workers will leave BHP this week, and BHP expects that 900 of these will be looking for other work. BHP expects between 300 and 400 subcontractor employees to be affected. - Many of these work for large businesses with the capacity to redeploy staff. The area consultative committee of my department has advised that there are eight subcontracting firms with 105 staff largely dependent on BHP. The government has just approved a $100,000 package to provide the mentoring that these firms need to readjust. - Ever since the BHP shutdown announcement the government has been working closely with the Newcastle community and with the state government. The Prime Minister has made four trips to Newcastle to meet with the social task force chaired by Mr Rob Chenery and by Mr Kevin Maher of the Australian Workers Union. We established a $10 million fund to support employment in Newcastle and the Hunter, and over $9 million has been committed so far: $1½ million to upgrading Newcastle Airport, half a million dollars for the Lower Hunter water pipeline, $1½ million to a transport and distribution centre in Maitland, $2 million in principle to upgrade Forgacs Shipyard and $2½ million towards the Impulse Airlines reservations centre.In some ways this is a sad ending for BHP, but it is also a new beginning for the Hunter. In April the Prime Minister opened a British Aerospace fighter support facility at Williamtown, which will directly employ 250, with 200 support jobs. The Prime Minister has also announced that Williamtown will host the Air Force's early warning aircraft from 2004, which means an extra 280 RAAF and support jobs. The Huon minehunter project and the refurbishment of two amphibious support ships are a further $1 billion boost to the Hunter economy. The government has also provided a $30 million tax break to assist the Redbank power station, which will employ 1,000 people in the construction phase and 250 workers and contractors once completed.I just want to make two final points. The first is that BHP has handled this closure like a truly model corporate citizen. On this matter the Big Australian has been the Big Hearted Australian. -  - I am advised that total payments to the BHP retrenchees are in the order of half a billion dollars, which is obviously a massive cash injection for the local economy. - To aid job matching services available under the Job Network, BHP has set up for its workers an in-house, on-site employment centre which will operate until December next year. - The final point I would make is that Newcastle is bigger than BHP. It is a town with a tough reputation. - The people of Newcastle are tough enough to rise to this challenge, as they have to so many in the past. Janet Murray, one of the BHP retrenchees who is going on to start up her own business, said this morning:Newcastle is well equipped to meet the challenge this time round.The government has played its part to help.</DOC>

As to the other matters that the honourable gentleman raises, of course the House will get more information from the government in relation to the additional defence costs as and when it becomes available. That is our position. I have made it clear twice, and I will say it again: whenever more information about the costs is available I will be very happy to make it available to the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question, and I acknowledge his great interest in young people in his electorate and in ensuring that they have appropriate educational opportunities. The National Youth Roundtable is currently meeting in Parliament House and I am pleased that a number of members from both sides of the chamber have attended presentations by the roundtable. This generation of young Australians is probably the best educated generation that this country has yet seen. Young Australians want the opportunity to put their views to government. They believe they have something to contribute, and they do have something to contribute. The government, through the National Youth Roundtable, is providing an unprecedented opportunity for the coming generation of young Australians to put their views directly to government. The Youth Roundtable consists of 50 young Australians aged 15 to 24 years who are selected from almost 1,000 applicants. They come from all states and territories, they span the age group 15 to 24 and they include a wide mix of young people, many of whom have overcome barriers to success, such as disabilities, homelessness and unemployment.Since March this year, the members of the Youth Roundtable have been consulting widely in their communities and they have now returned to Parliament House to present the results of their consultations with young people around Australia. The members of the Youth Roundtable have unprecedented access to government - the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, senior ministers, parliamentary secretaries, government advisers and officials from many Commonwealth departments. The result of this, as I am sure any member of the House who was present this morning at the presentations by the roundtable will recognise, is the extraordinary quality of the work that has been done by the members. The roundtable has already made a significant contribution. It drafted a preamble to the Constitution, which the government took into account in putting forward its proposed preamble. -  - The members of the roundtable are very conscious of the fact that young Australians have very often been in the front line in defending the democratic and humanitarian values for which this country stands. We were very pleased to see in the statement issued by the roundtable that it was strongly supportive of Australia's peacekeeping operation in East Timor. They recognise that young people over there might well have been members of the youth roundtable themselves. I take it as a matter of great credit to the members of the roundtable that they have been very conscious of the responsibilities that they carry. As I said, the members of the roundtable are currently presenting the results of their consultations around Australia, and members on both sides of the House are welcome to attend.</DOC>

 - I note that in the question that has been put to me a number of assumptions and assertions have been made which have been attributed to the Treasurer's statement last year. I cannot recollect that statement. I have no reason to believe that it is not correct, but I will check that first to see whether those figures that were stated to me, which do not immediately come to me as being the figures I was aware of, are correct. In response to the honourable member, it is easy for the opposition to come in here and fire figures around to try to support a particular claim that they might want to make at this time or any other time. In the process of so doing they want to ignore at all times the beneficial impact of the new tax system. There are significant beneficial impacts of the new tax system, which clearly the Leader of the Opposition does not want to hear about. - As I indicated on numerous occasions, on isolated instances they will come in and they will raise assertions. The point of order taken by the Leader of the Opposition clearly demonstrated that. I will repeat that the new tax system which this government and this parliament supported will bring significant benefits to all Australians, more affordability for insurance and more  affordability for many other areas in the community. - Again, I repeat that I will look at those figures and see whether there is accuracy or otherwise in them. I repeat that it is all very fine for the Labor opposition to talk about any particular figures and to ignore the significant boost to the economy that the new tax system will provide.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cook for his question. I know that he comes to this House with enormous experience in tourism, being the former CEO of Tourism Council Australia. We have with us in the House today the current CEO of Tourism Council Australia, Phil Young. Both Phil Young and I are today hosting a tourism leaders forum here in Parliament House. This is a reflection of how seriously this government takes tourism as an industry.The tourism forum is looking for ways to grow tourism in a sustainable manner that will generate wealth and jobs not just for those in our tourism centres but also out into regional Australia. With that in mind, it is with great delight that I announce today the release of our Regional Online Tourism program, which is a way of boosting the promotion of tourism to our regions. In accordance with govern  ment policy, it was published on the web in the first instance. The Internet is revolutionising the way that tourism does business. While much of the tourism industry has recognised the potential of this technology, it is important that our regions are not left behind with this technology. This particular initiative joins our $350 million over four years to the ATC, as well as our doubling of the regional tourism program and our contribution of $8 million to the domestic tourism initiative. There are many great things to come with our tourism leaders forum here in Australia and from this Howard government.</DOC>

 - There was adequate information and data provided by the government accompanying A New Tax System at the time  of its release and adequate further information given as to the modelling that was done in terms of the inflationary impact on that new tax system. The government has continually supported the inflationary impact that it has asserted in respect of a new tax system, and that, of course, is a complete system of which the GST is in fact one component. The government stands by the inflationary impact that it has stated will flow from the new tax system. Any attempts on the part of the opposition to suggest -  - I repeat again that the government stands by its statements in respect of the inflationary impact of A New Tax System. As far as I am aware, no further information has been provided to suggest that what we have stated previously is not the situation at this point in time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wentworth for the question. Today is a day on which we remember men and women of our police forces who have given their lives in the line of duty. Police are sometimes not accorded the acknowledgment they deserve - some of us tend to take safety, security and wellbeing for granted - yet police live and deal with danger, violence and tragedy on a daily basis. Sadly, members of the police force often become victims of violence themselves. The recent tragic slaying in Darwin of Sergeant Glen Huitson and the equally tragic death of Constable Ty Bennett in southern Tasmania, as well as the deaths of Senior Constable Simon De Winne in Victoria and Senior Constable Gordon Patrick in Western Australia, are graphic illustrations of this reality. These deaths all occurred in the last 12 months. Today the honour roll for those police officers killed in the exercise of their duty was read as part of a National Police Remembrance Day service held here in Canberra. The service provided the opportunity for reflection on those lives cut short during community service.Police fight a war on a day-by-day basis against those who bring violence to society. The Australian people should consider police who risk their lives in the course of their duty with a similar sense of pride and thanks to that accorded to the men and women who have served this country during times of war. I am sure all members of this House will agree that it is fitting that on this day we take time to reflect on the debt we owe for the sacrifices of members of our police forces.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Obviously, as a member who represents an area that exports a lot of agricultural commodities, he is interested in the discussions that will take place in Singapore on Friday between CER and AFTA, as we export some $10.4 billion worth of exports to the ASEAN countries. Of course Japan is Australia's largest trading partner, at around 20 per cent of our exports, but I might just focus on a particular area of export in answering this question. That is the excellent performance of Australia's pork industry, and we will be making an announcement at the launch and promotion of Australian chilled pork in Singapore on Friday, organised by the Confederation of Australian Pork Exporters. It is interesting to note that Australian exports of pork have more than doubled - from 6,674 tonnes, worth $33 million in 1996-97, to over 16,350 tonnes, worth $70 million last year.Japan has accounted for most of this growth, with exports rising from 747 tonnes to 4,429 tonnes. Exports to Singapore have absolutely boomed. In January exports to Singapore stood at $8,000 a month; in July they amounted to $6.4 million worth. The market for air freight fresh chilled pork from Australia to Singapore now accounts for approximately 6,000 pigs a week.Members will recall last year the difficult circumstances that were being confronted by Australia's pork industry. The government  made a decision to assist the producers in that industry and it is paying dividends in spades. It was interesting that in last week's Queensland Country Life the editorial, `Pork industry kicking goals', read:A remarkable transformation is taking place in Australia's pork industry. Only a year ago the industry was in crisis. Knives were out for the then Agriculture Minister, John Anderson, who was being accused of destroying the domestic industry by allowing imported pork to compete on the domestic market. Today, prices are at a three-year high and climbing, export markets have been established and the industry is entering a growth phase firmly aimed at supplying the massive and nearby Asian market.Australia's export pork industry is one of Australia's great export stories of the last six to 12 months - with the assistance and guidance of our government and the policy that we have pursued in this area - and I am going to reinforce that in Singapore and Japan at the end of this week.</DOC>

 - At the outset, on Monday I tabled, along with a statutory declaration, a statement from my former staff member. That statement has now been provided to me in the form of a statutory declaration and I make it available to honourable members.Let me start with the end of the question first. There has been absolutely no evidence whatsoever to confirm that there was a budget leak. What happened - and I was informed of this only on Monday - was that as early as  February 1998 one of the companies that sells MRIs went around a conference in Sydney saying, `You'd better sign up now. It's coming in the budget and the government is going to have a supply measure.' I do not quite know how they knew this, as we first considered the supply measure in the first week of May, so there was considerable speculation in the industry that there would be a supply measure months ahead of when we did it. That is the first point.The second point is that this was not a secret negotiation. The Australian Health Technology Advisory Committee said in October 1997 that the government should fund MRI. I had said publicly that we would try to find a way to fund MRI. I began formal negotiations with the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists in February 1998, as I recollect, with the express authority of the expenditure review committee to discuss with them the full possibilities of a budget measure. This was necessary because the whole budget measure led to savings of $80 million over a three-year period, and this could not be done without the cooperation of the College of Radiologists. So there was a great deal of speculation.We did not make our decision to have a supply measure until the first week of May - I think I was first told about it on 5 May, so I do not concede there was a budget leak. I do concede that some people in the College of Radiologists knew about it. I do not know how those people behaved, and I do not know whether or not they ordered machines. If they did I think it is quite improper, but I do not want to speculate on that; they will be found out through the investigation process that we have put in place. I concede that the investigation has taken a long time. I have asked the Health Insurance Commission to finish it as fast as possible, but I have not attempted to interfere with the investigation because it does need to be at arms-length from government. I can assure the honourable member that, as soon as it becomes available, I will make the report itself available.Finally, this whole measure has made a new imaging technology dramatically more available than it ever was under the Labor Party.  When I came to government there was not one of these machines available anywhere in rural Australia. Today there are 19 of these machines in rural and non-metropolitan areas and we have an $80 million budget saving to boot.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I am sure members of the House are interested in what is happening in relation to the East Timorese who have been evacuated to Australia. Some 1,500 people were evacuated from East Timor to Darwin and have been resident in a camp under canvas in a situation of some vulnerability as we approach the wet season. For that reason, we have been anxious to move people to sites that will provide more secure accommodation, albeit temporary. A total of 813 people have been moved to Puckapunyal, which is a safe haven in Victoria, and 402 people have been moved to the Leeuwin safe haven site in Western Australia. To achieve this outcome, these sites had to be vacated by Kosovars, who either were intent on returning to Kosovo or had to move to other safe haven centres. I make that point because there are a further group of East Timorese in the reception centre in Darwin who have been identified for placement in a haven centre, but they cannot be moved until Kosovo evacuees are consolidated into a smaller number of havens. Of the 3,900 Kosovars who came to Australia, 2,600, or two-thirds, have now returned home. A further 600 have indicated to us a desire to do so by the end of October. That leaves us with around 700 who, at this stage, have not indicated a desire to return and who may seek to stay on until such time as the UNHCR says they can be moved home in a way which is not voluntary. But, up to the moment, it has been a voluntary repatriation.It is important for the House to know that this morning I visited the East Hills haven site in Sydney because it has been identified as  necessary to accommodate the East Timorese. I told them that the East Hills Kosovars who are leaving Australia on the next charter flight on 6 October can stay until the flight goes, but of all the others I have said that, unless they have the strongest medical reasons for staying at East Hills - independently corroborated - there will be a requirement for them to move to the other safe havens before then. You will appreciate that there has been some indication to me that, unlike the situation at Leeuwin and Puckapunyal, people are intent on not moving on. For that reason, I have indicated that access to the living allowance, phone cards and the haven facilities will be available for former East Hills residents only at the havens that we have identified Those havens are at Bandiana and Portsea in Victoria and Brighton in Tasmania. Similar arrangements will be made for the Hampstead and Singleton residents, where we need also to have the sites available. There are very good and substantial reasons for this. I am disappointed that, although the Australian community has a desire to accommodate the East Timorese appropriately - we have numbers waiting in Darwin for that accommodation now - the capacity to respond, if there are any further requests, is being jeopardised by a lack of cooperation.</DOC>

 - I did ask the department again yesterday after question time, and they informed me that no minutes or notes were taken, which is the reason why I have tabled two statutory declarations. -  - The meeting was an informal meeting, largely to say thanks to the  College of Radiologists. I know that the shadow minister is interjecting that this is unbelievable, but that shows that she does not understand the way health works nor the way that government works. It is not routine or normal to take minutes of every meeting. It does not happen and it did not happen in this case. But you have two statutory declarations there from two staff members who were at the meeting.The second thing she raised was whether I have confirmed how many machines were ordered by members of the executive. No, I have not, because I have not sought to interfere in any way with the investigation of the Health Insurance Commission. It is possible that there were machines ordered by members of the executive of the College of Radiologists. I would think that, had they done so, it would be highly improper. But it is possible that they did it. They were part of a negotiation which was specifically authorised by ERC.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Page for his question. I know, certainly from past experience, that the member for Page has always taken a very keen interest in issues relating to consumers - particularly in his electorate, I might say. I thank the member for Page for drawing to my attention recent reports that Aussie Home Loans have now entered the credit card market. I am informed that they have entered the market with a 6.35 per cent honeymoon credit card rate in a transactional deal with American Express. That initiative is welcomed by the government. We encourage competition and we certainly encourage competition that involves new entrants coming to Australia - in the case of American Express, it has been here for a long time - in  partnership with a local venture such as Aussie Home Loans, to provide to everyday Australians credit cards and credit facilities that are highly competitive.Honeymoon rates are a new product in credit cards. I do urge consumers to think very carefully and have look at the details of credit cards before they sign up. But I know that members such as the member for Parramatta, who is always in my ear about his local headquarters of Aussie Home Loans, are certainly strong advocates for greater competition. This new product adds to the already 200 organisations in Australia that supply 70 different credit cards - 70 cards from 200 organisations.	That sort of competition has come about because of the structural reform we have undertaken as a government. They are the sorts of reforms such as the Wallis reform or, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, some of the reforms that the Labor Party initiated when it was in government. But, in terms of the Labor Party, they were supported by the opposition. I need to ask a question: why is it that the opposition keep opposing every major reform that we try to undertake? They opposed us on retail tax reform, such as ANTS; they opposed us on industrial relations reforms; and, when it comes to corporate law reform, they oppose us there as well.Why does the Labor Party keep opposing us on the structural reform which Alan Greenspan said is making a huge difference to Australia's competitiveness - not only in the Asian region but globally? We have got people around the world praising Australia for its regulatory reform; but let it be on the record that at every stage the Labor Party has opposed us in all of our reforms. We are still waiting for your response on Ralph, but we are not holding our breath.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for that question. No doubt he is alluding to the remarks that were made in New York by the Prime Minister of Malaysia. I say on behalf of the Australian government that the government categorically rejects the criticisms made by Dr Mahathir. The Australian forces have behaved impeccably and they have brought very great pride to the Australian nation. The Australian people are rightly proud of the role that is being played by the Australian forces under United Nations mandate and in cooperation with other participants in the multinational force. There is therefore no justification whatsoever for an allegation of belligerence or any other kind of behaviour outside the mandate given by the United Nations, and I emphatically and categorically reject the claims made by the Prime Minister of Malaysia. I say on behalf of the government and I think I speak on behalf of the House when I say that we have heard nothing but sensible, responsible and humane comments from General Cosgrove and his troops in East Timor. We are particularly proud of the balance and dedication shown by our troops in the field.We would welcome increased participation in the multinational force by ASEAN countries. We would particularly welcome a larger contribution from Malaysia. They have already made a small and very welcome contribution. The Australian CDF has informed me that at a professional level Australian forces and Malaysian forces know each other well and work in a very harmonious fashion. Our men and women on the ground would be more than happy to work closely with their counterparts from Malaysia. Malaysia was offered the deputy commandership of the multinational force. It is worth reminding the House, and it is worth reminding critics of  Australia's role, of this fact. But it declined the position and that position was then filled by an officer of the army of Thailand. Thailand has responded readily, along with the commitment of a battalion.Mr Speaker, may I take this opportunity while I am on my feet to say that the cooperation amongst the forces on the ground has been very effective - indeed, quite outstanding. I particularly take this opportunity to express my gratitude and thanks to the Prime Minister of New Zealand and to the government and the people of New Zealand for the commitment of an infantry battalion of some 800 New Zealanders. We will welcome, as we always do, working alongside our ANZAC comrades. The contribution of the New Zealand government, given the size of that nation, is something for which we are particularly proud. New Zealand is a reliable and close friend of Australia. I especially convey my thanks to Mrs Shipley, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, for the contribution being made.</DOC>

 - I will make some inquiries about the assurances in relation to hot pursuit. I repeat that my recollection when I was asked the first question was that that was  not necessarily in the context of hot pursuit. The situation remains that the mandate relates to East Timor. The doctrine of hot pursuit is a very limited doctrine, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, and although the mandate would by implication allow for hot pursuit, the circumstances under which that would occur would be extremely limited indeed, as the Leader of the Opposition will know. Any suggestion that there is any conflict between me and the Minister for Defence is plainly ludicrous.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to inform the House that INTERFET forces deployed in East Timor now number about 4,100. These consist of 3,377 Australians and 718 from other nations. Eleven countries have forces deployed in Australia or in East Timor: Australia, New Zealand, United States, United Kingdom, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, France, Italy, Malaysia and Brazil. Although not yet deployed in Australia, contingents from Korea, Norway and Ireland will be arriving in the very near future. TNI's withdrawal from East Timor is now largely complete, leaving approximately 1,300 troops in East Timor, the majority of whom are in Dili.Until the MPR endorses the result of the consultation on autonomy, INTERFET and Indonesia will share responsibility for security in East Timor. INTERFET's prime task in the early stages of deployment is to restore peace and security to East Timor. I am pleased to say that operations outside Dili are continuing successfully. The Philippine infantry company performed security tasks on the second airfield and the Gurkha elements have been pushing out into the east end of East Timor. Some 15,000 displaced people have so far returned to Dili and further returns are expected in the next few days.Meanwhile, the build-up of INTERFET forces continues. Some 24 C-130 sorties were conducted yesterday, and 17 are set down for today. Food drop sorties have been suspended following an injury to an East Timorese child, but the ability to deploy troops has enabled humanitarian forces to be able to deliver certain foods around East Timor. INTERFET continues to support humanitarian efforts on a wide scale.Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with both the Secretary for Defense of the United States and the New Zealand Minister for Defence. The discussions were important and certainly underscored the enormous strength of the relationship there is between Australia and the United States. Following the meeting, Senator Cohen announced an increase in the United States' participation in East Timor. This includes four heavy-lift CH-53 helicopters that have the capability of carrying any large vehicle. These will be arriving in the vicinity of East Timor in the next few days. A special army communications team of about 130 people will be set up, with a high capacity network for voice and data communications, which are absolutely vital for ongoing deployment within East Timor. On top of that, additional aircraft will be provided to the United Nations force. I am very grateful for this increased commitment. I point out that such contribution acts as a significant force multiplier. It gives capacity which was not there before.I am also pleased to note that the United States House of Representatives recently passed a resolution by 398 to 38 which commended Australia for its leadership of the INTERFET force, supported the United States' logistical and technical assistance for INTERFET and urged consideration of the suspension of financial assistance if Indonesia hindered UNAMET or INTERFET and the safe return of East Timor to a nation. The government welcomes the resolutions of the American Congress.Also yesterday, just to back up what the Prime Minister has said, I met with the defence minister from New Zealand, Mr Max Bradford. We discussed a number of issues, including the situation in East Timor. Follow  ing that meeting, Minister Bradford announced that New Zealand will increase its commitment from a company to a battalion of some 800 to 1,000 troops. I thank New Zealand for their contribution - and all other nations that have made either military or financial commitments to the multinational force. I also applaud the recent decision of South Korea to commit some 419 troops, 200 of which would be combat.The INTERFET deployment to East Timor is progressing well. I am sure that all members in the House will welcome this and welcome the announcements that have been able to be made today. It certainly secures the ongoing development of the INTERFET force within East Timor. In my view, the operation to date is going exceptionally well and I commend General Cosgrove for his efforts.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Paterson for that question. I can understand that all members of parliament in this House and the other place who have connections with or represent areas of the Hunter Valley  will feel for the people of Newcastle today. I think it is a pity that what might have been the opportunity for a little expression of bipartisan concern was ruined by that ugly political intervention.The truth is that, since the winding down of steel making activities in Newcastle was announced by BHP, the New South Wales government, a Labor government, and the coalition government have worked together very closely to try and provide assistance to the people of Newcastle and the people of the Hunter Valley. The behaviour of this government and the behaviour of the New South Wales government on this issue has been decidedly bipartisan, and I thank the New South Wales government for taking a constructive approach to what has occurred.It is a cause of regret, but even the most partisan individual in this place would recognise that there have been forces at work in the Australian manufacturing industry, including the steel industry, which commenced long before this government was elected to office and which have brought about the circumstances which led to a market commercial decision by BHP to wind down steel manufacture. What we have endeavoured to do is to work with the community. I have visited Newcastle on three or four occasions since being Prime Minister. Through our own actions we have attracted and helped to attract additional investment into the Hunter Valley. The burgeoning aerospace industry is providing new jobs and new opportunities for people in the Hunter Valley.Every time that I have been to Newcastle I have been reminded by the Chamber of Commerce and I have been reminded by many other people of the growth of the service industries in Newcastle. The truth is that there is a future for Newcastle way beyond the end of steel manufacture, and it would be unfair to the people of Newcastle and it would be sending the wrong signal to the people of Newcastle and the Hunter to see what has occurred over the past couple of years in totally negative terms. You will not achieve anything by trying to engage in the sort of partisan point scoring that the member for Paterson was trying to engage in.I want to take this opportunity of thanking Senator John Tierney, a senator for New South Wales, who has worked constantly with people from both sides of parliament -  - On the question of job creation, whilst it is impossible to give a precise figure, as he knows, the advice I have is that, when you take into account all of the initiatives in which the government has directly or indirectly been involved, there have been some hundreds of jobs created and there are more in prospect as a result of new industry and new activity that is coming to the area. Nobody disguises the fact that there has been a loss of jobs because of the closure, any more than anybody can disguise the fact that, as steel making wound down through the eighties, there were jobs lost in other parts of Australia under the Hawke and Keating governments.If we treat the industry restructuring of this country in the way in which the member for Paterson wants us to treat it, we will never have an intelligent debate on the industrial future of Australia. I would remind the member for Paterson that Australia is not the first country to experience the difficulty of industry restructuring. I might ask him, rhetorically, whether he heard the item on AM this morning about the efforts that have been made in Wales as a result of the restructuring of the steel industry to gain new industry. I might point him to the example of many parts of the United States which were rust bucket areas of the American economy.What you have to do, in a compassionate and sympathetic way, is to acknowledge the difficulty and the hurt experienced by the individuals and the families. I take this opportunity of congratulating the BHP company on the transitional arrangements that they have put in place and their assistance on the Pathways program, which they have helped to  finance and of which I have been made very well aware. The Minister for Employment Services mentioned it yesterday.You also work with the community. I established a prime ministerial task force jointly chaired by a former BHP executive and by Kevin Maher, the secretary of the Newcastle branch of the Australian Workers Union. I have gone on a regular basis to Newcastle. That is the way you deal with these problems; you do not try to score a cheap political point at question time.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. We on this side have a real concern about small business and the environment in which small business operates, not just because we are interested in small business per se but also because we are very keen to encourage small business. In the last decade, many of the jobs that have been created in the Australian economy have been created by small business. If we are to continue to do better in respect of employment and further reducing unemployment, then many of the businesses that are going to provide those jobs will be small businesses.Right along the Queensland coast, and certainly in the electorate of Herbert, the small business community is absolutely vital to the strength of those communities and their chances to give people a job. I know the member for Herbert is a strong campaigner for small business. He often speaks on the interests of small business, and I am not surprised to hear from him, as I have heard, that he has already had examples of the negative impact on small business of the changes to workplace relations laws in  Queensland. In the end, that betrays the very objective that the Queensland government set for themselves in respect of unemployment. They said that they wanted a five per cent unemployment target but, sadly, the workplace relations changes they have introduced are not reducing unemployment. They are more likely to disadvantage small business and lose job opportunities than create them.When you look at the details of the laws which have been introduced in Queensland, you can see the negative impact on small business. For example, I know that one concern in Herbert is that union officials have been given the new right to enter every Queensland business premises, whether or not the employees want the union there. In fact, they have provided complete rights of entry to union officials, even though people in a business do not want the union in and even though a business may have no union members in it whatsoever. They even abolished the basic requirement that the union give 24-hours notice. This is just a heavy-handed opportunity for unions to go around and mug small business, and there will be lost jobs as a result.Union officials are given new rights to veto agreements. So you can be running a business with your employees, working well as employer and employee with no union members in the business, and yet under the industrial laws in Queensland a union can come in and veto an agreement where they have no members. That undermines a sense of cooperation and improved productivity, which is one of the reasons that people under us are enjoying higher pay.I will give you another example. In the state law there was an exemption for small business from unfair dismissal laws for a 12-month period. That is a sensible law which used to be in Queensland because it encouraged small business to give people a job. You would have to say that a probation period of 12 months - even if you do not agree with our full proposition - was a pretty fair proposal for small business. That has all gone out the window at the behest of the trade unions in Queensland. That will do nothing for small business. It will cost jobs in Queensland.Lastly, in respect of small business the new law is giving union officials the right to have small business independent contractors declared as employees and subject to union rules and membership. You can be running your own business as a small business and have the Queensland law, put in place by the Labor Party and the unions in Queensland, declare you an employee so they can harass you through the trade union structures.Not only is this terribly important in Queensland - and no doubt it will cost jobs in Queensland - but also it is an example of what you will get if you ever have a federal Labor government back in power. Whether it is in New South Wales where the whole transport system is shut down - being Labor's policy in action - or whether it is New South Wales forcing non-unionists to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to slush funds, it is Labor in action, state or federal. It is a very good warning to small business across the country of what Labor really stands for.</DOC>

 - The reference group that was announced yesterday, which will prepare the green paper, has quite broad terms of reference. I am not going to say in advance what submissions it should receive. I imagine it will get submissions from a wide area of Australia. I am not going to pre-empt what it might recommend. I am aware of the provision in the social security legislation to which the honourable gentleman refers, and it is worth pointing out to him that waiting periods were originally established by the Labor government under the social security legislation. The rationale for waiting periods is that  people with adequate financial resources should be expected to support themselves before turning to the social security system. There were changes made by the present government - I acknowledge that - but it is my view that the principle was established by your government. So, if you are seeking to say that in some way this is an invention of the coalition government, that is wrong.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dawson for her question. Obviously the sugar industry in her electorate makes a significant contribution to our economy and to the growth in our economy. Yesterday's trade figures showed a stronger export performance which produced a trade deficit lower than market expectations. Exports of goods and services in August rose by 1.2 per cent, which is a significant turnaround. Indeed, an article in the Sydney Morning Herald  had the headline `Trade hopes best since Asian crisis'. It said that the export growth was generated primarily in rural exports, which were up seven per cent, or $134 million in seasonally adjusted terms, and that higher tuna exports were largely responsible for a $76 million improvement in other rural goods.Interestingly, given that we are just coming out of the Asian economic downturn, exports to East Asia were up by 5.8 per cent, which is quite a significant turnaround. Some of the particularly interesting statistics are in North-East Asia. Merchandise exports to Japan were up by 14 per cent, to China by 21 per cent and to Korea by one per cent, which are significant turnarounds. In South-East Asia, we saw exports to Thailand increase by 53 per cent with a significant turnaround in that economy. Interestingly, exports to Indonesia increased by four per cent.The trade figures show that export growth hopes are at their best since the start of the Asian economic downturn. Australian export  ers are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities as the world's economy gathers pace, particularly in countries such as Japan, our largest trading partner. Importantly for all Australians, and particularly those 1.7 million Australians whose jobs rely on exports, we are looking to see our export opportunities increase and grow, based on the turnaround in our export performance that we saw in those figures from last month. The government is absolutely focused on not only improving our export performance and looking for new markets overseas but also continuing to modernise the Australian economy and improve the taxation arrangements in this country to see our export industries put into a much more competitive position to deal with the challenges that they face across the international trading scene.</DOC>

 - I do not believe for a moment that I have misled the Australian people. I just happen to have with me a copy of the question that I was asked yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition and the answer I gave. I think I heard the member for Cunningham ask, `Why did I say that as early as 6 September President Clinton made it clear that ground troops would not be available?' Was that your question? - I am just reading the answer I gave, which is on what the question is based. This is what I had to say:I should make it clear that when I first discussed this matter with President Clinton . . . I indicated to him that the Australian government and the Australian people expected an American involvement. He immediately made it clear to me that that involvement to the extent of involving combat troops would be extremely difficult.He did not at that stage give a definitive response on behalf of the United States, and that is the reason why I did not presume to say what the final American response would be. I took the attitude that the final shape of the American response was something for the Americans to announce and not something for me to announce.I take this opportunity of expressing again the situation, and that is that in a series of discussions between me and the President and the Minister for Defence and the United States Secretary for Defense the contribution of American forces, including troops, was discussed. The President made it very clear to me - I had three discussions with him on it - that, although they were very anxious to help and they appreciated very much the importance of the operation, there was a domestic political difficulty in providing American ground troops. He mentioned - I think on 6 September but it may have been on the 10th, but it matters not for the purposes of this - that they had 14,000 in Kosovo. He pointed out to me that he had made strenuous efforts to lobby support in the American Congress, and he even went to the extent of naming two members of the Republican contingent in Congress who were very strongly supportive of an American involvement but were nonetheless opposed to the committal of US combat troops.I took the view all along that in the end what Australia wanted was a strong American contribution. We would have preferred that contribution to have included troops. That was my view, but I was also assured by our Defence people that the assets they ultimately put in the formal request were adequate, and that remains the situation.I do not want this toing and froing between the government and the opposition to in any  way convey the impression to the United States that their contribution is not very welcome, very adequate, very helpful and very supportive. I think it is very important that I make that clear, and I hope that I have the authority of the opposition to make that clear on their behalf. Let us not play with words. The issue of an American ground force contribution was canvassed on a number of occasions, and the tenor of the President's response was, `Look, we have been very stretched in other parts of the world. You've got to understand my domestic political considerations. We will give you all sorts of other support.' As a result of that, the formal request that was ultimately made naturally included the assets that we knew we would get, because that would be the sensible thing to do.Can I say to the member for Cunningham and those sitting opposite that that is the situation. Of course I did not presume to give a running commentary on what the Americans would ultimately decide to do, because it was their business, their authority and it was for them and not for me to announce what they were going to do. But I make it clear that all along they knew we wanted the Americans in, and I can still recall the last words of the conversation that I had with the President when I first spoke to him. I said, `Bill, we want the Yanks in.' We made it very clear that that was our position.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. I am sure all honourable members of the House would be aware that the Telstra 2 share offer has now been open since early last week and in that time many Australians have taken the opportunity to become shareholders in one of Australia's largest and most dynamic companies. Since the offer was launched early this month, the government has announced busi  ness tax reforms which may have an impact on the Telstra 2 share offer. I am pleased to say that the Ralph reforms are in fact good news for those who are considering an investment in Telstra 2.In particular, prospective individual investors should benefit from changes to Australia's capital gains tax regime. Under these changes, individuals will be taxed only on half of the capital gains they make on assets sold after more than one year. This means that individuals who hold their Telstra 2 shares for more than 12 months will in fact pay tax on only 50 per cent of any capital gain they make on those shares.This tax benefit comes on top of specific measures that have been taken in the Telstra 2 share offer which make them accessible and attractive to potential retail investors. Those specific measures include the decision to discount the share price by at least 40c per share for those who hold on to their shares for more than a year and also the decision to allow them to pay for the shares by two instalments. The proposed changes will also benefit complying superannuation funds, and of course many millions of Australians invest in those funds. Under proposed changes to capital gains tax, these funds will pay no more than 10 per cent on nominal capital gains on assets held for more than one year. In other words, the Ralph reforms could make an investment in Telstra 2 even more attractive.To fulfil its legal obligations, the Commonwealth has lodged today a supplementary prospectus with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. The supplementary prospectus, which will take the form of a one-page advertisement in tomorrow's newspapers, confirms that the Ralph reforms would not have an adverse material effect on Telstra. That supplementary prospectus will also provide details about how changes would affect Telstra and individual investors in instalment receipts and shares of Telstra.I would stress again that, if anybody after looking at that supplementary prospectus wants any further information, they should consult their broker or consult an adviser on that particular subject.There is a little more than one week to go for those who wish to invest in Telstra - there is still time, in other words. Those applications, together with payment for the first instalment, should be received by 4 p.m. - in the individual time zones of those who wish to invest - next Thursday, 7 October. Those investors who miss that deadline will in fact have missed out on getting an opportunity to acquire shares in Telstra 2. In less than three weeks, subject to market conditions, these shares will be trading on the Australian Stock Exchange. I encourage all Australians to invest in this company: take a stake in this dynamic Australian company and help make Australia one of the largest share owning nations in the world.</DOC>

 - As to the courtesies involved, I rang the President of the host country yesterday, before I made my decision known, to explain that I was not able to come, that I took the view that - given the situation in East Timor and the major deployment of Australian forces - the more appropriate thing was for me to remain in Australia and not be absent for a period of five days, particularly as the Minister for Foreign Affairs is in New York. Australia will be represented admirably at the South Pacific Forum by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for  Transport and Regional Services. I regret this situation, but I think, on balance, it was the right decision to take, and I am rather surprised that the Leader of the Opposition should take such a point scoring issue.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I have been alerted to this. Food essence is used in the making of cakes and puddings. That is a normal food essence, and most honourable members would probably have that lurking somewhere at home. I have some at home and the use-by date is well past.Unfortunately, in recent times a new product has appeared on the market that I find terribly disturbing. It was involved in the death of a 15-year-old boy in Victoria. That case is before the coroner. I do not wish to discuss it specifically. I picked up this bottle of it at a supermarket in Canberra at lunchtime. This has more alcohol in it than a bottle of whisky, and this was on the supermarket shelves, next to the ice-cream, for less than $6. - This is food essence labelled `Black Sambuca'. It is this sort of essence that was involved in the case of the boy who died following drinking it.While this is regulated by states and territories, there are a few things the Commonwealth government can do. The alcohol used in food essence attracts a concessional rate of taxation. The Australian Taxation Office has written to the companies involved in producing these bottles - which, if they were used for proper use, on my rate of usage at home would take about 80 years to use - and has stated that they will no longer be able to get  the concessional tax treatment that they do for the production of food essences.Secondly, I have contacted ANZFA, the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, and said that clearly the food standard code is deficient because bottles with such a high alcohol content do not have the alcohol content listed and do not have appropriate warnings. Thirdly, I have written to my state and territory colleagues. In some states these bottles are only available in licensed premises, but I purchased a bottle in a Canberra supermarket today for less than $6. It is my very strong view, in light of the tragedy in Victoria, that these products should not be generally available in supermarkets.I hope that these two changes, with the cooperation of my state and territory colleagues on the third, will mean that these products will very quickly disappear from supermarket shelves - as far as I am concerned, the sooner the better. Hopefully we will not have another tragedy like that which happened in Victoria.</DOC>

 - As is characteristic of this place, question time is an opportunity for those who ask questions to put their construction on events, and it is also an opportunity for those who answer questions to put their construction on events. Let me take the  opportunity to say that, for the first time in the history of this country, Australia has the leadership of a major international peacekeeping force. I would have thought that that would be a source of pride not just to the government of the day or to the Prime Minister of the day but, more importantly, to the people of Australia.What this government has been able to achieve in relation to East Timor far exceeds the effort of any government over the last 25 years. Far from deserving the description of a `bungle', I believe that it is a very significant foreign policy achievement of the coalition government. Through our strenuous efforts - and I pay tribute to the work of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence - in cooperation with our friends in the region, and with the cooperation and help of the United Nations, we have been able to put together an international peacekeeping force which does this country great credit. It has brought new hope to the people of East Timor, and it has been widely recognised by people such as Xanana Gusmao. He has been quoted in the press this morning as denouncing the idea which is at the basis of the opposition's criticism of the government: that in some way we should have persuaded the United Nations not to hold the ballot after Dr Habibie had announced that the ballot was going to be held.The reality is that, at every point of this issue, the government has behaved correctly. It has confronted a very difficult situation, and the position taken by the government has won it wide support in the Australian community. Interestingly, that wide support has included support from some in the left wing of the Australian Labor Party, which has been highly critical of the stance taken by former governments.I believe that what we have done over recent weeks has been enormously to the credit of this country. Australians saw a difficult situation where its government had to walk a very narrow path. There was an evident need to try to preserve good relations with Indonesia. It always has been and it always will be an important goal of the foreign policy of this country to recognise  that you never get yourself into a situation where you endeavour to preserve a relationship at any cost. That has been the difference between this government and all preceding governments on this issue. That goes to the heart of the debate. The reality is that the Leader of the Opposition was a member of a government that for 13 years made no serious attempt to bring about a proper settlement in relation to East Timor.The Leader of the Opposition invites me to remark about the foreign policy of the government. The foreign policy of this government is not like the foreign policy of the former government, conducted in circumstances of withholding information from the Australian community and failing to communicate with the Australian community. I personally wish the soon to be departing former foreign minister and his family well, but one of my most vivid recollections of him is of being rung on the car phone one morning in Melbourne in December 1995 and the then minister for foreign affairs telling me that Australia had negotiated a security treaty with Indonesia. The proudest thing about the negotiation of that security treaty was that it had been negotiated in secret.I think the foreign policy of the former government would have won it more support and more respect if it had been closer to the aspirations and the wishes of the Australian community. It is very important in the conduct of the foreign policy of the country that the government always makes certain that there is not a serious disconnect between the goals of that policy and the aspirations of the Australian people. The reason for that is that the Australian people normally get it right. The instincts of the Australian people are transparent, decent and open, and if governments conduct foreign policy understanding the attitudes of the Australian people they will not go far wrong no matter what their political complexion may be. - </DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Forde for her very keen interest in family policy. I would also like to acknowledge a gentleman who lives near her electorate, Mr Jack Griffin, who is 75 years of age and who, along with Brian Burnes, rode down here from my electorate - 1,200 kilometres - and were met by Minister Bishop to celebrate the International Year of Older Persons. -  - The real inspiration for families will actually happen tomorrow when there will be changes to family allowance. An extra 78,000 Australian families with older dependent children will receive a payment for the first time. This is the first instalment of an excellent range of measures that the coalition government is introducing within the tax reform package. It means that eligible families who do not receive youth allowance or Abstudy will now be able to receive $23.70 per fortnight for dependent children between the ages of 16 and 18 and $50 per fortnight for dependent children between the ages of 18 to 24.This is the first instalment of the $2.5 billion in additional assistance to families, as the member for Lilley should note. This is all part of the historic package that was put together by the coalition government. What we want to do of course is build stronger families, stronger communities and a stronger country. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question - some time after the article appeared. Prior to the last election, the government commissioned the Productivity Commission to inquire into the impact of the national competition policy in rural and regional areas. Three commissioners were employed to take that on, including Ray Braithwaite, who would be well remembered in this place. They issued a draft report. A final report, arising after comments are made, will come to the government in due course. As is always the case with reports of that sort, the government, having commissioned the report, will look at it. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Fadden for his concerns for job seekers in his electorate. It is appropriate on this day to  acknowledge the difficulties that so many job seekers still face, but it is also appropriate to acknowledge the great successes of the Job Network. In the 16 months that it has been operating, the Job Network has placed 370,000 eligible job seekers into work. It is currently placing job seekers into work at the rate of 7,000 a week. That compares to about 4,000 a week on a like to like basis under the old CES.Under the Job Network, 72,000 job seekers have commenced job search training. I am advised that three months after participation, 39 per cent of those job seekers have found paid employment, which compares very favourably with the old job club program; 430,000 job seekers have received intensive assistance, and early indications are that this program is performing up to 60 per cent better than case management under Working Nation.As the House might be aware, tenders closed on 30 July for the next Job Network round. This is Australia's largest ever human services tender, and it is worth $3 billion over three years. It is being managed by my department at arms length from ministers. However, I am advised that the vast majority of existing Job Network members have submitted tenders, as well as significant numbers of potential new entrants. Obviously, this is very good news for job seekers. It is not necessarily great news for every tenderer because, in a competitive market, some good institutions can lose out to better ones. -  - I am advised that the tenderers have put an enormous amount of effort and sophistication into preparing their documents and have focused on their performance of actually getting people into jobs. The evidence so far suggests that the Job Network will go from strength to strength in the new year. Obviously, that will be to the great benefit of Australians who need help.</DOC>

 - She can keep saying it many times, and I will keep giving the same answer: that I do not concede there was a budget leak. - As I said yesterday - if you would care to look at my answer - there was speculation by an MRI sales company as early as February that there would be a supply side measure, and that could not have been on the basis of any information at all, because it was the first week of May before it was first raised with me. Negotiations with the College of Radiologists were about a whole package of radiology where there were savings to the budget, which could not have been conducted in any other way were we to have savings. So far, they have been successful.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Macquarie for his question, because I know that he has an active interest in Active Australia, as I do. Today I launched our media campaign for Active Australia, which is occurring on Sunday, 10 October. All Australians will be seeing commercials encouraging them to get active on 10  October and to get out into local communities and find groups of active Australians that they can become part of.It is a feature of our government that we are looking at encouraging Australians to be active throughout life. There are some significant moments in life - such as when you leave school, when you retire or after childbirth - when people tend to give away physical activity. We are saying, `Stay with it!' There is one day of the year when you can get in touch with local community groups, councils, clubs and associations and local gyms, which will be displaying their wares. You can get out and find out about joining up with a club or activity. At this stage we have 62 local councils participating in this event, as well as a number of indigenous communities and thousands of sporting clubs. It is going to start on 10 October this year. Do not always say, `I'll do something with the kids one day'; say that you will do it on Sunday, 10 October. That is our promotion: Let's get active, Australia.</DOC>

 - In a word, the answer to the first part of your question is no; I was not.  That is barely surprising; I do not carry that technical knowledge around me with me. But I will check as to whether what the honourable member has said is correct. As to the rest of the question, judging from what I have heard in the parliament, I have no reason to doubt anything the minister has said. My experience of the minister is that he is a highly intelligent, honest, meticulous person who gets his facts right. If anything is drawn to my attention that would require any intervention on my part, I would do so. But so far it has not.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Curtin for her question. Overseas students at Australian universities are one of the great export success stories of this country. Indeed, members may be interested to know that overseas students are our largest services export earner after tourism. Ten years ago there were some 21,000 overseas students attending universities here in Australia. Now the number exceeds 83,000 - nearly four times as many.The performance of the universities is all the more remarkable in the light of the recent economic downturn in Asia, because students from Asian countries make up some 83 per cent of our overseas students in universities. Figures recently released by me indicate that in 1999 there was an increase of 15.1 per cent over 1998 in the number of overseas students in Australian universities. Australia has expanded its market share.Australian universities are proving to be exceptionally entrepreneurial. Australia is building up an excellent reputation internationally in terms of the quality of its marketing of Australian education overseas. My department's Australian Education International has been highly successful in supporting this international marketing effort. The  success is ultimately due to the fact that what we are offering in Australia is university education of a very high quality that is being recognised internationally.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question and for his interest in this subject, which is a matter of interest to all Australians. I was in New York the week before last and used that opportunity to, amongst other things, discuss with Security Council members the prospects for a new resolution to replace the existing resolution 1264 to ensure that there are appropriate arrangements for East Timor once East Timor is separated from Indonesia.Australian officials and I have been urging and lobbying members of the Security Council to enact a robust and comprehensive resolution that will allow for a seamless transition to a United Nations peacekeeping operation. On 7 October - that is last week - the British government introduced a draft resolution to the Security Council authorising the establishment of the proposed United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor. The draft incorporates major elements of recommendations made by the Secretary- General in his 4 October report, which did describe the situation in East Timor as critical, with no civil administration, with no judiciary or legal system, and with essential services on the brink of collapse. We have argued for, and the draft resolution proposes, a robust chapter 7 mandate for the United Nations transitional authority, and it envisages an operation of two or three years duration.We want to see a robust mandate. This draft resolution proposes a mission structure of three components: firstly, governance and public administration; secondly, United Nations and other humanitarian assistance; and, thirdly, a military component consisting  of between 8,000 and 9,000 personnel. The draft resolution is expected to be considered further at expert level in the course of this week and to be voted on by the Security Council on 23 October. Australia is actively assisting the United Nations to prepare for the United Nations transitional authority in East Timor. We have several Australian experts providing input to planning in New York, and we have technical missions scheduled to travel to East Timor in the near future.</DOC>

 - I wrote to defence ministers who are members of the coalition and suggested to them that there should be a meeting at some stage this year, probably in November. That seemed to me to be an entirely appropriate thing to do. Those countries have made a significant contribution to the success of the commitment in East Timor. In the letter, I thanked them very much for their contribution. As the foreign minister has just outlined in his answer to the previous question, we are in the process of possibly moving to phase 3. Under those circumstances, the arrangements will be different and it would be quite natural to have some serious discussion with ministers.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. Indeed, it was my very great privilege to represent this country  last week on the beautiful island of Palau at the 30th such forum. It was very well chaired by the president of Palau, President Nakamura. Leaders at the forum issued a special statement of support on East Timor after the retreat that we enjoyed on a very attractive island for many hours on the second day. That statement of support was in addition to the normal communique from the meeting. The special statement - and I am sure that this will be of great interest to all people in this House - commended the contribution of South Pacific Forum members to regional security, applauded the central role of forum countries in responding to the crisis in East Timor, welcomed Australian leadership of the INTERFET multinational force and welcomed both Indonesia's agreement to the establishment of INTERFET and the early success of INTERFET in restoring peace and security. It also called for the early establishment of a UN transitional administration and peacekeeping force in East Timor.But it went further. Leaders went on to say that they specifically indicated both their willingness and their desire to provide practical support to the United Nations operations in East Timor. They expressed a very strong desire to make their own contribution. I believe that is very significant, as well as very welcome. Many of those island nations are small communities - as they themselves would acknowledge - with limited resources, but they were adamant that they wanted to be involved and involved on the ground. The Australian government will now hold further talks with the island nations to see how they can best make an appropriate contribution. As they themselves put it, they do not expect to make a contribution in terms of military personnel or equipment, but in other areas such as policing, technical support, perhaps medical assistance and, interestingly - as one of them volunteered - in the area of expertise in rebuilding small communities, they may very well have things they can contribute, and they are keen to do so.I think the forum was therefore very good in terms of its outcomes from Australia's point of view. At the very time that the Leader of the Opposition here in Australia  was carping about the need for the government to garner regional support, the South Pacific Forum was delivering that support in full. I think that is welcome, and there is no doubt that Australia and Australians very much appreciate the communique from the forum. I note, in passing, that from next year the name of forum is to be changed to the Pacific Island Forum. In closing my remarks, I congratulate the President of the Republic of Palau, His Excellency President Nakamura, on his chairmanship and on the success of the forum.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question. I can advise the House that, during the recent annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, the membership of a new international grouping, the G20, was settled. The G20 is a group of countries which is considered systemically important to the world financial system and it was set up in response to a G7 initiative because of  concerns about those countries which had recently been through crises. Australia has been asked to join the G20 group in recognition that it is systemically important to the world financial system and for its contribution to the international financial architecture. The group will be chaired by the Canadian Minister for Finance, with a ministerial meeting to be held for the first time in December this year. That is in addition to the fact that Australia is now a member of the Financial Stability Forum on Banking, which comprises the G7 and only four other countries in the world. It also recognises important financial centres.In addition to that, in the year 2000 Australia has been chosen to chair the OECD. The OECD is the grouping of the world's 29 industrialised countries that have the highest living standards. Australia has been chosen to chair the OECD council, which will be held in June next year, in recognition of its financial strength, particularly in the light of the East Asian financial crisis.Indeed, the Secretary-General of the OECD, Mr Don Johnston, will be visiting Australia next week to prepare for the OECD ministerials. As he recently said before coming out to Australia:Australia's performance is an example for other countries. It demonstrates that it is possible to continue opening markets and benchmarking performance against OECD best practice even in the face of severe external shocks.That is recognition at the OECD level, at the IMF level, in the Financial Stability Forum and at the G20 level of Australia's importance as a financial centre with its success in economic management during the Asian financial crisis and the legitimate and real reform building intentions that we have brought to discussions on the international financial architecture.</DOC>

 - As usual, the member for Hotham misrepresents. It was his big point that there was a so-called shortfall. He did that, as I pointed out at the time, by adding up six years of budget forward estimates, something that has never been done in the history of economic debate before. - No. I am afraid that, if you pull out your budget, you will find the forward estimates are always four years -  -  - and you, as a shadow minister of finance, might have been thought to have pulled out a budget at least once in your term as shadow minister for finance. But perhaps that is expecting a little bit too much. Indeed, we have never published six years of forward estimates before, nor have we ever referred to cumulations of six years. It was the big point of the member for Hotham. -  - His vociferous interjections merely indicate that he has lost again on the point and been thoroughly exposed on the matter. In relation to the Ralph matters generally, he would also be aware, if he had studied them carefully, that the government has deferred measures which we are currently taking soundings on which, in addition to that, would generate additional revenues.But I do want to make this point, and it is important: the Labor Party was desperate to  deal itself in on the Ralph review - absolutely desperate. All through the period before the announcement, the member for Hotham was trailing his coat, saying, `Don't forget me. I was irrelevant on GST. I was irrelevant on personal income tax. I was irrelevant on welfare reform. I have been irrelevant to the economic debate. I was irrelevant and went missing when the budget debates were on. But don't forget me with business tax reform.' - He pleaded to become relevant on business taxation. He announced on the day that he thought that these were `negotiable reforms', I think were the words he used. He sought briefings, got briefings. But the Labor Party has still been incapable of announcing a position on business tax reform - still incapable of announcing a position. - We have announced the most far-reaching, far-sighted reform of business taxation in the history of Australia. What it does is reduce company taxes. It cuts capital gains tax in half. It gives merger relief. It introduces a simplified taxation system. In relation to the remainder of matters, including high level reform, we have said to the business community, `During the month of October give us your views on those matters and we will announce a response in November.' But the silence from Labor is deafening - still not a position on any single measure. It is trying to be relevant, but what happens when you do not have a policy? When you do not have a policy, you oppose, oppose, oppose, because it becomes a substitute for not having a policy and not thinking and not having a leader.</DOC>

 - Last Thursday was the deadline for those who wished to invest in the retail tranche of the Telstra 2 share offer. I am very pleased to advise the honourable member for Makin and members of the House that the response of Australian investors has been very strong. In fact, it has exceeded the government's expectations. More than 1.56 million Australians have applied for more than 1.4 billion shares in the offer. This response means that more than 66 per cent of the shares available have been applied for by Australian retail investors. It also represents a large proportion of those who pre-registered for the offer.This outstanding response supports the government's decision to offer a further 16.6 per cent of the Telstra shares to Australian investors. It demonstrates that Australians are eager to invest in one of this country's largest and most dynamic companies, and it confirms that the government has succeeded in making the Telstra 2 share offer both fair and reasonable.This time next week, subject to market conditions, shares offered as part of this offer will be trading on the Australian Stock Exchange. The final price will be no greater than the average price of existing Telstra shares traded on the Australian Stock Exchange this week less the applicable retail discount. Investors will then know the cost of their second instalment, which is not due for another year - in fact, just after the Sydney Olympics. Details of the allocation and final prices will be announced next weekend and published in daily newspapers next Monday. I am pleased that so many Australians have decided to participate in this offer. I wish them well in their investment, and I acknowledge them for investing in this dynamic Australian company and helping to make Australia one of the world's great share owning democracies.</DOC>

 - We are asked to release what we relied on: we relied on the report from John Ralph which is 800 pages long. There has never been a more transparent process in relation to business tax reform in Australia. You set up an inquiry which has three of Australia's leading businessmen, they have something like 16 public meetings, they get 370 submissions, they get focus groups in,  they run their proposals through business focus groups, they do an 800-page report and the Australian Labor Party asks, `Would you please release the explanation?' It is 800 pages of explanation. - There is no need to get so upset about it. -  - He asks, `Will you release the material you relied on?' We released 800 pages. Two weeks ago the putative shadow Treasurer said, `Give us a briefing.' We gave him a briefing; we brought him in. He was desperate to be dealt in. He said, `Don't forget about us. We want to be relevant to the whole procedure.' We go away for two weeks to see how his thinking has matured during the two weeks, and there has been no advance - not one position. He does not know where he stands on capital gains; he does not know where he stands on company tax; he does not know where he stands on the simplified tax system. -  - All of these things are fully explained and costed in the open report of three of Australia's leading businessmen. The Australian Labor Party can say it is opposed to business tax reform or it can say that it does not believe that John Ralph is a credible inquirer. That is what it can say, but of course it says neither. It comes to no position; it nitpicks around. Why? Because it cannot have a policy. The one thing you will  never hear from the Labor Party is a policy. Labor and policy do not go together.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. It is a very important decision. It means that the system of enterprise negotiations is now fair and square at the centre of the labour market system in Australia. What that means for ordinary workers is that we now have a system that is going to encourage our businesses to promote productivity and that we have the wherewithal to continue to pay higher wages as a result of a more efficient system. This system helps to create not only higher wages - which we have seen in the last three years the system has been in place - but also jobs in the economy at large. So this is a very good decision. It is consistent with the reforms that we introduced in 1996, and it also underlines that in future the award system will be basically a safety net for those who are disadvantaged, those who are economically at the lower end of the wage scale. This decision confirms important trends and the basic pillars which we put in place back in the 1996 Workplace Relations Act.If you look at the editorial in the Australian this morning, they summed it up when they said: The decision is a welcome sign that an adequate framework for enterprise bargaining is being created in Australia. - `Pity about the umpire,' says the shadow minister, who made the ridiculous claim that this was the end of arbitration. How could you possibly make such a claim when this decision was an arbitrated decision of the commission? This was a decision made under 170MX of the act, which is the provision in the act which provides an arbitral power for the commission. I know that because I spent many hours with the member for Dickson going over the exact words of this particular provision. This was not, `Push me over, I'm worried about a double dissolution.' Oh, no. This was a deliberate and carefully worded section to ensure an appropriate balance and a continuing role for the commission in certain circumstances. She now feels isolated because the Labor Party has left that position. But, in fairness to the member for Dickson, the fact is that when we negotiated this agreement in 1996 it was part and parcel of Labor's policy to simplify the award system. This is what Paul Keating said in 1993:It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitral tribunals. It is a model under which compulsorily arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net. This safety net would not be intended to prescribe the actual conditions of work of most employees, but only to catch those unable to make workplace agreements with employers.So the member for Dickson, when she negotiated with us, was negotiating within a concept laid down by the previous Labor leader. Now she feels embarrassed because she has got frontbenchers on the other side backgrounding against her. The fact is that this is the deal we did, and this is working in the interests of Australian businesses and Australian employees.The other furphy we get is, `Oh, this'll lead to industrial action.' This is the same old claim that Bill Kelty made back in 1996, `I'll give you the symphony, I'll give you the whole orchestra, you'll have nothing but  industrial warfare.' Did we get industrial warfare as a result of the introduction of these reforms? The answer is no. In fact, we got the lowest level of industrial disputes. And, if you bothered to read the decision by the commission, it actually makes the point that this was a decision made by the commission, under its arbitral powers, on the merits of the issue.Here we have a case where the union has undertaken industrial warfare and lost, gained nothing for the members, and the company has been able to force through sensible changes in an industry which needs to be competitive if it is going to be able to maintain jobs in the coal industry. This is not the law of the jungle according to Greg Combet; this is exactly the reform process we agreed with the Democrats when they were not bound hand and foot to the ACTU in formulating policy. It is a very good decision for Australia. It is another step along an evolutionary path which means higher productivity, and with higher productivity we are going to have more jobs and higher living standards.</DOC>

 - Absolutely not, because a cursory reading of the measures that we have announced would show that in the year 2000-01 they actually produce revenue. You are actually, as a result of these changes, in front. You raise more revenue as a result of these changes in the year 2000-01. - The question was whether additional measures to raise revenue  would not come into effect until 2001-02. That was the question. The point I make is: why would you be looking for additional revenue measures before 2001-02 when the changes announced to date are actually revenue positive in 2000-01? We are talking here about measures to take place in 2001-02, because if you were looking for additional revenue you would not need it until 2001-02. That is also the reason why the government was in the position to say that it could engage in consultation with the business community. The business community, right throughout this very successful enterprise - probably the most transparent, up-front reform of business taxation in the history of Australia - said in relation to what we call high-level reforms, that is, the changing of concepts which are deeply embedded either by common law or by statute in our tax act, that if they were to apply then they needed consultation and they had to be put back. And, since they were not needed until 2001-02 because the package was revenue positive in the next financial year, 2000-01, we were only too happy to do that - to engage in the consultation.The Labor Party apparently is against the consultation or alternatively - which I believe is the case - cannot come to a view. So what does it do? It nitpicks around what is going to happen in 2001-02. But here is a real question for the Labor Party: the capital gains tax changes which we announced are to take place from 30 September this year - from a date that has passed. Why don't you focus your question on your attitude to a law which is designed to have taken effect from 30 September 1999 rather than fixating yourself on measures in 2001-02? We know the real position of the Labor Party is that it wants higher capital gains taxes. That was the policy it took to the 1998 election - higher capital gains taxes. - Oh, he does not like this. - As you move around the world the whole movement in relation to tax reform is to reduce capital gains taxes, for example: the Clinton administration, a capital gains flat tax rate of 20 per cent; Gordon Brown, the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer of the UK, was proudly boasting that Labour is reducing company tax and capital gains tax in Britain; and, as Ireland's finance minister, Minister McCreevy, recently pointed out, in Ireland they reduced company taxes and capital gains taxes, and revenues went up. So we have what you would probably call a left of centre government in the United States, a left of centre government in the UK -  - and a left of centre government in Ireland all moving like this government to modernise business taxation. The only ones in the whole world who stand out - like they do with their modern thinking on the wholesale sales tax - is the Australian Labor Party, the party of reaction that modernisation has passed over. What you ought to do to get relevant to this debate is support us on tax reform to bring Australia into the modern world to get us into international practice, and have the decency for once in your lives to support a positive policy.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Fadden for his question. Last week the Minister for Trade and I travelled to Singapore and Tokyo, where we held over 30 meetings - most of them bilateral meetings - to discuss Australia's development as a global financial centre. From those meetings two points became evident. The first is that only some sections of the international financial community are fully aware of just how far Australia has come not only in its regulatory reform but also in its taxation reform. It surprised many people. Even the Monetary Authority of Singapore signalled to us that they are very interested in our corporate law reform program. They were surprised that, despite the Labor Party's opposition, we were are able to get the GST through. They praised us for the GST package, the ANTS package, and the good work done by the Treasurer and the government on that.What became evident was that Australia is at the forefront of international best practice across a range of areas. Lehman Bros, which is a global investment bank, handed me exclusively a copy of their international report on global stock exchanges last Thursday. - You should listen to this. The report said - and this is salient advice for the Labor Party:Globalisation is rendering locally based systems completely inadequate. The sheer speed of change will bring about a much more flexible approach to regulation based on an agreed best practice.They go on to say that the traditional centres of London, New York and Tokyo are going to be in competition with centres such as Sydney. But the overwhelming advice that they put in the report is this - and the Labor Party should also listen to this:We believe - this is a global report - that Australia is extremely well positioned to continue to be a trendsetter into the 21st century.Why is it that the Labor Party opposes every attempt that we make to bring about better regulation? Why is it that the Labor Party opposes us on taxation reform - the taxation  reform that the Monetary Authority of Singapore lauds us for? Why is it that the Labor Party opposes us on corporate law reform? - As the Leader of the Opposition says, the world was amazed at the position of the Labor Party on this. Why is the Labor Party opposing corporate law reform? Why is it opposing taxation reform? Why is it opposing corporate tax reform? Why is the Labor Party opposing every regulatory initiative that this government is putting in place and every budgetary initiative that this government is putting in place that is delivering a better quality of life for Australians? The only answer is that the Labor Party does not understand the issues. It is being laughed at globally, and it is going to pay the price.</DOC>

I might add that just recently we funded the Lone Fathers Association, which is a very worthy organisation -  -  - It is good to see the Labor Party so interested in this. I also note that many of these programs are funded through the Office of the Status of Women. We have a major commitment to all groups. I think the member for Lilley is more interested in promotion and propaganda than he is in good policy.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. He has a deep and abiding interest in the issue of federation funding, as do a number of members, even on the other side of the House, who benefited from the joint announcement by the Premier of Queensland, Peter Beattie,  and me late last week with respect to federal funding for the Queensland heritage trails. The federal government invested some $50 million from the Federation Fund, and the Queensland government, in a joint project, invested some $38 million. The sum of $12 million will be garnered from local government and corporate or private sponsorship - making an investment of $100 million into rural and regional Queensland.It is a magnificent concept. The Premier was fulsome in his praise of the Commonwealth, because he knows - as he said privately and publicly - that this is a very significant, indeed historic, injection of funding for tourism and cultural development infrastructure in rural Queensland of the like not seen before. There are four trails: the coast trail, which follows the eastern coast from Brisbane right up to the Torres Strait; the mining and dinosaurs trail, which links the great mining sites of the north and the fossil beds from the prehistoric inland sea; the Matilda trail, which links the sites and landscapes of Queensland's outback; and, finally, the early settlers trail, which links places and landscapes associated with the pastoral industry - largely centred on the Darling Downs.As a result, tourists who are driving can link up with the four trails. There will be cultural destinations where museums are being refurbished and galleries are installing new attractions. It is all quite magnificent and will appeal to international tourists as much as to domestic tourists.I inform the member for Hinkler that the Mount Morgan Mining Centre, worth $1 million, is being funded. The electorates of a number of other members - the members for Brisbane, Oxley, Wide Bay, Capricornia, Dawson, Herbert, Kennedy, Groom and Leichhardt - are receiving significant investments. Those members have been vitally interested and have been champions and advocates for their electorates. As a result, there is much needed infrastructure now available to meet not only the social or cultural aspirations of their communities but also their need for economic development.</DOC>

As far as the arrangements with Centrelink for pension paydays are concerned, we gave the people on pensions - indeed, people on any government payments - the choice of day to receive their payments. If they are unhappy receiving payments on that day, they can always go back to the first day. -  - The member for Lilley spends all his time scaring innocent people. - The member for Lilley spends all his time scaremongering amongst people who are not fortunate enough to have the ability to look after themselves.

 - I congratulate the member for his interest in this major sporting event which brings an enormous boost not only to our elite sport but also to tourism within Australia. It is the government's aim throughout the Olympic Games, the 2001 Goodwill Games and the 2002 Gay Games to spread the benefits from these events to all of Australia. I congratulate the Melbourne Commonwealth Games team on their successful bid. I think we were assisted by Wellington's pulling out but, nevertheless, it was a win. I understand that our overseas missions, our diplomatic posts, worked very well with the state of Victoria to present the successful bid to host these 2006 Games. It certainly gives our elite athletes something to train on for past 2000. We will continue to assist all those who seek to have events in Australia, and to distribute the benefits from those events right across Australia - from the outer fringes of our urban areas to our regional areas - so that all of Australia benefits from these major events.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. The first thing I did was have discussions with radiologists over several months. In fact, a whole range of changes came in on 1 September which included an across-the-board cut of two per cent, some rules for attendance at items and a variety of other things. I point out that this is a three-year agreement and that you can only judge its success over three years and not in the first year. I expect it to be successful over three years, particularly having brought the changes in with the cooperation of the profession.Secondly, this is the sort of agreement that the Labor Party were never able to come up with, to work cooperatively with the medical profession to try to balance and manage a budget over a period of time. It is a significant change. It is a significant reform. It is something the Labor Party can carp and whinge about but they were never up to it themselves. Thirdly, with regard to gaps, between 1985 and 1995, the average gap payment on Medicare under Labor went up 12.6 per cent. So you are hypocritical in the extreme to talk about a three per cent increase.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I recognise his obvious interest in trade - it being his former profession - and also his interest in exports of Australian art and culture. Austrade and the Australia Council have been involved in a process lately of promoting the export of Australia's arts and culture to the world. In fact, the annual growth rate for our exports has been between six per cent and seven per cent in recent times. We now earn more than $650 million in export earnings from cultural  exports. In 1997-98, Austrade's Export Market Development Grants Scheme provided $4.3 million in grants to 77 cultural organisations which generated more than $100 million worth of exports for Australia. Austrade's work with the film industry has helped attract to Australia the production of movies such as The Thin Red Line  and The Matrix .Last week Austrade, in conjunction with the Australia Council, conducted briefing sessions in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, to make people in the arts and cultural industries aware of the assistance available through Austrade for their export efforts. I thank the member for Cook for representing me in the Sydney briefing session and I acknowledge the involvement of my colleagues - the Minister for Foreign Affairs in Adelaide and the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation in the briefing session in Melbourne. It goes without saying that we should recognise that it is not just the sales of wheat and coal and export dollars earned from tourism that are important to Australia's export efforts but also Australia's cultural achievements and the arts.</DOC>

 - The question of magnetic resonance imaging and funding for it prior to the 1998 budget was the subject of discussion with my colleagues in the Expenditure Review Committee, and the Minister for Health and Aged Care had discussions with me in respect of it. What the honourable member for Jagajaga continues to forget in all of the  matters she attempts to raise on this particular issue in this House is that the proposal was put to the government on the basis of a capped amount.There was a capped amount available for radiology generally. It was an extension of the funding in terms of radiology but within a capped amount. That is what was taken into the budget. That is the manner in which the minister for health has dealt with it throughout the period since it was first decided prior to the 1998 budget, within the 1998 budget and through to the present time. I believe that that covers the broader issues that were raised by the honourable member for Jagajaga. The simple fact is that, with the capped amount, so much is available for the service through MRI, and the minister for health continues to monitor that, as does the finance department.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question. The Howard government has put in place the nation's first national literacy plan to give every young Australian the chance to read and write satisfactorily by the time they leave primary school. Recently we held Australia's first national literacy week, at which 70 schools received awards for the progress they were making in teaching young people to read and write satisfactorily.The question asked me about alternative policies in this area. I am aware of alternative policies, but these alternative policies are not coming from the frontbench of the Labor Party because we know that, on the front bench, there is a complete policy vacuum. There is no leadership and there is a policy vacuum. But the backbench of the Labor Party are becoming desperate, and they are now producing some alternative policies  which the frontbench seem unable to come up with.Last week the member for Rankin came forward with a 10-point education policy. We were told yesterday by the Sun-Herald that the member for Rankin cleared this speech with the opposition leader and discussed it with the shadow education minister. Of course, the opposition leader said, `There's no problem. This doesn't conflict with any of our policies. We don't have a policy in this area, but this 10-point policy might provide us with one.' The member for Rankin deserves credit. He said he did not intend his proposals as a criticism of Mr Lee. Of course, one can treat that with some scepticism because this is now the only education policy circulating on the other side. This is probably why Michelle Grattan wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald on 2 October:Michael Lee as education spokesman is not making a big impact. Yet this area is a priority for Mr Beazley, who aspires to be the 'education prime minister'. Mr Lee could be better used elsewhere.Perhaps the member for Fremantle can be brought down from the back bench, or maybe we will hear something from the member for Dickson. That might be her next portfolio. While chaos reigns on the other side of the House, this government is getting on with the task of making sure that all young Australians have educational opportunities.</DOC>

 - First, I thank the honourable member for his question and for raising this important issue. When I first met Xanana Gusmao and some of the East Timorese way back early this year, this was, even then, one of the issues on our agenda; so I want to make it clear that the government has, over  quite a long period of time, developed a strategy to achieve a smooth transition of the Timor Gap Treaty from Indonesia to East Timor - in consultation with, of course, the key state and territory governments in this country as well as with industry.Before 30 August, the date of the ballot, the government informally discussed the issue with key international players and not just with the East Timorese. The exact date on which I discussed the treaty with Xanana Gusmao was 25 February. We did not think it was appropriate to discuss the issue too publicly and too openly before the 30 August ballot, because obviously that would have pre-empted the outcome of the ballot and we did not want to give the public impression of any expectation of how we thought the ballot would go. Since 30 August, the government has been implementing its transition strategy, including through talks with the United Nations and the East Timorese representatives. My officials have discussed it with Jose Ramos Horta and, just last week, with Mr Mari Alkatiri, who is a senior CNRT official whom the honourable member may have met. He is also an energy expert for the CNRT and has confirmed to officials a desire to move forward on future treaty arrangements. We see this as consistent with an early and smooth transition providing a solid basis for continued long-term investment in the Timor Gap. Some adjustments will have to be made to the treaty, of course - primarily in the arrangements for the joint authority, which the honourable member referred to in his question. It is the joint authority which manages the rights and responsibilities under the treaty on a day-to-day basis.In any case, I can report to the honourable member and to the House that we are happy with the way the discussions are proceeding. We think that the Indonesian government will be very cooperative in the process of transition. Equally, all the signs are very positive - and have been right from my meeting with Xanana Gusmao on 25 February - from the East Timorese as well. So we do not foresee any significant difficulties, but obviously there will be the sorts of transitional issues that the honourable member alluded to that will have  to be concluded. I might just make one other point as well. After the MPR has passed its vote East Timor will move to be a United Nations territory and so we have been discussing this issue with the United Nations in particular because it is they who will have to administer the treaty as well in the interim period.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question and for his interest. Members of the House will be aware that there are a very large number of displaced East Timorese in both East and West Timor. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that somewhere between 150,000 and 230,000 displaced people are in West Timor. While it is difficult to quantify, there are reports of around 200,000 East Timorese displaced within East Timor itself.Today the government is announcing a $6 million package of additional assistance to displaced East Timorese people. We are very concerned about the conditions of these people - in particular, leading up to the wet season, which is about to begin. So this assistance will address some of those issues. We are providing emergency shelter materials. Family kits will be provided, which will comprise items such as plastic sheeting, timber and tools, as well as soap and water containers. There will be enough kits to provide basic shelter for around 18,000 people. We are also ready to assist those who have the capacity to begin to support their own food needs. Now is a very low point in the agricultural cycle. We will be providing 30,000 seed and tool packs through Australian non-government organisations. The government will provide funding and logistical support to help the United Nations World Food Program activities - and that includes purchasing 10 four-wheel drive trucks to allow the delivery of relief assistance to  remote areas during the wet season and continued support for air and sea transport services between Darwin and East Timor which back up the ongoing relief effort.As I said at the beginning, we are very concerned about the humanitarian situation in West Timor as well. We do welcome the recent repatriation flights from West Timor as a first step, but we continue to encourage the Indonesian government to permit voluntary repatriation. Of this package we are announcing today, $2 million will be directed to displaced people in West Timor, including funding for United Nations High Commission for Refugees repatriation programs. It will provide for basic needs of displaced persons living in camps or within host communities in West Timor until they are able to return to their homes. The task of recovery for these people will be difficult. The government calls on the international community to join with Australia in helping these people. But we are determined to provide practical and effective assistance to the East Timorese people.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the question is no. In relation to the second part of the question, this was the government that came up with the policy of entity taxation. We remain committed to introducing it. Needless to say, I would point out that in 13 years of government the Australian Labor Party showed not one whit of interest in this subject - not one whit of interest. As per usual, it took the coalition to deal with the legacies of Labor failure and mismanagement. The Labor Party only ever got interested when it had the capacity to do nothing. When it had the capacity to do  something, it showed not one whit of interest. It got interested in this issue only once the capacity to do anything about it had completely gone from it after 13 years.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question. Like other members of the Liberal and National parties, he will be very interested in the benefits to small business from cutting capital gains tax. On this side of the House, where there is a deep commitment to the small business community of Australia, we make no apology for cutting Labor's capital gains tax on small business. Labor was the party that introduced capital gains tax - some of the highest capital gains taxes in the developed world - and it appears that Labor is going to fight to retain them.On this side of the House we have announced real provisions to help small business. The first thing we say for small business people is that when they sell their business - in which they have wrapped up all of their life, all of their savings and all of their work - only 50 per cent of the assets of that business will be taxable. That is an extension to the small business owners of this country. In addition to that, for the 50 per cent that will be taxable, the government intend to introduce a 50 per cent disregard in relation to the gain. We are waiting, of course, for the Labor Party to announce their position as they desperately search around for a policy on this issue, but it appears that, as on most occasions, because they are unable to articulate a policy, they will say, `No, no, no. Vote no, no, no,' and oppose any reform.The small business people of Australia will be interested to know that Labor supports higher taxes on their business. The coalition wants to cut the capital gains on the small businesses and farmers of Australia. In addition to that, if they hold an asset for 15 years and they are retiring - a farmer, for example,  selling the property to go into town on retirement - under the coalition proposal, which the Labor Party will not support, the sale of that asset will be capital gains tax free. And won't that be great news for the farmers of Australia! In addition to that, as a result of the government's share ownership proposals, 32 per cent of Australians directly own shares. In the sale of the first tranche of Telstra, 560,000 Australians purchased shares. I believe that in relation to that first tranche something like 75 per cent of Telstra employees took up shares. These are Telstra employees who own shares. The Labor Party wants to tax them on the gain at 48c - Telstra employees taxed at 48c on the Telstra shares they took out.Thirty-one per cent of Australians now owning shares need to know this: the Labor Party wants to tax them at full marginal rates on the gains on those shares. The Labor Party, first having tried to prevent them taking up shares, now wants to tax them for the privilege of having taken them up - modern socialism in the hands of the Labor Party: first of all, try to prevent them getting a saving and, if they manage to slip through the net, try and tax the saving at rates of 48 per cent. On this side of the House, we have a policy to encourage share ownership. We congratulate those Telstra employees who have taken out shares and we think they deserve tax relief on their savings. This is the side of the House that wants to deliver benefits to the Telstra employees and to the millions of Australians that now have shares in Australian companies.</DOC>

 - As I recall the Ralph findings, he said that you should not have any exemption for charities. The government has  a provision for $17,000, grossed up value, being exempt for charities. I make the point to the charities that it excludes all of the things that are not subject to FBT in the first place - it does not apply to their computers, or their laptop computers, or their briefcases or their airline memberships. All of the excluded benefits are not taken into account in relation to that $17,000. It means that charities can still give a car, completely tax-free, plus about another $1,000 of benefits. Mr Ralph said nothing. The government has a policy of a grossed up value of $17,000. - Mr Ralph said they should not have any exemption and that, if you wanted to help charities, you should instead send them grants. That is what Mr Ralph said. - The point I am making is that the government has a more generous treatment than is recommended by Ralph. From the interjections of the member for Hotham, I take it he disagrees with the governments' policy. Mr Speaker, I am giving him the opportunity to answer -  - This is the first time I have ever known him to be silent in the House of Representatives: you ask him what his policy is and you stop the interjections, Mr Speaker. - I assume that the Labor Party will oppose this policy, as they oppose all policies. Just before they make a formal announcement opposing the government's policy on this, and hold out to the charities their opposition to it, let me say that I went back and got the Labor Party policy in the last election. Right after the part where they promise to increase capital gains tax on pre-1985 assets, and right after the part where the member for Hotham promised to put higher taxes on four-wheel drives, because he was  going to drive the Toorak tractors off the road, the Labor Party said:A Labor government will reform the fringe benefits tax to limit the value of FBT benefits that can be provided by certain institutions which enjoy concessional FBT treatment to $17,000 of grossed up benefit.So he walks to the dispatch box to query his own policy.

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question and I acknowledge his deep interest in providing young people in his electorate with good-quality training opportunities leading on to real jobs. Earlier this year, I announced the rural and regional new apprenticeships initiative, which delivered on the government's commitment to provide a much-needed boost to training and jobs in rural and regional Australia. This initiative provided an additional $1,000 payment to employers of new apprentices in occupations where there were skill shortages. I am pleased to inform the House that following this initiative there has been a boost of new apprenticeship numbers in rural and regional Australia. Between January and June of this year, there have been over 6,400 new apprenticeship registrations in occupations eligible for the rural and regional new apprenticeship incentive payment. That is a 14 per cent increase on the number of registrations over the same period in 1998. The government expects that some 30,000 new apprentices over a five-year period will benefit from this initiative.While the government is expanding job opportunities and quality training for young Australians, there is a deathly silence on the other side of the House. I was asked whether I was aware of alternative policies. We saw what the member for Batman put forward when he was in the shadow portfolio - not a single question or issue raised in this House during question time since the election. Of course, that is what we would expect from the member for Batman, a failed ACTU president. They still have not got over the disappointment at the failure of their attempt to wreck the apprenticeship system. The record of the member for Batman presents a challenge to the member for Dickson. She is known for her lack of portfolio activity but it is very hard to believe that she will not be tempted at some time to ask a question in this House.Her first press release confirmed that she is going to follow in the footsteps of the member for Batman. She did not mention apprenticeships or training when she took on the portfolio. It was apparently beneath her notice. When she was interviewed on the Sunday program, she was actually quite explicit about the strategy that she intends to pursue. She said:I think that there are some rules that seem to operate when I open my mouth.The reporter said: `Yeah.' The member for Dickson went on to say:I'll just have to keep my mouth closed.So there we have a declaration of intent that there will be no policy from the member for Dickson on apprenticeships and quality training. Vocational education and training is vital to Australia's future. This Howard government has breathed new life into the apprenticeship system. We have rebuilt the apprenticeship system after Labor put the ACTU in charge and very nearly wrecked it. Now we are increasing opportunities for quality training for young people in regional and rural Australia, and on the other side of the House there is nothing but a crashing policy vacuum which reflects the lack of leadership on the part of the Leader of the Opposition. </DOC>

 - The member for Calare will be aware of the history of this matter that: before the 1996 election I undertook that, if the coalition won, we would hold a Constitutional Convention. We delivered on that commitment. I was a participant in that convention, along with many others in this chamber. The announcement I made at the end of the convention that we would put the model that received clear support at that convention to the Australian people was greeted with widespread support, including from the leaders of the Australian Republican Movement, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. I say with great respect to the member that any attempt now, months after that event, to pretend that at the time what I announced the government were going to do was not in accordance with the wishes of the convention is completely wrong. This is a matter on which the government parties are allowed a free vote. I do not intend to pass any comment on the merits of the arguments for or against the question because I do not believe, given the free vote stance of the government, question time is an appropriate forum to do that, but I will talk on process. I would remind the member for Calare that at every stage I and the government have been totally candid with the Australian people. - I have never disguised my own position from the Australian people. I have never walked away from the commitment I made to have a convention. We are having a referendum on 6 November. I am not going to answer a hypothetical question. As is implicit in the fact that the government is holding a referendum, it will abide by the outcome. This is a matter for the Australian people and the Australian people alone to decide.

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question and for his considerable help and expertise in relation to tax matters. He has raised with me the question of the powers to monitor price increases, particularly to ensure that businesses do not use tax changes as an opportunity to increase prices. The government has amended the Trade Practices Act to prevent price exploitation in the lead-up to the new tax system with fines of up to $10 million for companies and $500,000 for individuals who try to use the tax changes to profiteer. In addition, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission can serve a notice on a company when it believes there may be price exploitation and the company must justify its position. The ACCC has power to monitor prices generally and particular industries can be declared by the Treasurer. In those circumstances, the industries concerned have to give prior notification of price changes.Some members have raised with me the question of insurance companies and some of the insurance premiums that are now being charged with tax. It is fair to say that that portion of an insurance contract to be performed after 1 July 2000 is subject to GST.  In relation to that part of the contract and that part of the contract only, there would be a liability. Some members have raised with me the question of whether insurers are passing this matter on properly. In response to their inquiries, I have had discussions with the Chairman of the ACCC, Professor Fels, who has already had some discussions with insurers. But I have asked him to look at some of the complaints that have been forwarded to me and to have some discussions with the insurance companies to make sure that they - who, I admit, have had some bad losses through catastrophes such as the Sydney hailstorm quite recently - do not use tax changes as a cover for recovering losses or raising premiums.The ACCC has already written on one occasion to the Insurance Council of Australia indicating that some of the comments made on behalf of that organisation have been unhelpful and could lead to suspicion about price fixing. That letter was written back in April 1999. As a result of the representations that have been made to me, I have asked Professor Fels to have another look at the insurance industry. Professor Fels will be reporting to me. He has the full panoply of powers that the government has given to him under the Trade Practices Act and, in addition, can recommend a declaration in relation to a certain industry. So to those members who have raised this particular issue with me, I thank them very much for doing so. I can indicate to them that steps are already in train in response to those representations, and I will certainly be reporting to those members concerned the outcome of those investigations.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Grayndler, who has a keen interest in coming to the wonderful electorate of Richmond. I am not quite sure whether you are coming there for holidays. But I am fully aware of the rights of people in mobile home parks. As you correctly point out, I have many residents in my electorate who have chosen the lifestyle of living in mobile home parks, and there are many very good citizens. As they well know, prior to the last election we were very open and transparent about the GST, particularly the relationship that it had to rent and particularly the relationship that it had to mobile home parks. The facts are, and perhaps I can reiterate them for you, that as you are no doubt aware division 87 of the ANTS provides concessional treatment for long-term commercial accommodation. It allows the GST to be charged on 50 per cent of long-term accommodation prices. This extra charge will be offset by the ability of the operator to claim input tax credits for a GST paid on inputs. However, in some cases where commercial premises provide no or very little short-term accommodation, the government will provide some flexibility. Park owners, as you well know, have the option to charge it or not to charge it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. The member for Dickson says she can see it coming. There are serious issues which this government is dealing with. - When it comes to employment and unemployment, I take it as a compliment when the member for Melbourne says that we are predictable. We are constantly on this issue. We consider this a very important issue. We give it the highest priority. We have policies on this issue which we are determined to press ahead with because we know that good policies implemented means good results. We have out the latest numbers from the ABS on jobs. I am pleased to report to the House that a record number of Australians are now in jobs - a total of 8.831 million people, according to those numbers released last week. Since coming to office, the coalition has seen the creation of 526,900 jobs. The unemployment rate is now at 7.4 per cent. The last figure did blip up a bit but that was because the participation rate moved up as more people took up opportunities. - Well, what you see is that 81,000 jobs created or thereabouts in the last two or three months -  - which represents a very strong -  - Mr Speaker, I have had interjections about how things were when Labor were in office. In the 3½ years since we have been in office, 526,000 jobs have been created. Let's be generous to them: let's compare that with Labor's last six years. In that time, only 396,000 jobs were created. In terms of jobs per month, in the time that we have been in office 12½ thousand jobs a month have been created. - You want the figure? In your last six years in office, 5,800 jobs were created per month. That is not to say that we are satisfied with progress. We are not. More needs to be done. And the people who are standing in the way of further reforms are the very people sitting on the front bench on the other side - most of them former trade union hacks sent up here as a reward for service in the trade union movement. The shadow minister did have something to say. She put out a set of numbers. When we corrected her numbers for the numerous errors - that is a little lesson to be learnt; you want to get your facts straight - compared to February 1996, the number of unemployed males, females and young people is down and the number of long-term unemployed is down. Even on the question of regions - and I think more needs to be done in terms of regional development - the shadow minister said that there were 235 areas -  -  - Right, just to get your facts straight, it is actually 227. But the interesting comparison is that that figure was 393 when Labor left office. So, again, progress is being made. Further progress will be made if we can see the passage of reforms that will help. For example, for small business, the change to unfair dismissals would help create more jobs. If we could have a better capital gains tax regime for small business - which you cannot support; you lack the leadership to support a sensible measure - that would be good for small business, that would mean more jobs. Lastly, what we would like to see from the opposition is for them to actually have a policy on this issue. We had a promise that we would have a policy position on employment by the end of September. What do we see? A statement from the Leader of the Opposition saying, `Oh, no, I have got too many balls in the air at the moment; it will have to wait until after the referendum.' People who are unemployed are sick of waiting for you. For 3½ years you have been leader; it is about time you showed a bit of leadership, actually had a policy and were prepared to stand up for the unemployed in this country.</DOC>

 - This initiative is properly that of the Office of the Status of Women -  - Yes, I was a guide. The point of the matter is that the manner in which funding has been conducted to support women's organisations has been changed, in that there are three peak groups who are now receiving $100,000 each, as distinct from a greater number who were previously receiving $50,000 each. Those three are the National Council of Women, the YWCA and the Federation of Business and Professional Women. There is a further $200,000, because the amount of funding for women's organisations remains the same, at $500 million -  -  - I beg your pardon - $500,000; I added a nought. There is a further $200,000 which will be available for project funding for which groups such as the Girl Guides will no doubt be applying. The $300,000 for the three peak groups is designed to give an effective voice to those groups, so that the criticism that was previously heard that the funding was not great enough to carry out proper secretariat functions has now been met.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for McPherson, who does a mighty job as my neighbouring MP, for her insightful question. I would like to inform the House that later today I will be tabling the 1998-99 Centrelink compliance report. This report shows that over $232 million worth of social security payments owed to Centrelink have been identified by computer data matching programs. During the 1998-99 financial year, there were over 3,000 convictions for welfare fraud. Centrelink's compliance activities resulted in savings to the Australian taxpayer of $20.9 million per week. Over a quarter of a million payments were either cancelled or reduced as a result of Centrelink's compliance activities, equating to almost $280 million. These figures certainly highlight that the government's action on social security fraud is achieving results.Although this government is committed to reducing the cost of fraud and overpayments to taxpayers, I emphasise that this government is equally committed to prevention, and prevention, as we know, is always better than cure. This government takes seriously its duty to ensure the integrity of the social security system. We have a duty not only to the Australian taxpayer but also to the vast majority of Centrelink customers, who are honest and have genuine entitlements to social security payments. Later today, I will be tabling this document.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. It is interesting to note that, in my travels recently to announce various NHT grants, I announced $14 million for Tasmania. A very interesting point was just made that it was going elsewhere, but not one of the Labor members in Tasmania bothered at any time to make any representations to get that money for their constituents. When the Prime Minister first advised the Australian people of our intention to sell one-third of Telstra, he made another very significant promise, which was to use the proceeds for debt reduction - that is, the reduction of the huge fiscal debt accumulated by the previous government, and the debt contemporary Australia owed to the environment. That promised funding was initially $1 billion and now stands at $1.5 million following the Telstra 2 announcement.One of the largest problems facing Australia today in the environmental area, and about which you, Mr Speaker, have issued constant warnings, is dryland and the associated waterway salinity. On 3 August 1999, Dr Harris of the CSIRO publicly estimated that the cost to overcome this problem over the years was in excess of $30 billion. It is a matter of statistical fact that this is almost exactly the sum of money this government has been obliged  to spend in just four budgets to pay the interest on the Beazley borrowing binge. It is only this government which, in repaying that debt, is freeing up the funding needed to address many problems, including those associated with the environment. How people on that side of the House see the environment as a joke, I would like to know. -  - Oh, yes; it is a joke to say things about the environment. - Through announcements made by Senator Hill, Minister Truss, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Environment and Heritage, Dr Stone, and me, the government has recently announced funding for the third year of the Natural Heritage Trust program. Over $190 million in funding for over 2,700 projects throughout Australia has been announced so far for 1999-2000. By far the bulk of these funds will be spent in regional and rural Australia for obvious reasons. - Yes, like the $14 million that went to Tasmania. - Last week I was present also in the electorate of Herbert, which is very ably represented by the member who asked this question, and in the adjoining electorates of Kennedy and Leichhardt to present certificates to the local community and the people they employee who will benefit from this round of funding. In the electorate of Herbert, a single grant of $164,400 will be provided for eight projects, which includes $7,000 to protect, repair and maintain the Serpentine Lagoon Wetland and $72,000 to enhance the biodiversity, habitat and connectivity between areas of high conservation value along the riparian areas of the Ross River. In the electorate of Leichhardt, $200,200 will be provided for six  projects. This grant includes $36,000 to continue the implementation of the Trinity Inlet Freshwater Creeks Revegetation Strategy and $34,300 to establish a North Queensland farm forestry development committee, which has great prospects.Ongoing funding of almost $400,000 was presented in Cooktown for research and the reduction of the feral pig population. We were informed while we were there that that population is estimated to be between two million and nine million animals. When you look at the insects, frogs and everything that that research has identified these animals are eating, you do not wonder why we have a reduction in those indigenous species. One pig, when captured and dissected, was found to have some 300 frogs in it.The Natural Heritage Trust is the largest environmental rescue effort ever undertaken by an Australian government. This has been achieved through a partnership between the Commonwealth government, the states, local government and particularly community groups and individuals, who have contributed a vast effort in this regard. This is a program that gets people on the ground to identify the problems and to contribute personally with the aid of federal funding. It is certainly no joke, but it is another area of policy vacuum from those opposite.</DOC>

 - Someone has had a bad lunch over there. I thank the honourable member for her question. I have never main  tained that all contracts were signed months before the budget. I have maintained that some were. I think in the past I said that I did not know the distribution at the time. As the Health Insurance Commission said at the Senate estimates committee, to release the dates would be counterproductive to their investigation, and I intend to allow the investigation to run its full term. As for the fact that any leak came from me, I completely repudiate that. Those sorts of gutter tactics will not get you anywhere.</DOC>

 - I applaud the member's interest in tourism, which is one of the largest foreign dollar generators for this country. In August 1999 we saw a 10 per cent increase in our inbound tourism numbers from August last year. That has been a major return to growth in inbound tourism for Australia. This is showing a clear recovery from the Asian crisis. We have invested $359 million in the Australian Tourist Commission for our promotions overseas, as well as around $30 million in annual funding to our tourism operators under the Export Market Development Grants. I encourage all tourism operators to have a look at the EMDG scheme as a boost to their export potential. It is evident already that Australia is well on target to achieving 8.4 million visitors to Australia in the year 2008, which sets up this industry to have an export potential of $33 billion.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. He has a real interest in helping rural and regional communities that are facing very real periods of adjustment cope with that adjustment and find new economic and job futures for the people who live in those regions. Last week, the government announced that 13 regional communities would benefit from an injection of $1.6 million for a series of programs under the government's Rural Plan program. Rural Plan is part of Agriculture - Advance Australia, which is the very substantial package that the government, in its first term, put in place of the old Rural Adjustment Scheme, which was widely seen as outmoded and inadequate.This very substantial Agriculture - Advance Australia package included Rural Plan, which is all about supporting grassroots efforts by communities to deal with the changing economic and industry circumstances they con  front and putting in place new plans, new ways forward and new strategies for more diverse and sustainable rural industries. In short, it allows them to find ways to kick-start their local economies, particularly in those areas that have been hard hit by low commodity prices and shifts in demand, such as we have very sadly witnessed in recent years in the wool industry.Examples under the latest round include funding of $120,000 for the Planning for the 21st Century program in Loddon shire in Victoria. In the electorate of the honourable member who asked the question, the Barwon-Darling Alliance project received $120,000 to put together a strategic plan to foster the development of primary and processing industries in that region. I share some of that region with the member, in my own electorate, and levels of unemployment are tragically high, particularly among young people and indigenous people. Everything that can be done to identify new industries and new opportunities ought to be done, and we are certainly doing what we can to help. In the electorate of the member for Hume, the Lachlan Valley Horticultural Network has been funded with $150,000 to help agricultural production gear more effectively for domestic and export performance. In the electorate of Lyons in Tasmania there is the Derwent Valley Economic Renewal program. Rural Plan is another example of the kind of program that we are putting in place - a whole range of programs and a whole range of tools are being made available to rural and regional Australia at a time of real pressure and adjustment.</DOC>

 - I thank the Chief Government Whip for his question. I am sure that we could have had more in the parade if we had had more horsemen in the House. Over the last three days, the people of Canberra have witnessed members of the Imperial Bushmen's Contingent from all the eastern mainland states coming here to commemorate the commencement of the Boer War 100 years ago. The Boer War is a significant part of our nation's history. Some 16,000 young Australians went off to the Boer War and we lost over 600 young Australians. The three-day activity in Canberra has been appropriate because the contingent has brought alive a significant part of our nation's heritage and history. I think it was Paterson and Henry Lawson who really epitomised the bushman. Paterson was a wartime correspondent in the Boer War and he wrote about the bushmen in South Africa as hard riding and straight shooting, and larrikins to boot.The member for Ballarat also has some hard riding larrikins who have ridden 800 kilometres from Creswick in his electorate, just north of Ballarat, right here to Canberra to participate in this very important commemoration. One of the most interesting things about that is that they were four young people: two 17-year-olds, a 14-year-old and a 15-year-old. I think that augers well for the future of the heritage of our nation. I think those four young people - Laura and Dane Woodward, Hannah Aumann and Mark Hansen - deserve  to be congratulated by members of this House. I hope that members on the other side of the House might join in congratulating those four young people, who spent 23 days riding here to Canberra so that they might have some understanding of what those who served our country might have gone through. Many of those people who did go through that experience were not much older than those four young Australians, who have ridden 800 kilometres from Victoria here to Parliament House.The other thing that I might add, if I could, is that last night I had the opportunity to launch an Internet site through the Heraldry and Genealogical Society of Canberra. That Internet site is of Australian casualties in South Africa. In the past, these records have been held by South Africa, and we thank the South African official for making them available to us. They are an invaluable record on the Internet for all to search, and I think that also adds some significance to the occasion of the last three days. I do not think there is anything more significant, more Australian, than the slouch hat and the emu plumes that go with it, and seeing them on the young people riding up to Parliament House and the Australian War Memorial as part of the Imperial Bushmen's Contingent means that the spirit of the bushmen and the Anzac legend are alive and well in Australia, and that they will be into the century.

 - I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question and for her interest in this issue. I can confirm to the House that the Pakistan military has seized control of the government, but the situation remains fluid and unclear and our High Commissioner and High Commission in Islamabad is continuing to monitor developments. There are unconfirmed reports that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is under house arrest after his failed attempt to dismiss the Chief of the Pakistani Army Staff, General Musharraf. There are also reports that Pakistan is now under martial law with army units in control of key government installations including radio, television and airports. There have also been some unconfirmed reports of gunfire, although generally the situation remains calm in Pakistani cities. General Musharraf, who appeared on television last  night to declare the army had seized control of the government, indicated the situation was calm, stable and under control.Australia is deeply concerned at the unconstitutional overthrow of a democratically elected government in Pakistan. Australia calls for the earliest restoration of democracy to Pakistan and that the constitution and the rule of law be respected. The Australian High Commission is contacting Australian citizens resident in Pakistan to urge them to exercise caution and limit unnecessary movement. There are around 470 Australians registered with the High Commission. Honourable members may be interested to know that my department is in the process of issuing a new travel advisory note for Pakistan.</DOC>

 - The government's policies in relation to education are on the public record. -  - We have policies on this side of the House. That is the difference. The government's policies in relation to higher education have been clearly stated. We have made available fees for undergraduate students to expand opportunities for students to attend Australian universities. Fees are available also for postgraduate students and, as a consequence of this, we now have more university students on campus in Australia than at any previous time. Universities in this country are better funded than at any previous time. The government's policies therefore are always aimed at expanding opportunities for all students who are qualified to gain a university education.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Bradfield for his question. Obviously the opportunity to reform Australia's business taxation system is a great opportunity for Australia and a real opportunity to build economic growth in this country. What the government proposes is to lower company tax rates so that we will be one of the most competitive economies in the region. We propose to introduce a simplified taxation system for small business which gives them the benefit of pooling arrangements. We propose to allow investment by exempt pension funds into Australia to have rollover relief in relation to farms, small businesses and the like and, as the Ralph inquiry found, a consequence of that will be to add to GDP growth. I think that is why the business tax reforms have been so warmly welcomed, because they will add to GDP growth and make Australia a stronger economy.The Labor Party are unable to announce a policy in relation to business tax reform. They are making every possible excuse to avoid any responsible position in relation to this, including the absolutely false and far-fetched claim by the Leader of the Opposition this morning that somehow he cannot announce his position on business tax reform because of East Timor.This is a claim that he made yesterday. I overlooked it yesterday, thinking it was most probably an error, but he returned to it today and said this: `A dollar will go into the pocket of high income earners in this country and out of the pocket of our troops in Timor.' This is one of the grubbiest claims that he has made to date in relation to East Timor. Nothing could be further from the truth than that grubby claim repeated for a second day in a row by the Leader of the Opposition, who should be taking the advice of callers to talkback radio in Perth when he looks at his position on East Timor.The troops in East Timor not only are fully funded but also have taxation exemptions in  relation to their salaries. You are never going to help Australia's military effort at home or abroad by running a weak economy. What backs up our troops and what backs up our international position is a strong economy. We would not be able to do this if our budget were $10 billion in deficit. We would not be able to do this if we had sat back and said, `We're not going to reform our labour markets and our product markets and secure our banking system and make Australia one of the strongest growing economies in the region during an East Asian financial crisis.' We would not have been able to do this if we had sat on our hands for the last three years, as the Labor Party was saying, and we will not be able to realise the important role that we have unless we keep the Australian economy strong. That was a grubby claim, and it was a false claim. It is about time that, instead of snooping around those sorts of false issues, the Leader of the Opposition showed enough courage to finally announce a policy.</DOC>

 - This is a question from a shadow minister who is under very serious pressure within his own party. The member for Fremantle is eyeing that spot on the front bench. If that question is any sign, she is going to be there in the not too distant future. The suggestion that there are regional university campuses at risk is absolutely absurd, and I completely reject that. The government is not only supporting universities to produce the highest revenues that they have ever had but also strengthening the provision of higher  education in regional and rural Australia. A significant proportion of the moneys which the government has put into the development of higher education campuses in Australia in recent years has gone to campuses in regional Australia.The contrast is between a former Labor government - which locked tens of thousands of qualified students out of Australian universities and which provided access to universities for overseas students that was not provided to Australian students - and a government which has opened the doors of Australia's universities to qualified students, has virtually eliminated unmet demand and has put the universities in a position where they may now be better resourced than ever before. In fact, the total revenue of Australian universities this year is some $700 million higher than it was in 1995 under the previous Labor government. So let there be no mistake: this government is committed to access to quality university education for qualified students in metropolitan and regional Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie. To respond to the preliminary interjections, what Rob Bastion said was that capital gains tax relief for small business is well and truly overdue. And why wouldn't he say that? If we can encourage our small businesses, they will grow, and that means more jobs. It is a very simple but obvious message which seems to have failed to have caught the attention of the Leader of the Opposition and those on the other side.Yesterday, as released in the papers this morning, we had another survey of employers  and their attitudes to the unfair dismissal law. The Recruitment Solutions survey showed that six per cent of companies surveyed indicated that they had recruited fewer permanent staff, which is a quite clear statement that fewer people are getting jobs than should be; eight per cent had not employed people permanently but had put on people as casuals; and 35 per cent had been the subject of an unfair dismissal claim during the past 12 months.If you did just an on the back of an envelope calculation, given the number of small businesses in Australia, you could extrapolate that and say that 60,000 jobs have been lost because of the unfair dismissal law and that, furthermore, another 80,000 people have gone into jobs as casuals instead of getting a permanent job. That is a pretty relevant point, because the opposition are always complaining - and I might say exaggerating - the number of people who are employed as casuals and yet, in opposing our reforms to unfair dismissal, the opposition are forcing a lot of employers to actually put people on as casuals instead of as permanent staff.A lot of small business people say, `I don't want to get caught up in this unfair dismissal law, and I can't afford the legal costs, so I'll put somebody on as a casual.' You as the Labor Party cannot complain about the number of casuals and then go over to the Senate and vote against a measure which would encourage permanent employment.It is yet another demonstration that, on an important issue relating to employment, Labor have no alternative of their own and their only position is to oppose sensible measures which would actually create jobs. It is time that they had a policy. We were promised a policy on employment. It is about time the Leader of the Opposition showed a bit of leadership, showed a bit of fortitude, stood up to his masters in the ACTU and actually developed policy that would help small business, whether it is on unfair dismissal, capital gains tax or many of the other reforms Labor continue to oppose.</DOC>

 - The government's policies for higher education have put the universities in a position where they have greater capacity and autonomy to manage their own affairs. It is up to the universities what policies they pursue internally. We, for example, have given the universities the opportunity to receive payment from the government for taking on students beyond the fully funded places. We have provided the universities with $2,500 for every student enrolled above the fully funded places. - It will be a long time before I tell the member for Dobell the contents of any private conversations that I may be having. What I am drawing the member for Dobell's attention to is the fact that the government has provided the universities with the opportunity to gain additional resources and greater flexibility in deciding what policies they will pursue on campus. The universities have responsibility for that, and the  conditions on their campuses are matters that are in the hands of the university management.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. As the House would know, the Australian economy grew at 4½ per cent in the last financial year, and the government has forecast somewhat of a slowing in 1999-2000 from those very high levels. But what we saw yesterday released with the National Australia Bank monthly business survey was that business conditions remain at around the highest levels recorded since the survey commenced in 1997. The survey stated that it was `the first since the government's response to the Ralph business tax proposals and, as such, the kick in confidence could well be related'. So it was finding in the business community a lot of confidence coming out of the government's tax changes - and, of course, the sooner they are supported and enacted, the sooner that confidence will translate into increased activity and increased jobs.The NAB's Chief Economist, Alan Oster, noted that overall the survey points to another very strong performance by the non-farm business sector in September. Importantly, the survey also finds a continued absence of any significant wage and price pressures in the non-farm business sector. At Merrill Lynch's investment conference in New York, its chief economist, Mr Peter Osborne, had this to say to potential investors in Australia:Inflation is low and stable, interest rates are low in both nominal and real terms, the fiscal position is strong and the banking system is extremely healthy.That is the kind of news that is being received about Australia around the world. The more we attract investment, the more we get business going, the more jobs we will have in this economy - and business tax reform is a very big part of that. We will not increase the growth rate of the Australian economy by  doing nothing. Those people who have a genuine interest in increasing growth in the Australian economy will be looking to implement business tax reform.I remarked recently when talking to investors overseas in both America and London that because productivity growth has averaged 2.9 per cent under the government - about double the productivity growth that occurred under Labor - it is possible that the long-term growth rate of the Australian economy could lift up a notch. If we can maintain productivity, the long-term growth rate could lift up in the next decade to 3½ to four per cent, which would be a quantum shift up. That is the return on good economic policy.The return on good economic policy - whether it be labour market reform, banking reform, corporate regulation reform, fiscal reform, the new monetary policy, low inflation or putting the budget back into a balance, which were all opposed by the Labor Party - is the productivity lift that could sustain a step up in growth in the Australian economy in the next decade. As I said at the time of the last budget, if that were to occur, the next decade could be a special one for Australia. The important thing is that we keep the economic momentum going, that we complete the great task of tax reform, that we move into the area of business tax reform and that we make sure that this economy has the potential to produce the goods and services which will lift living standards, create jobs and offer better opportunities for Australians in the future.</DOC>

 - I am not going to comment directly or indirectly on the document that the member for Dobell claims to have. I stand by the answers that I have given to the House. Any decisions that this government takes in relation to education at any level will be designed to improve access, to improve quality and to improve opportunities for Australia to become a highly educated and skilled country.This government is the government which is providing leadership to Australia in educational standards and educational outcomes. The record of the Labor Party in government was absolutely abysmal. It was abysmal at the higher education level in terms of squeezing opportunities for qualified Australian students. It was abysmal at the vocational education level. Indeed, as we saw from Neal Blewett's book, the former education minister, Mr Dawkins, referred to Labor's appalling record in that area. - Mr Speaker, if indeed they do have a copy of a cabinet submission of mine, all I can say is that that will be the most intelligent and best thought-out proposal on education that the Labor Party has had in its hands for a very long time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for his question. It is a very serious question. Through the good efforts of our government and the Australian people, we have managed to quarantine the Australian economy from the economic downturn in Asia. We are actively engaging in building and strengthening our relationship with our South-East Asian neighbours.Having just returned last week from talks between the trade ministers from the ASEAN countries and the Australian and New Zealand trade ministers, I can report that our relationship with our regional partners is in very good order and is very strong. This region accounts for about 12 per cent of our total trade efforts. Prior to the economic downturn in South-East Asia, it had been experiencing about 10 per year growth per year.Our ASEAN neighbours fully recognise the importance of strengthening our relationship, particularly the trade relationship with Australia. Highlighting this, the Singapore meeting a week and a half ago agreed to establish a task force to undertake a feasibility study into the possibility of establishing a free trade agreement between the ASEAN nations and Australia and New Zealand, being the CER countries. The high level task force will be headed by the former Prime Minister of the Philippines, Mr Cesar Virata.The concept of a free trade area is strongly supported by the Australian Industry Group, who have welcomed its potential to deliver additional market access for our exporters. In fact, they engaged an independent economic analysis of what benefits would flow to the Australian economy. That modelling showed that the Australian economy would stand to benefit by more than $8 billion a year by that sort of involvement in the region. They put out a press release which said:The Australian Industry Group congratulates the minister on this ground-breaking announcement and looks forward to working closely with the task force to progress this important development in building closer linkages with the region. I accept those congratulations on behalf of the government. This agreement clearly shows that our ASEAN neighbours recognise the very important role that Australia is playing in developing a more prosperous and secure region in which we live. We will continue to work with our ASEAN neighbours in strengthening that relationship.</DOC>

 - The hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition is absolutely breathtaking. Here is the leader of a party which in government pursued policies which locked out of universities the most marginal students. Up to 30,000 or 40,000 marginal students - students from poorer families, students from blue-collar families, students who did not have the educational opportunities of other students - were denied a university education by the Labor Party. It is through this government's policy of making possible fees for undergraduate places that students are getting their preference and vacating government funded places. It is this government, by its marginal funding of over-enrolments, which has opened the doors of Australian universities to qualified students from poorer backgrounds. For you to get up here and pretend through your rhetoric that somehow or other you were looking after those students when you denied them access is gross hypocrisy.If indeed the Leader of the Opposition has in his hands a copy of a cabinet submission  that I prepared, all I can suggest to him is that he reads it very carefully and compares it with what he is not getting from those who are responsible for education on the other side of the House.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question, and I acknowledge his great personal interest in the provision of educational opportunities for students in regional and rural Australia. The tender for the new apprenticeship centres has just been completed and will see some 425,000 Australians over the next three years gaining assistance in their enquiries in relation to new apprenticeships. The new apprenticeship centres provide support to employers by helping them with information on registration and the provision of incentives and facilitating any other advice and assistance that employers need.As a result of this tender round, 34 organisations will provide new apprenticeship support services in 311 sites over the next three years across Australia. This is an increase on the 208 sites operating at the present time. One pleasing feature of the tender round was that a number of employer organisations have won contracts to operate new apprenticeship centres. This shows that business is very strongly supportive of the reforms which the government has put in place. A key aspect of this tender round has been its focus on making sure that employers and apprentices in regional and rural Australia are better served. In fact, a signal of this is the dramatic increase in the number of sites for new apprenticeship centres in rural and  regional Australia and in remote regions. The number of sites increases from 118 to 200 under the new arrangements in regional and remote Australia.This government is committed to providing quality education in regional and rural Australia. That is a great deal more than I can say for the opposition. Recently, when the Leader of the Opposition issued a press release about easing the workload of the member for Dickson, he referred to the fact that the member for Batman had been active in developing a training policy for regional and rural Australia. I have got a suggestion for the member for Dickson - that her first question to the member for Batman be: where is the policy? Where is all this work that has actually been done on regional and rural Australian education because we have not seen it. No-one else in Australia has seen it. There is no policy out there from the opposition. The quality education and training policy in this country is coming from the government.</DOC>

If indeed the member for Dobell has a copy of a cabinet submission which promotes the extension of loans in Australia, I would have thought that that was a policy that maybe the Labor Party would be very interested in.

 - I thank the honourable member for Blair for his question, and I thank those members of the opposition who noted that this is Austcare Refugee Week. I want to use this opportunity to restate the government's commitment to assisting those people who are refugees and to remind the House that Australia maintains the largest per capita refugee and humanitarian program in the world. On top of that, this government has initiated the arrangements that have enabled 4,000 people from Kosovo to be given safe haven in Australia until it was safe and secure for them to return home and has also made provision for East Timorese people to be accommodated in Australia until it is safe and secure for them to go home. This was all on top of the measures that have been maintained over a long period.Notwithstanding our generous and proud record in this area, our refugee and humanitarian program is under challenge. It is important to recognise how it is under challenge. There has been a very rapid escalation in unauthorised arrivals to Australia. During the course of this year, 1,500 people have arrived by boat off the west coast of Australia, in comparison to a mere 200 last year. The fact is that they are often people - unlike those we have seen before who have not been able to sustain asylum claims - notwithstanding our generosity in relation to Iraqis and Afghans in accommodating them through the regular refugee program, who have been living in security and safety for a number of years in third countries, and are now seeking to get to the front of the queue for asylum places in Australia.I am determined - and so is the government - to protect Australia's places for those who are genuinely in need and not to stand by while the system is exploited by those who do have alternatives and while those who have no alternatives miss out. In the context of the measures that the government has already announced - in relation to enhancing Coastwatch, Customs and Navy capacities to  intercept vessels arriving, the penalties for people smugglers, the additional resources that we put into boosting our intelligence information offshore and in transit countries and the legislation that we have before us at the moment to enhance our powers of search and pursuit of vessels involved in people smuggling - it is important that we do more to reduce the attractiveness of Australia as an option for those who seek to come here unlawfully.We also need to be able to identify clearly those people who have had claims accepted offshore - in other countries - who seek to hide their identity and ensure that we do not know who they are, where they are from and that they have had claims accepted before.Today I announced a comprehensive package of measures to respond to this problem. It includes providing temporary protection only in the first instance to unauthorised arrivals found to be in need of refugee protection. That measure is not unusual. It was a measure of a sort that was put in place by a former government, and I think is required again to reduce the attractiveness of Australia as a destination. We also need to legislate to prevent the protection visa system from being clogged up with people who already obviously have alternative protection available to them. We need to amend the law to ensure that, if they have had claims accepted elsewhere, they stay there where they are safe and secure and do not deny a place to somebody else who has no place to go. Finally, we need to strengthen the powers under the Migration Act to allow testing of unauthorised arrivals and asylum seekers to prevent identity fraud.I am pleased at the silence with which I have been heard and the nodding heads I have seen, and I look forward to the comprehensive support of the opposition to all of these measures in their entirety.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question and recognise the contribution that he has made to the debate on this issue, including raising it in the parliament on quite a number of occasions. Certainly, I have seen the article in the Australian , which refers to the introduction of exotic marine pests into Port Phillip Bay. I understand that the article arose from a CSIRO study on the issue, which I think produced information of concern to all Australians that many exotic marine pests and diseases are able to travel to Australia and that many of them have come through ships' ballast water.It is of interest to note that each year about 10 billion tonnes of ballast water is transported around the globe. It has been estimated that as many as 10,000 plants and animals are transported each day through ballast water. So it is a matter of potential concern that new pests and diseases can come to Australia through ships' ballast water. There is already evidence of a number of organisms reaching our waters through this mechanism.Last month, the government announced that we would indeed be acting unilaterally to introduce strict new rules for international ships to manage their ballast water so that we can minimise the introduction of exotic pests to Australia. Australia has been active in this field for quite some time, and we had been hoping that an international agreement on ballast water management would have been reached by now. It is clear that that is still some years away. We cannot wait, and so the Australian government has announced that we will be acting unilaterally, and new requirements will come into force from 2001.I have been very pleased at the warm response that this action has received from the shipping community and from those involved in Australian exports and imports. There has been unanimous support from industry. They are working with us to implement appropriate  guidelines and to prepare the necessary regulations and mechanisms so that Australia will have the toughest rules in the world to deal with ballast water management. I commend the honourable member for Dunkley for his interest in this matter. We are interested in not only the waters of Port Phillip Bay but all Australian waters, to ensure that there is the minimum possible risk of importing exotic pests and diseases through ballast water.</DOC>

 - We have the extraordinary sight of the opposition claiming that there is a secret plan, and they seem to be doing their best to try to keep it secret. They have been asked to table the document and make it available - and they are so far refusing to do it. So let us see it. This immediately raises questions about why the opposition is refusing to table a document. Insofar as the opposition leader's question addressed the issue of access, I simply repeat my last answer - that this government's policies are all designed to expand access to education for all students, regardless of their financial background, and our policies have done this. -  - That is why we have more students in vocational education and training than ever before -  - and more students on university campuses than ever before. Our policies will continue to be policies that will expand access for students from whatever financial background they come.</DOC>

 - Thank you, Mr Speaker. - Thank you, Mr Speaker, for the opportunity to answer the question. I thank the member for Robertson for his question. I recently had the opportunity to visit Work for the Dole participants in his electorate and I appreciate his commitment to this great government program. I am aware of a new study by the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales based on a national survey of 2,400 people. This survey showed 80 per cent support for the proposition that unemployed people under 25 should be required to participate in Work for the Dole. It showed 77 per cent support for the proposition that unemployed young people should be required to participate in mutual obligation activities and it showed 70 per cent support for the proposition that the long-term unemployed should be required to undertake mutual obligation activities.This survey is further evidence of strong public support for these three signature programs and initiatives of the Howard government. The survey was not all good news, I am afraid. Nearly one-fifth, or 20 per cent, of respondents thought that job seekers should not be required to look for work, thought that job seekers should not have to accept any jobs offered and thought that job seekers should not be required to undertake training. I think that Australia cannot afford this kind of negativity. Attitudes like this are unacceptable to this government. They were unacceptable to the former government. They were unacceptable to the former shadow minister for employment. And the question is: are they also unacceptable to the new shadow minister for employment? Perhaps she might tell us sometime exactly what she thinks  about Work for the Dole and mutual obligation.</DOC>

 - The opposition are obviously startled by the fact that they have been fortunate enough to see some policy options. It has thrown them into complete confusion. We know the last time they had a thinker and a writer on that side of the House: he is now sitting up on the back bench. - The fact that they have seen some quality policy options put before the government is obviously disturbing them, because the last person who tried quality policy options is now on the back bench. They have the writers up there on the back  bench and the photocopiers down here on the front bench. Could I just reiterate what I said yesterday: this government is all about improving access to universities. We are not about increasing debt for students or making debt a burden. - Of course I was directly addressing that point. The opposition have been running around the country telling their friends in the student union movement that the government is all about $100,000 or $150,000 loans and debts, none of which is accurate or based on the paper that is now in their hands. All we see now is the Labor Party's mates in the student movement on campus out there protesting -  - The point that the Leader of the Opposition raises goes directly to the distortion that I am referring to of the prospect of large debt falling on students. The Prime Minister has made it completely clear today that the government stands by its commitments on the deregulation of fees. The government is all about presenting options, including the possible expansion of income contingent loans - which is one of the elements in this paper which has not been referred to at all by the opposition - to ensure that students have access to university. These options will allow the government to consider  the best ways to improve access to Australian universities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Grey for that question. The short answer to the question is yes. The longer answer starts, of course, with an acknowledgment by me - and I know it is an acknowledgment that is shared right across the education sector - that the minister has done an outstanding job in the portfolio that he has had. The truth is that, at the time of the last election, a number of undertakings were made about education. The major undertaking was that we would continue to expand access into universities for young Australians.In 1999, there are 398,500 undergraduate student places for the first time - an increase of seven per cent on levels in 1996 under the previous government. Secondly, there is a record number of fully funded undergraduate places - 364,400, which is 3.5 per cent more than in 1996. There is a record estimated total university revenue of $8.675 billion, which is 4.5 per cent more than in 1996. I might add, by way of passing comment, that what this minister has done in enforcing higher literacy and numeracy standards for Australian schoolchildren in the Australian states will contribute massively to the education resource of this country in the years ahead. He is the first federal education minister to take seriously  the problem of literacy and numeracy in Australian schools - something that ought to have been the responsibility of the state governments but that state governments, I am sorry to say, of both political stripes over the years have abysmally neglected. Thanks to the minister, something has been done about it.In 1998, when the West report into higher education was presented to the government, a number of undertakings were given. Those undertakings included a commitment that the government had no intention of introducing vouchers for post-secondary education. That undertaking stands undiminished, and I repeat it today. We have no intention of deregulating university fees nor have we any intention of introducing HECS for TAFE courses. Those undertakings were repeated by the minister at the time of the election and they remain undiminished today. The government will not be introducing an American style higher education system. -  - There will be no $100,000 university fees under this government. That is a figment of the Labor Party's propaganda machine, and everyone knows that is what it is. -  - We will have a submission before us. The minister is canvassing a range of options in the submission, but I can assure the Australian people that the decisions to be taken by the government will fully reflect the undertakings previously made and reaffirmed by me just now.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for the question. As many honourable members are aware, Mr Gusmao and his party are in the Speaker's gallery. I know I speak for everybody in welcoming him. [Applause] I did have the privilege of meeting Mr Gusmao and others, including Mr Ramos Horta, this morning. I had the opportunity, along with the foreign minister, to extend to him and the other members of his party not  only the good wishes of the Australian people but also the strong sense of sympathy felt across the whole spectrum of the Australian community for the cause of the East Timorese people in recent months. I told him that the depth of sympathy felt was quite spontaneous and that the level of violence and destruction which followed the independence vote had appalled the Australian community. He expressed his thanks to Australia for the part it had played in putting an end to that violence. They expressed very strong support for Australia's leadership role in the multinational force. He said that, in that process, Australia had also helped to give the people of East Timor a restored sense of self-confidence.We acknowledged in our discussion the difficult challenge of reconciliation and reconstruction that lies in front of the people of East Timor. I was encouraged by the fact that he and his colleagues are anxious to go about the task of establishing the infrastructure for a new community. I did indicate during the course of the discussion that it was difficult for somebody who is Prime Minister of a very stable, developed, cohesive and independent community to even begin to imagine the difficulties that lie ahead of the potential leaders of such a small and fragile community which has gone through the immense trauma that the people of East Timor have gone through in recent months.I have to say that I was impressed by the quiet sincerity and dignity of a man who understandably commands great affection from his people. That affection is readily apparent and it was easy to understand from what was my first meeting with Mr Gusmao. He was very conscious of the need for the East Timorese to prepare themselves, during the UN transitional period, for full independence. I said that Australia would provide very significant help, but we alone could not assist the building of the new East Timorese state. We needed the assistance of the international community. We discussed and agreed on the desirability of a future closer relationship not only East between Timor and Indonesia but also between our three nations. We will forever be together in this part of the world and it is important, notwithstanding the  difficulties and the trauma of the past few months - indeed, years in the case of the people of East Timor - that we remember that. It is valuable for all of us to understand at this difficult time that the three us will need to build a relationship with each other in different ways in the years that lie ahead.Mr Gusmao spoke of his hope that qualified East Timorese in Indonesia would return to East Timor to help build his new country. I think all of us recognise the very long and difficult journey that lies ahead of the people of East Timor. We hope for a vote of separation by the Indonesian parliament and we wish the leaders of the new country well. They not only have our respect for the heroic fight for freedom and independence they have undertaken but I am sure that they will have the practical support of the Australian people. As the meeting concluded, we agreed that - whatever differences might exist in language, culture, religion or other background - when you share common democratic values and a common commitment to personal liberty and freedom, there is a natural chemistry between people in nations. I think that will be the case between Australia and the future nation of East Timor.</DOC>

 - The Prime Minister has already made it clear that the government stands by the commitments it has made on vouchers. They are not part of the document that has been widely circulated. The document does not propose a voucher system. It is true that within the document there is an option which proposes government support for a wider range of students to receive the vouchers than currently receive them. I would have thought that would have been welcomed on all sides of the House as an option that the government ought to at least consider. I think we are facing here a sheer lack of comprehension by the member for Dobell of what is proposed within the paper. - We have had the opposition and its acolytes going around telling the Australian public that this submission slashes hundreds of millions of dollars from university funding. Of course, this is absolutely incorrect. It does not do that. - It is very obvious that, if one had a policy which provided a universal subsidy to all students - and of course all students do not presently receive a subsidy - that subsidy would be available to students at all institutions. This has nothing whatever to do with a voucher system. - I have answered that and I suggest to the Leader of the Opposition that, if he is having difficulty understanding the answer, he read the transcript and follow closely what I have said because he will find that I have completely answered that. We see the political confusion on the part of the opposition at the moment because they are now asking me to rule out a policy which provides additional support to Australian  students, but, of course, that is now where the Leader of the Opposition is. He has clearly completely lost touch with the sorts of proposals that come before cabinets and which serious governments will want to look at.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question, and make the point that Australia now has the historic opportunity to reform its business taxation system and a historic opportunity to make Australia a competitive place in world terms for building investment, business and more jobs. What the government has announced as a policy is a proposal which would reduce company tax rates from 36 per cent to 30 per cent. That would make the Australian tax rate, which is currently higher than the US, New Zealand and the UK, lower than the US, lower than New Zealand, on a par with the UK and one of the lowest tax regimes in this region.In addition to that, changes to capital gains tax would also make Australia internationally competitive. From December 2000, the United States will have capital gains tax rates of around 18 per cent. They are at 20 per cent now and the US is reducing them. Australia's top rate is 48 per cent, and we have the potential to reduce that to 24, with a low rate of 10 per cent. Even in the United Kingdom, the Blair Labour government is reducing capital gains taxes. Up on the Labor Party backbench there are followers of the third way, and of Mr Blair and Mr Brown, and no doubt they will have noticed that the Labour Party in the United Kingdom has no qualms at all about being internationally competitive in relation to lower capital gains tax rates. Perhaps we could have a column in the Financial Review on the third way of Labor supporting capital gains tax cuts in this country. We are currently having a visit by  the Secretary-General of the OECD to Australia. On PM last night he remarked:Australia's performance has been remarkably good.Peter Martin asked:What are we doing right?Answer:The reforms, the move to, if you like, budget fiscal consolidation.Martin:But did you really attribute Australia's economic success to those sort of government measures?Secretary-General:Well they are absolutely fundamental to it. You can't have this kind of economic performance without good governance.That is what the Secretary-General of the OECD said on PM  last night. Needless to say, all of those changes were opposed by the Australian Labor Party. In today's Financial Review  the OECD chief is quoted as supporting our tax changes. He said:Countries have to strike a balance between tax on capital, consumption and income. You have to strike a balance on how much the State will take without impinging on the economic paradigm . . . I think Australia's proposals are trying to achieve that balance.The OECD and the IMF have been urging Australia for years now to broaden our indirect tax base and introduce a GST - which, of course, was opposed by the Australian Labor Party hook, line and sinker. Australia will chair the OECD ministerial next year. That is recognition of our economic performance.Can you imagine a Labor minister going to the OECD and lecturing them on tax changes; telling the Blair government that they are wrong to have a value added tax; telling the French government that they are wrong to have a value added tax; telling the Swiss that they are wrong? Can you imagine a Labor minister at the OECD saying, `What you really need is a modern tax like a wholesale sales tax. We had a Mr Scullin in 1932 who thought one up'? Can you imagine a Beazley at the OECD saying, `Join us and Swaziland and Botswana with modern tax policy'? The Australian Labor Party is out of touch with all of the developed countries of the world, with the Clinton administration, with the Blair third  way. The Australian Labor Party find its intellectual succour in the tax regimes of Swaziland and Botswana, with all of the modernity that they can muscle up. The Australian Labor Party stands for nothing: it only stands against things.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Herbert for his question. He is a member who is deeply committed to improving educational opportunities in his area and I am pleased to say he has been greatly assisted in his task by the decisions of the government. Australia has a lot of trouble attracting doctors to work in rural areas. One problem has been that many city resident doctors are not attracted to country practice. If people come from the country to train to be doctors, then frequently those students do not return to practise in the rural areas. The government therefore has decided to provide funding for the development of a medical school at James Cook University and will be providing recurrent funding for a six-year medical course at the new medical school at James Cook University in Townsville. The sum of $9.6 million will be provided over the years 1999, 2000, 2002 and 2003. The government is also providing $10 million from the health portfolio for capital works conditional on receiving matching funding from the Queensland government.This course will have an annual intake of some 60 students with the first students commencing next year following accreditation for the course from the Australian Medical Council. In each year's intake 15 places will be earmarked for students from rural and remote areas and five for indigenous students. This measure is particularly important in advancing the goals of the government's policy for rural health and improving the medical services available to indigenous Australians. </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I recognise the interest that he has shown in this important issue and, indeed, in the broader issue of East Timor. It is true that there are some who have claimed that the Timor Gap Treaty has somehow been frozen by the Indonesians. I just want to let the House know that Indonesia has not suspended or frozen the Timor Gap Treaty. The allegation that it has somehow been frozen is an extrapolation from a report of the suspension by Indonesia of Navy patrols in the Timor Sea, as well as a joint naval exercise called New Horizon, which has absolutely no linkage whatever to the Timor Gap Treaty. In any case, we have had no official notification, I am told, of this reported decision.Mr Speaker, the fact is that the activities under the Timor Gap Treaty are exploration for and production of petroleum resources and those activities are still continuing and will continue, even when East Timor separates from Indonesia under the transitional arrange  ments that we are putting in place. Despite what some people are trying to claim, it is worth letting the House know this, that Phillips, the company which is the operator of the upstream petroleum production activities for the Bayu-Undan project, has confirmed to the government their support for the government's strategy.The government has obviously been very conscious of the need to develop a transitional strategy and we have been implementing that for some time. We have been talking with the Indonesians, including the Minister for Mines and Energy, Mr Kuntoro, who said to us not just in February but also last month that Indonesia would have no claim over the treaty area if East Timor became independent. Similar discussions have been taking place with UN representatives. As I explained earlier this week, once East Timor separates from Indonesia it will be administered in the short term by the United Nations and, therefore, under the principle of successor states, the Timor Gap Treaty will apply to a relationship between Australia and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor.So it is true, as some have said, that the stakes are high on this issue. The Bayu-Undan project involves an investment of about $2.1 billion, and that is why we on this side of the House are not running around trying to scare business or make unnecessary mischief between Australia and Indonesia. I would say this: the companies involved do not want anybody to do that; they want this matter to be managed in a responsible, calm and considered way. I do not think it advances the cause of our national interest for people like the member for Kingsford-Smith to try to make party political issues out of it, as he has done in the last 48 hours. It is the sort of issue that can get an opposition into trouble if they make party political issues out of it, as you know from your own experience now.</DOC>

 - Let me just take the member for Dobell through exactly what was said yesterday and what was said in the cabinet submission because, once again, we see an example of his complete incompetence. In the House yesterday the member for Dobell asked me whether -  -  - You might be interested to hear just how he mucked it up. He asked me whether I accepted the fact that there are `regional campuses whose very existence is now at risk as a result of' the government's policies. The draft cabinet document that has been circulated has no words of that kind in it whatever, and those were not the words that were read to the House just now by the member for Dobell. I responded to the suggestion that there were regional campuses whose very existence is now at risk by saying that was absolutely absurd, and I completely rejected it. It was absolutely absurd then, and I completely reject it again.</DOC>

 - I congratulate the honourable member on his close attention to local matters. I will, along with many other members from both sides of the House, be attending the celebrations this weekend in relation to the great Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme. It is fair to say that that scheme stirred the imagination of the Australian community in its phase of postwar reconstruction in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It features 16 major dams, seven power stations, 145 kilometres of tunnels and 80 kilometres of aqueducts. It cost - and this seems in today's dollars a remarkably small amount - $1 billion. If built today, of course, the cost would be much greater.The Snowy scheme made a significant contribution to the reshaping of the image of Australia as a nation built on post World War II migration, because the work force came from over 30 countries, most of them people affected by displacement in Europe during World War II. When Australians think of the Snowy scheme, we think of the massive contribution made by migrants from so many parts of Europe to the building of the assets of that scheme and the way in which they made, through that and through their later lives, an enormous contribution to modern Australia.More than anything else, at the weekend we will celebrate the contribution of those people from so many backgrounds to the building initially of postwar Australia and subsequently, in different ways, of modern Australia, which is such a credit to all of us and such an example of what can be achieved through tolerance, hard work, commitment and equality of opportunity. Indeed, Australia is seen around the world as a shining example of that.I am aware - as is my colleague Senator Minchin and the Deputy Prime Minister, in particular - of the difficulties and uncertainties that face some irrigators, particularly in the Riverina. I thank the member for Riverina. She and the member for Farrer, who asked me the question, have drawn attention to the concerns of their constituents. The issue of balancing the needs for water around irrigation, energy and environmental flows is a  perennial problem in a dry continent such as Australia.Although it has to be said that water management is in the remit of the governments of Victoria and New South Wales, the three governments concerned - because the federal government does have a role - have to work to try to find the right balance. Water is too important a resource for the Australian community to ever be the subject of partisan or interstate rivalry of a political kind. It is very important that I say that, whatever the outcome of other matters is, I do not want to see this issue get caught up in interstate rivalry between the governments of Victoria and New South Wales, whatever their political complexions may be.I understand that the Snowy Mountains Council has agreed to release an additional 300 gigalitres of water on commercial terms. Part of the commercial terms is the repayment of any volumes used by the recipients against their future allocations. I do ask that the New South Wales government is in future very sympathetic to possible impacts on regional communities from this water payback if water shortages persist in New South Wales. It is very important that that be said.The very livelihood of many of the rice growers of the Riverina depends upon the availability of water. I saw a group of these people yesterday afternoon, and they also saw the member for Farrer, the minister, the member for Riverina and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. This is an important issue and I ask the New South Wales government to treat these farmers fairly and decently. I ask the Victorian government and the New South Wales government - and, indeed, the Victorian opposition - not to allow this issue to be caught up in any kind of political crossfire. It is far too important for that. What matters is that the farmers of the Riverina get an adequate supply of water on fair terms. That is what matters, and that is what the federal government will pursue.</DOC>

 - It is clear that some further explanation is needed to put the member for Dobell straight. Let us take you carefully through what the cabinet submission said. In my last answer I gave you the question that I had responded to yesterday and I stand entirely by that. The cabinet submission now says:Already eight institutions appear to be operating at a deficit, and some regional campuses are at risk . . .That is, at risk of operating at a deficit. That is very different from the proposition that regional campuses have their very existence now at risk. The whole point of the submission is to make it clear that there are risks for institutions to manage. All managements manage for financial risk, and that is what regional universities have to do. That has got nothing to do with whether their campuses are at risk, and I totally stand by the answer I gave yesterday.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for New England for the question. He and I were discussing only an hour or so ago what needs to be done to address the social change that is causing concern in many parts of rural and regional Australia. He and I share a commitment with other members of the government to ensure that people who live in rural and regional Australia receive a fair share of our country's national growth and prosperity. One of the important things that we need to do in developing policies to ensure that country people have their needs adequately met is to better map the social changes, the demography, of regional and rural areas and to assess what sorts of environments are actually leading to the social change in rural and regional Australia.This morning I was delighted to launch a Social Atlas of Rural and Regional Australia which has been compiled by the Bureau of Rural Sciences. It is an excellent compilation of close on 100 maps of the social and demographic issues that are important in rural and regional Australia. For the first time it puts in an easy-to-read form information that rural communities need to assess their own prospects and opportunities and also that governments at local, state and federal level need to look at the sorts of areas to be targeted in developing appropriate responses to the issues.A number of interesting things came out of the atlas. Firstly, it is clear that, whilst there are many areas in rural and regional Australia that are suffering difficulties, there are others that are doing quite well. It is of interest, I am sure, to all members of the House to know that the population in regional Australia has  actually gone up at a faster rate than in metropolitan areas. However, most of that increase is in the coastal belt and not in the more remote parts. It is also interesting to note that unemployment has fallen substantially throughout rural and regional Australia during the term of this government. There are more women working in agriculture. Indeed, Australia is one of only three countries in the world where there has been an increase in employment in agriculture.Those sorts of things are very encouraging, but it is also true to say that a number of areas have been identified with particular difficulties. There are declines in income for farmers, particularly for those dealing with the broadacre crops, and in some of the traditional Australian agricultural industries; and we need to be addressing those sorts of issues. This atlas is a an excellent prelude to the rural summit which will be held next week, which will bring together people from around Australia to look at issues of significance to rural and regional Australia, address some of those social problems and find the answers to ensure that all Australians share in our national growth and prosperity. I am sure that the atlas will also help the new opposition spokesman on regional affairs to find where regional Australia actually is.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. This is National Asthma Week. It is running under the slogan: `Be asthma aware. Care for my air'. Asthma affects two million Australians - about one in four children, one in seven teenagers, one in ten adults. It is the most common reason a school-age child goes to hospital and it costs the community directly about $700 million a year.	 It is an inflammatory disease of the airways that leads to narrowing of the airways and mucus production - and we do not know the cause. About 700 Australians a year die from asthma, and it is believed that 60 per cent of these deaths have factors that are avoidable associated with it. One of those factors is passive smoking, which is the reason for the campaign this particular week. It is an extraordinary figure, but over 46,000 children have their asthma exacerbated by passive smoking by the parents. It is not simply enough if the parents even smoke outside. The fact is we can measure increased by-products of tobacco in the urine of children with asthma - even if their parents never smoke inside the house.The honourable member asked what we are doing about asthma. It is something we have made a particular priority. The first thing is that a couple of months ago I was able to persuade my state and territory colleagues to make asthma Australia's sixth national health goal and target. Secondly, while the opposition likes to make much out of organisations that do not receive funding, we have funded Asthma Australia for the first time ever to be a peak national organisation. In this year's budget we committed $8 million over three years to specific asthma programs.I am pleased to say we have been able to find a bit more money than we promised we would, and we are going to cover three main areas. We are going to provide education resources for people with asthma, because there is a very great capacity to improve  people's management of their asthma, and hopefully reduce the death rate from asthma. Secondly, we are going to get nationally consistent guidelines for general practitioners and hospitals so that we can get the best practice management of asthma. Finally, we are going to institute a national system for the collection and collation of data so that we can actually understand the burden of asthma better - we do not understand it all that well - and do something about it.Finally, I would like to congratulate Asthma Australia. They are doing a wonderful job. They have certainly made me proud that they are an organisation the government has been able to support and they are doing a great deal to help the burden of people with asthma.</DOC>

 - Far from university resources declining under this government, as a result of the actions of this government university revenues are now at an all-time high. In fact, universities today have some $700 million more in revenue than they had in 1995. This reflects the fact that the government has already taken action to assist the universities to address the pressures that all institutions are under these days - that is, pressures to adjust to growing demand, pressures to adjust to new technology. We have sought and continue to seek to put the university sector in the best possible position to respond to these pressures. We have provided funding for overenrolled students, which the Labor Party refused to do. We have provided $2,500 per overenrolled student, and this has encouraged  the universities to open their doors to tens of thousands of students who were locked out by the Labor Party's refusal to take action. We have provided the opportunity for universities to offer undergraduate places above the fully funded load for fees. There are now almost 2,000 of these students within the system.This government is conscious of the enormous importance that Australia places on the university sector. It is an important sector in terms of giving opportunity to Australians to make the most of their talent and abilities. It is a sector which provides opportunities to skill up Australia to meet international competition. It is a sector which is crucial to keeping Australia abreast of the very rapid advance in knowledge which is taking place. Every policy of this government has been designed to increase the university sector's access to resources and to improve access to qualified students.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Macquarie for his question, and I know how his and many of my other colleagues' constituents benefit significantly from this initiative. We have consistently said that, in the strategic approach to building a global financial centre, we would need to slowly build various initiatives, including regulatory reform, taxation reform and a stronger economy, and we would also need to develop a partnership between the private sector and the public sector and use the combined resources to help build a global financial centre in Australia.I am pleased to advise the House that we now have a chief executive for the financial centre task force, which is based in Sydney. The current Chief Executive Officer of the Sydney Futures Exchange, Mr Les Hosking, has agreed to take that position. It is quite a coup for us to get the services of Mr Hosking for our endeavours. For 15 years, Mr Hosking  has been the chief executive of the largest financial futures exchange in the Asia-Pacific region. It has an annual turnover of 30 million contracts worth around $A10.5 trillion each year. The Sydney Futures Exchange, with its global partnerships, is certainly developing into a major derivatives hub of the Asia-Pacific region. It has served well the needs of the Australian business community, particularly Australian farmers, with its financial products, particularly with its derivative products relating to wool and wheat.This is yet another step in our development of the financial services centre. We are determined to continue to build international relationships and strategic relationships between Australian exchanges and global exchanges and, importantly, to increase the level of employment in the financial services industry directly linked to the development of a global financial centre.</DOC>

 - Of course, the Leader of the Opposition is not accurately representing in any way whatsoever, once again, the proposals in the policy document that he has from the government. This indicates the Labor Party's complete incapacity to address the serious policy issues that deal with the higher education sector. I notice that a doorstop interview of the Leader of the Opposition this morning included this statement:There is active discouragement in all of this for Australians to have children.We have here a policy proposal which contains options to expand financial support. - I was directly addressing the issue that was raised by the Leader of the Opposition because, firstly, the Leader of the Opposition is trying to totally distort what is in this policy paper. It either suggests his incompetence or his deceit, but he is out there trying to tell people that the paper contains options that it does not contain. In the long run, one would have to say that this is not going to do him any good at all because he is going to be exposed to everybody who reads that paper as having totally misrepresented what is in it.I was drawing attention to the absurdity and ludicrous scare talk that the Leader of the Opposition is now engaged in. Instead of engaging in a serious policy debate, all he can do is spread this information and utter scare talk, which he hopes, presumably, will arouse the Labor students on campus even more so they will get out in the streets. This country is looking for a sensible debate on where the university sector and higher education in this country are to go. You are now fortunate to have in your hands a first-class set of policy options, which the government will be considering, and all you can do is distort and misrepresent it. The only person you have managed to discredit in the course of this foolish attack of yours is yourself.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for that question. I certainly do remember the interview on 3AW. The leader's question gives me the opportunity to expand on the theme that I developed during that interview. That is that the government stands by the commitments made in 1998, and before the last election, regarding the various pillars of our higher education policy. Cabinet discussed the matter this morning and I can inform the parliament, and through the parliament the Australian people, that support for those principles has been reaffirmed by the cabinet, by the government.I can also inform the House that we have no intention of introducing a loans scheme. I make it very clear that any attempt by the Australian Labor Party to run a scare campaign on the basis of a loans scheme or real rates of interest will fail because there will be no real rates of interest. Real rates of interest are something that belonged to your time in government - they were 18 or 20 per cent. That is when the rate of interest was really a real rate of interest. It was such a real rate of interest that it sent many small businessmen and Australian farmers to the wall.There are a number of challenges in the higher education area. One of those challenges relates to the rigidity of the industrial relations approach adopted within universities and the very negative attitude of many of the academic unions to industrial relations - attitudes that I might say are supported, encouraged and buttressed by the Australian Labor Party and particularly by the Leader of the Opposition. I would not be the least bit surprised if my colleague the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs has something further to say about that matter before the day is much older.I make it very clear that we will not be introducing a voucher system. We will be maintaining the principles of the HECS  system. There will not be any attempt by this government - through the back door, the front door or any other way of getting into this House - to replace the HECS system with a loans system. The bad news for the Leader of the Opposition is that he cannot run a scare campaign on this.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. The government has recognised the need within the university sector to consider salary increases for members of staff, but the government is very concerned at the extent to which the National Tertiary Education Union is seeking to impose pattern bargaining on the universities to maintain the existing rigidities that are hindering universities from adjusting to the needs and demands of students. The only ones who suffer from this are the students themselves. Innovative universities -  - The Central Queensland University is an example of a university which has made an agreement with staff that allows for summer schools, evening teaching and multiple locations and introduces flexibilities into their arrangements. The government has decided this morning to assist universities to make agreements which will serve their long-term interests and the long-term interests of their students and staff. To do this, the government will be making available some $259 million over three years for university salaries, on condition that the universities meet certain conditions in their enterprise bargaining rounds.The member for Hotham would naturally be listening very closely to this because he was unable to get any support for the universities for their enterprise bargaining rounds so he will remember this very well. This government recognises the issue that arises and is determined to see greater flexibilities introduced into the university sector. This grant will enable universities to offer a pay rise of an extra 2 per cent, in addition to other amounts they receive from normal indexation, their own revenue measures and productivity improvements, on condition that we see flexibilities introduced into the agreements made between the universities and their staff.This government totally rejects the scare campaigns which have been waged on the other side of the House. As the Prime Minister has made clear, the current HECS system is going to be maintained. The cabinet has also decided that the current levels and arrangements for tuition subsidies and the allocation of places between universities will also be maintained. So this reveals the emptiness of the campaign run by the Labor Party, and I believe universities will welcome the offer that has been made by the government to support the current salary round.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Sturt for his question. Members of the House will be pleased to know that, as  a result of the government's plan to give ordinary Australians an opportunity to take out shares in Telstra, around two-thirds of the offer has been allocated to retail investors and 87 per cent of retail applications received the shares that they requested in full. I think members of the House would want to pay tribute to the work of the Minister for Finance and Administration in overseeing this great privatisation initiative. The first instalment of $4.50 was paid on application, and a final instalment of $2.90 will be paid on 2 November 2000.I saw in the paper at the weekend numbers of young Australians talking about this exciting opportunity. The Sunday Age quoted Natalie Edwards of Glen Iris, 16 years of age, as saying:. . . I thought it would be a good investment to buy some this time as an investment for my future.Isn't that a great thing for a 16-year-old? Tim Masher, aged 20, a client services adviser, said:. . . I wanted to start a portfolio for the future and I thought they were the best one to start off with.Simon Wall, a university student from Mosman in Sydney, said:I'm doing it as a learning experience to find out how the sharemarket operates . . .  - Isn't it great to see young Australians starting to save? We hear the socialist left interjecting on this, but even the Leader of the Opposition today wished the float well. He said at a doorstop, `I wish the float well. I'm opposed to it, you know, but I wish it well.' With respect to all of the Telstra employees who have taken up shares, we also think that is a wonderful thing for investing in the future.As a result of this privatisation of Telstra, over 43 per cent of Australians own shares directly or indirectly, which is the highest level of share ownership in the world. With the government's capital gains tax changes, those 43 per cent of Australians will get a cut in the capital gains tax under the coalition. But, if the Labor Party had its way and blocked cuts in capital gains tax, the 43.3 per  cent of Australians who own shares in this country would be worse off.I say to those members of the Labor Party who went around after the last election saying that they had missed aspirational politics, do not miss the bus this time. Do not let the ACTU presidents get away with blocking capital gains tax cuts and say after the next election, `We missed the opportunity again.' Now is the opportunity to support the government on capital gains tax cuts - 43.3 per cent of Australians now own shares directly or indirectly, and 43.3 per cent of Australians stand to benefit under the government's far-reaching capital gains tax changes.In addition, the float of this 16 per cent equity will give another $16 billion to retire debt - $16 billion off the nation's debt. We can reach our goal of 10 per cent debt to GDP ratios by 2000-01. We can give Australians a stake in the future. We can cut the capital gains tax, and we can give this country the opportunity that it deserves.</DOC>

The really important point here is that the  coalition has put in place effective guidelines for the maintenance of services and for the universal service obligation. The question of who owns telecommunications services in this country really does not go to the central issue of the delivery of services and the maintenance of those services in rural and regional Australia. That is the real concern that we on this side of the parliament have, and we have addressed it. I do not believe that anything further needs to be added.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. Over most of the last four years now the government has achieved a great deal in terms of giving rural and regional Australia a better platform on which to proceed. The slashing of inflation, together with the fact that we now have interest rates at their lowest levels since the late 1960s and that transport reform, waterfront reform and so forth have all been implemented to a great degree in this country, means that rural and regional Australians have a far firmer foundation upon which to build a future than they had in the past.In addition to this, Mr Speaker, we have provided a very large number of tools - if I can use that term - for rural people to progress their future. Whether it is the $1½ billion that we have now allocated for the Natural Heritage Trust through to Agriculture-Advancing Australia and such innovative programs as Farm Family Restart, whether it is Networking the Nation, the social bonus, the hundreds of millions of dollars provided to help people in rural and regional areas access world-class telecommunications tech  nologies, or whether it is such innovative programs as rural transaction centres and putting face-to-face services back in the bush, the fact is that we have made very good progress.As I think all observant people in this House know, the challenges in rural and regional Australia are very real. They are driven by factors such as what now amounts to a full century of declining real prices for agricultural and mineral products, and the massive changes in technology resulting in huge changes in labour markets. Unlike urban areas of Australia and, indeed, other Western countries, the new jobs that are emerging have not been developed to the same degree in rural and regional areas.Next week 230 people, mainly from rural and regional areas across this country - plus a number of keynote and very specialist speakers from this and other countries - will assemble here for a summit to give their perspectives on tackling rural and regional challenges. The aims of that summit will be to develop a national appreciation of the challenges facing regional Australia and to deepen that appreciation; to gather ideas on how those challenges can be met; and to identify the roles that each of the partners play, including each level of government, the business and the community sectors as well as rural and regional Australians themselves. The themes of the workshops will include communications; infrastructure; health; community wellbeing and lifestyle; local, state and federal government; finance and facilitating entrepreneurship; value adding to regional communities and their industries; new industries and new opportunities; community and industry leadership; education and training; philanthropy and partnerships; and sustainable resource management.There will be a hotline operating from Wednesday of this week until the end of the summit. It is a solutions line for people in rural and regional Australia - and others for that matter - who may want to put forward innovative ideas. I would encourage people to consult with my office if they want to circularise those numbers in their electorates or whatever. This is about building the most effective partnership possible between this  government, which is sympathetic to the needs of rural and regional Australia, and the other players as we all seek to find innovative, forward looking solutions that maximise the potential of our existing industries and help us also attract as many as possible new sources of investment and jobs in rural, regional and remote Australia.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hume, who raises this very important issue of natural resource degradation and, in so doing, points to the only government that has ever devoted significant resources to addressing the issue. The Natural Heritage Trust, which is funded from some of the proceeds of the sale of Telstra, has enabled the most significant programs to address environmental degradation in the history of our nation. The sum of $1.25 billion was provided from the first sale of Telstra, and now another $250 million will be available as a result of the second tranche in the sale of Telstra.That will bring to $1.5 billion the amount of money that is available for this particular work. The extra $250 million will enable the continuation of funding for things like bush care, river care, land care, coast care, the Murray-Darling 2001 strategy and a host of other environmental programs which have touched almost every community in Australia, particularly those in rural electorates like the electorate of Hume.This money has also been put to very good effect in capital cities and in urban environments where there is so much work that also needs to be done to help improve our environment and ensure that we pass to future generations a country not damaged by our presence.There are particular concerns about dryland salinity. The Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council in its review of dryland salinity again addressed a number of issues that need to be considered by the government. On Friday this week I expect to release the Murray-Darling Basin Commission's salinity audit, which will cover that very significant part of Australia which produces a significant proportion of our national wealth and where salinity is a growing problem. That report will also help identify some of the issues but, more importantly, the solutions - solutions which simply would not have been possible under the previous Labor government's regime of talking about environmental issues but effectively doing nothing. This government has provided the funds through the Natural Heritage Trust - through the proceeds of the part sale of Telstra - and that has meant a real difference for Australia's environment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for drawing the attention of the House to the fact that there are 12 months to go before the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games in Sydney. That event will be bigger than the Commonwealth Games and is one of the largest sporting events after the Olympic Games. It tends to be a bit overshadowed by the Olympic Games, but let us not forget that ticket prices are very reasonable. It is going to be a magnificent event.Australia has some outstanding paralympian athletes, such as John Maclean from my own electorate, who has swum the English Channel and who has competed in the Hawaiian iron-man championships. He in fact completed that event within the able-bodied person's time, so he is also trialling for a position in the Paralympic Games. Many people in this House have athletes in their electorates who aspire to compete in the Paralympic Games.The federal government is right behind this event, making sure it is one of the best ever events that Australia has hosted and the very best ever event in the history of the Paralympic Games. In fact, our very own Tim Fischer, the member for Farrer, is the mayor of the Paralympic Village. In addition, we are contributing $5.5 million to assist in the team's preparation for the games and this is the most significant contribution ever to our paralympians. It will ensure a larger team than we had in the 1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games where Australia was second in the medal tally. At those games America, which finished first, had the home ground advantage. We are hoping to have the home ground advantage here in Australia by the federal government assisting over 40,000 Australian students right across Australia to come to the games and be involved in the Elite Athlete  Program. We are also providing $25 million to the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee to help meet the projected deficit from staging the games. They are an important event, and I am sure they enjoy the support of the entire House.</DOC>

 - The position is that we made undertakings. Those undertakings have been observed. Those undertakings will be observed. I know that the Leader of the Opposition is disappointed that he has not been able to get a bit more traction out of this issue. But the situation remains that the government went to the last election with certain commitments regarding the maintenance of the HECS system. That commitment remains. We went to the last election with certain commitments that we would not introduce HECS charges for TAFE courses. That commitment remains. We have no intention of introducing a loans scheme with a real or indeed any other rate of interest. That is not our policy.I would remind the parliament of what I said last week - that is, the number of people going to universities is at a record level under this government. Thanks to the guidance and the policies of the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs - a minister who brings to his portfolio a better understanding of these issues than any of his predecessors on the other side of the parliament - we have seen not only an enhancement of the number of opportunities for young Australians to go to university but also a renaissance in the apprenticeship and training system of this country. If ever there were a group of young Australians who were left for dead by the Australian Labor Party, it was those people who wanted blue-collar trades and apprenticeships. You left them for dead. You were meant to represent them in the parliament but, when it actually came to the allocation of the dollars and the policy vision, the sons and daughters of the working people of Australia were left for dead by the Australian Labor Party. The apprenticeship system and the traineeship system languished under Labor, and it has taken a coalition minister to revive the apprenticeship and traineeship system of this country. I pay a great compliment to the minister for the work that he has done in this area, as I do for the work that he has done in relation to tackling the problem of literacy and numeracy in Australian schools. We gave undertakings before the last election. Those undertakings remain. Those undertakings will be honoured in full.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Moore for his question. Members would be aware that of the 3,900 Kosovars who came to Australia fewer than 500 are expected to remain here after their current visas expire on 30 October. I have been visiting the remaining safe haven centres personally. I have been emphasising to the Kosovars the importance of considering their position at this time. It will be recalled by honourable members that they agreed to come to Australia at the request of the UNHCR on a temporary basis in order to ensure that others might not have been denied the opportunity to enter camps in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It was a prospect that the borders could have been closed. It was also a prospect of course that, if arrangements were other than temporary, one could say that ethnic cleansing had had a successful outcome for those who were implementing it.The UNHCR says now that Kosovo is sufficiently secure for most Kosovars to be able to return home. Hostilities have ceased and KFOR has established security, and basic services such as water and electricity have been restored to most areas in the region. It is obvious that Kosovars who are here should, if they were thinking of their own interests, take advantage of the winter reconstruction allowance that has been offered by Australia and which ceases on 30 October. That was $3,000 per adult and $500 per child.I have been asked what should happen at 30 October. It is my intention to renew the visas for one month and to review the matters thereafter on a regular basis. I will continue to discuss the situation with UNHCR, but one should not assume that these arrangements will go on. Of course, the legal situation is that, if people remain in Australia after visas have expired, there is an obligation upon my department to detain them and to remove them from Australia. I do not think anybody would want it to come to that situation, but you have to look at what the ultimate outcome would be if you are maintaining a temporary regime.There may be individual cases that warrant special consideration. I have never denied that. Each case would have to be considered on its merits. To date - and I emphasise that it is only to date - I have not seen any compelling reasons which I think would warrant a grant of refugee status. Those who have advanced reasons such as people having lost their homes or perhaps having little to return to should recognise that there are 23 million displaced people around the world, many of whom have lost their homes in earthquakes, storms and in other very difficult situations. The expectation is that the international community would seek to assist, as Australia has, with the rebuilding of people's homes in situations of safety and security.That is the situation that I have explained to the Kosovars - that it is not a question of if they return home but really a question of when. It is appropriate that the message be supported. One would not want to see people leaving in circumstances that do not recognise that this was a humanitarian gesture. But  those whose circumstances of safety and security enable them to return home should not be taking places that would otherwise be available through our refugee and humanitarian program, and that would be the result if we were to acquiesce to the request of those who simply find it too difficult at this time.</DOC>

 - I am aware of one or two of the regional universities in particular that have had a rough run in recent years. I do not think there is anything whatsoever to be gained by naming them in this place - I really do not. I am surprised that you would ask me to do that to those universities. Insofar as those regional universities are concerned, I simply say to you that with our interest in and concern for rural and regional Australia we will address the particular concerns of those in the budgetary and cabinet methodology in the normal way we would.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. I know that the member is involved with the joint committee that deals with immigration matters and has had a longstanding interest in the issue of visaing arrangements. The Electronic  Travel Authority, the ETA, is the most advanced and streamlined travel authority system in the world. It is a system by which electronically stored authorities to travel to Australia are issued. In 1998-99, something of the order of 2.3 million ETAs were issued to short-term tourist and business visitors, representing over 75 per cent of all visitor grants to Australia. Over five million have been issued to date.These arrangements were first introduced in September 1996, so they are of very recent origin. They were introduced for Singapore on that date, and they are now available to passport holders from 31 countries and locations. These include the majority of Australia's high volume, low risk tourist markets, including Singapore, the United States of America, Japan, the United Kingdom, western Europe, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia. It is important to recognise that the extension of the electronic travel authority is on the basis of economies being compliant markets - that is, that people come to Australia and that they observe the intentions stated in their visa arrangements. The electronic travel authority is a form of visa in that sense. It is not evidenced in a paper form - it is electronic - but it does fulfil many of the requirements that other countries operating visa fee arrangements see as being equivalent.In that context, it is a system which enables us to quickly check people's bona fides, particularly in relation to character issues. However, where there are other matters that ought to be addressed, it is still necessary in some places for people to apply for a paper visa in the normal way where additional inquiries can be undertaken. The governments of France, Spain, the United States of America, Japan and Korea have now extended visa waiver arrangements because they see the very significant advantages that come from the ETA system. It is a better system because it means that people arrive in Australia authorised to enter and do not face the sorts of problems that occur in some places where those inquiries are made when you actually arrive at the gate. That is what happens with visa waiver arrangements.I noticed that just last week another young Australian was being returned from the United Kingdom because they went with some references in their kit and the questions that we would ask at the time when the ETA is dealt with were being asked at the gate, and the passenger was turned back to Australia. For travellers coming to Australia, the electronic travel authority is a better system because it enables people to enter faster, but it also ensures the maintenance of effective border control for Australia where we can determine, in our own interests, who is able to come. We do so in the context of looking very much at people's bona fides - to determine where it will apply and where other arrangements might be more appropriate.</DOC>

 - I recollect a number of things and one of the things that I recollect most vividly, in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, is the decision that the government took this morning in cabinet. That decision, as I already outlined to the House - but I will take the opportunity of doing so again - is to maintain the existing arrangements. That means, in particular, a clear rejection of vouchers for post-secondary education, a clear rejection of the deregulation of university fees and any introduction of HECS for TAFE courses, the maintenance of the current level of tuition subsidies and HECS exemption arrangements, the retention of the current processes for agreeing to the number of government funded places and the retention of the prohibition on charging fees for HECS liable places.They are the arrangements that underpin the existing system and that guarantee the realisation of the aspiration of middle Australia for  their children to be educated in universities. That has been, and remains, the commitment of this government. We are a government that believes in affordable tertiary education for Australian children. We are also a government that believes in giving parental choice in relation to secondary education -  - This is a government that remains very committed in the provision of quality education to Australian children at all levels: primary, secondary and tertiary. That is why we committed ourselves to such strong support for literacy and numeracy. One of the issues that has been identified in this debate - by the vice-chancellors, the minister and all those who have carefully followed the debate - is the problem of salary arrangements within universities. The Leader of the Opposition has obviously read the transcript of my interview with Neil Mitchell. He will be aware that I made the observation in that interview that I thought, judging by community standards and given the sorts of responsibilities that academics had, there was an argument to say that many academic staff in Australia were not as well remunerated as they might have been. I have said that before - and I do not in any way walk away from saying it - but I would say to the universities and the vice-chancellors that there is a  quid pro quo in that. If you want greater salary justice, you have to reform your industrial relations system. You cannot, on the one hand, say, `We want greater salary justice for academics; we want our professors and senior lecturers -  -  - to be paid according to the responsibility they carry,' but still continue to embrace Neanderthal industrial relations practices, to allow yourselves to become the victims of pattern bargaining, to maintain some outdated notions and to reject Australian workplace arrangements - in other words, to hang on to an old-fashioned industrial relations system that you expect the federal Treasury to underwrite. The essence of what the minister has announced today is, `Yes, we are prepared to give financial help to the universities in relation to their salary problem but only if they are prepared to put their industrial relations house in order.' The ball is in their court. If they fix the industrial relations, we will make the additional money that Dr Kemp indicated available.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question, for her concern for job seekers in her electorate and for the rather arduous journey she recently took me on to visit them. I am pleased to let the House  know how technology is helping job seekers thanks to the efforts of my department. Three years ago, a visitor to an office of the old Commonwealth Employment Service would have been confronted by an array of noticeboards advertising perhaps 200 or 300 local jobs. Today, any visitor to Centrelink has access to over 60,000 jobs around the nation, thanks to the Australian Job Search database produced by my department. Through a network of 2,000 touch screens in Centrelink offices and over 500 touch screens in Job Network member offices, job seekers have access to a national database which is now three times larger than anything ever available from the old CES. I am advised that every day there are 400,000 job searches through these touch screens. This site is also available through the Internet, and I am advised that every day there are 100,000 job searches through the Net. I am further advised that jobsearch.gov.au is the most visited employment site in Australia, and I am further told by the excellent Bulletin magazine that, on the 16th day of last month, the departmental Job Search site was the eighth most visited Australian site overall.What began as an electronic noticeboard has now become a virtual labour market. In March, the government introduced a lodge-a-job facility enabling employers to lodge vacancies directly on the Net. In August, the government launched a lodge-a-resume facility enabling job seekers to put their details directly on the Net without any intermediary and enabling employers to search these resumes without any intermediary. All these services are absolutely free. Thanks to these technological innovations, job seekers can make themselves known to potential employers anywhere in the world and employers have immediate electronic access to a national pool of talent. The government is not going to stop there. I am advised that, early in the new year, we will be giving job seekers access to future job trends on the Net. I would like to congratulate my department for their constantly innovative approach to getting more jobs for more Australians. </DOC>

 - I would be happy to tell the member for Hinkler and indeed the House something about the government's campaign to ensure that all Australians, including farmers, are aware of the processes that will be involved in the introduction of the new tax system so that they are familiar with the new GST arrangements and are able to take advantage of the new tax system and all that it offers. The government will be spending around $15 million over the next year to support farm organisations to deliver tax system information to farmers. Around 150,000 copies of this information booklet are being distributed to farmers so that they have the basic information they need to prepare for the introduction of the new system on 1 July next year. This booklet will tell them about how to register, details about which products are GST free, which ones are input taxed, information about the new tax system and the new diesel  fuel rebate arrangements - the sorts of things that farmers will need to plan their businesses for the new tax system. In addition, there will be a detailed reference book, audio tapes, a video, CD-ROMs and even materials on an Internet site, all to be made available over the next few weeks.Industry specific seminars have already begun in Tasmania, and in Victoria there was a state-wide satellite hook-up last week which I understand involved over 4,000 farmers. The Queensland Farmers Federation will be coordinating this campaign in Queensland, and similar organisations in other states will take responsibility for ensuring that the information is available to farmers so that they can plan early for the new tax system. May I take this opportunity to encourage farmers and indeed others in the community not to just put aside the need to plan for the new tax system. I know it is still some months to 1 July, but it will not be good enough to start making plans on the eve of that day for how the new system will work. I would encourage farmers, even though I know they are very busy and they have lots of other things on their minds, to take the time to attend some of these seminars so that they can plan early and be ready for when the new tax system arrives on 1 July.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition asked a very similar question to this yesterday, so I am very happy to repeat the substance of what I said yesterday. In so doing, I do not accept uncritically the interpretation that the Leader of the Opposition has put on discussions that may have taken place in cabinet. As the Leader of the Opposition will know from the years that he was in government, what matters are the decisions that cabinets take. We have taken a decision yesterday that was reported to this parliament, and I think widely welcomed throughout the Australian community, to maintain the existing higher education system. We have no intention of deregulating university fees. We have no intention of altering the current HECS arrangement.I say to the parents of Australian children aspiring to go to university that under the current government more young Australians have won places in universities than ever before; under this government more young Australians have won apprenticeships and traineeships than ever before; and under this  government more young Australians have won jobs than ever before. Since we were elected in 1996 more than 520,000 Australians have gained jobs. On top of that, as my colleague the Treasurer reminds me, more young Australians have been able to afford to buy a home under this government because, through our wise policies, our frugal policies, our elimination of the Beazley $10½ billion deficit, we have been able to reduce interest rates. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: the government has firmly ruled out any departure from the commitments I made to the Australian people and which were repeated by Dr Kemp before the election last year. That remains the policy. It will be the policy. It is a policy widely supported within the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Pearce for her interest in small business and for her question. Australia moves to a new tax system on 1 July of next year. In addition to that, on Thursday of this week the government will be introducing the first bills to implement a new business tax system as well - bills which will reduce corporate tax rates, change depreciation schedules and introduce simplification and reduction in capital gains taxes. It is apparent that, as we move towards the new tax system for the new century, this is going to involve additional measures by the government to explain how the tax system operates. From November of this year, businesses will be applying for and getting the Australian business number. The Tax Commissioner has announced that in order to help with the first three quarterly returns under the new tax system there will be extended periods for lodgement - that is, for the first quarterly return there will be an extended period of three weeks, for the second it will be two weeks, and for the third the extension will be  one week - to give tax agents additional time to get those quarterly returns in.The government has already announced that there will be major income tax concessions for businesses that get new software. In addition to that, tax agents are going to be provided with basic business software by the tax office to give free to their small business clients. On a recommendation of the board for the new tax system, the government has lifted the threshold for cash accounting to $1 million and the government has now signed contracts amounting to over $55 million in funding to give to peak bodies to explain the new tax system. The government has funded a GST Business Assist help line being run by the Australian Society of CPAs. In addition, the government has set up a tax reform web site to provide up-to-date information for small business. The web site got 2.5 million hits in August and 3.4 million in the month of September. Australia's biggest seminar program ever is being conducted to explain the new tax system and, so far, over 137,000 registrations have occurred.As part of the new tax system, Australians will be getting income tax cuts on 1 July, family benefits will be increasing, there will be new Commonwealth-state financial arrangements and we will be taking the opportunity to get rid of some of the indirect taxes which have been holding Australia's business sector back. That is the new taxation system that starts on 1 July. On Thursday of this week, we begin the story of the new business taxation system for Australia - a tax system which will take Australia into the next century and make it a strong economy, creating jobs that this nation really needs for the young people of tomorrow.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Sturt for his question. When the government was originally elected in 1996, we promised less red tape for business, leading to more jobs and more investment. The Treasurer announced in 1996 the beginning of a significant corporate law reform program, and I am pleased to advise the House that last night the Senate passed the first part of that program. It is a significant win for 1.1 million Australian companies and particularly for 950,000 Australian small businesses. It has put in place an incentive for business to take calculated and well-informed risks. It delivers better director accountability through the safe harbour provisions which we have put in place. It has improved shareholders' rights. Importantly, it has given small business the opportunity to access capital in a far more efficient manner. It is far cheaper now, with this corporate law reform program, for small business to raise capital to develop their ideas and to deliver on their ambitions.The two key areas of reform which passed through last night mean that we have got business, and not just the accountants, having a say about Australian accounting standards; and we have got business, and not just the lawyers, having a say about Australian takeovers. It is not often that I quote the Australian Financial Review -  -  - I am resisting the urgings of my colleagues. The editorial of the Australian Financial Review  said:CLERP: reason for applause.The GST and business tax changes have grabbed the headlines, but an equally important plank of the government's reform agenda corporate law reform . . .  - It is the Australian Financial Review . They go on to say:It is crucial. If the government is serious about making Australia a global financial markets player, unnecessary regulation is as big an impediment for offshore companies that want to invest in Australia as tax rates. Similarly, transparency and accountability is crucial for a fair and efficient investment market.This delivers jobs and investment in Australians and Australian ideas. I would like to particularly thank the Australian Democrats for their support of this bill. The Australian Democrats were prepared to talk and negotiate on this bill. It defies logic that the Labor Party would choose to oppose this bill and the principles behind it at every point. Every political bone in your body would make you wonder why the Labor Party would oppose it. How many votes would they have picked up in the seat of Lindsay, Herbert or Petrie because they opposed CLERP? The professional opposition opposes IR reform that delivers more than half a million jobs; it opposes tax reform that delivers more than half a million jobs, the privatisation of Telstra, and budget reform that delivers more than half a million jobs for Australians. The Labor Party has also opposed us on corporate law reform which delivers for small Australian businesses.But the good news for the Labor Party is this: they have entered the second chance draw. On IR, Telstra, budgetary reform, taxation and corporate law reform, there are second tranches coming along, and you have the chance to oppose them again. Our initiatives are delivering jobs for Australians, particularly young Australians. This is another  step forward. Why would Labor continue to oppose it?</DOC>

There is much more information to support the view that there is likely backdating and that there were contracts that were non-binding that have been portrayed as binding.

 - I have released, on behalf of the government, a discussion paper on registered organisations. This covers both unions and employer bodies, and it follows on a couple of reports that we have had in the last couple of years. I think the response has been reasonably positive, but it is interesting that, as usual, the Labor Party is completely opposed to reform. Even in the area of workplace relations and, on the face of it, on the ACTU's estimate, real wage increases for low income people of over nine per cent, even in the face of that clear evidence and the further jobs that have been created, Labor is completely opposed to reform. In this area the proposals are straightforward proposals to ensure the accountability, the transparency, of  the operation of both employer bodies and union bodies.It is a nonsense for the Labor Party just to say, `Oh, no, we're completely opposed to sensible reforms.' The fact is that many unions have been losing members, and I believe there are union officials who think sensible reform is the way to go. It is however interesting also that, in line with this very negative approach from the Labor Party, and certainly also members of various trade unions, we now have revealed to us - and I want to thank the member of the House who provided me with this material - the latest desperate tactic by some trade unions to work with the parliamentary party on the other side to gain further membership. In particular - and I will table the document without the name of the addressee; it is a letter from the Transport Workers Union and it is in conjunction with the Labour Council of New South Wales - it contains a proposal to federal Labor MPs and state Labor MPs that, as a means of boosting the flagging numbers of the trade union movement, these MPs use their parliamentary offices as new outposts and branches for these unions that cannot attract members. They want to use parliamentary staff and they want to use electorate offices. They want electorate offices of members of parliament to be used as referral points for constituents to be sent off to some trade union `if you have got a problem'.</DOC>

 - I have not changed my answer. The fact is I have never conceded that there was a budget leak, because I have been provided with no information to say that that has happened. What I said was that I could not say that it did not happen. It is quite different. The fact is I believe the majority of cases will be shown by being backdated or by being non-binding contracts that were shown to be binding. It would stand logically that, if you had to backdate a contract you could not have known about it, and if you had to have a binding contract, or non-binding contract that you portrayed to be binding, you could not have known about it either. So my answers are absolutely consistent. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for McPherson for her question. I am sure all members of the House would be aware that the East Timorese people are currently dealing with a widespread humanitarian crisis. Thousands of East Timorese are hungry, sick and displaced, property and infrastructure have been destroyed and the most basic of services that we take for granted in this country just do not exist. Just as Australia was well prepared to make a contribution to  INTERFET, we also need to be well prepared to make a contribution to the international effort to rebuild East Timor. To help the Australian government monitor the situation and ensure the effective delivery of Australian aid, we have located an AusAID officer in Dili. Next week, I understand, the United Nations will be embarking on a major exercise to coordinate the restoration of these services, and a World Bank team will be visiting East Timor to assess the situation there.Based on Australia's expertise in the field of multilateral procurement, our strong record of development assistance to East Timor and our proximity to the territory, the government believes that Australia and Australian companies are in a position to make an important contribution in this task. This morning I convened a forum in Canberra to provide potential Australian suppliers with a comprehensive overview of the reconstruction requirements and how they can contribute to the vital task of rebuilding East Timor. Over 450 representatives from Australian business and government agencies participated in the forum - and I should note that the member for the Northern Territory was also in attendance. Speakers at that forum this morning giving information about how the international process will work included representatives from AusAID, Austrade, the United Nations, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Northern Territory government.There is a very serious and difficult task in front of the international community to rebuild and reconstruct East Timor, and Australia obviously will need to play a vital role in that. It was pleasing to see the commitment from the business community today to understand how the process will work under the auspices of the United Nations.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes, whose electorate covers one-third of New South Wales. I am certainly very pleased to advise the member for Parkes that the Broken Hill Centrelink office earlier this year had a major refurbishment and is now a very modern open-plan office. I do acknowledge that the Broken Hill Mayor, Ron Page, and his delegation are with us today and would certainly know that office. The Broken Hill office is an important office because it provides a visiting service and agent to Wilcannia and also an agent to Menindee - Wilcannia, which is 200 kilometres from Broken Hill with a very large indigenous community; and Menindee, which is 120 kilometres from Broken Hill. There, a service is provided through a community agent every day to those people in remote Australia.The government is committed to improving Centrelink services. This is a far cry from the dark old days of the DSS, particularly when the opposition was in government. What we want to see now is that, when people go to a Centrelink office, those offices are open, bright and breezy and they have very good customer service. - The opposition interjects, but the interesting thing with Centrelink today is that at least it is open five days a week. Under the old DSS, if you went there on a  Wednesday afternoon at 1.30, the door was shut, it was not open. Centrelink today is open five days a week. In the old days of the Labor Party, you could not even make an appointment. Now you can make an appointment with Centrelink; if it is an urgent appointment, you can make it on the day. In the old days of the Australian Labor Party, you would have to wait in long queues to get into the DSS. Those queues now are minimised. Centrelink customers now have choice; they have a choice of what day to receive their pay. They did not have any choice under the old ALP regime. They did not have personalised service; today they do have personalised service, with one-to-one contact, and you do not have to keep repeating your story - like I have to keep repeating it to the opposition so they will learn. These are the improvements that Centrelink is making across the country.Importantly, in rural and regional Australia there are more services now: 260 rural agents and 140 visiting services, with options to video conference, et cetera. These did not exist under the Australian Labor Party. Likewise, in the early 1990s there were hardly any telecentres or call centres. Now there are 23, and two more will be opening shortly. Over 13 of those, just under half, are in regional Australia. What is more, we actually have a customer charter. You did not have a customer charter before with Centrelink. What this is all about is providing the best possible service - I know the member for Lilley is listening; he may learn something - to Australians. But I recognise that we will always continue to review Centrelink for its six million customers to ensure that it provides the best possible service to the community and to the Australian taxpayer.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I note her abiding interest in artistic matters. No previous government or Prime Minister has devoted itself to the cause of raising social and cultural philanthropy as this government has. Earlier this year there was a radical change in the taxation system which brought our capital gains tax and tax deductibility regime to world's best practice so that there is simply no excuse for any private individual or the corporate sector to claim taxation disincentives - something that this government did that was sadly neglected under 13 years of Labor.At the same time we are working to revolutionise private support for the cultural and arts sectors through the Australia Foundation for Culture and the Humanities. We have worked with the foundation to develop two tools for business and private individuals: the first is the cultural products menu, and the second is the business case for cultural investment. They were launched last week in Melbourne at the foundation's successful conference `Partnerships: the business case for sponsoring arts and culture'. These two tools will help both business and the cultural sector to work together to understand and to develop the commercial benefit to businesses by supporting the arts.The cultural products menu is an Internet based register of arts and cultural products that are available for business sponsorship or donation. It contains details of more than 120 arts projects from around Australia, making it easier for businesses to locate these projects  or organisations which will match their commercial and social objectives. The second tool is the business case study guide which shows companies how to plan, develop and evaluate successful partnerships with the arts. It shows how a strategic cultural investment can deliver measurable commercial benefits and returns for shareholders, including corporate legitimacy, market advantages and employee benefits.Together with the outgoing Chairperson of the Australia Foundation for Culture and the Humanities, Mr Richard Pratt, to whom I wish to pay special tribute for his energy and devotion to the cause of cultural philanthropy over the last few years, we will be going to different states to further the work of the Australia foundation and the government's commitment to cultural and social philanthropy.</DOC>

I took advice from my department and wrote to the Auditor-General on the basis of advice from my department. As to a royal commission, you would have to provide some advice of wrongdoing. Other than the backdating and the contracts that were non-binding and that have been passed off as binding, which is a scam, you have provided no evidence of wrongdoing whatsoever. </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. It gives me the opportunity to talk about the coming tender round for the Work for the Dole program. As the House would know, the government is expanding Work for the Dole from a 25,000 places a year program in the last financial year to a 50,000 places a year program in the coming financial year and, as part of this expansion, we are moving from a `one sponsor, one project' model to a brokered model that will enable more community groups to be involved. We are trying to get larger, shorter, smaller and more varied projects. In other words, we are trying to get a more varied range of projects available to participants and a wider range of work experience available to job seekers.Two weeks ago, tenders closed for the next round of Work for the Dole applications. The government was seeking 67,000 places at about $2,000 a place. I am pleased to tell the House that we have received bids for 283,000 places at prices within the government's expected range. When this program began there was some concern about the capacity of the community sector to provide enough places. The overwhelming response to this tender demonstrates growing community  acceptance of this program, which is not only a question of mutual obligation but also a question of restoring the social contract of bringing potentially alienated people back into the mainstream of society. When Work for the Dole began, it was strongly opposed by the Australian Labor Party, and it would be fair to say that the ALP is still opposed to some aspects of the program. But it is important to give credit where it is due. Some time ago, the former shadow minister for employment began to encourage community groups to participate in the program in the national interest and in the interests of job seekers. I am very pleased to tell the House that a significant number of large charitable organisations have bid to participate in Work for the Dole for the first time. For the first time, they are coming into this great program. I welcome the former shadow minister's contribution on this subject, and I trust that the new shadow minister for employment will be equally constructive.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. In Hansard  of 11 February 1999, I am recorded as tabling advice from the Health Insurance Commission, which stated:The Health Insurance Act 1973 contains secrecy provisions which preclude the release of information about individual cases. Furthermore, it has not been the practice of successive Health Ministers to interfere in the action of the HIC with respect to individual providers. This practice is a sound one and there is no basis for an exception being made in this case.That was the advice that I was given by the Health Insurance Commission on that day in February. That advice has not changed.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question. As the Prime Minister mentioned last week, we were celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme and the very significant contribution that it has made to Australia. It is recognised as one of the greatest engineering projects in the world and rated as one of the seven civil engineering wonders of the world by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Prime Minister and other members attended a number of those 50th anniversary events. I had the opportunity on Saturday, with the member for Eden-Monaro, of being able to attend the citizenship event that took place. It was a very moving occasion because it brought together many who had migrated to Australia and who had played a significant part in the building of the Snowy Mountains scheme. I am gratified by the very significant contribution that so many of those people who participated have made. I even note that another of our colleagues, the member for Sydney, was there because of her own parents' involvement with the scheme in those early years.The contribution this scheme has made to the growth and development of Australia's economy has been well acknowledged, but I also want to acknowledge the fact that many have argued the scheme was the birthplace of Australia's multicultural policies and programs. The workers in that scheme came from something in the order of 30 different countries. Fifty years ago, 100,000 of them made a very significant contribution to this nation.My department, through the Living in Harmony initiative and through the celebration of 50 years of Australian citizenship, was able to support the event that took place in Cooma Park where those who had migrated at that time and had not yet taken out Austral  ian citizenship - and some of their descendants - were able to do so. But, more impressively, some 4,000 Australians who had taken out citizenship or who had obtained citizenship through birth took the opportunity to affirm their commitment to Australia through the affirmation ceremony that we also conducted.During this 50th year of Australian citizenship, I have been particularly impressed with the enthusiasm with which Australians have embraced their identity as Australians and the fact that this brings together people from so many different cultural backgrounds in a unifying way to pledge themselves to this nation and its future. The affirmation ceremonies, which provide a unique opportunity for Australians to be able to affirm their commitment, have been an innovation. I have been pleased to see them so warmly supported and so enthusiastically participated in.</DOC>

 - A new circumstance has arisen from the Labor Party's clear commitment to continuing with their amendments to the regional forest agreements legislation, which was evidenced by their calling of a division in this place the other day. The problem that arises is that a large number of regional forest agreements have been signed and some are very close to signing. In each case, were they suddenly to become legally subject to a disallowance motion in the Senate, they would have no standing in terms of the provision that they create whereby woodchip companies no longer have to get export licences for the areas covered by those regional forest agreements. The fact that they had no standing would automatically mean that each and every one of them could not claim to not need an export licence until the Senate had dealt with these matters.The problem there is that most of these companies have contracts. If there were any effect on those contracts, the importing countries would be laughing their heads off. There is an oversupply of woodchips in the world at the moment. Some are sourced from countries that do not have the standards of forest management that exist here in Australia. Once our high value contracts were broken - as they would be by the failure to deliver - the countries that import would not even need to come back. I point out that the company of Midway operates out of the port of Geelong and does its chipping in Geelong. Boral does so out of the port of Newcastle. They create jobs in those cities as well as creating opportunities to work for people further out in the regional centres. There is, of course, another export out of the port of Eden by Harris Daishowa. All of the RFAs signed associated with those particular companies would be affected if the government were to accept Labor's amendments to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 1998 . The reality is that at the moment those particular RFAs have standing, but as of 31 December of this year any woodchip must be sourced from a region covered by an RFA. It must be obvious to all present that, if this legislation  were still pending but had been accepted and amended in the way the Labor Party proposes, we would have a situation where none of those companies would be able to export woodchips at all.There is a further problem, and that relates to Tasmania and some parts of Victoria that the Labor Party claim are exempt from these particular amendments for disallowance. That is, of course, a question that cannot be answered because there are constitutional issues. Companies, in Tasmania in particular, would confront the situation of not knowing how the law applied to them and, as a consequence, would probably also, awaiting its clarification, stop exporting, lose contracts and put all the people out of work. That is what the Labor Party propose with these amendments. It will be total confusion. They know it. We have written to them. We will see just what the senators from Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania do about their own constituency when confronted with this issue tomorrow. We will see what the member for McMillan wants to do too. They obviously have no power in their own caucus, so they had better demonstrate some in the parliament.</DOC>

I am not aware of Dr Meikle actually having organised any function for me. Any money that has been raised has been raised in accordance with the Liberal Party's fundraising guidelines and has been properly disclosed. There is absolutely nothing improper about that.Just to go back to the previous question, I was first told that there was likely to be a supply measure in the budget on 5 May 1998, and I was aware of the commercially sensitive nature of that. I do not believe that I spoke to any radiologist, directly or indirectly, other than my one meeting with the College of Radiologists between my first being informed on 5 May and its being announced on budget night.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I received some advice just before question time from the Health Insurance Commission. When I finish with it, I will be happy to table it for the benefit of honourable members. The Health Insurance Commission tells me that it has completed investigation into 29 MRI units. One matter has already gone to the Director of Public Prosecutions. A further 15 are to be cleared for referral to the DPP over the next two weeks on the basis of backdating or conditional nature of contracts. Thus, with over 50 per cent of the contracts examined, there has actually been found sufficient evidence to warrant referral to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Of the remaining 13 contracts, only six have been cleared and seven are expected to be cleared. With some of these there may be a degree of suspicion, but not enough to warrant referral to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I am happy to table this document for the benefit of honourable members.</DOC>

 - I have been waiting for a question from the opposition on the Productivity Commission for some time. Obviously you have not wanted to know the information, otherwise you would have asked earlier. -  - Let me say that unlike the Labor Party, who commissioned the Gregory report into the need for capital funding and never responded to it ever, this government is responding to the Productivity Commission report which was commissioned by this government prior to the last election, delivered to the Treasurer and subsequently published on 31 March. Since that date, we have been consulting with the industry - and I might say two important discussions took place on Monday of this week - regarding aspects of that report so that when there is a published response, which I would remind the Labor Party they never did to the Gregory report, it will be one that has been thoroughly researched and consulted on.Let me say in the interim that one of the things mentioned in that report is the question of so-called coalescence, which is bringing to a national rate the subsidy that is paid for nursing homes, as they were called. The fact is this is yet another matter that we are having to fix up after the Labor Party, which funded every state at a different rate on the basis that it cost a different amount of money to run a facility in different states. This government decided that it was better to come to a nation  al rate, as was done for hostels, and indeed the Productivity Commission has agreed with that proposition. How one achieves the national average rate is the point that is under discussion.I simply say that in the period since the commission brought down that report this government has increased funding to residential aged care facilities. In the case of Queensland, since 1995-96 - which is your last budget - we have increased funding to that state by 58 per cent. In other words, an enormous amount of additional money has gone in through the resident classification scale, which is delivering more money to all providers right across Australia. In your last budget you spent $2.5 billion, and in our last budget we are spending $3.5 billion - an increase of $1 billion into the residential aged care sector. That is commendable by anybody's yardstick.A lot of that money has been put in since the report of the Productivity Commission. Nonetheless, we take seriously the matters raised in that report. We are consulting with industry; we are consulting with consumers. When the response comes down, it will not be an ad hoc response but properly researched and meeting the needs of the aged care community.</DOC>

 - As I am sure all honourable members are aware, last night the Indonesian People's Consultative Assembly took a decision which effectively grants independence to the people of East Timor. It is a very important moment in the history of that country. It is a decision that will be widely welcomed throughout the world. It gives effect to the popular will of the people of East Timor. It will begin a new era in relations between the people of that territory and the people of what will soon be to them the rest of what used to be the same country; that is, Indonesia. The House will be aware of the backdrop against which this decision was taken. They will be aware of the leadership played by Australia in assembling a multinational force. They will be aware of the tragic circumstances in East Timor that led to the need for the assembly of that force. What we must now all do is look to the future. When Xanana Gusmao met me last week I indicated to him that, despite the difficulties that would be involved in the process of reconciliation and moving forward together, it was desirable that East Timor see its future as lying in a closer relationship with the people of Indonesia. East Timor in the near future - a small, fragile, highly vulnerable but nonetheless free country - will need the help of Australia; East Timor will need the help of the rest of the world; and East Timor, Indonesia and Australia, forever together in this part of the world, will need to work out a way of cooperating together into the future.I believe that the decision taken by the Indonesian constituent assembly will make a positive contribution towards improving relations between Australia and Indonesia. It is inevitable that those relationships are strained at present because of Australia's proper role in East Timor. It is equally important and also inevitable in our own interests that we try to rebuild our relationship with Indonesia on a proper basis of mutual respect. I believe that, as the irritant of East Timor begins to recede into the past so far as the relationship between our two countries are concerned, we can start to build a better relationship with Indonesia. But it will be a different relationship. It will be a relationship instructed by the circumstances of our involvement in East Timor. It will be a relationship instructed and conditioned by the fact that Indonesia is now historically in the process of embracing democracy. As we meet in this question time, the same People's Consultative Assembly could well be voting on who will be the next president of that country, and whoever wins that ballot will be a person with whom the government I lead will seek to cooperate. That person will be installed as president as a result of a democratic process.Whatever criticism may have been offered of Indonesia's conduct in recent times, it is a remarkable thing that a country of 211 million people, that has passed through many decades of authoritarian rule, should have embraced democracy. We should, as friends and neighbours, do all we can to facilitate the entrenchment of the democratic process in Indonesia.I also take the opportunity of saying that Dr Habibie, the current President of Indonesia, is not a candidate for election as the next president of Indonesia. He has had his critics around the world, and he has had his critics within Indonesia, but it would be unfair and churlish of this House not to record the fact that it was Dr Habibie's decision which led to the ballot being held in East Timor that led to the people of East Timor voting for independence. For that, he does deserve acknowledgment and respect. He also deserves acknowledgment and respect for the fact that, after taking over from his predecessor, President Suharto, he did take Indonesia down a democratic path. It is very easy in retrospect to say that he had no alternative. It is even easier in retrospect to turn around and say, `Well, he shouldn't have done this, or he should have done it at another time.' The reality is that he did two very important things for which he will forever be entitled to credit - he gave the people of East Timor a vote on their future which their leader, Xanana Gusmao, said they would readily embrace, no matter what the pain and travail, and he also gave to the people of Indonesia the opportunity to embrace democracy.At a time when in other parts of the region nations are unfortunately turning away from democracy, it is a very welcome trend indeed that Indonesia should be embracing it. All of us, whatever our politics and whatever our views about the minutiae of the debate on East Timor, who care about a close relationship between Australia and Indonesia based on mutual respect will hope that the democratic experiment succeeds. We will wish the new Indonesian President well, and it will be the obligation of this government and future governments of this country to work closely with the people and the government of Indonesia on a proper basis of mutual respect but,  nonetheless, recognising that we have a destiny together forever in this part of the world.</DOC>

 - I am delighted that the honourable member for Melbourne has asked me a question on Telstra because I noted some articles in the media in the last day or two which indicated very clearly that Mr Blount, the former CEO of Telstra, came to Australia only because he was promised by Labor that Labor would privatise Telstra. -  - In fact, I think he indicated that the honourable Leader of the Opposition was present when that particular discussion took place. But what this government has done in any privatisation of Telstra and all of the other assets was to ensure that Labor's debt was paid off from the proceeds. Labor sold and used their money. They frittered it away on current programs. When it comes to Telstra 1, the price that was received at that time was the optimal return for that particular stock at that time. I do not criticise Labor who, under the now Leader of the Opposition,  in June 1994 sold Commonwealth Serum Laboratories for $2.30 a share when the price of a Commonwealth Serum Laboratories share today is $18. -  - I do not criticise, because you should have sold it. That is $2.30 to $18. -  - I do not criticise Labor for what happened when they entered the market on the sale of the Commonwealth Bank. The shares of the first tranche were sold at $5.40. These shares are trading at the present time at around $24. I accept the manner in which the market operates. I can recall some quotes from the former shadow Treasurer in the week leading up to the sale of Telstra 1 when he was out there saying, `This will be a fire sale. They will get $8 billion for it. They should pull it.' When it came to that sale a week later - and this is indicated very clearly by the process in the book build - the proceeds that were received for the sale of Telstra 1 were some $14.3 billion. That is on top of a recapitalisation a couple of months earlier whereby the taxpayers of Australia received the amount of $3 billion. That is a total of $17.3 billion.When you see a live market created and that spike, it is interesting to note that, in a comparison between Labor's sale of CBA 1 and this government's sale of Telstra 1, the increase over about the first 50 or 60 days ran parallel. CBA 1 went up about 24 per cent - but, of course, you had created a live market. When it came to setting the price, a range was stated - in order to generate the demand for Telstra 1 - of between $2.80 and $3.30. Six days prior to the actual striking of the price in Telstra 1, I increased that by 10c.	 That was because, quite clearly, the demand had been created, and I was interested in getting the optimal return for the taxpayers of Australia. I have little doubt under the process that was adopted with an independent adviser - and the Labor Party never received  independent advice on these matters - that the taxpayers of Australia received a maximum return. Sadly, as I have said so often, those proceeds had to be used to pay off Labor's debt, as have the proceeds of Telstra 2, which have been received as a result of those shares going to the market earlier this year.So the taxpayers of Australia have been well served by the sale of both Telstra 1 and Telstra 2. It is all very well for someone coming in a few years later to talk about a price that can be explained on the basis of telcos around the world going up. They are a growth stock around the world, and Telstra is at the very top of the tree when it comes to that because it is a very dynamic Australian company. That is what brought out demand again on this occasion. Telstra is improving the telecommunications of this country and it is taking its rightful place at the head of the very solid companies that exist in this country. It is part of what has been a phenomenon around the world in recent years. As more and more of these telecommunication companies are going to the market, there is a demand in whatever that market might be.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Makin for her question. The great news is that legislation will come into the parliament tomorrow to cut company taxes and capital gains taxes, including the capital gains of all of those people who, incidentally, became shareholders in the Commonwealth Bank as a result of Labor's privatisation. The good news for all of those people - who have obviously had rather large capital gains under the Labor Party's policies; I think it was $5.40 to $22 - who were introduced to privatisation by the Australian Labor Party is that, if the government's legislation goes through, the capital gains tax on that increase will be halved. If the Labor Party does not support this legislation, it will be taxing all of  those millions of shareholders, which it introduced to the market on very generous terms, at double the rate which they need to pay. So on this side of the House, we say that Thursday could be a great day for small business and the shareholders of Australia, if we can only get on and pass legislation to reform the business taxation system.In addition to that, not only will small businesses get a reduction in their company rate to 34 cents in the dollar and then to 30 cents in the dollar but, if the government's legislation - which comes as part of a simplified small business taxation system - is passed, they will also be able to write off all assets of $1,000 or less and to pool and depreciate all of their assets at standard rates, and up to 75 per cent of small businesses will no longer have to do an annual stocktake, which will be a dramatic simplification for the small businesses of Australia.There are also two other great benefits that will go through the parliament in this legislation, if the Labor Party can bring itself to support reform. The first benefit is that small business people when selling a business can have 50 per cent of the assets of the business taken out of capital gains tax and then pay the half rate on the remainder, which has the effect of making only 25 per cent of the small business taxable. The second benefit is that those people in small business who have held an asset for 15 years and are approaching 55 years of age can sell that asset capital gains tax free. These are great reforms - this is great simplification and this is a major improvement for the small businesses of this country.If the opposition can support reform, this is a benefit that we can give small business - along with lower interest rates, improved indirect taxation, improved industrial relations changes, more jobs and the good business conditions that prevail for small businesses at the moment. It is going to take some leadership from the Leader of the Opposition to support reform; it is not something that he is used to. But if he can reach out and support reform, we will commend him for doing so, and I am sure that the business community of Australia would be pleased to see a change  from the opposition at all costs to something that is creative for this country.</DOC>

 - I note with some interest that that question, or a large slab of it, was simply read off a press release issued by the shadow minister on Monday afternoon. I made it quite plain on Monday afternoon that our policy, which I think has been widely circulated and is widely understood on this matter, still stands. I thought it was quite irrelevant to have to restate the proposition that that includes a public inquiry into the adequacy of service levels - the service levels that we have dictated; that you did not dictate - and the obligations that we have put on Telstra being met before a further sale took place. Plainly, I add that that inquiry would involve input from the country people of the sort that I met in Texas last weekend, who had expressed some concern. The member for Maranoa and the member for New England were also there. The people of Texas in Queensland expressed concerns about service levels, which I will be taking up with the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.But I would have thought that it was quite sufficient to point out that our policy position on this matter has not altered. It does mean us meeting the commitments that we have made but, more particularly, I think it is worth stating that this really belongs in the category  of useful contributions to the debate about regional services and the needs of rural communities that we get from the opposite side - such as questions asking me to name the regional universities that are facing some financial difficulties. What a useful thing for me to be asked in this place - name them for the benefit of country parents so that these universities will be exposed! This is an absolutely absurd proposition.It is worth recalling that the opposition's lack of commitment to services in rural telecommunications extended to the deal they did with Vodafone which would have shut down the analog mobile phone network from the end of this year and would have left huge areas of Australia without any mobile telephone coverage at all. I really believe that this question reflects a pathetic attempt on that side - by a group of people who have opposed every worthwhile reform and policy prescription that we have put forward to help rural and regional Australia - to now paint themselves as having discovered some latter-day concern for the wellbeing of country people.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Page for his question. Actions speak louder than words. If you take the ACTU's estimate, real wage increases for Australian workers are up by 9.1 per cent since we have been in office. I am not using our figures but the ACTU figures. Over the 13 years Labor was in office, the real wages of low income people actually fell. Not only have those people enjoyed higher wages; they have had a better chance of getting a job. Over 500,000 jobs have been created since this government has been in office. In respect of basic rights for workers, under this government all workers are guaranteed freedom of association, the  right to join a union and, furthermore, the right to not join a union if that is their choice.The honourable member asks: what are the obstacles in the way of further reform? He has only to listen to the interjections from the other side to see the obstacles sitting there giving us their usual response. The loudest one, typical of the frontbench, is a former trade union official. He is a former trade union hack who outlasted his usefulness and so was sent to the federal parliament - former ACTU president, Lord Hotham -  - Mr Speaker, would you like me to name them all? - Talking about members, if you want to go to the statistics, 58 per cent of the frontbench of the Labor Party are ex-union hacks. If you go to the Senate, 69 per cent of the senators on the Labor Party side are former trade union officials. In the House, 40 per cent - nearly half of them - are former trade union officials. It is no surprise that, when the unions have a few problems with declining membership, who do they turn to to help them? They turn to none other than the frontbench and backbench of the Labor Party on the basis that all the members shall use their offices for the purposes of boosting trade union membership. We know now from the TWU that they want their parliamentary offices, paid for by taxpayers, to be used as branch offices of the trade union movement. - Do I have your invitation to continue, Mr Speaker? - Thank you. You were obviously paying close attention, Mr Speaker. I do not suppose there is any chance you would ever use your office as a branch office of the Transport Workers Union. -  - It demonstrates how close the two are. The Transport Workers Union, which now wants to use opposition offices as branch offices, is the same union that tipped more than three-quarters of a million dollars into the Labor Party between 1995 and 1998. That does not even include donations to local members. Of course, it has always been a two-way process. When Labor were in office, they were funding the TWU using taxpayers' money and getting it back as a dividend. When you look at the Senate, you have in person Nick Bolkus, formerly of the TWU; Steve Hutchins, a past president of the New South Wales branch of the TWU; and Stephen Conroy. They are not only pulling the strings from outside; they are running the Labor Party from within. How can the public have faith in a political party that basically sold its soul to the trade union movement?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dickson for her question. Naturally, I do support what was said by my friend and senior colleague the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. He made excellent sense in that letter. As for the performance of the Job Network, I have never said that the Job Network was perfect. I have  simply said that it is better than the CES and the Working Nation programs that it replaced. I repeat what I have said to the House before: in terms of getting unemployed people into work, the Job Network is at least 50 per cent better than the old CES. I also hope to be in a position very shortly to give the House some more detailed figures on the performance of intensive assistance which show that intensive assistance is comprehensively outperforming the Working Nation programs of the former government. Rather than taking pot shots at members of the Job Network, which comprises some of the greatest organisations this country possesses, the member for Dickson should get out around the country, travel a little bit, get out of Dickson and see some of the other people around the country, and then she will discover just what sort of job the Job Network is doing.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I must say I like the colour of his tie, and I should add I am looking for an invitation to visit Toowoomba to talk to all those people from my electorate who have retired up there to see what they are doing. -  - No, but we might counsel them on this issue, Prime Minister. - I was provoked, Mr Speaker.  - All of us are concerned about seeing the best possible future for our rural and regional communities. There is an understandable highlighting of the difficulties that much of the bush faces at the moment. It is important to remember, though, that many communities are finding new and innovative ways forward. Next week we will be having a summit here, and I welcome the opportunity to say to the House that one of the things we will be doing is looking to those communities that really are making a go of it. I could name several, in fact. One that comes to mind is Dubbo, in the member for Parkes's electorate. It is a larger centre with very high growth rates. It is interesting to note that, in part, it is able to attract people there for lifestyle issues. People want to know about things like crime rates, education, restaurants and so forth. There are positive answers to those sorts of questions which help encourage people to go and invest there, and they have been very good at extolling those pluses. Just a little while ago, there were 100 hectares under wine grapes in Mudgee, in my own electorate, and now it is 4,000 hectares. Tourism and a whole range of local activities are seeing that community grow.Leeton, in the member for Riverina's electorate, has a growth rate of around 1½ per cent. I was there recently and they are looking at a new industry based on pectin. That has come about in part because of the Commonwealth government's contribution to research and development. Leeton is a forward-looking community. Longreach, in Queensland, last year generated more money from tourism than it did from agricultural pursuits. Many new jobs are emerging in a very good way in that community. Moree, in northern New South Wales, is turning around a tendency towards quite serious decline in recent times by actively seeking new businesses in a range of ways. They are addressing problems. They have been actively pursuing culturally relevant jobs for the Aboriginal communities. They have created 75 jobs in the cotton industry alone - jobs that did not exist until very recently. There is a serious main street  program going on there to make it a more attractive town for people to live in, to come to and to invest in. In the town of Beechworth, in the member for Indi's electorate, we have seen an innovative fellow grow a bakery, in a decade or so, from just two employees to something like 64.These sorts of success stories need to be highlighted, and we will be doing that next week. It needs to be said that the investment climate that we have created is a very sound one for growth in rural and regional areas in these times of difficulty. The Ralph report, for which we are looking for some leadership and support from the other side -  - We might yet, Treasurer. Do not be too pessimistic; we may yet see some leadership. There is no doubt that the changes to capital gains tax will really make a difference to the attractiveness for small businesses of investing in rural areas. Then there are the huge reductions in transport costs that will come next year with the abolition of wholesale sales tax and there is the slashing of the fuel tax.It is worth making the point that we have seen a transition in the position of the spokesperson for rural and regional issues on that side of the House. The test as to whether the member for Batman is fair dinkum about his commitment to rural and regional Australia might be in a simple repudiation from him of the view of the previous spokesman, the member for Dickson, that our slashing of the diesel costs was nothing more than a $7.8 billion boost to pollution. We might believe he has some credibility when he repudiates that and acknowledges that it is a valuable reform for rural and regional Australia.There are a range of very valuable tools - whether it is Rural Plan, the Rural Assistance Program, which the minister right behind me runs, the tourism grants, Invest Australia, the TradeStart offices, Networking the Nation and the rural transaction centres - that we are giving rural communities to help them find a way forward. One of the objectives of the summit next week will be to establish the criteria for success by looking at what successful communities have done and then  seeking to more widely spread that success across rural and regional Australia.</DOC>

 - Well, I would ask the honourable member if she stands by her statement back in -  -  - I would be very happy to answer the question, but she was the one who said that a gap had opened up under the leadership of the Prime Minister back whenever it was that she came into the Labor Party. The fact of the matter is, as one of her colleagues said the other day, `Cheryl has become a weight around all of our necks; you never know what she is going to say or do next.' - Thank you, Mr Speaker - neither out of character nor out of order in any way. - I did write to the Prime Minister - in fact, it was not a secret document because I was the one who, in due course, released it. -  - It is a fact. What it demonstrated is that on this side of the House we are genuinely interested in policy. In terms of policy development, since that letter you have seen this government adopt a number of important policy initiatives which have been to the benefit of all Australians. For example, we enhanced the Work for the Dole Program, which was raised in that letter and which provides real benefits. - That letter also talked about what we would do for indigenous employment and today I launched another aspect. -  - The question was about the letter and I am answering the elements in the letter. The Leader of the Opposition asks about wages -  - As I was saying, we announced an expansion of the Work for the Dole scheme. That letter also referred to unfair dismissal issues and in that regard -  - I am happy to get to all of these matters. In respect of unfair dismissals, that is still a problem for the small business community, and flowing out of those discussions there are amendments currently before this chamber which the Labor Party is opposing which would provide benefits for small business and which would mean more jobs.Mr Speaker, the other significant issue - and I will then move on - was the corporations power. That was contained in the letter to the Prime Minister and I have spoken on that publicly since that letter was released. That is an issue which I think we do need to consider more carefully and I am having my department continue to advise me on aspects of that.In respect of wages and the award system, the government's policy is absolutely clear. That is a matter for the commission. In terms of safety net wage increases through awards, it is my view that - where we can reasonably within the government's general macroeconomic management - we ought to be arguing for higher wages based on higher productivity. That is our approach to wages. The opposition asked me about wages and I will tell them what the policy was when they were in government. They have boasted about reducing people's wages and they did reduce their wages. - I certainly will, Mr Speaker. I conclude by saying that we are in favour of higher real wages and we are not in favour of discounting wages, and have no such proposal currently or in the future on the books. Our policy is higher wages and, furthermore, we have got the reforms to ensure that our businesses through higher productivity can pay higher wages.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Menzies for his question. I am aware of reports that have appeared in the press on the  Dusseldorp Skills Forum study on the cost to Australia of early school leaving. The precise figure of $2.6 billion is dependent upon the particular assumptions made in that report, but it is a report which draws attention to the losses in income and opportunity that are suffered by young people who leave school early. This was a very serious problem when the government came to office, because the 70 per cent of young people who do not go from school to university had been appallingly neglected during the years of the Labor Party's government. Indeed, an earlier report by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum in 1998 based on 1996 data - that is, data referring to the period of the Labor government - said:Young Australians have gained a few substantial benefits from the dollars, words and policy efforts expended on them over the last decade.Those words amount to the statement that the Labor Party failed young Australians. -  - There is an effort to deny it on the other side of the House now, but it is in fact an admitted failure by the Labor Party itself. - Peter Baldwin in his Lighthouse discussion paper in 1997 said:Accommodating the needs of those not intending to proceed directly on to university education in the final years of school is something we didn't do enough about in government. -  - John Dawkins was reported in Neal Blewett's book as referring to Labor's `awful record on the subject of vocational education'. Young people were simply expelled from school onto the unemployment queues. It has fallen to this government to care for the interests of those young Australians, the generation of young Australians, the 70 per cent who do not go on to university. As a result of this government's actions we have greatly increased the opportunities for vocational education in the senior school curriculum. In 1995, under the last year of Labor, there were some 26,000 students doing vocational education in schools. This year, as a result of this government's initiatives and concern for these young people, 130,000 school students will be undertaking vocational education and training in schools. There are now some 90,000 more apprenticeship opportunities for these young people than there were when Labor drove apprenticeships into the ground. Indeed, this year some 5,000 part-time apprenticeships are being undertaken by young people while they are still at school. We would like to see those numbers go up substantially. If every state in Australia were observing the best practice state, that number would be not 5,000 but 13,000; and we want to see those numbers go even higher. This year, the Jobs Pathway program will be assisting some 62,000 young people to make a successful transition from school to work. It has been up to this government to remedy the betrayal of a generation that took place under the Labor Party in office.</DOC>

 - I am saying that the Health Insurance Commission believe that there is sufficient reason to refer more than half of the cases to the DPP. Everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence, but they believe that through their investigations they have uncovered sufficient material to do that. For the ones that they say have been cleared, that means that they will not be sending them to the DPP. It does not mean that there is not still a suspicion that there is a possibility of backdating or that there may have been a non-binding contract that had supposedly been binding. It is not just that they cannot find evidence to do it: they have  no evidence whatsoever that there was any leak. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Deakin for his question. Of course, everybody in the House recognises the great job that the member for Deakin does as an advocate for Australia's automotive industry. The member for Deakin has been an active participant in the processes of reform that this government has implemented over the past few years, to the great benefit of Australia's automotive industry. I would like to inform the House, in response to the member's question, that Australia's automotive exports increased to a record $2.77 billion in 1998-99, a nine per cent increase on the previous year. This is in spite of the economic recession that we experienced in the region of South-East Asia, and it is during a period when Australia's exporters have shown that they are quite entrepreneurial in their activities in finding new markets.Those new markets have yielded some unbelievable statistics as far as the automotive industry is concerned. Those new markets, particularly in the Middle East and South America that had not been opened up prior to this, have been opened up in recent years. The Middle East market now accounts for about $560 million worth of Australian automotive exports, especially Toyota Camrys and Holden Commodores. The statistics in a couple of countries in the Middle East are quite compelling. Exports in the past 12 months have seen a 339 per cent increase to  Saudi Arabia and a 480 per cent increase to Kuwait. - Those statistics pale into insignificance when you see the increase in South America. In South America, where Holden has commenced shipments of cars to Argentina, we have seen a 2,500 per cent increase in the marketplace. There was an interjection, `Off what sort of base?' Well, the base was fairly low, and we inherited that base from the Australian Labor Party. We have introduced a policy of pragmatic tariff reform that has given consistency and certainty to Australia's automotive industry and has encouraged that automotive industry to invest in what it is doing and to invest in that export effort. It is producing these sorts of export figures in an automotive industry that is being increasingly recognised around the world for its ability and for the R&amp;D that is taking place in that export industry. -  - I wanted to inform the House that just recently the Prime Minister's special automotive envoy, Mr Ian Grigg, visited the US and, while there, had a meeting with Mr Jac Nasser, the chief executive of Ford. Mr Nasser has offered to host an exhibition to promote Australian auto technology in the Ford Technology Centre in the US. I understand that the automotive industry will take that up, and we will be looking at facilitating that from a government perspective. These export gains flow from our government's efforts in putting in place a market access and development strategy that has been underpinned with funding of $20 million over four years.More importantly, these export efforts have been underpinned by our government's pragmatic approach to tariff reform and our government's sound economic management of the economy, which has provided the industry  with a sound economic base in the domestic circumstance from which to launch into the export marketplace. We have now announced and are going to implement taxation reform across Australia that will greatly benefit the export industries, including Australia's automotive exports. As the Treasurer has announced today, we will also be introducing legislation into the parliament later this week to improve the corporate taxation system and the capital gains tax system in Australia. With the support of the Labor Party, that will further underpin the domestic economic circumstance of Australian manufacturers so they can challenge the rest of the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for the question,  because last week I announced a number of decisions the government had taken to deal with the very large number of unauthorised arrivals. Since I spoke on that occasion, two more boats have arrived with 36 passengers from Iraq and Afghanistan. We have been experiencing a huge increase in the level of unauthorised arrivals. They are people who are not local to our region; they have travelled halfway round the world from places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Turkey to seek protection here. In many cases they are relinquishing situations of security they are now in or passing other countries where they can properly make asylum claims in order to come to Australia.Just to give you some idea of the dimension of it, there are 2.5 million Afghans living in countries neighbouring Afghanistan. There are 700,000 Iraqis living in neighbouring countries - many of them people for whom we make arrangements within our special humanitarian program or within our refugee program so they can come to Australia. That is in situations in which they are judged by the UNHCR to be in urgent need of resettlement in a country like Australia. What is happening is that people who are making essentially family reunion commitments are seeking to have their relatives jump the queue over those who are more vulnerable. One person even had the audacity to ring me at my office and to ask whether his relative had yet arrived in Port Hedland. The fact is that the Port Hedland facility is full. There are 300 places at the Curtin air base which have been put in on a temporary basis. That capacity will be expanded to 400 shortly, but we are reaching the point where the numbers of people we have to detain are such that we are under enormous pressure. It is obvious that there are incentives there that are bringing people to Australia rather than their waiting, as they may have in the past, for places within a proper refugee and humanitarian program.The temporary protection visa that I announced is to be introduced by regulation. The regulations were proclaimed this morning. This is one element of a range of measures we are working on. I welcome the in-  principle support we have had from the opposition. I hope it will be maintained. I welcome the support we have had for this measure, because it is important and in the national interest. I hope it will be maintained in the way in which the opposition shadow minister has said it should on a number of occasions - that is, tough action is required and if he were in my place he would be tougher than me.</DOC>

 - They certainly do not suggest what the honourable member says. What I have said is absolutely correct. The first time I was alerted to it was 5 May - the same day that I wrote to the Prime Minister. I have not seen the minutes that the honourable member has, but it would not surprise me at all if the College of Radiologists internally had been speculating on a supply measure. But my department officials tell me - and they were the ones conducting the negotiation - that they had not discussed that with the College of Radiologists. The College of Radiologists may have put some positions to us, but the first I knew of the supply measure was when it was put to me very late in the process, the day before I went to talk to the college itself.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. Today is a historic day for the Australian Public Service, with the passage of the government's Public Service Bill through the Senate this morning. This legislation provides a new modern framework for the Australian Public Service which will take it into the next century. It is the biggest overhaul and reform of Commonwealth Public Service legislation in 75 years. Compared to the 1922 act, it is a short act in plain English underpinned by values and not by rules and prescriptions.The philosophy of this act places the onus for the management of Public Service departments squarely on the shoulders of secretaries and agency heads. The agency heads have gained all of the powers and responsibilities of employers and access to all the flexibilities under the workplace relations legislation. They will exercise similar rights, duties and powers as their counterparts in the private sector. The legislation brings employment in the Australian Public Service into line with employment in the private sector. It nevertheless recognises the special character of the Australian Public Service. The red tape has been stripped away, but parliamentary scrutiny and public accountability of the Australian Public Service has been enhanced.At the very end of this process members will be aware that the opposition, under pressure from the Commonwealth Public Sector Union, sought to amend the legislation in an unacceptable way. The final amendment that the Labor Party inserted in the Senate would have effectively ruled out temporary employment, except when the Senate agreed to each individual circumstance. That would have made flexibility in the area of temporary and casual employment impossible within the Public Service. The government could not accept this, and I am pleased to say that the  Labor Party has backed away from this amendment and we now have a bill which provides a significant new level of flexibility in relation to temporary employment. Temporaries can now be employed for up to three years to meet agency needs and can be employed indefinitely to undertake specific tasks.Agencies now have a big job ahead of them to get themselves ready for the implementation of the new Public Service Act. I believe that they will be able to use this act to further enhance the quality of the public service offered to the people of Australia. In concluding, I would like to thank the members of the Australian Public Service, who have been waiting a very considerable time for this reform. I am pleased that we can now move into the next century with a new act with new opportunities to continue to build a world-class Public Service in Australia.</DOC>

 - I first of all have to refute part of the question. The Leader of the Opposition is suggesting I did something against technical advice. I have already mentioned in the parliament, back in February, the process by which we came to this, and I am prepared to stick by that. In fact, I can probably give you the exact Hansard  reference. I was checking it earlier today. In fact, it was 11 February 1999. My answer then -  and I will read it to the House, because it is still correct - was:My department said in Senate estimates that I made the decision - this is the decision about the supply - That is correct. Let me tell you the process of my making the decision. The department advised my office that there may be a problem. I asked my department for proposals that could address that problem. I discussed them with my department. I asked my department which was their preferred option and I made a decision along the lines of - in fact, identical with - the preferred option put to me by my department. So the notion you are suggesting that I somehow came over the top - of the department - and put something in myself is not correct.That is in fact the advice that was put to me by the department, and I took my department's advice. So somehow suggesting that I have overruled technical advice is simply not correct.To come back to the College of Radiologists, I am not responsible for the College of Radiologists. I would not be at all surprised if they were speculating as to what was going to happen. It would not surprise me at all that they were speculating on a supply side measure. When I had my meeting with them on 6 May, it was discussed in the most general terms at the end of the meeting, as backed up by the two statutory declarations I have tabled in the parliament and as backed up in my comments back as early as February of this year. They did raise the issue with me, so they had obviously been talking about it amongst themselves. But they did not know the exact detail - I am assured of that by my department - and they certainly did not learn it from me. If they have taken a speculative position, they need to look at that themselves. They need to look at their own internal processes to see how they stack up.While I am on the College of Radiologists, we had earlier today a suspension of standing orders to get my reference to the Auditor. I would have been happy to give it to you if you had just asked, but I am happy to table it. The Auditor, under section 20 - I understand it is under section 20 - is able to inquire as widely as he wishes. I will be asking the College of Radiologists to cooperate with the  Auditor. If the College of Radiologists does not cooperate with the Auditor, I expect he will comment as such when he gives his report. Finally, on the issue of generosity: yes, it was very generous. It was generous to the 100,000 Australians who were having to pay $400 to $800 each to get a scan. -  - It was generous to those people who had been neglected by Labor. This was a long overdue reform. It has been excellent for the Australian public.</DOC>

 - May I thank the honourable member for Longman for raising this question because it draws attention to a gathering of 130 young farm leaders who are currently in Parliament House attending the National Farmers Federation 20th Anniversary Conference of Young Farmers. The interesting thing about this 20th anniversary event is that the National Farmers Federation have chosen not just to recall their achievements over the past 20 years, even though they are considerable, but to use this year to invest in the future of farm leadership. So they have brought together, with sponsorship from the federal government and a number of other agencies, some of the young people who will be the farm leaders of the future.I have to say that I have been very impressed with the calibre of these people, and they give us a great deal of confidence about the capacity of rural Australia to continue to produce in a way which will benefit our nation. These young people are very important in helping to develop the sorts of policies that will be necessary to keep Australian agriculture strong and viable, but they are also important for the role that they can play at a leadership level in country communities. This  government is very keen to support rural Australia, and one of the best investments we can make is in its young people, because our rural young people certainly have the capacity to contribute to building strong agriculture in this country to ensure it remains competitive and to ensure that rural Australia remains strong in the decades ahead.</DOC>

 - I have not seen the comments from the state Treasury official which are alleged to have been made, but would it surprise me for a state Treasury official to be claiming more money? No. Would it surprise me if, for example, the state of Tasmania and its Treasurer were trying to get more money? They were one of the quickest signers of the GST deal. - Yes, the Hon. Dr David Crean raced down for the agreement to sign up for the GST. Obviously far-sighted -  - Bob Carr got there first. I can say that there are some Labor leaders that have a position on tax reform - Bob Carr was one that wanted to sign up, as I recall. - Dr David Crean was another who wanted to sign up. -  - I am just extolling their virtues, Mr Speaker. - The question is: would I be surprised - and I have not seen the comments - if a state Treasury official were claiming more money? No. I would be no more surprised by that than if the sun rose tomorrow. In all of my dealings with state Treasury officials, I have never seen one yet that has not taken the opportunity to try to claim more tax. As I said, when the GST deal came up, because it gives greater revenues to the states, the Labor premiers and treasurers were falling over themselves to become part of that deal.You ask what the government can do about it. The fact is that the Commonwealth government has given a guarantee that no state will be worse off as a result of that. We are going to advance to the states in the event, in the first couple of years, that they are under the amount that is guaranteed. If they have taken more revenues than they should have, all that means is that the amount that we guarantee that we will advance under the guarantee is less. One of the great things about this is that it is the biggest change to Commonwealth-state financial relations in Australian history, and the Labor Party was not a part of it. It was not a part of the biggest reform in Australian history. We have built in safeguards to protect the position.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cook for that question. I think all members of the House would want to congratulate Mr Wahid on his election as the new President of the Republic of Indonesia. He has a reputation for honesty. He has long stood for political and religious tolerance in his community and he has long supported political reform. In his inauguration speech, he reaffirmed his commitment to democracy, to free enterprise, to human rights and to the accountability of governance. These are principles that I know all Australians share with him. He has had good contact with Australia and Australians over the years. I said yesterday in the House that whoever won the ballot for President will be a person with whom the government I lead will seek to cooperate. In the wake of Mr Wahid's election, I repeat that commitment today. Later on today Indonesia will also have a new vice-president freely elected on the same basis.These events provide me with the opportunity to draw to the attention of the House the scale of change occurring in Indonesia. The first democratic general election since 1955 took place a few months ago. It was the first contested presidential election ever. East Timor has been allowed to separate from Indonesia in accordance with the constitutional processes of that country. We are witnessing some quite remarkable events that are transforming Indonesia, and these remarkable events do hold out the prospect for a new chapter in Australia's relationships with Indonesia.The new President, by any measure, will face an enormous challenge. Indonesia's political foundations are changing, its institutions will go through a period of great adaptation. Indonesia must also overcome one of the worst economic crises in its history. We here  in Australia understand that these are exceptionally difficult times and that the path ahead will be very hard for the people of Indonesia. We, therefore, in Australia, will be a sympathetic neighbour and, as in the past, we are ready to extend the hand of friendship and support.The new Indonesian government has yet to be appointed. The new President and his government will have many immediate preoccupations. There ought to be no rush to judgment or hasty action by anyone. Instead, we need to adopt a patient and calm approach, confident that the strong interest both countries have in close cooperation will surely emerge over time. The government I lead will aim to develop a good working relationship with the new Indonesian government, on a basis of mutual interest and mutual respect. We will build on our common interests while being pragmatic about and respecting the differences between our cultures and societies.This is an important period in the history of Indonesia and in the relationship between our two countries. That relationship has unavoidably been put under strain by the developments in relation to East Timor - a chapter in the history of this country of which we should be immensely proud, because this country not only did the right thing but did the thing that was in the interests of Australia. That does not gainsay the fact that in the long term we need to work side by side with Indonesia. It is in that spirit and with that realisation that the government is determined to see the election of a new president as an opportunity, over time and at an appropriate pace - and recognising the difficulties of recent weeks - to build a stronger and better relationship between our two countries and our two societies.</DOC>

 - Firstly, instructed by long experience, I never accept that what the Leader of the Opposition says I said I did say. Nor do I automatically accept that there was not some context in which I made the remark that gives a totally different interpretation to that which the Leader of the Opposition implies in his question. I will go away and thumb through the records I have of what I have said over the years. I am quite certain that that little bit of research will in no way gainsay what I have said in this House over the past week.I would like the Leader of the Opposition to listen very carefully when I say that there will be no vouchers. There will be no departure from the fundamentals of our higher education policy. I know from the reaction that I have had from different sections of the community over the past week that, increasingly, people in the Australian community are seeing the scare campaign being waged by the Labor Party on this issue for what it is. There  is no threat to the higher education system that we have developed in this country.I had a very interesting experience this morning when I took some talkback radio on a Perth radio station. I think I did rather better on the Perth radio station this week than the Leader of the Opposition did a couple of weeks ago. I was able to assure one of the young callers, when she inquired about the government's plans, that we had a balanced approach to higher education, that we could no longer imagine that we lived in a society where the government could provide a free tertiary education, and that those sorts of days were gone and are not coming back, but that we are in a society that believes that it is unfair, within a system providing a certain number of government funded places, to ask students to bear all of the cost of their tuition.What you need is essentially the system we have at the moment, where you have a number of government funded places, a HECS system, an opportunity and an incentive for people to discharge their HECS liability at the front end, and provision for those who cannot do that to pay it off when they are in a position to do so. That is a fair system. It is fair to the student, fair to the community and fair to the taxpayer. It provides an appropriate balance. While ever this government is in power, that is the system that will stay in place.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hughes for her question and for her interest in the general topic not just of East Timor but also of the international force in East Timor. I have just been to Thailand and Singapore. Whilst in Singapore, I attended the World Economic Forum. I can say to the House - and I am sure that all members will be interested to know this - that there is  overwhelmingly throughout our region great respect and, in some cases, admiration for what Australia has been doing in East Timor and for Australia's contribution to the international force in East Timor.While I was in Thailand I saw Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and also the Deputy Foreign Minister and the supreme commander of the Royal Thai Armed Forces. The Thai Prime Minister and others expressed to me their admiration for Australia's role in East Timor and particularly for our leadership of INTERFET. They also confirmed Thailand's absolute commitment to INTERFET and their determination to continue to contribute to the resolution of the East Timor problem. I took the opportunity to tell both the Thai Prime Minister and the Thai media more generally that in this country there is great admiration for what Thailand has done in contributing to INTERFET and for the role Thailand is playing in the deputy leadership of the international force in East Timor.While I was in Singapore I saw Prime Minister Goh. l know that members will be interested and pleased to hear that the Prime Minister of Singapore commended Australia for its courageous role in leading the international force in East Timor. He made an important point to me, and I know he will not mind me passing this on to the House and making it public - that is, he believes that Australia has earned great respect throughout the region for the role it has played in helping to resolve the problem of East Timor. I also had the opportunity to meet with the VicePresident of the Philippines. Like the Prime Minister of Singapore and Prime Minister of Thailand, she expressed her very strong support for what the United Nations, Australia and the international community are doing in East Timor.I conclude by saying that for our part we have been pleased with not only the broad international response to the East Timor issue; we have been pleased with the contribution our own region has made. The contribution of ASEAN, for example, has attracted some discussion in the media - not just in our own media but in ASEAN as whole. The truth is that ASEAN has made a very solid and  important contribution to INTERFET in the resolution of the East Timor problem. The contributions of Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines - also, let me say, Malaysia - are much appreciated. I know that those contributions will continue into phase 3 of the peacekeeping operation which will replace INTERFET.So it has been very heartening to go to not only two countries in the region but an international conference in the region in Singapore and to learn of the respect and the high regard in which Australia is held for what we have been doing in East Timor.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for his question. The green paper the government has released on higher education research funding has, of course, had an excellent response in the higher education community. I find it hard to think of any significant element of that community which has not endorsed all the principles and directions of the green paper. They have recognised in the green paper a policy direction which never came from the Labor Party. The fact is that the only policy you have ever put forward in relation to higher education research was to cut higher education research funding. The Leader of the Opposition may not have realised that, because he is not on top of education as a policy area. Of course, that was shown by the member for Werriwa walking right away from him. - It is clear that the green paper does not contain any voucher proposal. It is well known within the higher education community that that is the case. The proposals in the green paper are designed to give Australian research the critical mass and the levels of excellence that will attract back to this country outstanding young researchers who previously found that they had to go overseas to get the kind of research environments that they wanted. The government is very proud of the proposals and directions in the green paper. We have had many responses to the green paper from the higher education community. It has been a very valuable and constructive debate, and we will be announcing our response to that debate at a later time.</DOC>

 - I am only too pleased to respond to the member for Bradfield and to the very many members of the House who are interested in this particular aspect of the deployment in East Timor. I am pleased to say that the INTERFET operation is going very well indeed in that area. As of today over 6,700 personnel are in East Timor, of which some 4,850 are Australian. There are troops from Brazil, France, Italy, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States on the ground in East Timor. Contingents from Canada, Ireland, Norway and Germany are now under  going pre-deployment training in Australia. I am hopeful that the force will be joined by further international contributions.I am also pleased to report that INTERFET is making good progress in the achievement of its mandate. Operation Lavarack has extended INTERFET's presence to the western areas of East Timor and, despite some clashes with the militia, has gone very well indeed. Similar results have been achieved in the eastern regions by coalition forces. INTERFET has reported an increasing number of militia who are surrendering to them and to other community organisations.Perhaps the best indication of the progress that INTERFET has made in restoring peace and security to East Timor is the fact that Dili residents are continuing to demonstrate their increased sense of safety. Despite very poor infrastructure within Dili, an estimated 64,000 previously displaced people have now returned to the capital. INTERFET troops also assisted in clearing the marketplace, and the market re-established its operation on 12 October.With the ratification of the 30 August ballot by the Indonesian parliament, the eventual transition to a United Nations peacekeeping operation moves closer. I am pleased to report that the planning for this transition is well advanced. We are in close contact with the United Nations peacekeeping operations department and are hopeful that the Security Council will soon finalise the resolution for the next stage of this process. Discussions are continuing about the size and the leadership of this peacekeeping operation. The size of Australia's contribution is likely to be reduced, and the question of the leadership of the United Nations force is one to be determined by the Secretary-General. Regarding the outstanding enclave, the commander of INTERFET is conscious of the need to establish a presence there, and planning for this is in hand.Finally, can I say the success of INTERFET is testimony to the strong international cooperation that has made this possible. The government is grateful to the United Nations and to all coalition governments for their assistance and their support. I am especially  proud of the role played by the men and women of the ADF, who have been and will continue to be a great credit to the nation. I would also like to particularly acknowledge the very many officials here in Canberra - especially those in the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet - who have made a great effort in this deployment.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his interest in regional affairs and his commitment to it, unlike those opposite, who seek only to point score in this area and who constantly oppose every worthwhile initiative that we put up. But in relation to his question I can say this to the member: we have a limited number of places. In order to ensure that we do get quality debate and that the workshops are constructively put together and not so large and unwieldy that they cannot come up with worthwhile perspectives, the reference group determined that we had to  limit numbers to something sensible - around 230 delegates from across Australia.I acknowledge that there are many people disappointed, who would have liked to have been present, but the reference committee, headed up by Ian Sinclair, determined after an extensive exercise in consultation around the place that they had a list of people who could properly represent the range of views that need to be explored and from whom ideas can be formulated and recommendations put together.But, in particular, I would like the member to note that there is a hotline, operating from yesterday, available to people from right across Australia who have constructive ideas that they would like to put forward. I am quite happy to provide him with the number, if it has not been given to his office already. I would encourage people from across rural and regional Australia to take advantage of that facility. We do want your ideas. I think that all reasonable people would understand that you cannot have an unlimited number if you want productive outcomes, but we are genuinely seeking to ensure that we do have a capacity to absorb people's views. They are, of course, always welcome to - and they so often do - write to us, fax us or seek to meet with us, as we on this side of the House freely do.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Macquarie for his question and his contribution to economic debate. As he would know, the Westpac leading index was released yesterday, showing that the leading index was four percent, which was above trend, and the coincident index, showing the current state of economic activity, was 5.7 per cent in August, also above the long-term trend. That would seem to indicate, consistent with the government's forecasts, somewhat of  a slowing in growth from the record 4½ per cent in the last financial year but good strong growth throughout the course of the next year as the world economy picks up and as Australia's exports pick up in price as a result of some recovery in commodity prices.Of course, the Australian economy has been the standout economy in the Asia-Pacific region during the Asian financial crisis. Yesterday, the Chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Dr Alan Greenspan, reiterated his praise of Australia's performance throughout that crisis. He said:Despite its close trade and financial ties to Asia, the Australian economy exhibited few signs of contagion from contiguous economies, arguably because Australia already had well-developed capital markets as well as a sturdy banking system. Going further - Dr Greenspan said - it is plausible that the dividends of financial diversity extend to more normal times as well. The existence of alternatives may well insulate all  aspects of a financial system from breakdown.One of the strengths of Australia is its financial system and financial regulation. Soon after this government was elected, we commissioned Stan Wallis to do a report on the financial system, an inquiry which the government has now implemented in full in modernising our regulatory regimes. It is now providing the model for other economies in the world, such as Britain and Canada, which are using Australia as the template to follow in financial regulation.The IMF described Australia's financial sector reforms as `pathbreaking' and commended the government for its comprehensive corporate law reforms which the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation talked about recently. The IMF said:This will put Australia's prudential regime at the forefront of international practice.So here we have a picture of reform: world's best practice, the dividends that come during a financial crisis, international recognition from the US Fed and benefits being delivered to ordinary Australians. What are the benefits? Five hundred thousand new jobs in the last three years, increases in real wages, low interest rates, more young people able to buy  homes than ever before, a budget back in surplus and, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs said, Australia taking a leadership role in the region and, in fact, in much of the developed world. These are the benefits of economic reform and, if we continue them, if we modernise our taxation system, we can drive those benefits even further.I again say to the parliament: this country has an opportunity with business tax reform - the first tranche coming in this afternoon - to get one of the world's best corporate tax systems, something that will do something for the nation if we can seize this opportunity.</DOC>

 - It is probably neither. It is probably that it was one of the two things that I have already mentioned - backdating or non-binding contracts - but there has not been sufficient information to warrant a referral to the DPP. The other thing, though, is that it was very widely expected - people were expecting MRI to be funded. After all, Graham Richardson said in 1994 to the College of Radiologists there would be an MRI rebate, but the Labor Party never carried through with it. - People expect the Labor Party to break their promises, Prime Minister. We had an Australian Health Technology Advisory Committee report saying we should fund more scans. What we inherited from the Labor Party was 100,000 people a year having to pay $400 to $800 for a scan, so it was widely anticipated we were going to do something. I have not had any evidence to suggest that what we have been saying so far is anything other than utterly correct.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Dunkley for his question. I think all Victorians today and yesterday would be very concerned about developments in the state of Victoria. The headline in the Herald Sun  today tells it all. - The headline is `Steve's Party'. It is a photo of the new Bracks ministry. A number of the new ministers - four, in fact - have been sworn in before they were even sworn in as members of parliament, demonstrating the inexperience of the Bracks team. More ominously, as the headline also recounts, `But unions may spoil the fun'. That refers to the fact that the day the Bracks government was sworn in we have a mass rally of workers promising industrial warfare in Victoria, we have the CFMEU promising to take industrial action across the board - `The big war will start next year,' said Martin Kingham, who was of course one of the people responsible for putting Mr Bracks into the leadership of the Labor Party in Victoria -  - Like many on the front bench on the other side, they are former trade union  hacks. What we see in Victoria is a Labor government basically giving a free hand to the unions to take industrial action to jeopardise thousands of jobs of ordinary Victorians, to threaten the livelihood of small business in Victoria and to threaten the economic progress that has been made in Victoria in the last seven or eight years. It is not only Martin Kingham but also militant unions who are threatening industrial action. For example, Dean Mighell from the Electrical Trades Union said, `Certainly the AFL would not want to be bouncing the ball for February just yet.' They are threatening the Melbourne Cup. We will not even be able to start the footie next year. You get a Labor government and this is the sort of industrial action you get. -  - We remember when in 1991 in Melbourne there were trams lined up welded to the tram tracks under a Labor administration. - I think Victorians have a genuine cause for concern. What is provocative is the fact that we have threats of industrial warfare in the state of Victoria. For example, in the face of threats of industrial action in the hospital system in Victoria, the new health minister, in my view, had a pretty  clear obligation. You would think, fairly and squarely, he would be very concerned at the closure of beds in the Victorian hospital system. When he was asked about it, he said, `It is not for me to support or to tell them what to do in an industrial sense.'Worse still, the new industrial relations minister, instead of standing against industrial warfare, is reported to have rung up the union hierarchy prior to the rally and encouraged them to take the attitude they have taken - namely, threats of industrial action. That does not surprise us, because the industrial relations minister in Victoria is a former member of the ACTU - as we have former presidents of the ACTU sitting on the front bench - and she is a former trade union official.This is what you get when you get a Labor administration basically tied and bound to the trade union movement and unable to stand up for the national interest. Mr Bracks has said that he wants to pursue a policy of promoting good outcomes for the Victorian economy. If he is fair dinkum about that, that is an objective everybody in this place would share, but he is going to have to stand up to union militancy when it confronts him, as it has already.</DOC>

 - I do not have that information. As health minister, I am not privy to the Health Insurance Commission's investigative process. The fact is the Health Insurance Commission has quite strong powers. It can compel people to do things, and it is not surprising that its investigation should be set up separate from the government. It is quite possible that members of the executive of the College of Radiologists made purchases, but I do not have that information.I know the honourable member has said that 14 machines were under investigation; the Health Insurance Commission advises me  that is not correct. I do not know what a correct number is. One has to be very careful about making allegations like that. I am aware that the honourable member and her office are ringing around journalists and making specific allegations against individual radiologists. She wants to be very careful doing this, particularly given the accuracy of her information to date, because such action is entirely defamatory. Radiologists are not on the top of my Christmas card list at the moment, but they are entitled to a presumption of innocence until proven guilty.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for her question. We have got the discussion paper out. We are receiving submissions. I am hopeful that we will be able to complete that process and proceed with a view to having some legislation drafted by the end of the year to hopefully be able to present it to the House or at least have it out as an exposure draft. We will see as we proceed, subject to those submissions. This is quite important legislation. It is part of our reform process.For registered organisations, which include both employer bodies as well as unions, the principles of accountability and transparency in the way in which they run their enterprises, their organisations, are very important. Members, whether of an employer body or a union, are entitled to understand how their subscriptions are being utilised. This is also particularly important for the trade union movement because they have been losing members. If they are to be effective service organisations, the members will ultimately want to be satisfied that they are getting a fair deal for the moneys that they are spending.I have raised in this House in the last couple of days the revelation that the Labor Party, with the trade unions in New South Wales, have an alternate strategy for raising members, and that is to run an organising drive through the state and federal parliamentary electorate offices. This is a most unfortunate development. Taxpayers' funds are there to provide services to constituents. I do not think it is right that parliamentary electorate offices should be used as branch offices for the Transport Workers Union. The Labor Party think it is fair enough, because the TWU has given them over $750,000 and, naturally enough, the TWU has a payback in mind.I now have proof from the Internet site of the official organ of LaborNET, Workers Online, that in fact 18 MPs have signed up with the TWU to use their offices - to use their staff - as branch offices for the Transport Workers Union. This is another example of how the unions completely dominate the Labor Party. Furthermore, not only do we have 18 MPs who have already signed up to the protocol but the trade union official, Mr Sheldon, who is running this says that it will be very interesting to see who refuses to help the unions. We know what that means! This is talk with a big club - in other words, if you do not do what you are told, watch out because your preselections are under threat. This is typical of the coercive behaviour of some of these unions. I think it is incumbent on the Leader of the Opposition to require his backbench and his frontbench - those MPs who are now signing up to the TWU protocol - to make public their intentions to use their electorate offices for the purposes of the TWU. People are entitled to know that Labor MPs are more interested in looking after the membership drives of the TWU than they are in looking after the interests of their constituents.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for his question. Australian universities now have a crucial role in helping this country take maximum advantage of the revolution which is occurring in information technology. At the moment, of course, there are other disciplines having trouble with getting their graduates jobs, but there are significant skills shortages in the information technology and telecommunications area. I think everybody recognises that this is a significant challenge for the higher education sector. It requires a high level of flexibility, making available courses and training of staff who can transmit these skills. Frequently, there is a need for these courses to be delivered in a much shorter time frame than universities are used to. -  - Since the last election, the government has committed $25 million to lectureships in science and technology to promote initiatives in these areas to ensure that universities are equipped to deliver information technology skills. I am also pleased to report that there are indications of a significant response by universities to the challenge. The information technology and telecommunications preliminary commencement data for 1999 shows substantial growth on 1998 in enrolments in specialist IT courses, rising by 26.6 per cent to 19,525 commencements.Universities themselves are increasingly recognising that flexibility in the way in which they offer courses to students in the arrangement of teaching during the year is critically important in helping this country to provide the skills that it needs. I draw attention to the three-year term pioneered by Bond University which enables students to accelerate their education and enter the work force earlier - and of course begin earning an income earlier. Courses need to be provided,  at times, to suit students, many of whom are combining work and family commitments. The government's offer this week of $259 million to universities to provide the possibility of an additional two per cent pay rise to university staff if universities adopt significant flexibilities in their workplace relations will enhance the capacity of our higher education sector to meet the sorts of challenges that the IT revolution is putting upon it.Under the workplace relations legislation, I want to draw attention to the fact that the onus lies squarely on the leaderships of universities to make sure that the institutions are best positioned to meet the demands on them. This offer by the government provides the universities with a chance to have a win-win situation where staff will be better paid, universities will have more flexibilities, students will receive better services and rapidly growing industries, such as information technology, will get the skills they need when they need them.</DOC>

 - I would have thought that if people on the negotiating team actually ordered machines or tried to benefit they were exceedingly foolish. I have no evidence that they did, but if they did then they have had a very serious conflict of interest. But I go back to the whole point of this. This was a negotiation with a professional group. It was much bigger than MRI. Diagnostic imaging is a billion dollar a year budget. It is a budget that was seriously out of control when we came into government. In the six years before we came into government in 1996, nuclear medicine was going up at 19 per cent a year. CAT scans were going up at  16 per cent a year. The radiology budget itself was going up at 10 per cent a year. - It is entirely relevant because of that stupid, whining, carping voice coming from the other side of the House. You really should take more advice from your adviser. It is seriously relevant because we were trying to bring the diagnostic imaging budget under control. We were trying to bring a billion dollar a year budget under control. We could not fund MRI separately. - It is entirely relevant because I am talking about the negotiation process, and that is what the question was about. We had to enter into a negotiation with the profession as a whole. There was no other way of funding MRI. The alternative was just to whack it on the schedule and give everybody a rebate, which is what the Labor Party did with CAT scanning in 1984 and which resulted in us having the third highest rate of CAT scanning anywhere in the world.I was not prepared to follow the incompetence of the Labor Party. I was prepared to try to do something about supply. When we in the department started the negotiation with the college on 10 February, although there had been an informal exploratory meeting in  December, it was with the specific authority of cabinet. My department advises me that the people on the team were told of the seriousness of the process, but we were negotiating with a group of people who were representatives. They were expected to discuss it with their members, they were expected to give us the opinions of their members with respect to the diagnostic images as a whole, and that is a billion dollar budget.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. I note in passing that he is known to many as `the member for the Pacific Highway'. I do not think anyone has done more in the time that I have been here to promote a cause than the member for Cowper has, particularly following a tragic accident some 10 years ago on a stretch of road to the north of his electorate. He was in here on his feet, day after day, week after week, promoting this extremely worthwhile project. The latest development in this is that, on Sunday next, the $130 million Bulahdelah-Coolongolook deviation opens. That is in the seat of the member for Lyne. - I have been challenged to say it again. I can tell you that it is quite a handful. Coolongolook - that is how you say it. -  - This is a very significant development indeed. It is actually the largest project within the $3.2 billion program of upgrading the Pacific Highway. That is being jointly funded by the federal and state governments. It is in fact the largest government sponsored civil engineering project since the Snowy Mountains scheme.This section of the road that is now about to be opened - the Bulahdelah-Coolongolook deviation - recorded 355 crashes in the decade or so between 1988 and the middle of this decade, resulting in a tragic 32 deaths and 85 serious injuries. There is no doubt that this new section of highway will make a very real difference on a wide number of fronts. It will help in the simple reduction of fatalities. It will help in the overall objectives of reducing fatalities on the Sydney-Brisbane run by 80 per cent, it is estimated, by the year 2000 and cut an hour off the travelling time between these two great cities. There are, of course, benefits too to the economies of the regions involved all the way along the highway, and the linkages for the transport industry are greatly improved as well.So since that announcement was made by the now Treasurer at Tweed Heads just prior to the 1996 election, you have seen the government getting on with a major project that it committed itself to. That in turn is reflective of us delivering on the improving of regional infrastructure in a very substantial way in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hume for his question. I note his very tasteful selection of personal accessories today - his blue badge. I can read it even from here. - This is a very important question because again I am able to point to the significant investment by the government in rural and regional development taking place right now in terms of infrastructure and jobs. The government has backed Visy Industries' plans to establish a pulp and paper mill at Tumut with a $36 million incentive package. I believe it is fair to say that without that package it is unlikely that the investment and the jobs that go with it would have  happened. I think it really is a good example of a government working in partnership with business to deliver new investment and jobs to regional Australia.In fact, this involves a capital investment of $400 million. It will create more than 1,000 jobs - 145 permanently at the mill, around 100 permanent jobs in forest operations and management and another 145 jobs or so in ancillary services such as haulage and maintenance. It is a major investment in local value adding to the extensive plantation timber resource in the Tumut region. The first sod is to be turned very shortly on 4 November - just a couple of days before the event to which that badge of yours refers - and the government will be very capably represented there by the member for Hume and by the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government.This in fact will be the world's first unbleached minicraft pulp and paper mill - the first greenfields fully integrated pulp and paper mill to be established in Australia in two decades. It is reflective of an emerging environment of certainty for investment, and nowhere was that more needed than in our forest industries. Yesterday I posed a challenge for the new spokesman for regional issues over there -  - The member for Batman. I suggested that the member for Batman ought to repudiate the previous spokesman's  description of our diesel fuel reductions as a $7.8 billion boost to pollution. But I have a second challenge for him today: he can get behind the certainty for Australia's forest industry. That will be a great challenge for the ALP. They are the people who presided over a regime under which we saw our imports of everybody else's pulp and paper and timber in this country blow out to about $3 billion. There was no investment here because there was no certainty. The member for Batman can now start to evidence his credentials by working for some RFA certainty with the minister on our side of the House. - No, it is a bit early to bring back Cheryl. This mill is totally based on plantation pine. It has the support of the nation's leading and environmental groups. It is a great investment by an Australian owned company operating in regional Australia with our support and our encouragement.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to inform the House that there has been a great deal of cooperation between the Commonwealth and state governments across the normal political divide in relation to the diversion strategy that was first outlined at a meeting of the Prime Minister, premiers and chief ministers on 9 April. At the premises of a marvellous organisation called We Help Ourselves at Lidcombe in Sydney last Thursday, I was able to announce that agreement had been achieved between the Commonwealth and all the states.The Commonwealth is making available $110 million to fund a diversion program which essentially provides, for first-time drug offenders in particular, the option of undergoing treatment and rehabilitation assistance or, alternatively, being caught up in the criminal justice system. We believe that this represents a major breakthrough and step forward and one that recognises that for first-time drug offenders incarceration and being captured in the criminal justice system is not a desirable alternative. If a proper choice can be afforded to those people, then they and society will gain the benefit.Diversion is built on the concept of early intervention. We want to prevent people entering into long-term drug abuse where they face serious health problems, financial destitution, social dysfunction, a criminal record and, in some cases, acts of violence and property crime. In many respects, this approach is another expression of the philosophy of mutual obligation. We have an obligation to provide people with a way out of the path to drugs. But they must make the choice to  accept treatment and rehabilitation services or face the consequences of being caught up in the criminal justice system.I thank the state governments of all political persuasions that have cooperated with the federal government on this issue. I was pleased to see represented at the announcement I made in Lidcombe last week the police forces - not only the Australian Federal Police through the commissioner Mr Mick Palmer but also the South Australian Police through its commissioner, who has played a leading role in the law enforcement side of the campaign against drugs.I have said before, and I repeat, that you need resources for law enforcement, you need resources for education and you need resources for treatment and rehabilitation. In an unprecedented way, to the tune of more than $500 million, this government is providing resources in each of those areas. Over time, I hope that those initiatives will make a contribution towards reducing the scourge of drugs within Australian society.</DOC>

 - There is a variety of ways in which this government is assisting in the process of transition to the introduction of the new taxation system. Whilst I cannot say that I recall precisely every single detail of every single initiative, I do know that a voucher was involved in part of the package of the initiatives.I want to take up the point made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. What the Deputy Leader of the Opposition seeks to do - not unnaturally for a Deputy Leader of the Opposition without a tax policy, without an employment policy, without a health policy  and without any serious policy alternatives in any area - is a little bit of nitpicking. I invite the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, in his moments of greater charity - and others, including the person he quoted whom I know - to take into account the aggregate benefits to the business community of our new taxation system.The business community is thriving in Australia in a way that it has not experienced at any time since the end of World War II. The business community in Australia has lower interest rates than it has had for more than 30 years. The business community in Australia now has in prospect a far lower company tax regime. Small business will benefit enormously from the reductions in capital gains tax contained in the Treasurer's policy. Small business has benefited enormously from the industrial relations reforms of my colleague the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. Small business has benefited from many other policies.Of course there are some compliance costs involved; we have never disputed that. If you look at the aggregate, you will find that there is far more on the credit side, there is far more on the plus side. Taxation reform is a great boon for Australian business. Australian business will benefit from tax reform. It will be stronger, more competitive and less costly to run and, indeed, it will boost its profitability over time.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Hindmarsh for her question and I note her interest in these matters. There have been criminal elements very much involved in the latest incidents of people smuggling in Australia. Not only is people smuggling against our law - the law now  imposes penalties involving 20 years jail and fines of up to $220,000 as a maximum for those convicted of smuggling five or more people into Australia, so it is a serious criminal offence in its own right - but it has involved significant intimidation and the use of violence. People have been prepared to provide information and journalists who have been researching these matters have been attacked when obtaining information in this area. Threats have been made against people who have been smuggled into Australia about speaking to Australian officials or police. There is the use of false and stolen passports and bogus documents from various countries. There are reports that efforts have been engaged in to bribe foreign government officials and police and that money laundering occurs as well. The amount of money involved is very large; reports suggest as much as $3 million was received by one individual involved in smuggling a large group of people into Australia recently.Obviously, we are working with other governments under international treaty arrangements for combating organised crime to identify and attack those criminal elements in the trade, but there are others who are used. We have seen people recruited to crew boats to Australia. Obviously, they are being manipulated by organisers. They face significant sentences for their actions. At the moment, there are 45 crew detained in Darwin awaiting trial. There are 18 in Western Australia. Already, there have been some convictions in that area and pleas of guilty. The boats that have come from China are certainly involved in organised criminal activity, both in China and here. We are looking at the linkages here in Australia, particularly with criminal groups here that may be arranging to receive covert arrivals.The AFP have charged two people involved in the onshore party that met the Kayuen, which was intercepted off Port Kembla. Three people in the shore party of the North Queensland boat arrival that came in May are presently before the courts. I assure the House that we take these matters very seriously. It is a whole of government issue. It involves not only my department but also the Australian  Federal Police and other agencies. We are investigating the current crop of people smugglers in Australia and overseas. I am advised that I can expect some further charges to be laid against organisers at various levels.These issues, of course, are complex. It takes time to build up evidence to ensure convictions. But I assure the House that large numbers of people have been detained. The perpetrators of this criminal activity are people whom we will pursue here and abroad to the greatest extent possible to ensure that they are convicted and dealt with in relation to these offences.</DOC>

 - The Deputy Leader of the Opposition used the expression `an adequate response'. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the historic reform of the Australian taxation system is an adequate response to the mess we inherited from Labor when we took over the administration of this country. The reality is that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is a wholesale sales tax man who is still chained to the wholesale sales tax system. If he had an atom of political honesty in him, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would campaign from now until the next election on a platform of bringing back the wholesale sales tax system, bringing back all those rates of 45, 32, 22, and 12 per cent. We all remember the rates very well. They were increased to their present level without warning and despite denials immediately after the 1993 election.Any new taxation system involves transition costs - nobody is denying that. Of course it  involves transition costs. But any new taxation system carries with it enormous benefits. What this taxation system will do will be to reduce business costs by between $7 and $8 billion per year. It will reduce fuel bills by about $3.5 to $4 billion per year. It will reduce the cost of exports from this country by close to $4 billion per year. It carries with it the largest personal income tax cut in Australia's history. We also plan, via the business tax reforms, to bring the rate of company tax down in this country from the present level of 36 per cent to 30 per cent.We intend to bring in unprecedented new benefits for small businesses with turnovers of less than $1 million. That will be of benefit to something like 97 to 98 per cent of all farmers in Australia, as well as to hundreds of thousands of other small business operators. We are abolishing provisional tax. We are introducing other changes which, when you add them up, reduce to minuscule proportions the transition costs involved inevitably in bringing in a new taxation system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Menzies for his question. On 11 November this year the government announced the second stage of business taxation reform. The government indicated that in principle it would accept the high level reform recommended by the Ralph inquiry, sometimes known as option 2, that we would work with business to clarify the concepts behind it and that those reforms would come into effect not before 1 July 2001.In addition, we announced the government's response to remaining integrity measures, in particular integrity measures restricting the alienation of personal services income and integrity measures restricting losses from non-commercial activities. These measures, when taken together with measures previously announced by the government back in Sep  tember of this year, have the effect of making the business tax reform package mildly revenue positive. In the first year there is a cost of some $100 million; in the second year a benefit, additional revenue, of some $700 million; in the third year a cost of some $500 million; and in the fourth year a revenue increase of some $400 million. The consequence of that is that we are accomplishing the historic reform of business taxation in a revenue neutral or, rather, mildly positive way.The Australian Labor Party have been trailing their coat on business taxation all the way throughout this process, saying that they wanted to negotiate and be part of the historic reform of business taxation. They indicated that, if the government accepted the integrity measures which made the package revenue neutral, the Labor Party would be supporting business taxation reform. The government has done that. Now is the time for the Australian Labor Party to do something they find extremely difficult. Now they will have to make a decision, a very difficult matter for the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Hotham. They have been trailing their coats now for several months, saying that if the government announced its position on these integrity measures and if the package became revenue neutral they would be supporting it. We hear this constant refrain: because they cannot make a decision, they need more and more information. Now it is suddenly not enough to have a Treasury costing, it is not enough to have a Ralph costing, and it is not enough to have a revenue positive position. The heat is on Labor now to make a decision. They have been in opposition for four years, and they are yet to make a decision.We know why they keep taking this position - because it is easier to oppose when you have no policy. To actually take a decision and support something requires a policy. The acid comes on to the Leader of the Opposition and his backup man the member for Hotham, fresh back from his sojourn in Paris, to see whether they can finally come out and announce their position on business taxation reform. The truth is that it was the Australian Democrats who were the responsible opposi  tion party on indirect taxation reform. If Labor cannot make a decision, it will be the Australian Democrats who become the responsible opposition party on business taxation reform again.The Senate report comes down at 5 o'clock this afternoon, and the Labor Party ought to have a policy. It ought to have a position. It is up to Labor whether it can be part of positive policy making in this country or whether it sidelines itself from the great historic shift in taxation reform again.</DOC>

 - The position is this. Once the tax policy position was being designed, we have obviously as a government been concerned to ensure that we have a sensible process to assist in the transition to the new arrangements. We set up a Small Business Consultative Committee. We asked them to go out and talk to small business and ask small business what they thought we ought to do by way of education and support in the transition process. Whilst financial support of the sort that has been the subject of questions is part of the response, the small business community have said to us that what they want is quality information, a decent education and information program. Basically that is what we have been putting in place.It is true that we proposed to have a voucher type system. That was an idea that came out of the Small Business Consultative Committee. It will be used to attract discounts on the supply of training services, facilities and the like. So that is a very practical component of this information campaign for small business. But it is much wider than that. For example, the Treasurer recently announced the  immediate expensing of capital equipment purchases to help with the commencement of the GST, worth $175 million - a very good deal for small business. We have also relied upon a network of business organisations with a program worth well over $100 million to get them to go out to their constituencies, including people who are not members of those organisations, to ensure that they have a wealth of relevant information appropriate to their industry sector.We are also running a train the trainer program through a tender process, recognising the fact that we need to bring up to date the skills of people who will actually be carrying out this information program. We have a hotline. - Well, the hotline is very useful. We also have a web site. The Treasurer will correct me, but I think in August that had 2½ million hits and in September 3½ million hits. - Yes. So this is a very comprehensive program for small business. We are confident that it is going to do the job and ensure that we have a smooth transition to the new system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question. I know his electorate has been very significantly impacted upon as a result of the large number of unauthorised arrivals that we have seen in Australia in recent months. The  numbers are very large historically and the composition of groups who have come to Australia has changed significantly. It is a complex issue. It is not altogether new. When people come to Australia unlawfully and have no lawful basis to be in Australia, there is an obligation upon my department to remove such people from Australia as quickly as possible. That sends a very clear and unambiguous message to those who have no lawful basis to be here - that they should not come.In relation to those that come from elsewhere where there may be entitlements that they are able to pursue, that is an issue that I have been raising and pressing in recent days. I am glad to hear that perhaps the opposition is going to support the measures that I have announced in relation to dealing with that question. A clear and unambiguous message is first required in order to engage in an overseas information campaign. Without a message, a campaign is useless. On 29 October, I launched an overseas information campaign targeting the smugglers and those who are using their services. I will table a copy of the campaign documentation which I have sent to all members. Australian diplomatic representatives abroad have been tasked in first asylum areas and transit areas to work with the UNHCR and governments to do whatever is possible to ensure that people smuggling does not destroy the international protection system. This is a high priority for the government. It is urgent and it is ongoing.Earlier this month I visited the People's Republic of China. I met with senior representatives of the government. They reaffirmed to me their continued cooperation in taking strong action against those involved in trafficking. They told me that information they had received from us had been useful in prosecuting people in China and I told them that information that they gave to us was helpful for our being aware of people perhaps coming to Australia. I was informed that the boat that arrived recently at Christmas Island was one that they had not been able to apprehend before it left. They agreed to cooperate with us. They agreed to widely disseminate within China some posters that we had had prepared. Much larger versions of the one I am showing  to the House are able to be distributed with the cooperation of Chinese authorities. I am particularly gratified at receiving that. I table the document.Earlier in the year, the secretary to my department led a delegation to Indonesia of senior officials of the Department of Defence, Customs, Coastwatch, AusAID and the Australian Federal Police to discuss trafficking issues and the strategies to deal with them. Obviously, we will continue these activities with countries in the region and further afield. It has been a high priority of the Australian Ambassador, John McCarthy, with the Indonesian government in recent days. We are going to continue to work through international fora to ensure that these issues are continually raised. I went to a conference in Bangkok where I was able to pursue these matters with a large number of government officials present. I know my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs pursued these matters further in Thailand last week with the Thai government.It is important for honourable members to know that there is strong international support for what we are proposing. In addition to saying on Friday that the refugee convention does not stipulate what kind of visa a sovereign state should issue to refugees in fulfilling their obligations, the UNHCR had this to say:Refugees are particularly vulnerable to 'migration networks', organised criminal rings which have made of human trafficking a most lucrative transnational activity. This people trafficking has taken on enormous proportions. UNHCR is supportive of measures which are designed to minimise such activity while maintaining and strengthening the international refugee protection regime.That is a very important statement about the measures which we are involved in and which should be totally supported by the Australian community. I table that document for the benefit of honourable members.</DOC>

 - It is not a question of other people subsidising; it is a question of the Leader of the Opposition grasping the simple fact that the way a GST operates is that you tax the operator's margin. That is how it operates - at the margin. It does not go to expenses involved in the operations of the casino; it goes to the margin. It is as simple as that. This issue was dealt with extensively before and it remains the case. Of course, the basis of the GST has always been that you tax the margin. We did not hear any criticism of this from the opposition before the high-roller issue arose. They were not running around saying, `You should not tax the margin.' I am quite certain that, if we had not taxed the margin, they would have found a reason to complain about that. The reality is that when you have no policy all you can do is complain. And the Leader of the Opposition is demonstrating that.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Mitchell for his question. It is true that the official Australian Bureau of Statistics figures have come out since we last met and I am pleased to be able to advise the House that we now have a record 8,878,800 people in employment in Australia. The seasonal unemployment rate is 7.1 and trend unemployment has also been continuing its downward trend. That is the equal best figure, Prime Minister, since the middle of 1990. That is an excellent  result and it does speak volumes of the government's reform program. There is no doubt that, when Australia is better managed, more people get a job. Furthermore, you get a higher wage as well as a result of this government's policies.It is worth remembering that, when the Leader of the Opposition was at one stage the minister for employment, unemployment reached 11.2 per cent - a testimony to Labor's mismanagement when they were in power. The fact is that we had an appalling unemployment situation when Labor were in office. That was because Labor were never prepared to grapple with the difficult issues to bring about real reform that would actually have given Australia a better performance. That reminds me of those good words from the former Minister for Health Dr Neal Blewett, who said of the member for Brand that he was `flawed by a streak of the most un-Churchillian timidity'.The fact is that Labor still do not have an employment policy. They promised a policy back in July. Oh, no, they could not produce it then. Then they said they would produce a policy in September. Oh, no, by the time we got to September East Timor was the problem. Then when we said, `Where is your policy?' they said, `Oh, no, we haven't got a policy because we've got the referendum and we cannot have more than one ball in the air at a time.'Apparently there was to be a document prepared by some academics at Monash entitled `Workforce 2010'. It is ready but, oh, no, they cannot release it now. By the time it is released it ought to be renamed `2011' or `2012'. - These are the longest policy documents in the making that we have ever seen in Australian politics. It will be nearly 12 months before we finally see this workplace policy on employment or this employment policy discussion paper.There is no surprise in this. The Leader of the Opposition has been opposition leader for nearly four years, or will have been certainly by the time we ever see this document. When  it comes to actual policy, he struggles to have what it takes to develop a policy that is worth releasing. That is his basic problem. He has got the member for Melbourne with his views about policy, he has got Senator George Campbell who is out there attacking the member for Werriwa's policy and he has got a new member coming in. What is his background? What do you expect? He is another trade union official. He can answer that one in his maiden speech. This is the problem with the Labor Party. As the member for Werriwa said -  - This is my coup de grace, let me finish it surely. - The serious point to be made is that an opposition does have a public responsibility to issue policies. I finish with the words of the member for Werriwa on 20 October, 12 months ago, who said -  - Just picking up on the last part of the question, it was: was I aware of any alternative proposals? This is what the member for Werriwa said on 20 October:In April 1996 Kim Beazley said to me that Australian Labor was falling 10 years behind comparable parties in our policy development and our ideas. Now, that was the case then. We've probably got as much ground to make up now.That was 12 months ago. We want to see your employment policy.</DOC>

 - I am pleased to see that the Labor Party are interested in a tax on a tax because, under their wholesale sales tax, 22 per cent wholesale sales tax is added to the price of a car and stamp duty is put on the tax. In fact, if you want to go through the Labor Party's policy on wholesale sales tax, you first of all add a tariff to an imported car, then you add 22 per cent, including on the tariff, and then you put a stamp duty on the price inclusive of tariff and wholesale sales tax - a tax on a tax on a tax. This system happily went on for 13 years with a tax on a tax on a tax. If they were to get re-elected, they would be bringing back the wholesale sales tax.As I said before, Australia is going to be the chair of the OECD next year. If you were to turn up as the chair of the OECD and give a lecture to the OECD on modern taxation and why France and Germany should abolish value added tax and bring in wholesale sales tax -  - I was just making the point that, at the moment in Australia, you have tax on tax and, in many cases, tax on tax on tax. You asked what we are doing about the state stamp duties. We are in the business of abolishing state stamp duties - something that eluded the Australian Labor Party for 13 years. Did the Australian Labor Party have a policy to abolish stamp duty on shares? Stamp duty on shares is being abolished on 1 July next year. Did the Australian Labor Party have a policy to abolish bed taxes? No. Bed taxes are being abolished from 1 July of next year. Did the Australian Labor Party have a policy to abolish financial institutions duty? No. Financial institutions duty is being abolished from 1 July 2001. Did the Australian Labor Party have a policy to abolish bank account debits tax? No. - It is a very simple point: we are in the process of abolishing state taxes. That is what we are going to do. That is what solves the problem once and for all. I was going through stamp duty on shares. You asked me when: stamp duty on shares, 1 July 2000; bed taxes, 1 July 2000; financial institutions duty, 1 July 2001; followed by bank account debits tax; followed by stamp duties on mortgages; followed by stamp duties on commercial conveyances. - When? You never wanted to abolish stamp duties. I also make this point: all of the stamp duties which the Labor Party were happy to leave in place forever, in perpetuity, applied to the price inclusive of tax. They applied to cars including tax. They applied to houses including tax. They applied to all of the things where the wholesale sales tax applied. We have a provision which will abolish those stamp duties, and in addition, because all of the revenue goes to the states, we have the capacity, if the states profiteer, to pull back on the Commonwealth guarantee, as I have previously indicated. This is the sole policy to address this particular problem - a problem which the Labor Party had no policy of addressing, just like they have no policy on anything.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government is very committed to revitalising rail in Australia. We are planning for the future because it is estimated that our total freight task will double over the next two decades. We cannot have all of that on our roads. We are going to need rail, and we have got an investment package of around $250 million of Commonwealth money, which is being usefully leveraged up all over the country to upgrade the interstate mainline track.The member who asked the question - who, of course, was an extremely good minister for transport in New South Wales - would be well aware that, at this point in time, there is no dedicated freight line through Sydney at all. I recently announced that around half of the federal government's contribution of $250 million in the rail investment program - that is to say, $124 million - will go towards a long overdue dedicated freight line through  Sydney. At the moment, trains can wait for up to 24 hours for the lines to be free of passenger trains. You get massive backlogs, and indeed all of this simply encourages people to put their freight back onto trucks and onto our already congested roads.The total cost of the particular exercise we are talking about here could be anywhere between $500 million and $1 billion, so there is an opportunity for the government's funding to be used to leverage up funding from other sources, quite possibly for a BOOT type arrangement - build, own, operate and transfer. A study by Maunsell-McIntyre to investigate options is under way at the moment and will be completed shortly.I do urge the current New South Wales Minister for Transport to get behind the construction of the line and to recognise the importance of improving access through Sydney. This is vitally important. We have made real progress in fixing up the east-west corridor; in fact, it now has a very high percentage of the freight between Perth and Melbourne. We have been doing things properly. Under a program called One Nation, strangely enough, the ALP put some money into rail. They put taxpayers' money into a stretch of rail on the track at Pura Pura because the average train speed was down to about 70 kilometres an hour. When they had finished doing it up a la Labor Party reform, the trains travelled at about 25 kilometres an hour. We have been getting on with the job. -  - It's true; go and check it. After you had fixed up the railways the trains went slower. Now we have to get the north-south corridor working properly - that is, Melbourne, Sydney, in between and beyond. But I do emphasise this: when it comes to dispersing this money - it is a very important point - for projects in New South Wales, Western Australia and Queensland, until those states conclude satisfactory arrangements with the Australian Rail Track Corporation for single point operations for interstate access, we will not be handing over the money. I again call on the New South Wales Minister for Transport, Carl Scully, to get on with meeting his commitments - to finalise ar  rangements with the ARTC and get on with the job of upgrading the track in New South Wales.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Groom for his question. The Howard government is now rebuilding Australia's apprenticeship system after the appalling run down of that system under the Labor Party. Members of the House will remember that in 1995 the number of apprenticeships and trainees as a  proportion of the work force was the lowest for three decades. I am pleased to inform the House that employers are giving the New Apprenticeships system of the Howard government the very clear thumbs up. They are employing more apprentices than ever before. At the end of June 1999, there were 244,800 new apprentices in training in Australia - nearly a quarter of a million new apprentices - over 100,000 more than in 1996. Two-thirds of these were at higher skill levels. No fewer than two-thirds were at traditional apprenticeship skill levels or higher. This is quality training to solve Australia's skills problems that were exacerbated by the destruction of the apprenticeship system under the Labor Party.Employers' support for the New Apprenticeships system is also evidenced in their support for the New Apprenticeships centres. A recent survey found that 82 per cent of employers were satisfied with the services provided by New Apprenticeships centres. A recent evaluation of the user choice system, which gives employers the opportunity to choose the off-the-job trainer for their apprentices, found that employers strongly supported the increased choice and the quality of services that they were getting through user choice.There is no doubt at all that this government has put into place policies that are reviving job opportunities for young Australians. Youth unemployment is now lower than it has been at any time since the statistics began to be collected in trend figures. The government is committed to addressing Australia's skills needs and to providing real job opportunities for young Australians.</DOC>

 - I have not seen those particular comments, but the government's position is and always has been that residential rents are input taxed. That means that all of the inputs that go into the residential rent are taxed but there is no GST on the rental itself. I suppose if she is referring to a separate agreement which amounts to a rental for furniture and there were a separately identifiable amount then you might be able to make that argument out. But I will look at those comments. - While I am on my feet, Mr Speaker, let me clarify something. As I said in relation to my last answer, bed taxes are abolished on 1 July 2000. Financial institutions duty and stamp duties on shares are abolished from 1 July 2001. - I am clarifying it, Mr Speaker. I may have said that the stamp duties on shares were abolished on 1 July 2000 but that is in fact on 1 July 2001, the same day as the abolition of financial institutions duty.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question and acknowledge his interest in our relationship with China that has been evident over a long period of time. It is important for the House to note that last week China's bid to join the WTO took a significant step forward with its agreement with the United States on their bilateral relationship moving towards its accession into the WTO. Interestingly, going back earlier in the year, Australia concluded our in-principle agreement with China on its  entry to the WTO. It was negotiated by the former Minister for Trade, Mr Fischer, ably assisted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer.There are some significant gains for Australia, and we have supported China's accession to the WTO consistently for that reason. Australia sells a lot of exports to China. China is Australia's fifth largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth $10 billion a year. Our agreement with China will see tariffs and non-tariff barriers slashed, providing a major boost to export access potential worth hundreds of millions of dollars to our economy on an annual basis. In the in-principle agreement that we have concluded with China, tariffs on our exports of manufactured goods will fall from an average of 25 per cent to an average of 10 per cent. Some of the products that will benefit from China's accession that Australia exports to China are alumina, pharmaceuticals, steel, motor vehicles, motor vehicle parts and optical fibre cables. Also, importantly, the tariffs on Australia's farm exports will effectively be halved from 31 per cent to 14½ per cent. So exports of farm produce such as sheepmeat, cheese, oranges, wool and beef will all benefit from China's accession to the WTO. It is for this reason that Australia has actively and energetically supported China's entry to the WTO.We have been encouraging the United States and the European Union, who are yet to complete their in-principle agreement with China, to do so so that we can get on to achieve those outcomes as far as Australia's exporters are concerned. This agreement with the US augurs well for the WTO meeting to start in Seattle in a week's time, where we are seeing a strengthening of the World Trade Organisation and the rules based system.</DOC>

 - The answer to the honourable gentleman's question - and I do remember that he asked me about this yesterday - is that the answer I gave yesterday is the answer I give today: that is, that the structure of this tax is that you pay the tax on the margin. That is the way the tax operates, and what the honourable gentleman is putting forward completely misses the fact that the GST is applied on the margin. In reality the Leader of the Opposition is arguing for a tax on gambling winnings; that is what he wants. Why don't you go out to the working people of Australia and tell them that you want to tax punters' winnings? That is what you want to do. - No, I have not, Mr Speaker; I have one or two things I would like to add. It is not within the capacity of any government to devise a taxation system that prevents one person, one group of people or one corporation in this country from relieving others of expenses they might normally incur. If the Leader of the Opposition is seriously suggesting that sort of a taxation system, then he has really taken leave of his responsibilities.While I am on my feet, I would like to add to an answer I gave yesterday to another question that was asked of me by the Leader of the Opposition. He referred to a question that I received on the Howard Sattler 6PR radio program from a lady by the name of Shirley. I did recall it and I did undertake to check the records. - Mr Speaker, if he wishes to take the point, I am perfectly happy. I will do it at the end. - That is fine by me.</DOC>

 - As is probably well known on this side of the House, one of the great things about the new tax system is that charities are GST free. That means that charities can claim back all of the embedded taxes in prices for things they buy that they currently have to pay for under Labor's tax system. Under Labor's tax system, the WST and fuel excise are embedded in prices and charities have to pay them. Because charities will be GST free under the new tax system, there is no liability on the services they provide and they get back every dollar of embedded tax in their prices. That is a great thing for the charitable sector.As part of the new tax system, the government will be increasing pensions. In advance of the introduction of the new tax system there will be pension bonuses and also bonuses for self-funded retirees. In addition, there will be vouchers available for the charitable sector to help them prepare. Just to give you an idea of some of the prices that are going for preparation in relation to GST, I read in the paper today that IBM and Primus are about to enter into an agreement with the ACTU. Millions of union and superannuation fund members will be offered IBM personal computers and Primus Internet access for less than $10 a week. Isn't that great! If you take that deal, for $12.95 you can have an add-on which will give you a home office bundle which intuits GST-ready quick books.So under the ACTU scheme, you can get GST ready for $12.95 a week. Isn't that great for the ACTU! At $12 a week - that is $144 a year. We thank the ACTU for helping their members to get ready for the GST and to do it at such a cheap price of $12.95. I do not normally spruik for the ACTU, but at $12.95, online, with a computer, ready for the GST! You would not need $200 to get that. You could get it down at the ACTU for about $144.In addition, $10 million has been provided to community groups so far to help them with the implementation of the GST. The Australian Taxation Office is providing an awareness seminar for the non-profit sector commencing on 29 November. The government has a charity consultative committee which is working with the industry to help them get ready. The tax office has a tax reform         information booklet and on the web site at www.taxreform.ato.gov.au there are provisions for the non-profit sector. This is a great step forward for the non-profit sector. For the first time ever, all taxes will be cut back and embedded in prices - never offered under the Labor Party - and there will be pension increases, bonuses, vouchers and, in additon to all that, help to set up the systems which will bring Australia's taxation system into the modern era and take it away from Labor's fascination with a 1932 tax system now well out of date in advanced countries around the world.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, if the member for Lilley had been at the ACROD conference, he would have heard, as he mentioned, that I read out a statement. Obviously, there have been constant negotiations with the government and with the Democrats, but I make the point that it is likely that any grant made by the government to charities will be subject to a GST. The grant would be adjusted to incorporate this and the charity would remit the GST component to the tax office. As the Treasurer succinctly pointed out, if it is a non-commercial service, particularly in relation to services from charities, the GST will not be charged.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parkes for his interest in detention facilities and the maintenance of the policy on mandatory detention of illegal arrivals. I confirm that our facilities are running close to full at the moment. The department continually reviews its contingency plans so that we can match our capacity with the requirements of detaining people who arrive in Australia unlawfully. As part of our planning, we reopened, at the Curtin air base near Derby, Western Australia, the facility that was last used in 1995. It was recommissioned on 26 September and is now close to full.We have the new facility that is being prepared at Woomera in South Australia. The plans there are well advanced. The Woomera site comprises 21 brick accommodation units which initially will be able to accommodate 400 people and is able to be expanded if necessary. The first detainees will be able to be accommodated early next week. The services are delivered for us by Australasian Correctional Management. The cost of estab  lishing Curtin and Woomera is about $10 million. At the current rate of arrivals, just feeding and housing alone will cost in the order of $100 million this financial year. Other programs within my portfolio add to the cost. If we do not have additional arrivals - and that is highly unlikely given the pipeline that we are aware of - it will come to around $150 million. Other agencies also have increased costs.There should be no doubt that the commitment to mandatory detention remains. Costs are incurred whether people are within the community or detained. I do not know of any organisation that ultimately would not say that the government had some responsibility to keep people if they were released into the community, but you would also have other costs that would be considerable, including location costs, if you were going to remove people in addition. Besides, it would be very irresponsible if you were to release people without knowledge that they meet appropriate health, character and security assessments and had a lawful entitlement to be in Australia.The cost of locating people who have been entering Australia unlawfully by releasing them is well beyond the costs that I think would normally be involved in continuing to keep them here in Australia. They are matters on which I would take advice. I could also add that if you were releasing people into the community, that would be exploited by the people smugglers and would only lead to a very significant additional increase over and above the numbers that we have now seen arriving in Australia.For this reason, the government will continue with its policy of mandatory detention and I hope we will continue to enjoy bipartisan support for mandatory detention - it has been bipartisan for a number of years. I assure the House that the government will provide the resources to ensure that we are able to maintain that policy effectively.</DOC>

 - It will not be taxable. To describe it as a gift voucher is perhaps overstating the case: I know it is Christmas time -  -  - It is basically an opportunity for small business. I do not think we have actually announced an amount, so I am not conceding amounts for the moment. There was very good consultation by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. He spoke to small business, and they recommended that they be given the opportunity to purchase assistance. We will be able to take that one step further. We will actually be negotiating with preferred suppliers for discounts. We will be able to say to small business, `If you go to preferred suppliers, you can get discounts and you can apply a government grant to the cost and, in addition to that, the remainder of the cost is fully deductible if you do it before 1 July 2000.' -  - There is a real incentive to go out and do it by 1 July 2000 because not only can you have a preferred supplier and government assistance but also you can get full deductibility. Of course, under Labor Party rules, if you bought new equipment to deal with wholesale sales tax, stamp duties, financial institutions duty, bank account debits tax or higher income taxes, that would be a capital item which would be depreciable over the life of the item. This is fully and immediately expensible with a full tax deduction. If you put that together with the changes for small business that mean that they get input tax credits plus the changes - if the Labor Party can finally make a decision; I know it is a big ask - which would reduce capital gains taxes -  -  - We know you are against reducing capital gains taxes for small business. There would be half capital gains taxes and rollovers for 15-year assets, and small business would have great opportunities in this country. That is the kind of tax system  that the small business community has been asking for for a very long period of time. It will be a great thing for Australia, good for our exporters and, what is more, good for economic growth. So let's get on and create a new taxation system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question and acknowledge her interest in the project. On Saturday last I, along with the Queensland Premier, launched the port of Brisbane motorway project. This is a project worth some $111 million in total. The Commonwealth contribution is $44 million, and that will go to linking the national highway to the port of Brisbane. This is a very welcome development indeed. In fact, it is unique in Australia. No other Australian location can claim a grouping of air, sea, rail and road interchange facilities all on one site in an area where there is an abundance of land - some one thousand hectares or so - for further port development, new business and so forth. I think that this fully integrated interchange facility can make a very substantial difference not just locally in terms of the potential for jobs in that part of Brisbane but, in total, there will be an estimated improvement in the jobs outlook in south-east Queensland of around 30,000 new jobs.I think it is also true to say that it takes us further towards the point in this country where ports compete with ports, to the great advantage of all exporters. It is one thing to point to our outstanding record in waterfront reform, but each port is in fact a chain with several linkages in it - from freight forwarders through to government instrumentalities, road and rail interchange and what have you - and what you really need to do to make one chain at a given port compete effectively and reduce costs to the greatest degree possible is make it compete with another port. What we have  seen here is a commitment to the federal government to further efficiencies and further competitiveness for our export sector. This will be the largest urban renewal project at a local level in Brisbane since World Expo 88 revitalised South Bank a decade ago. It is worth making the point that it capitalises on other initiatives in the region, including the $3 billion - $3,000 million - reconstruction of the Pacific Highway between Brisbane and Newcastle and a range of other very important infrastructure projects that are making a real difference.</DOC>

 - Obviously the honourable member has never been in small business. He ought to listen to his wife, who reckons that unfair dismissal laws ought to be changed for small business. I have not seen those comments, but I can tell the House that when we had the Bell committee going around the country asking about tax compliance - and obviously working on the system that Labor had when in office - I think their report was that it would take three or four hours a week to comply with Labor's tax system. So, if this bloke is reckoning one hour a week, I can tell you that that is a big improvement. - I think he has a lot of explaining to do to the small business community as to why he does not support halving the capital gains tax, which, I can tell you, a lot of small business people would like to see. - The good thing for everybody else is that, with good policies for small business, they go out and create jobs, which is one of the reasons that we want to see the small business community getting a much better tax system. As we know, the small business community has strongly supported tax reform and there are a wealth of benefits for the small business community in the changes that we are introducing. Obviously there will be transition costs for small business. - People are going to have to get used to a new way of doing things. Clearly, that is far preferable to sticking with an old system which has penalised small business and job creation generally. We have a very comprehensive program in place. I think it is true too that small business people are now starting to turn their minds to GST implementation, which is a good thing. We have the biggest information and education program ever implemented in Australian political history in respect of putting the necessary information to the small business community. We believe that we are making real headway.I note that the ACTU have just done a deal to make sure that every worker has access to the Internet. On the system that they are putting in place people will be able to have access to the software necessary for the GST. So even the ACTU are getting in on it.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. I acknowledge her wonderful dedication to creating opportunities for the young people in the electorate of Gilmore. This government believes in expanding opportunities for Australians to lift their skill levels by accessing quality education and training. The purpose of the current Australian National Training Authority agreement has been to expand places in TAFE. In order to achieve this the Commonwealth, with the states - despite the tremendous fiscal problems that the Labor Party left us with - has undertaken to maintain spending in real terms if those places are increased. At the start of the agreement it looked as though we might be able to get an increase of some 70,000 extra places in TAFE. I am pleased to inform the House that it now appears that under the current ANTA agreement this increase is likely to be 160,000 - 160,000 additional places in TAFE for Australians. This reflects the commitment of the great majority of the states and territories -  -  - to education and training opportunities for their citizens. There is only one dull spot in this record, and that is the Carr government in New South Wales. -  - The largest state training system has managed to deliver a miniscule increase in curriculum hours of about 1.3 per cent over the whole period of the current ANTA agreement, compared with an average  of 9.3 per cent across Australia. Had New South Wales performed at the same level as the other states and territories there would now be another 30,000 places in TAFE in New South Wales. That is an appalling failure on the part of the Carr government. In addition, during the period in which the Commonwealth has been maintaining spending in real terms, the Carr government has been cutting spending on TAFE. In 1998, the New South Wales government cut its recurrent spending by over $8 million, according to the official statistics of the NCVER. All the evidence is that the Carr government has continued to run down TAFE expenditure in New South Wales and it is falling in real terms.What this demonstrates is that there is a lack of commitment on the part of the Carr government to expanding opportunities. What this country needs are governments in all the states and territories that are committed to giving people the skills that Australia needs to get jobs and to compete in the world. This government is committed. Let us see the same level of commitment on the part of the Carr government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. We have some very good news on measles notifications around Australia. In 1993-94, we reached the  peak of notifications, with 9,500 children being notified as having had measles. This, for a disease for which there has been a readily available vaccine since 1968, is completely unacceptable. It peaked in Queensland in 1994, with nearly 2,500 cases of measles and in New South Wales the year previously with 2,300 cases of measles.So far this year, we have had under 270 cases of measles for the whole of Australia. Queensland, which at its peak was 2,500, is now 30. New South Wales, at its peak over 2,300, is at 75. This is even more impressive when you consider that Australia was informed by the World Health Organisation that around this time we could expect a measles epidemic. In Victoria earlier this year, we had a very small outbreak in teenage children, with less than 100 cases. This would have gone on to a full national epidemic. The University of Sydney has estimated that 17,500 people would have got measles.This change is due to the measles eradication campaign that we ran last year between August and November. I now have the evaluation of that. It is the largest national public health campaign we have run in Australia since 1956, which was our last polio vaccination campaign. The National Centre for Immunisation Research has judged the campaign an outstanding success. About 1.7 million children five to 12 years of age were vaccinated during this three-month period. That is 96 per cent of all children. That was done with individual parental consent for each case. About 1.3 million of these children were vaccinated in 8,800 schools around Australia. A sero-survey after the campaign, where we test the blood and look for the level of immunity, showed that in six- to 12-year-olds 94 per cent are now immune to measles compared with 84 per cent prior to the campaign.We took adverse events very seriously because this is something that is often raised in cases of vaccination. In 1.7 million vaccinations, we had 89 adverse events. However, half these were not serious enough to seek medical or other health attention. So the chances of having an adverse event that will require you to see a doctor or go to a hospital were one in 38,000. This is an extraordinarily  low rate of adverse events and shows that this concern was unfounded. I am pleased to be able to inform honourable members that, of the children who have had adverse events, all have made a complete recovery.The campaign is the most successful public health campaign we have run in over 40 years in this country. It was a very complex campaign requiring state governments, territories, doctors, other immunisation providers and schools to all work together with the support of groups such as Rotary International.

 - I made a statement on this last week. I said that the government expects that underlying inflation would average in the year 2000-2001 at 2½ per cent, that the one-off price impact in that year from tax changes would be 2¾ per cent and that the CPI for that year would be 5¼ per cent. That is the first round effect in relation to the GST. Thereafter, prices would begin falling as embedded taxes are taken out. The overall price effect is less than the long-term overall price effect that the government indicated at 1.9 per cent. From memory, it is 1¾ per cent, which is actually less than what was put out during the election campaign at 1.9 per cent. Admittedly, there have been changes in relation to the coverage of the GST as a result of changes negotiated in the Senate and the consequences that were put together.In relation to the Macquarie Bank, no, I have not seen the Macquarie Bank surveys. I think most of the private sector forecasters believe that those put out by the Treasury are generally more accurate. Certainly the ones I put out are those put together by the Treasury.  The underlying inflation rate of 2½ per cent for 2000-2001 is still well within the range that the government has been targeting of two to three per cent. The government has outperformed that range essentially since it came to office.Inflation has averaged in the one per cents since this government came into office. Compare that with the 1980s. During the decade of the 1980s -  - As I recall, from the beginning of 1983 we were under a Labor administration and inflation averaged 8.2 per cent for the whole decade. While we are thinking about it, at the end of that decade, in 1990, as I recall, unemployment peaked at 11.2 per cent. The then minister for employment was the Leader of the Opposition.He has a record - 11.2 per cent unemployment - so they made him finance minister. In his two years as finance minister - his reward for all of his great efforts on unemployment - he accumulated in two budgets $23,000 million of deficit. That is a record which may never be equalled by a finance minister in Australian history.</DOC>

 - May I thank the honourable member for Barker, who raised this issue with me during a recent visit in his electorate. The Farm Family Restart Scheme has certainly been a successful innovation by this government to assist farmers during periods of crisis. Previously, when difficult times came, farmers were often pressured to make a decision about the future of their family farm without professional assistance and with no breathing space to overcome their business problems or to address the social impact of the decisions they  needed to make. There was really no effective safety net available for farmers in hardship.With the Farm Family Restart Scheme, this government has addressed the problem and provided income support for farmers for up to a year in these circumstances, supplemented with professional business advice. Farmers have also had access to social security benefits such as the health care card. Where farms are no longer viable, farmers can choose the option of a re-establishment grant worth up to $45,000 to help establish themselves in a future off the farm.The final date for applications for these re-establishment grants was due to be next week. I am pleased to inform the House that the government has decided to extend the application date for the re-establishment grants until 30 June 2000. Already, almost 3,000 families have taken advantage of the Farm Family Restart Scheme, and 240 farmers have been able to access the re-establishment grants. This extension of the date will help more farmers to take advantage of this excellent program which has certainly provided real help to people in rural communities facing major difficulties. I thank the honourable member for Barker for his interest in this issue.</DOC>

 - Obviously the question was written. The answer was given just a moment ago and he did not think to change the written question. As I said, the comparable CPI figure has been revised down, not up - down to 1¾. The figure was 1.9. It is no revision upwards if it comes down to 1¾. To put it in decimals, just so you understand, 1¾ is 1.75, and 1.75 is less than 1.9; 1.9 is greater than 1.75 so if you revise it from 1.9  to 1.75 you are revising it down. As I also said in answer to the last question - but of course that was written by one of your staff before they heard the last question, and you asked it notwithstanding - one of the principal reasons for that was the exclusion of food. It came down from 1.9 to 1¾, principally because of the exclusion of food. That is the effect of the package - 1¾.There is another point which we have also always made clear. Again, I made it clear in a speech last week which you may have missed because you were in Paris at the Socialist International meeting with French socialists who have a value added tax and German socialists who have a value added tax and British socialists who have a value added tax. In the speech I made last week which you may have missed and which may not have been reported at the Socialist International conference in Paris - although I am surprised Jospin did not get up and refer to the support in Australia for a GST - I also made the point that with the impact of a GST the full price impact takes effect and then, as the embedded taxes are removed in relation to wholesale sales tax and others, the reductions flow through. So you have the cost impact flowing through initially and then over a period of time embedded taxes coming back. As was always made clear in the ANTS package and in the Senate inquiry, after the full package has taken effect the comparable figure to the 1.9 is 1¾.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for La Trobe for his question and for his interest in this issue, which I think concerns all members of the House and the Australian community - that is, doing what we can as a country to try to get rid of the scourge of landmines. We have signed the Ottawa treaty. We were amongst the first countries to sign that treaty, which has now been signed by 136 countries, to get rid of landmines and we have begun the process in  Australia of destroying the landmines held by the Australian Defence Force.Today I took the opportunity to launch the government's initiative Destroy-a-Minefield. This is a scheme which will enable all Australians - individuals, schools, community groups, businesses and other types of associations - to make a direct contribution to alleviating the suffering caused by landmines. The scheme will be focused on Cambodia, the country in our part of the world which is the worst affected by landmines. It will enable various community groups to adopt active minefields selected by the United Nations as having a high priority for clearance.Funding raised by the community will be matched by contributions from the federal government. The contributions from the federal government will come from, inter alia, the sales tax revenue raised from Elton John's Candle in the Wind CD, which was released at the time of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. For every $2 raised by the public, the Commonwealth government will match that with a further $1. This campaign is estimated to raise something in the vicinity of $1.2 million.Mr Speaker, I would like to take the opportunity to say in front of all members of the House that I would like all members in their individual electorates to promote this Destroy-a-Minefield campaign. Frankly, whether your electorate is a Liberal electorate, a National electorate, a Labor electorate or an Independent electorate - I think I have covered the waterfront there - there will be a genuine concern about the issue of landmines and there will be a strong feeling amongst people that they would like to contribute. I would urge all members to make a contribution. A kit will be sent around to members to help them with the launch of the program.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, this is a good question from the people who constantly raised the price of fuel for regional Australians and who knew no approach to fuel other than to continually jack up the price. - The Leader of the Opposition knows that it is quite impossible, within a matter of five seconds I think -  -  - 14 seconds, I am corrected - to determine whether or not an answer is relevant to the question. - We would do well to recall the 1993 election, when we were promised that they could -  - I will listen to the answer. - In light of all of this I have to say that we are still waiting for their new-found spokesman for the bush to repudiate the claim of the member for Dickson -  - If this is a matter of relevance -  - then I am quite happy for the Leader of the Opposition to resume his seat and I will so rule. The minister understands the obligation he has to answer the question and I call on him to do so. - Thank you, Mr Speaker. This is directly relevant because it comes to the point that he has failed to repudiate the claim by the member for Dickson that our cut to diesel fuel excise - our cheaper fuel - is nothing more than a boost to pollution. - Members on my left would facilitate the chair enormously if they were silent enough to allow me to listen to what the minister has to say. I will, as the chair always has, require the minister's answer to be relevant to the question. - Mr Speaker, from that I highlight the fact that our objective with tax reform is to reduce the price of fuel. The price of business fuel in this country will be reduced and there is no need for the price of petrol to rise.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Bradfield for his interest in this important matter. Mr Speaker, on 5 July this year a consumer rang the ACCC's GST hotline, which is 1300 302 502, and complained that a company called Australian Taxation Information Services, or ATIS, was distributing forms, which were very similar to Australian Taxation Office forms, to small businesses asking them to pay $175 for one year's registration or $295 for two years registration in order for them to secure an Australian business number. These forms were sent to 20,000 small businesses, including some in the electorate of the member for Bradfield. Businesses were misled into believing that ATIS was associated with the Australian Taxation Office and that these payments were necessary to register under the GST.On 16 July, the ACCC successfully prosecuted ATIS through the courts. They were fined $5,000 and the defendant, Michael Phillip Ivanoff, was ordered to write to all 20,000 businesses to inform them that ATIS had no association with the Australian Taxation Office and that the money would be returned. The defendant, Mr Ivanoff, failed to do this. Subsequently, he was prosecuted and has been sent to jail for three months. This is the first significant prosecution involving a GST scam. This reinforces the fact that people trying to take advantage of consumers during the conversion to the new taxation system will be severely fined and, if necessary, sent to jail. All Australian consumers will be watching carefully as Australian business helps to implement the new taxation system, and all Australian consumers will continue to police what is a far better taxation system than the hotchpotch provided by the Australian Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I do not recall seeing that particular piece of literature. I cannot assume that it exists. It may or may not have existed. But we made it very plain that we would reduce the price of fuel by the estimated impact of the GST and that when the GST was then payable it would always be reclaimable by a business. The fact of the matter is that we are for cheaper business fuel. We are for arrangements in this country which will see the cost of delivering things to rural areas, including fuel, come down, not go up, just as we are for arrangements on fuel taxation which will mean the cost of exporting - which is what we do in rural communities - will come down. We are for lower fuel taxes. You are for higher fuel taxes. Your spokesman for the bush over there has failed.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Corangamite for his question. I think that every member of this House recognises the interest that the member for Corangamite has always shown in Australia's automotive industries, particularly as one of Australia's significant exporters. We have seen in recent times some quite extraordinary results as far as the export of Australian automotive pro  ducts across the world is concerned, particularly into South America and into the Middle East.I would like to inform the House that last week, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I was in Thailand to participate in a joint ministerial meeting with our counterparts in Thailand, Dr Supachai and Dr Surin. As part of that, we took with us a delegation from Australia's automotive industry to conduct a joint automotive working group in Bangkok. The result of that mission was quite extraordinary, given the recent circumstances of the economies in South-East Asia. As a result of the automotive mission that we travelled with, the industry is set to deliver into Thailand additional automotive exports in the order of $40 million over the next 12 months to two years. We have also set up the prospect, as far as Australia's exports are concerned, of supplying gas conversion kits for nearly 1,000 buses to the Bangkok Metropolitan Transit Authority fleet. That has come out of those discussions, with the opportunity to design and construct 175 new gas-powered buses for the new rail feeder service in Thailand.It was a very successful visit over a couple of days. The automotive delegation was led by the Prime Minister's special envoy for the automotive industry, Mr Ian Grigg, who is doing an excellent job in establishing linkages and facilitating business for the Australian automotive sector. Also, as part of the visit to Thailand, the Thai government has confirmed that from 1 January 2000 it will remove local content requirements from its automotive sector. Of course, whilst we were there both the foreign minister and I, in the bilateral discussions we had with our counterparts, pressed the point with the representatives from the Thai government with regard to the reduction of the automotive tariff barriers that exist in Thailand, and certainly we were given a very good hearing in that regard. We have seen the Thai government reduce dramatically the tariff barriers to a number of products this year. We feel confident that they will also do that in the near future for the automotive industry and that we will see more exports of  automotive components and vehicles out of Australia into that all-important market.A point to finish on is that our Australian automotive industry have achieved these great outcomes under difficult circumstances - a difficult economy and a difficult economic climate in the region. But they have also done it while they are still carrying the burden of Labor's wholesale sales tax. Come the middle of next year they will be doing it with much less burden and they will be much more competitive as a result of the policies of our government.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The government did not - and nor did I, as part of the government - deliberately mislead the Australian people. Right from the outset of this East Timor exercise, the government has made very clear its concerns about the behaviour of the Indonesian military in East Timor. When I met with Ali Alatas around 23 February this year - it might have been a day or two different from that, but it was approximately that date - I made the point to Mr Alatas that we were very concerned about what we had heard of the relationship between the military and the militias. That was the first time at my level that we made that representation to the Indonesian foreign minister, because from recollection it was the first time I met the Indonesian foreign minister following the change in Indonesian policy towards East Timor. Subsequently we made around 120 different representations to the Indonesian government about violence in East Timor and we made it perfectly clear, publicly and privately, to the Indonesians that the violence in East Timor was the responsibility of the Indonesian authorities and the Indonesian military. We made 120 representations and we organised a summit in Bali for the Prime Minister to meet with President Habibie when General Wiranto was there. Ali Alatas was there and the Minister for Defence and I were there. These issues were discussed at great length and at that summit the Prime Minister  pressed President Habibie for an international peacekeeping force in East Timor. The point is this: we were always concerned about these issues and we took action.I saw the honourable member making his point in a doorstop earlier today and it follows on from the absurd, selective and intellectually very dishonest article by his friend Mr Lyons. The simple fact is that in that article and in your doorstop there is not a single reference to the fact that we made 120 representations about these issues, that we organised a prime ministerial presidential summit and that we prepared the Australian Defence Force from early this year in order to be able to move to East Timor as circumstances permitted. When finally it was possible to do it, we did it. This government is a government which will always proudly have on its record the fact that it changed Australian policy on East Timor, that it helped give the people of East Timor a chance to decide their own future and that it brought peace and security to East Timor when it happened. It does not matter what the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Kingsford-Smith, John Lyons or any of those people ever say: they will never take that away from Australia and they will never take that away from this government. We stand proudly by our record, and it is much appreciated by the people of East Timor.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fairfax for his question. He probably has in mind the survey of small business which was released today by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. What it showed was that general business conditions have improved in the most recent quarter and the expectation is for further improvement in the next quarter. - I am pleased to see that the Labor Party takes such great interest in conditions improving for small business. I am sure that the Labor Party welcomes good economic news as much as the government does. The sales revenue for small business improved in the most recent quarter. The findings were that profits in the small business sector recovered during the last quarter. There are indications of employment growth continuing in the small business sector. That is good for jobs, with unemployment now at 7.1 per cent. If we continue economic growth at a decent level, it could fall further. All members of the House welcome the fact that it is down from 11.2 per cent unemployment rates under the then minister for employment, the current Leader of the Opposition, who has the modern Australian record for unemployment of 11.2 per cent.The mid-year economic and fiscal outlook will be released tomorrow, I hope, if it is back from the printers in time. As the Prime Minister indicated yesterday, what that will show is that, whilst there have been some enormous costs to the budget from East Timor, the budget will be able to fund those costs in the current financial year. The East Timor levy is for the next financial year, 2000-01. There have been additional costs in relation to that year arising partly from the Senate's demands to change the government's tax package, costing approximately $1.8 billion. There is about $0.5 billion in respect of interest on public debt, which is an additional expense because of those other expenses. There is also the putting back of the second Telstra instalment. The government has made it clear that it intends to keep the budget in surplus. We believe that just as putting the budget into surplus when we were elected in 1996 from the $10 billion deficit that the Labor Party was running at that time insulated us against the Asian economic and financial crisis, it is important to keep budget surpluses and to keep the reduction of debt going in the Commonwealth.They are the important fiscal parameters with which the government has been dealing in the mid-year review. Again it is a first, under this government. The Charter of Budget  Honesty legislation requires mid-year reporting. It will detail our first forecasts for 2000-01 when it is released, which I hope will be tomorrow.</DOC>

 - The opposition do not have a very good record on R&amp;D. They are the ones who operated the syndicated rorts that this government had to come in and fix up. What is happening in terms of R&amp;D in this nation is that the government is running a particularly good science and research program. It is one in which the public sector is spending more than in the average OECD country by a long chalk. In fact, the amount of money we are spending in the public sector is a very great credit to the government. What is falling down is private investment in research and development. - The deputy leader should not talk about tax concessions and R&amp;D. You are the old rort merchant. Remember that. There were the deals in the back of the Rolls Royce. The record of the government in this area is outstanding.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and recognise the interest and concern he has about this issue, as indeed do many members of the House. The government, through our overseas posts, has launched a wide-ranging international campaign against people smuggling. We have been particularly engaged with authorities and with the police in both Indonesia and China. The Australian ambassador to Indonesia, John McCarthy, has discussed the issue with the new Indonesian ministers for legal and constitutional affairs and defence. Both of them acknowledge the problem, and they have been receptive to further cooperation. Indeed, the Jakarta police have told us that they recently broke into a passport forgery ring and seized 180 passports, 55 visa stamps, hundreds of blank visa labels and false identifications from a document forger.The House will be familiar with the fact that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs recently visited China. He received reaffirmations of Chinese support and cooperation in cracking down on people smuggling rackets. Other relevant posts, including Amman, Athens, Bangkok, Islamabad and Tehran, are raising with their host governments Australia's serious concerns and are asking for cooperation in stamping out the trade. They have also been disseminating information kits outlining Australia's position and the dangers and new penalties involved.When I was in Nakhon Si Thammarat last week in Thailand I discussed increased cooperation in this field with the Thai government. The Thai authorities have, for some time, been very cooperative and in two major raids in September seized over 1,000 counterfeit passports as well as document producing equipment. So the government is very active in this area and we will continue that activism to ensure that our efforts are successful.</DOC>

 - I am confident that the government's policies in research and development will be successful under the new regime, as they have been under the old, not only in terms of the gross amount but in relation to the various innovations that we have brought to research and development in Australia, particularly the Innovation Investment Fund, which I regard as one of the great successes in the R&amp;D field. On top of that there are the new changes that we made to pooled development. Under the pooled development scheme we have been able to encourage small companies -  - I was listening to the minister's reply. I was, I admit, in conversation with the clerk during the last 15 seconds of the minister's reply. Prior to that he had been entirely relevant and I invite him to continue his reply, relevant to the answer. - Mr Speaker, I was pointing out to the opposition the many benefits of research and development that the government has brought about by way of use of the Innovation Investment Fund, the Pooled  Development Fund and the Technology Diffusion Program. - I had no reason to interrupt the minister's reply when he had barely uttered one sentence. I call him to continue his reply. - Mr Speaker, I was speaking before about the Innovation Investment Fund, the Pooled Development Fund and the Technology Diffusion Program. All of these have given research and development a great leg-up in Australia. In relation to the GST application to the research and development funds, I will take that on notice and report back to you.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question and for his continuing interest in this question of people smuggling and people entering Australia unlawfully, in particular those who may have had opportunities to make claims or applications in other countries. The fact is that Australia has not been alone in facing significant numbers of arrivals. People have attempted to use the refugee process as a means of obtaining residence, often in a country of choice, without taking reasonable steps to avail themselves of protection elsewhere and sometimes already having it available to them, abandoning it and seeking to make those claims again in Australia. Some people have also made other repeated attempts to gain  unauthorised entry to Australia. On occasions they have even claimed a different identity or a different nationality. It was recently reported to me that one of the ACM - that is, the Australian correctional services personnel who had previously been in Villawood - recognised a person detained in Curtin in Western Australia who had been removed from Australia as an unsuccessful asylum claimant from Iran and who was now claiming to be from Iraq.It is quite clear that there are many people who arrive undocumented. Many have destroyed travel documents en route and have deliberately endeavoured to frustrate our attempts to establish their true identities. I am sure honourable members will recall recently that, when one of our defence vessels was approaching a boat in the seas north of Australia, people were seen to be throwing documents overboard as the Navy came by. It was, unfortunately, too late to try and retrieve them. It was a situation where clearly people were trying to frustrate our ability to identify them clearly.Our identification powers are clearly out of date. We need to access the latest technologies, and I am sure honourable members will be pleased to know that the government is moving to redress this gap. The legislation is now in the process of being drafted to strengthen our identification powers under the Migration Act and to allow biometric testing of unauthorised arrivals and asylum seekers. This will enable us to identify people trying to exploit the protection arrangements by assuming false identities. It is proposed that the legislation will include mandatory fingerprinting and the latest technologies such as DNA testing, face, palm and retinal recognition, as well as voice testing. The proposed new identification powers will bring us in line with the provisions made in many European countries, Britain and the United States in relation to these identification techniques.By comparing biometric data collected from other countries, we should be in a position to quickly confirm the identity of people who already have another protection available to them. It will also enable us to identify people who have sought to enter Australia unlawfully  under another identity, and it will enable us to have information here to identify clearly people who may be doubling back. This legislation will be important. We are drafting it as quickly as possible, and I would hope that the parliament would afford it quick passage when I have it ready.</DOC>

 - I am not aware of that report, but I am profoundly indebted to the member for Dobell for asking me that question because it enables me to point out a few salient features about the GST. To start with, the states get it all. The states get all of the GST. Every last dollar of the GST goes to the states, and that, my good friend, is why they signed up with alacrity. One after the other, they queued up. Bob Carr said, `This is outrageous. Where do I sign, John?' Peter Beattie said, `This is terrible. I will fight it to the last vote. Where do I sign?' They went on and on.This is the greatest deal that the states of Australia have had since World War II in relation to revenue sharing. This reverses the trend that began with the imposition of uniform taxation as a wartime measure in 1942. This will provide the only basis for an expansion of revenue so that the states can provide the services. The greatest beneficiaries of the GST are the state governments of Australia, because what the states will have is something that they have pleaded for for years, and that is access to a growth tax. Year  after year, they came: Bolte, Bjelke-Petersen and both generations of the Courts. On they came, saying, `Will you please give us access to a growth tax?' And it was the coalition government that finally did that. This is a great investment in the federal future of Australia. There will be more money available for government schools. There will be more money available for public hospitals. Prudent state governments have grabbed hold of this, and they will help themselves to the bounty of the GST.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Riverina for her question. I know she has a very strong interest in this subject because of two very important defence facilities based in Wagga Wagga - Forest Hill and Kapooka. The Prime Minister's announcement yesterday that we are going to increase the planned full-time strength of the Army from 23,000 to 26,000 and the Air Force's planned strength to 13,555, with an additional 555 added to the Air Force, means more career opportunities for young Australians. I think we all agree that the Australian Defence Force provides excellent, and also accredited, training and education for many young Australians. Our ongoing recruiting, together with the numbers that we require to add to our additional infantry battalions and to combat support and airfield defence in the Air Force, means that there are some 5,000 full-time, and a similar number of part-time, recruits required this financial year. We will be transferring existing personnel from other roles in the ADF, and reservists will also be transferring to the regular force.There are clearly substantial opportunities for young Australians to start their careers in defence. Our key recruiting age is between 17 and 24. The number of Australians in this age group is falling, and these young people are also in great demand from the private sector,  which presents very significant challenges to us. That is why we are planning to use Employment National and Manpower, two large private recruiting firms, to help us meet this target. That will let us reach out to people who may not have thought of defence as a career option, rather than waiting for them to walk into a Defence Recruiting office.In Wagga Wagga, in the member for Riverina's electorate, Kapooka, the `Home of the Soldier', will see many more fine young Australians arriving to receive their basic entry level training, which is designed to build their skills and their confidence. I also know that the member for Riverina and the people of Riverina and Wagga Wagga will be very pleased to hear that, because they are very supportive of the Defence community and have given them great support throughout the years.It is also important to make this point to the House: not only will these young Australians be provided with excellent training and challenging career opportunities, but a 19-year-old private will receive a gross income package equivalent to around $41,000, not including any field or deployment allowances. This taxable income of over $32,000 puts them in the top 50 per cent of income earners in this country - that is a 19-year-old private in the Army. The other thing is that it puts them in the top five per cent of income earners in their age group. We not only give them excellent skills and training, but also extremely good remuneration.The motto of Defence Recruiting, to do something for yourself and something for your country, is very relevant, because we see those skills in our Defence Force every day both here in Australia and overseas. I would hope that those on the other side of the House would support the recruiting drive to achieve the target that this government has set for our Defence Force to increase our capabilities.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dobell for his question. I have seen a lot of reports about the reaction in the community to the GST and the new taxation system. There are critics of the system; there are also many in the business community and generally who, although they recognise that there will be transitional challenges - and the government has never pretended otherwise - understand the long-term benefits to the Australian economy and the Australian community of taxation reform are very significant.The honourable gentleman talks about independent schools. As it happens, I have not seen that comment by the Australian Parents Council, but let me say this in relation to non-government schools: I do not think any government in the history of this country has  a better record than the one I lead in providing choice for people to go to non-government schools. There is a level of choice available to Australian parents now at all income levels. The really big change is that we have made it easier for people on lower incomes to choose an independent school. That is what we have done. We have not just reinforced the capacity of people at high levels of income to send their children to independent schools. By abolishing your discriminatory New Schools Policy we have made it possible for the independent schools to burgeon in the lower income area. I would have thought a Labor government would have been interested in that, but a Labor government was not. - Mr Speaker, I was asked a question about the attitude of the Australian Parents Council. The Australian Parents Council is the peak body for parents who send their children to independent schools. I was therefore talking about the attitude of those parents towards the funding support they receive from this government, and their attitude is one of great gratitude.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for McPherson for her question. As members of the House will know, this government has given top priority to making sure that every child leaves primary school able to read and write properly. When we came to office, some 30 per cent of Australian schoolchildren were unable to read and write at a level that would allow them to continue successfully with their education. This was a problem which snowballed during Labor's years in office. In fact it was during the period when the Leader of the Opposition was education minister that this problem was drawn to the attention of the government in the Youth in Transition  surveys and the Leader of the Opposition connived in the suppression of this information. He was not willing to make available to Australian parents information about the lack of literacy skills in Australian schools. -  - Didn't you know about the report? - Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Leader of the Opposition was as useless in this area as he was as Minister for Finance and, as a result, a generation of young people suffered as he sat on information which would have alerted Australians to the problem which we discovered when we came into office. His education policy was a farce, as we know, and the member for Werriwa walked right away from that policy. -  - He has no credibility whatever in this area. -  - It has fallen to this government to address the appalling problem of literacy and numeracy left to Australia by the former Labor government. -  - This year students in all states and territories have been assessed against the national literacy standards established by this government under the National Literacy Plan. The first of these assessments is now coming through and today the government of Western Australia has released results for that state. The results show that overall some 14 per cent of year 3 and 16 per cent of year 5 students were below the national standards in literacy. For indigenous students, between 45 and 49 per cent were below the national literacy standards.These may not be pleasing facts to parents in the community but I congratulate the Western Australian government for having the courage to put on the record the facts which the Labor Party in power has never been prepared to tell parents in the community. There is a real sense in these figures that they are actually an improvement on last year's figures because of the enormous effort which is now going in across Australia to making sure that young people get decent literacy and numeracy skills.The Leader of the Opposition is totally out of touch in this area. He did nothing when he was education minister and he released an education policy in the last election campaign which had four lines on literacy and numeracy. He is not serious in relation to education and it is no wonder the member for Werriwa walked right away from his policies. It is time for him to stop waiting for the Australian Education Union to post him the Labor Party's education policy and to make a commitment to supporting the National Literacy Plan.</DOC>

 - The correct assessment of the price impact of GST is that which was published through the government's model as part of its A New Tax System. -  - I have never seen people so disappointed, because the government is introducing a first home owners scheme, which will give young couples the opportunity to get a grant to equalise out that cost. The grant to young couples who have not bought a house before, who get a benefit from the first home owners scheme, will be enough for young home buyers to put a deposit down and to buy a house. Won't that be a great thing as part of the government's taxation reform? It is a new first home owners scheme - young couples will get assistance to  put down a deposit and buy a home, and the news gets better. No wonder he interjects! - The good news that the Leader of the Opposition just tried to stop was that not only will the first home owners scheme give young couples a deposit and they will be able to buy their house with that deposit but home loan interest rates now at 6.8 per cent - down from 10½ per cent under the Labor Party - mean that they can afford to keep their home. Isn't that a great thing for the young couples of Australia? We know that the Labor Party likes wholesale sales tax and we know that the Labor Party has been having wholesale sales tax on building materials without compensation, and I was really taken by what I saw the Leader of the Opposition say this morning - although he does not want to be reminded, Mr Speaker. - With the introduction of GST, wholesale sales tax on building materials will be abolished. You have to deduct that. It was the Labor Party that had wholesale sales tax on building products. He does entertain our days, Mr Speaker. He went out and did a doorstop this morning. He said, `The old wholesale sales tax was a dream compared with what we now have.' Nought per cent, 12 per cent, 22 per cent, 32 per cent, 41 per cent, 46 per cent. He had it on toothpaste but not on toothbrushes. That was an  absolute dream! Can't you see these guys, down there in Paris at the Socialist International, looking at the French socialists and saying, `You ought to oppose value added tax. You need a modern wholesale sales tax.' - Mr Speaker, I was just making the point that if you do not have a goods and services tax you have a wholesale sales tax. I do not think that there is a developed country in the world that has wholesale sales tax. If you went to the Socialist International, as the shadow Treasurer did last week, and you stood up and you said to the Blair Labour government, `You don't need value added tax; you need a modern 1932 wholesale sales tax' - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his question. I remind the House that on 29 July this year wholesale sales tax on TVs, cameras, videos and a range of other goods was reduced from 32 per cent to 22 per cent. So even then we were simplifying the wholesale sales tax for the Labor Party. Since the introduction of the ANTS package in July, the ACCC has monitored 34,000 prices of wholesale sales tax decreases in 548 outlets in 112 towns right across Australia. On the first wave of analysis, there was a 90 per cent compliance rate. On the second wave, it was a 99 per cent compliance rate and, on the third wave, it will be a 100 per cent compliance rate. This extensive price monitoring during the introduction of the new taxation system by the ACCC is sending a message to all businesses that the ACCC is actively working with the community to ensure that the full benefits of the new taxation system are passed through to consumers. Of course, they have the power to fine - up to $10 million for companies and $500,000 for individuals. As I mentioned in the House yesterday, in the case of Michael Phillip  Ivanoff, there was a jailing for three months for contempt of court. Many businesses have been caught by the ACCC for running a campaign titled `Beat the GST price increase'. The ACCC has formed the opinion that this is misleading and deceptive conduct, especially in the case of Werribee Mitsubishi and Daihatsu in relation to motor vehicles and Ray White Real Estate and Tropical Homes - ironically, in relation to home prices. The ACCC has acted swiftly in response to this. I am pleased to advise the House of a significant extension in the price monitoring program in the lead-up to 1 July next year.In the lead up to 1 July next year, the ACCC will be extending its price monitoring from 34,000 prices to over one million prices across Australia. It will analyse from 548 outlets to 8,000 outlets around Australia. This reminds the House - and, in fact, reminds all Australians - that the best price monitors are Australian consumers, and I urge Australian consumers to contact the ACCC on 1300 302502 if they think that any conduct is either misleading or deceptive or if people are lying to them about the prices associated with the introduction of the new tax system.</DOC>

 - I thank the Leader of the Opposition for giving me a question rather than the shadow minister. The facts are as I said yesterday in this parliament - that if  charities were receiving a grant then there would be a GST reimbursement added onto that to compensate those charitable organisations and they would not be worse off. Indeed, we have made specific provisions within the new tax package to accommodate charities. If charities are receiving under $100,000 they will not be subject to it. In addition, their non-commercial activities will not be subject to it. As far as the comments of the member for Herbert are concerned, I will have to speak to him afterwards.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Barker for his question. Obviously, being in a rural electorate, on behalf of his constituents he is very concerned about the current circumstances that confront our exporters of not only agricultural commodities out of Australia but also manufactured goods and particularly services. All these areas of trade, as far as Australia is concerned, need better market access, need cleaner, fairer market access, into the marketplaces across the world into which our industries are exporting. The meeting of the WTO beginning this weekend in Seattle marks the beginning of what should be a historic occasion as far as world trade is concerned to set up a much better trade agenda over the next 10 years. Our ambitions for this round are obviously to try and make this round the market access round because better market access, cleaner market access, is going to provide the greatest benefits to all Australian exporters, whether they be primary producers or exporters of goods or services. Our intention is to make this a market access focused round; a round that should be concluded after three years and, at the end of those three years, have those decisions bound up in a single undertaking.It is interesting that we have seen in recent times the WTO significantly strengthened  with the agreement by the US and China in principle on their bilateral relationship to see China enter the WTO next year. At the meeting beginning next week there will be 134 countries represented in Seattle to negotiate the launch of a new round of trade negotiations. If we can see some significant reform out of those trade negotiations over the coming years, we will see some significant benefits accrue to Australia and across the world. It has been estimated that if we saw a 50 per cent reduction in the level of protection globally then we would see the world economy boosted by $US400 billion - or $A625 billion - per year. We would see a $7.8 billion per year boost to the Australian economy.We are undertaking this task in the knowledge that it is going to be a difficult challenge; it is going to be a difficult task. There are a lot of very extreme views across the world in regard to the general concept of liberalisation. Australia thus far has played a significant role in these negotiations as we lead up to Seattle. As the chair of the Cairns Group, we have been conducting negotiations with the US, the EU and Asian countries in terms of getting the right balance in the ministerial declaration. Obviously, we will arrive in Seattle and that will progress from there on a minister to minister basis.It is vital that we recognise that it is very important for Australia that we make progress out of this round, and we will certainly be focused on doing that. We are taking with us quite a diverse range of representatives from exporting industries and interested parties in the official government delegation and the NGO group. We are going to include all those representatives from Australia in a `team Australia' exercise so that we will be projecting with one voice the views that Australia has as far as trade liberalisation is concerned and the importance of that to the Australian economy and the broader global economy.The Prime Minister highlighted at CHOGM recently that trade liberalisation is also very important to developing countries and the least developed countries in the world. That has been recognised by their support of the trade liberalisation agenda. Those benefits will  accrue to those economies, and we will continue to remind some of our colleagues across the world who are probably not so enthusiastic about the agenda that we want to push that it is important for not only the richer countries in the world but also the developing economies in the world that we progress down this path. The progress we make will be to the benefit of Australia's exporting industries, and we certainly look forward to the support of the broader community in Australia and of course the opposition in this parliament in our pursuits on behalf of the Australian people.</DOC>

 - Mr Speaker, you can never believe the words coming out of the member for Lilley. One of the greatest things that we are doing with this new tax system is giving all Australians a better chance of a higher quality of life. The greatest thing we can do for many people who have a reliance on charities is to give them the opportunity of employment. We need to give carers a better opportunity and to give those at most disadvantage a hand up so they do not have to rely increasingly on charities. They are the things that this coalition will do when the new tax system comes into place. There have been a number of concessions put in place to ensure that charities are accommodated in the new tax system. I am happy to reiterate some of those concessions. All charities with income over $100,000 must register for a GST. All  charities underneath $100,000 may not have to register for it. -  - As I mentioned, Mr Speaker, charities that have a turnover under $100,000 may choose to register or not to register. Indeed, there are a number of concessions. If it is a non-commercial operation, they will not have to charge a GST. A commercial operation which is over 50 per cent of the market value of the product or service will be subject to it. The government has put in place provisions, particularly in the form of education - which, I might add, was never done by the Australian Labor Party when they increased a lot of their wholesale sales taxes from, as the Treasurer mentioned, 10 to 12 per cent or from 20 or 22 per cent.I would like to congratulate the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accounts, who are providing advice to charitable organisations in the management of the new tax system. I can assure the members of this House that the government is very cognisant of the fine work that charities do, and we are certainly making provisions in the new tax system to look after them.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his question and his interest. I know that Shane Kelly lives in his electorate. He is an athlete who would know more than most of all the hurdles that must be overcome in the four-year trek to an Olympic  gold medal - to have overcome finance and travel and to have actually got on the track with your equipment in one piece and be doing world beating times only to have your foot slip on a pedal. An athlete at that level does not also need cheats on the track. That was what last week's summit was all about.I am pleased to report to the House that we have taken our Tough on Drugs in Sport strategy right around the world. We have received many commendations for our initiative from the numerous nations present at that summit. It came at a very timely point. Often when you organise governments to come together for these world summits, you expect some agreement on these motherhood statements of general intent and to argue for hours about semantics in a communique. At this summit we did so much more. We ended up with an intergovernment consultative committee which is going to carry forward the initiatives of the summit. We outlined the issues that the governments of the world want to see addressed in a world anti-doping agency. We want to see a world anti-doping agency that is independent of any organisation, that is accountable to governments, that is transparent in its operations and that is representative of all the regions of the world, not just Europe but throughout South-East Asia, our region in Oceania, South America, North America and Africa. We received enormous congratulations from all of those regions and representatives right around the world on our summit.The key outcomes from the summit included: endorsement of international standards for drug testing - Australia played a key role in developing that initiative; a commitment to protecting the rights of athletes with anti-doping programs; and agreements by governments to review legislation for controlling the supply of prohibited drugs and to examine the option of collaboration between border law and enforcement agencies, sporting agencies and relevant regulatory authorities as well as collaborating on research. To this end, Australia has put in a very promising tender for further EPO research. I am quietly confident that we will have a test for EPO before the Sydney 2000 Games. I thank the member for  Wannon for his interest in the question. It is tremendously important for the athletes in all of our electorates who are aspiring to the Olympic Games. It is a difficult enough task as it is without having cheats out there on the field and on the track.</DOC>

I remind the member for Maribyrnong that he has already had a good deal more leniency extended to him than was extended to some of his other colleagues. - I take this question because the whole basis of it is wrong.

 - I thank the honourable member for Farrer for his question. I am delighted to have been asked a question by my friend the honourable member. - Oh, dear; the Labor Party are still there, are they? First of all, in relation to the Crawford Fund -  - Yeah, scary! - It is the interjections. You have given them a general warning. - Exactly. - Good point, Mr Speaker. I acknowledge the honourable member's involvement with the Crawford Fund as its new chair. It was a pleasure to have the opportunity to address a seminar organised by the Crawford Fund this morning. The government will be continuing to provide financial support to the Crawford Fund during the course of the next financial year and, as I said in my speech this morning, we will certainly be doing so beyond that. As far as the consulate in Dili is concerned, since transition from Indonesian sovereignty to what one might describe as United Nations sovereignty the consulate has become the Australian mission in East Timor. Obviously it is a matter of great convenience that we do have a mission there. It is a mission staffed by people with very great ability, led by Mr James Batley, who has been the consul and who is now head of the mission. He served with great ability in a number of posts before that. They have worked in very difficult circumstances. They had to be evacuated in early September. They have returned, and they have shown real courage in a difficult environment.Finally, on the question of emergency assistance for East Timor, I announced a couple of days ago that we will provide an extra $60 million this financial year through our aid program for East Timor's humanitarian, but also for long-term reconstruction, needs. Over and above what happens this year will be a matter that we will look at in the context of future budgets. East Timor will need not just humanitarian assistance but assistance with the development of a sustainable economy. That sustainable economy will have to be built on the back of what they are able to get out of the Timor Gap. That will be a useful contribution to East Timor's economy and also its agricultural foundation.The honourable member in particular in his question mentioned coffee. The coffee industry is very important to East Timor. I am glad to say that the coffee crop this year was not destroyed at the time of the violence, so money will be earned from that. But I think with our skills in agricultural research and our historic involvement with agricultural development we will be able to provide a lot of assistance to East Timor in the areas that the honourable member asked specifically about.</DOC>

 - Once again we have seen how the Leader of the Opposition is simply not on top of education issues. His question included several misstatements of fact, which I will now correct for him. He referred to the decline in the operating grants from the federal government to universities. There has been no real decline in operating grants because, following the efficiency dividend decisions of 1996, the government has provided additional money to the universities in operating grants for overenrolled students. The fact is that this year the operating grant for universities, at $4.959 billion, is some $30 million higher than 1996 in constant dollar terms. So the fundamental assumption of your question about operating grants is wrong.Further to that, the government has provided the universities with the opportunity to raise additional resources. The total revenue of Australian universities is now some $700 million higher than it was in 1995 when you take public and private sources into account. In addition to that, the Commonwealth has actually increased the funding for targeted programs for scientific research through my portfolio.Funding for scientific research in Australian universities is now significantly higher than it was in 1996. It was you in your flawed, failed, stuffed-up - as I think the member for Werriwa called it - election policy who proposed cuts to scientific research funding. You could not even get the figuring right to maintain the forward estimates - and you have the nerve and hypocrisy to come into this House and ask what this government has done about university funding. Universities under this government are autonomous institutions. They are entitled to make their own decisions about their funding priorities within the university budgets, and that is what those universities have done.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. I was surprised to hear some members of the opposition apparently disagreeing with his statement that our historic tax reform will create growth and jobs. I point out that that historic tax reform is supported by the Labor Party. So I do not think you should be interjecting against the benefits that it will bring Australia, because you actually support it. We welcome the support of the Labor Party on historic tax reform. It will do a great deal to build Australia's economic development in jobs.Today the government released its Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. In the course of releasing that outlook, the government has revised up its growth forecasts for the 1999-2000 year from three to 3½ per cent. In addition, the government has revised up its forecast for next financial year to 3¾ per cent largely as a result of the fact that the international outlook, which was working so much against Australia in 1997 and 1998 with the Asian financial crisis, appears to be turning. Asia is now coming out of recession and we would expect a recovery in Asia in the period ahead.The mid-year outlook shows that, notwithstanding unanticipated and large expenses, the budget remains in healthy surplus. As a result of the measures which the government announced this week, it will remain in surplus across into the next financial year. Those unanticipated expenses were caused by the Senate's position in relation to the government's tax reform and the costs associated with East Timor.The government, also in its mid-year economic outlook today, has revised up employment growth for the current year. We have revised up employment growth because the Australian economy is showing additional employment and creating new jobs. For the first time, enclosed in the government's forecast is a forecast that unemployment in  Australia next year will fall below seven per cent. The government forecast that by the middle of next year, June 2000, unemployment will be around 6¾ per cent - the lowest unemployment in Australia for over a decade. That is the consequence of good economic policy, which has kept strong growth on low inflation. Since the government was elected, nearly 570,000 net jobs have been developed in the Australian economy, and the government is forecasting additional job growth in the next year. This is a story of strong growth on low inflation, good jobs growth and falling unemployment, and with the big structural changes to the Australian economy and the development of tax reform - the historic business tax reform which will now pass this parliament - that will lead to stronger growth, more jobs and better opportunities for all of Australia's citizens, particularly its young people.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for her question. We have received the arbiter's report. It is being examined by government, and I will give an announcement when government makes a decision. But what I would say on hospital funding is that the honourable member is quite incorrect. If the hospitals are cash-strapped, it is because of how the states have chosen to fund them. The federal government  has increased hospital funding by six per cent. The states in their budgets, with the exception of South Australia because we cannot get that data, have increased their hospital budgets on average by 0.3 per cent. If the states had put the same amount of extra money in that the Commonwealth had put in, there would be $478 million extra in the hospitals.It is particularly bad in New South Wales, where the Commonwealth gave an extra $93 million this year, and state expenditure in the New South Wales budget on hospital services - not on health services but specifically on hospital services - went up in the order of only $45 million. So the New South Wales government did not even put in the extra money the Commonwealth gave it - half of it they squirreled off into the Olympics, I imagine - let alone put a cent of new money in themselves. So they have to take responsibility for their own actions.</DOC>

 - Yesterday's announcement that the opposition would vote for the government's policy in relation to the new business taxation system clears the way through the Senate for the introduction of historic reform, which will be the greatest reform to Australia's business tax system ever. As part of that, the broadened base will apply to companies and reduce company tax rates from 36 per cent to 30 per cent, making Australia one of the most competitive business taxation regimes in this region, attracting new businesses to Australia and creating new jobs. As part of that, capital gains tax will be simplified, because the old indexation system will be changed and the averaging system will be abolished. Capital gains will apply to nominal increases at half rates, meaning that the top rate applying to a nominal capital gain - a much more simplified method of assessment - will become 24.25 per cent as people who save and invest get benefits in relation to the taxation regime.But in addition to that there are benefits for small businesses, which will have 50 per cent of their assets kept out of the capital gains tax regime, and particular benefits for the farmers of Australia, because one of the new measures which the government is introducing is that, if a small business has held an asset for 15 years and the person is 55 years of age and intending to retire or is otherwise incapacitated, they can sell that active asset capital gains tax free. So, if a farmer has decided after a lifetime of farming that they want to sell the farm, move into the regional country town and buy a property, they can do something now which they could never do before under the capital gains tax system which was penalising them. If they have held that asset for 15 years, they can sell it and it will be capital gains tax free. They can buy premises in the town, and they can realise the reward of a lifetime of hard work. That is great news for the farmers of Australia. This is, of course, the first government in Australia's history that has cut capital gains tax. It took a coalition government to cut capital gains taxes in this country, to help small businesses. It took a coalition government to help the self-funded retirees and investors -  - I do not see why the opposition frontbench interjects. You support this policy. You are voting for it. You should be out there now extolling its virtues - all of the virtues of the policy which you are voting for and actually support. All we can say is that it is a policy that the opposition have recognised as being of value to the nation, and I appreciate the fact that they have done that. They are giving it their wholehearted support, as you can hear from their noisy rounds of `Hear, hear!' as they cheer on this policy in such a noisy way from the opposition benches, having come on board and having supported the government in its business tax, obviously being so happy at doing so and being able to join the government. It is great for farmers, great for small business and great for the self-funded retirees. It will be good for economic growth, and that will help Australia's jobs.</DOC>

 - I guess I cannot expect the shadow minister to know the answer to this, because she does not attend health ministers' meetings, but the answer is in what happened at the health ministers' meeting. It was matched funds by Commonwealth and state governments. The states wished to put in a certain amount of money, but there was a strong view around the table that, if advice came back to us that we needed more money, we would attempt to find that to put in. The real difficulty with quality is that problems tend to be systemic problems; they are not problems in which it is easy to intervene. Solving them needs the cooperation of the medical profession, and the quite extraordinary and outrageous manner in which this report was released by the member for Fremantle when she was minister for health has made it extraordinarily difficult to get the medical profession onside to help us.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his real interest in the economic progress of rural and regional areas. In addition to those ben  efits that he mentioned that will come into play on 1 July next year arising from indirect taxation reform, for example, an estimated savings of some $900 million a year to the nation's farmers and well over $4 billion in relief on exports because of the removal of the embedded taxes that currently exist on our exports, we will have with the business tax changes quite simply a better and simpler small business tax system and one which, as the Treasurer has just alluded to, clearly offers real relief from capital gains tax, which is one of the great bugbears of small business and the farm sector. On top of the major benefits of the new GST system, we see in particular the slashing of transport costs, which are so crippling in a country as vast as ours.So, firstly, it is simpler. A single quarterly or monthly business activity statement - I even have a draft exposure form here, and it is very straightforward; I am delighted to see what it will potentially look like - will replace up to 32 - can you believe it? - reporting and repayment requirements that currently pertain to business people. - That's under the system that those  opposite advocate that we ought to retain, that they want to keep in place. One system, Pay As You Go, replaces 11 existing systems involving up to 32 forms for reporting and paying tax. For a farmer running a cash book without a computer - I know a few of those - I think it will take an hour or two at most. It is a very small time input indeed for the very real cost relief that will emerge out of this tax reform.Coming to capital gains tax reform, repeatedly over the last decade or so that I have moved around the country, I have heard people saying that capital gains tax is a major inhibitor. As the Treasurer said, we are delighted to be the first government ever to actually reduce very significantly the burden of capital gains taxation. All small businesses will benefit. We have slashed the rates for small business asset exemptions, and we have made it easier to roll over assets into replacement assets.Finally, there is the exemption for those who have held assets for 15 years or more. That is very important for those many small businesses and farmers who see their businesses as their superannuation. What is more - I heard someone interject on this - we have done it without threatening the capital base or the operation of legitimate family trusts set up to pass on a farm or a business from one generation to the next. This is on top of the very real boost I have touched on from the reform of our indirect taxation system next year. I again remind people on this broadcasting day that people will see in rural Australia a cut of 23c a litre in the price of diesel - very worth while for regional transport costs - and the total abolition of all fuel excise on rail in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. His electorate has Frankston as its central part. In these suburban electorates - he is representing a suburban electorate - he has a lot of small businesses, a lot of microbusinesses, and there is no doubt that the reforms which have now been agreed will produce significant benefits for those people. Mr Speaker, I have taken out a couple of examples just to give you a feel for the dimensions of this. -  - Why interject? These are great advantages. I will send you the numbers and next time you are speaking to a trade union group you can get up and say, `Capital gains tax reform under us is great, and here is an example.' This is my example: someone in a $20,000 to $30,000 range buys a hairdressing shop for $10,000 in June 1994 and sells it this year for $18,000. Under the old system that you are happily with us getting rid of, capital gains tax is $2,450. Under us, there is a 70 per cent reduction, a $710 tax bill. This is a massive benefit, meaning that if you are running a hairdressing salon you keep more of what you earn in building up your asset. - I get the interjection about the GST. I see what Steve Bracks says about the GST this morning. He says that it is just such a great tax, and given the revenue likely to come from it, he is going to spend that on cutting payroll tax to create jobs in Victoria - a fantastic benefit from the GST. You would be opposed to giving people the chance of a job.Take another bloke who is an operator of a small butcher's shop. This is a butcher's shop where the person has bought it for $100,000 and sells it for $200,000. There are various assumptions you can make about tax rates, but under the old system you were looking at a tax liability of $35,000 or thereabouts for that person. Under us, depending on the age and for a person going into retirement, there is no capital gains tax at all. It is a fantastic  incentive for small business, and of course that means jobs.This is an extraordinary achievement in the area of tax reform, and I want today to publicly pay tribute to the Treasurer for securing such a fantastic win for the small business community. - This does display extraordinary powers of persuasion. This does display an insight and understanding -  - These reforms, supported by the opposition, are putting incentive back into small business. That is great for people who have got their own small business, but it is also great for people they will employ in the future who today are unemployed. It is a singular feat to achieve a halving of the capital gains tax. For somebody who has been in business for a few years, 15 years, and qualifies under the proposal, there is no capital gains tax at all. Again, that emphasises the significance of the benefit for the small business community. I suppose the Treasurer would have to acknowledge that timing is terribly important in politics. If he had gone to the Labor Party back in June, that was when the Leader of the Opposition said, `You can only take one week's holiday because you have got to get out and brand-name our policies.' When it came to July, he did not have any policies. He was holding a seminar to see what his policies might be. By the time we got  to September, he had been liberated so that they could be freewheeling and they could die in a ditch on their principles. - Finishing on this point, Mr Speaker, the latest strategy we have from the opposition is that if you have got a problem with developing a policy you hospitalise the front bench and put it off until next year. - This is a great win for small business. - </DOC>

 - I have not seen those comments allegedly attributed to the Prime Minister and long experience has told me to take what is said from that side of the House with a pinch of salt, even more than two telephone books worth of salt. -  - I should take from that side of the House more than three telephone books worth of salt - is that the point that you are making? Can I say in relation to tax reform though that I think a goods and services tax - or value added tax - is now applied in 150 countries of the world. It is supported by the British Labour Party. It is  supported by the French Social Democrats. It is supported by the French socialists. - It is supported by the German Social Democrats. It is supported by the New Zealand Labour Party. It is supported by all of the parties of the Socialist International, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition would have found out in Paris at the Socialist International recently.And if he had stood up at the Socialist International and told them how they should get rid of value added tax and introduce wholesale sales tax, he would have had nobody in that room supporting him unless there was a representative of a socialist party from Swaziland or Botswana present because it is the Australian Labor Party, Swaziland and Botswana that, according to Labor, are the only political parties in the world that have figured out that value added tax is not a broad indirect tax worthy of tax reform, that Scullin had it right in 1932 - that the most up-to-date modern thinking that the Labor Party can still cope with was Scullin in 1932 - that the rest of the world - France, Germany, Japan, all of Asia, Britain, New Zealand and Australia - have all got it wrong, and that the only people who have really got it right are Australian Labor, Botswana and Swaziland.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the member for Parramatta because I know that not only is he a fine member but he is very concerned about his self-funded retirees and the elderly people in his electorate. He knows, like all Australians know, that this business tax reform package, which has been put  through, is great news for self-funded retirees and is great news for elderly Australians.One of the major benefits that the Treasurer has negotiated in the business tax package is that there will be increasing levels of savings and contributions towards superannuation funds and also towards private savings. I think all of us would agree that, if we can encourage private savings, then we can start to encourage greater self-reliance in people for their own retirement. If we can have greater self-reliance and a greater incentive for people to plan for their own retirement, then it means a lesser burden on the social security system.The other measure which the Treasurer clearly articulated is the enormous benefits, particularly for older Australians, with the capital gains tax changes. If you have been holding a business asset for longer than 15 years, you sell it and you are over the age of 55, then all that now will be subject to capital gains tax relief. I think that is a tremendous benefit to people in regional Australia and also in urban Australian areas such as the seat of Parramatta.One of the great benefits with the new business package is the effective rate on capital gains towards superannuation funds which will now only be 10 per cent, as opposed to  15 per cent, which of course was introduced by the Australian Labor Party. This will mean superannuation contributions will have a greater return to members. Likewise, self-funded retirees will have a further benefit because of the self-refundable imputation credits. This is very good news and it is also good news for the 1.5 million pensioners, in light of the many investments that they have in mutual funds, because their returns will be higher and they will get greater remuneration. So without question the coalition's business tax reform package is a huge leap forward for all Australians.</DOC>

 - The implementation of the goods and services tax provides us with an opportunity to change the way in which the tax system is administered. For many years, we have seen the small business community loaded up with a string of tax administration systems - all different, none coordinated and all of which have led to a significant impost of red tape on small business. That is why a lot of small business people have been saying for many years that we need a better system. -  - Well, just you wait! When we were elected, we set up the Bell committee. The Bell committee went around to small business to talk to them about how we could better administer the tax system. -  - The Bell committee recommended a consolidation of five existing tax systems into one pay as you go system. That system will see the end of the reportable payments system, and it will see, for example, the end of provisional tax. -  - For many years a lot of small businesses have gone broke because of the provisional tax which you kept in place. We will abolish the provisional tax system. - There is sales tax on books in New York. Thank you to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. He does travel more than I  do. For small business this will mean a consolidation of the system. Instead of up to 32 different iterations with the tax office in an annual period, it will be reduced to four quarterly payments.	 If it were the case that your small business put the invoices, the receipts and the cheque butts into a shoe box until the end of the year and then passed them to the accountant, there is no doubt that you would have a greater transition cost. But you would also have a better set of accounts and a better understanding of what was happening in your business.This package represents the most significant attack on red tape in recent Australian tax history. It is very good for small business not just from a red-tape point of view but because customers will have more money in their pockets and because we are reducing tax on business. This is a very good package. When it is topped off with the fantastic reforms on capital gains tax, small business is going to be a lot better off.</DOC>

 - You were shopping in Marks and Spencers. -  - How was Harrods? - I thank the member for Longman for his question. The member for Longman, and importantly the people of Caboolture, would be aware of how significant share ownership is for improving the general wealth of Australia. As I understand it, the Bank of Queensland was recently very heavily oversubscribed. The people of Queensland are very keen to invest in shares.After the passage of the Ralph taxation initiatives yesterday, 80 per cent of Australians will pay no more than 15 per cent in capital gains tax as a result of those initiatives. In fact, super funds, which are accessible to 91 per cent of working Australians, have had their taxation reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent as well. That brings Australia into line with a whole range of other countries, but most importantly it reduces the complexity and compliance costs for small business and particularly for small investors in Australian shares.It is an opportune moment to remind the House that share ownership in Australia is continuing to grow. Since 1995, 2.8 million Australians have become direct Australian share owners for the first time. That has come about for two particular reasons: firstly, the privatisation programs undertaken by various governments around Australia and, secondly, demutualisation of insurance companies. They have provided the shares. So now nearly 44 per cent of all Australians directly own shares, which is more than six million people.Some people in this House do not think that is enough. I noted the comments of the member for Werriwa during the course of the debate on business taxation yesterday. He, having for the last 3½ years been trying to drag the Labor Party kicking and screaming to the right, has now decided to try to pull them to the left on taxation. - This was in the debate on business taxation yesterday in the House. I quote the member for Werriwa:This parliament should be enacting a first share owners scheme to bring all Australians into the virtues of a share owner democracy . . .  We all agree, but we are intrigued that, when this parliament had legislation before it with the most accessible and affordable first-time share owners scheme in it - and that was the sale of the second tranche of Telstra - the Labor Party and the member for Werriwa voted against it. On the one hand, the member for Werriwa comes in here and says there should be in operation a share owners scheme for all consumers, and on the other hand he votes against the sale of Telstra. - I am helping them in this situation, Mr Speaker. From now on, share ownership in Australia will be more affordable and more accessible than ever before because of the initiatives of abolishing stamp duty on the transfer of shares, starting 1 July 2001, lower transaction costs as a result of the Wallis initiatives, greater competition in the provision of share ownership services, halving capital gains tax and scrip for scrip takeover relief. Share ownership in Australia has never been more accessible for everyday Australians.</DOC>

 - I am not sure about the assertion that the member made at the start of her question. I thought we were providing quite a lot of material in a range of languages. -  - I will be happy to have that checked and will advise the honourable member in due course. In terms of the voucher, the whole idea of it is to provide assistance but it is particularly directed to ensuring that small business avails itself of the wide range of information, training and other measures necessary to assist in the transition. The GST Assistance Office is seeking registrations of interests from suppliers so that we have an idea of the extent of discounts that will be available to small businesses as they exercise the voucher that is being made available to them. So what you are going to get is a leveraging up effect of the voucher, thereby enhancing the value of it for small business operators. When we took advice from the Small Business Consultative Committee on this issue, contrary to the misleading statements made by your shadow minister, the committee actually said that a voucher idea -  - The Small Business Consultative Committee said that the money has its role, but the really important thing for small business is to have a range of information, education and training programs made available. That is what we have done. As I say, we have leveraged that up in a sense using the voucher, and I was very pleased to see in the Yellow Pages index, I think it was, that came out this week that we are seeing a lot of small business people now turning their minds to implementation. Obviously, you would expect  that, but it was a very high figure. I do urge small businesses to focus on this issue. I know they have Y2K and Christmas and everything else coming up, but it is wise to get in early and get on top of the issue. We are very keen as a government, through all the organisations that we are assisting, to ensure that they do have quality information available to them.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Groom for the question. It certainly is a matter of concern to the government when people are here unlawfully, and there is a variety of means by which people become unlawful. First, of course, if people come by boat or by air and are not authorised to enter Australia, there are good and appropriate reasons why that is a matter for concern. We need to be able to satisfy ourselves that we know who the people are, whether they pose a risk to the health of the Australian community, whether they are of character concern - in other words, whether they are criminals in another place - or whether they pose a risk to our security. They are appropriate questions to be able to ask.In relation to people who come to Australia lawfully - in other words, they enter on a visa and we have had an opportunity to clearly identify them and to satisfy ourselves from information made available to us that they are not criminals and that they are not of security  concern; we maintain alert arrangements to identify people of particular concern to us - they do not pose the same immediate problem on arrival. The fact is that, in relation to the people who come to Australia by air, we make quite determined efforts to intercept them before they even get on an aircraft. In the past 12 months, something in the order of 438 people were intercepted at overseas airports and prevented from boarding flights to Australia. We also locate people at our airports who arrive and are refused entry. That can be because they have fraudulent documentation or it can be because we have other doubts in relation to their bona fides. We have seen a very significant increase in unauthorised border entries at our airports, and in the last year we refused entry to 2,019 people. Something in the order of 70 per cent of those unauthorised air arrivals were removed within 72 hours of arriving in Australia.However, we are putting considerable resources into dealing with the other problem. When we know who they are and they happen to overstay a visa I do not regard it as being of the same urgency as the other matters, but it is of concern. Last year we located something of the order of 13,000 people who had overstayed visas or breached visa conditions. That is a very substantial number. When you estimate that 50,000 people are here unlawfully at any time, a 20 per cent location rate is very significant indeed. So that members may know of our ongoing concern in relation to this matter, I have had a review of illegal workers here in Australia. The government will be considering recommendations from the report. It will be interesting to see the level of support for the wide ranging recommendations that will no doubt flow from that review.</DOC>

Of course, he spends a lot of his time scaremongering and spreading fear amongst the most vulnerable people of the community, whether it is local councils, younger people or older people. As I have mentioned quite a few times in the parliament, grants that are made to charities that are registered and have an income over $100,000 will be subject to a GST. Of course, the actual grant itself will be increased to take that into account. - Clearly, charitable organisations just claim it back and it just washes through the system.

 - I thank the member for Menzies for his question. Even though unemployment has come down from 11 per cent under Labor to about seven per cent now, some people are not prepared to give credit where it is really due. The latest example of this was the member for Lalor who attacked the government in the House this week because unemployment in her electorate is still well above the national average. I should point out that, in the statistical region of outer western Melbourne, which contains the electorate of Lalor, unemployment was 13.3 per cent when this government took office. It is now down to 9.4 per cent, which is obvi  ously still too high but it is a lot better than it was. Unemployment was in fact at 10.5 per cent in that region. When the now Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment it was 16.2 per cent and, when the now Leader of the Opposition lost that office, unemployment in that region peaked at 17.5 per cent when none other than the now Deputy Leader of the Opposition was minister for employment. This is not untypical of what has happened to unemployment in regional Australia.Last week the acting shadow minister for employment claimed that government programs were failing and they were particularly failing the long-term unemployed. I should point out that long-term unemployment and very long-term unemployment peaked in 1993 when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was minister and are now one-third below those peaks. I should also point out that 70 per cent of the participants in intensive assistance under the Job Network are long-term unemployed and that 30 per cent of long-term unemployed intensive assistance clients are in paid employment three months after leaving the program. The only Working Nation program with higher percentages of long-term unemployed in it was new work opportunities, which had just a 20 per cent outcome rate at a cost of $55,000 per successful outcome compared to just $7,000 under intensive assistance. Intensive assistance is working because it involves local Job Network members tailoring a package of assistance personally to each job seeker.On that point, it is worth noting what the acting shadow minister said in his interesting book Open Australia. He said:The introduction of the concepts of case management and mutual obligation has helped to customise the relationship between state and beneficiary. This process needs to be accelerated so that government assistance assumes a much more facilitating role.That is precisely what this government is doing in all of our employment services. We are building a social coalition between the great charitable organisations and the small community organisations of this country to help the people who need it most. I should point out that, in an electorate such as Lalor, we have funded no fewer than 16 Work for  the Dole projects, and each one of them involves a local organisation working with local people to enhance local infrastructure and the fabric of local life.I would say to members opposite that they should support these great programs that are working with the communities of Australia and they should get away from this old-fashioned mind-set that Canberra and only Canberra knows best.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. I notice that one other member of his frontbench has been declaring that the 7c is something set in concrete, which it never was. It was always only an indicative figure. We have made it plain that when the new fuel tax arrangements come into place we will reduce the cost of excise on fuel by an amount equivalent to the GST. For private motoring then, the GST is imposed and the private motorist pays the same price for petrol that they would otherwise have paid. For business use, of course, the GST is rebatable at a rate of 10 per cent. That is over and above the other reductions to fuel prices. -  - I make the point that it is a broadcasting day. The ALP has been out there fearmongering on our approach to fuel taxation. This is the crowd that oversaw an increase in the price of fuel excise in Australia from 7c a litre to 34c. They are the people who in government in 1993, when they told the Australian people that they could introduce l-a-w law tax cuts without imposing a GST and without raising new taxes, proposed to raise the price of petrol by 10c a litre for  leaded and 5c for unleaded, with commensurate rises in the price of diesel. Let that be remembered. That was their approach to fuel policy. They are the people who believe in high taxation on fuel and high taxation on the costs of transport. We are the side that has significantly reduced the cost of fuel, to the great benefit of rural and regional Australia.I conclude by saying that we know what their policies are. Their policies are to retain the wholesale sales tax and to keep pushing it up like they did in 1993. Their policies are to retain fuel excise and to keep increasing it because the tax system, as they know, is actually fundamentally broken. I think the message out of all of this is that, given that the new spokesman for rural Australia over there has not yet repudiated the member for Dickson's claims that our reductions in fuel costs are just a $7.8 billion boost to pollution, I think it is time the Leader of the Opposition showed a bit of leadership here and actually showed his hand. Does he - and the Labor Party - or does he not support our reductions in the cost of transport in this country?</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Eden-Monaro for that question. Like many other members, he constantly puts the case for the timber workers in his electorate, who he sees as deserving of employment. Irrespective of the more esoteric arguments advanced in this place on the regional forest agreement legislation, the judgment of those representing capital and labour is that the Labor Party's amendments, as reiterated in the Senate, are in fact an attack on the security needed to  guarantee investment, jobs and growth in the forest industries.Consequently, amongst others, the CFMEU has put out a press release that is headed `Forest union lashes Labor'. Included in that press release by Mr Trevor Smith, the National Secretary of the CFMEU Forestry Division, which condemns the ALP, the union has said, `The union has accused the ALP of breaking commitments made to the union during the last federal election.' -  - In other words, as is very clear, at the last federal election the member for McMillan and other members went to their people and said, `Trust us, we stand by our own invention -  -  - which is the national forest policy statement of 1992, and the union is now saying to the public and to the workers, `You told us an untruth.' That is what they - the union, the CFMEU - are saying. What is more, they say, `Let no-one in the parliament think that this issue will go away. Every regional community reliant on the forest and forest products industry is going to be informed of this betrayal and the union will urge the government to reintroduce the bill as soon as possible.'I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that the government will in due course reintroduce this legislation and all the Labor members in Tasmania with forest interests - and that is the lot of them - all the Labor members in Victoria with forest interests and all the Labor members in New South Wales with forest interests will have the opportunity, leading into the next election, to explain to the people who have loyally backed them over the decades why, according to the assessment of the union -  -  - according to the assessment of the investors, according to the assessment of the workers, they have let them down and done so deliberately. The issue here is  that, as Senator Brown is so keen to tell everyone, the Labor Party's amendments were designed to wreck the regional forest agreements legislation which is designed to encourage people, by giving them legislative backing to a state-federal agreement, to invest in the industry.We have a $2 billion trade deficit in forest products in Australia. That is money we are borrowing as a nation from the rest of the world. That deficit can be removed if we go into value adding, particularly in the manufacture of paper. You do not get into the manufacture of paper without a $1 billion or $2 billion investment. But imagine the opportunities I have as minister under the action agenda to go to people who are interested in doing that and to say, `Spend your money, but Kim Beazley has made it clear that he will take your resource away from you because he wants to cancel out through the Senate regional forest agreements made in good faith.'It is an outrage that people run around at the factory gate telling people, `We are looking after you,' when of course the Hansard record in this House and in the Senate says that they voted against the interests of their own workers. I can assure those workers we will persist in giving them the protection and the investment they are entitled to.</DOC>

 - The answer that the minister gave, which is entirely correct, is that the excise arrangements will be struck on the price of petrol at the time that we strike them. The amount will come off the excise -  - I suppose we should strike at a price other than when we strike it, should we? These economic geniuses, Mr Speaker! I suppose we should strike it on last year's price, should we? Or maybe we should strike it on next year's price. The economic  genii of the Labor Party think it is very funny to strike it on the price on the date on which you strike it. And, of course, on the date on which you strike it, you will strike it a price so that the excise reduces and the 10 per cent means that prices need not rise. I make that point.Of course, another factor to be thought of by the economic genii of the Labor Party is that the higher the price, the more the reduction in the excise would have to be and the higher the 10 per cent GST would be. In fact, when you equalise out the tax arrangements, you get the same amount of revenue anyway. The excise comes down and the 10 per cent goes back up. It is the same amount of tax. It just depends on whether you are taking it in a form of excise or whether you are taking it in the form of GST.We have these questions here every day. We had them from the member for Lilley about grants. What is going to happen with these grants? The fact of the matter is that a council that has registered for GST, which pays 10 per cent, will get it all back - the full input tax credits. - We factored it in on both sides. We factored in the excise reduction and the GST take. As I said before, if you reduce the excise and apply a 10 per cent GST to equalise the price, the revenue is actually the same.Let me make a point: excise is a tax; GST is a tax. Whether it is called excise or whether it is called GST, it remains the same. The frightening possibility - it may just be a frightening possibility - is that, possibly since 1985 when the Labor Party last supported value added tax, they have been campaigning against something they have not understood. It is quite possible that since 1985 they have  been campaigning against something they have not understood. Mr Speaker, 150 countries in the world can do tax reform. They can do it in Germany, France, Britain, New Zealand, Japan and Singapore, but Australian Labor cannot make the cut.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and acknowledge his very real interest in and very strong support for the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line announced by the Prime Minister at the Regional Australia Summit here recently. I noticed in something, which probably as closely as anything else approximates a policy on that side, that the Leader of the Opposition  supports it strongly as well. We have increased our financial commitment to the project by a further $65 million, in addition to the $100 million already allocated from the Federation Fund and the long-term peppercorn lease of the existing Tarcoola to Alice Springs line, which has a written down value of some $400 million.Completing the link between Adelaide and Darwin - which was first promised in 1911 - will significantly benefit not just the South Australian and Northern Territory economy, and in particular their exporters, but the nation. Construction will take three years. It will create employment for 7,000 people in regional Australia. I know - and this will be of enormous relief to the member who asked the question - that it will particularly benefit the steel producing city of Whyalla. A United States Asia-Pacific transport consortium, which includes the South Australian based Macmahon Holdings and Kinhill Engineering and Construction, was selected in June as a preferred builder for the railway. With the abolition from June next year of all excise on diesel train operation, we have provided the consortium and, it should be said, all railway operators with a boost to the competitiveness of rail services.This is the sort of nationally significant project which helped to make Australia great. It certainly leads to Australians being very proud of the work that can be done. It is a great credit to the South Australian and Northern Territory governments that they refused to say no. I think the Alice Springs to Darwin link will enhance our attempts to revitalise rail in this country. We are putting real capital into rail. We are getting traffic and freight back onto rail. Our reform projects are indeed directly opposite to those pursued by the Labor Party when they were in government; for example, that infamous stretch of rail where they set out to restore it under their One Nation program and the trains went slower after they had reconstructed the rail than they had before.</DOC>

 - I was asked, when I was in New York in the wake of the allegations that appeared on, I think, the Richard Ackland program, Mediawatch , what I thought of the allegations. I think on that occasion I said that I was not going to get into the detail of holding judgment on individuals, but I thought the most appropriate thing that I could do was to state a principle in relation to people who make comment on talkback radio or television, or in the media generally. I am happy to stand by what I said in New York. I think it is a sound principle. When I hear somebody say, `I think what the government has done is right' or `I think what the government has done is wrong' or `I think the opposition is right' or `I think the opposition is wrong,' I assume that they say that because that is the view they hold. I am prepared to state that as a principle and let its application in relation to individuals fall where it may. I have not as yet been apprised of the findings of the ABA for the very simple reason that I do not think they have made any. I have watched the inquiry with interest, as no doubt all honourable members have. The principle that I stated in New York remains my view and we will see how it applies to the findings of the inquiry.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for his question. He may have seen the survey of manufacturing in New South Wales which was released by Colonial State Bank and Australian Business . It found that in the December quarter manufacturing business conditions were the strongest for five years. Of further encouragement is that production, sales, orders and profitability were all seen as improving in the March quarter of 2000. The Chief Economist of the  Colonial State Bank, Craig James, said that the manufacturing sector could look forward to a new century with optimism. The Managing Director of Australian Business , Philip Holt, said that manufacturing was entering the new millennium with optimism based on strong sectoral performance in the December quarter and that the most striking feature of the survey was the comprehensiveness of the recovery across the industry sectors.I think most members of the House will welcome the fact that manufacturing conditions are in such good shape. Of course that has a lot to do with the strength of the Australian economy and the low interest rates that manufacturers are benefiting from. The external recovery will be of benefit to manufacturers. Can I also say that one of the great benefits for the manufacturing industry will be the new tax system because Labor's wholesale sales tax penalises manufacturing. Wholesale sales tax falls on the manufacturing sector hardest and makes it harder for manufacturers because it taxes them at such high rates. By modernising Australia's taxation system, we will be giving manufacturers a better go and that will lead to better conditions for manufacturers and their employees.Part of the good story for manufacturing has also been the increase in productivity which has occurred over recent years. Since the government has come to office, productivity has been growing at 2.9 per cent per annum compared to a growth of 1.5 per cent per annum under the Labor Party. That poor productivity performance under Labor meant that real wages were depressed, prices were outstripping wages and living standards were going backwards. If we can have the growth of productivity standards which you get out of a new tax system, out of low interest rates, out of new industrial relations, out of capital gains tax changes and out of good economic policy, that is good for the manufacturing industry, good for productivity and good for jobs, and that will be good for business into the next millennium.</DOC>

 - The answer is that I can neither confirm nor deny that because I am not aware of the details of any document that may or may not be asked of charities. Indeed, it would be quite unreasonable and impractical to imagine that every single piece of paper that emanates from the Commonwealth Public Service should have first been run past the Prime Minister. In the light of what the Leader of the Opposition has asked me, I will naturally take the opportunity to investigate what he has put to me. But his question allows me to make a couple of points along the way. It allows me to make the observation that there are quite a number of benefits out of the taxation reform proposals of the government for charities in Australia - in particular, the removal of many of the embedded costs which are attendant upon the operation of the wholesale sales tax system. I would also remind the House of the very considerable concessions that from the very beginning have been made in relation to the operation of charities and also further changes that have been made, such as the establishment of a very effective consultative mechanism and procedure. I believe that, when the new taxation system comes into operation, there will be enormous national economic benefits. The new arrangements will also be seen to have very greatly benefited the operation of many of the voluntary organisations in the Australian community.As the Leader of the Opposition has raised the issue of interface between the government and the voluntary sector, I take this opportunity to inform the House that I had the oppor  tunity during last week to chair the first meeting of the government's Business and Community Partnership initiative. This is a group with representatives of the major charities of Australia, such as the representative of Mission Australia, the representative of the Wesley Mission in Sydney - I think one of the largest charities in Australia - and some very senior members of the Australian business community. It is an organisation that was established by the government to promote the notion of a social coalition within the Australian community. The social coalition takes the view that the government's responsibility to provide a safety net must remain absolutely unambiguously there. Any suggestion that this government is about withdrawing the social security safety net is wrong. Any suggestion that we are in the business of shifting burdens in economic responsibilities onto the charities of Australia is wrong. It is our goal to build a great social coalition in this country. It is our goal to bring together the resources of the government, the resources of the private sector, the resources of individuals and, importantly, the resources of the Australian business community.There are many business men and women in Australia who already give very generously to the less fortunate in our community. My challenge to the business community of Australia is not so much that business should give more but more businesses should give. What needs to happen in Australia is that the example of those very generous business leaders who give a lot should be followed by many others in the business community. But I want to make it absolutely clear that it is no part of the government's social coalition to reduce by one dollar the value of the social security safety net in this country.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Petrie for her question. I had the pleasure this morning of announcing the  government's response to the question of coalescence, and that is that we will be injecting new money, $148 million, to remedy what has been a leftover legacy from the Labor Party. If I can explain, very simply, the Labor Party put in place differential based state funding whereby different states received different amounts of funding for nursing home care. In 1997, as part of our reforms, a process of coalescence - to bring everyone to a national rate - was put in place, and that was to occur over seven years. That matter was referred to the Productivity Commission for its comment and it agreed with moving to a national rate but disagreed with the seven-year term.The question was one of equity, Queensland being the lowest funded state and Victoria being the highest. What we have done by making available new money of $148 million is to ensure that the national rate for Queensland will be achieved by the year 2002, with an increase of $83 million. South Australia will receive in excess of $14 million and, because under the old scheme there was to have been a dip in the subsidy paid to Victoria, $40 million will be pumped into Victoria to ensure that dip does not occur. Similarly for Tasmania, there will be $6.3 million to ensure that that does not occur in that state.Overall I can say that funding will continue to grow at an average rate of five per cent, which will amount across the board to something like $800 per bed. The fact of the matter is that we are putting together now an equitable package, which means that those states which were penalised under an unfair Labor system will now have equitable funding. The proposal that Victoria should have been penalised has been rectified by putting an additional $40 million into place - what I can call a thoroughly equitable outcome. Can I put on record my thanks to the industry representatives who negotiated with me for the last months, particularly to the churches who are the largest providers in this country, and indeed I would refer honourable members to the press releases put out by Catholic Health Australia and by the Uniting Church.</DOC>

 - I can only repeat and say to the honourable member for Lilley that I have not seen the document. I will have a look at it. Because of the searching cross-examination to which I am subjected in question time, I will not have time to read the entire document before the end of question time, but I undertake to have a very careful look at it afterwards, and if there is anything in it that is inappropriate it will not be repeated. We are not in the business of engaging in any intimidatory tactics towards charity. -  - But by the same token, you over there should not be in the business of deliberately trying to scare vulnerable people. We now know the policy of the Leader of the Opposition for the next election and that is to hope and pray that something goes wrong with the GST, because he has got nothing else. He has not got a policy feather to bless himself with except the vain hope that a policy the Australian people supported at the last election is going to fall over. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that that is a bankrupt approach for the new millennium. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, you ought to find something a little better than that. You ought to in fact summon the courage - or is it something else - necessary to present some alternative to the Australian people. I repeat what I said earlier to the honourable member for Lilley: the charity sector in this country occupies an honoured role as far as this government is concerned. We have increased provision for charities in the four years that we have been in government. We have embraced the advice of charities. We do not treat charities in this country any longer as having a role confined entirely to what they do extremely well, and that is dispensing human compassion. In the face of opposition from Labor people, we have been prepared to involve the charities in policy formulation in this country. We have been prepared to involve the Salvation Army in giving advice on drug policy. We have been prepared to involve other great charities in giving advice on youth homelessness. In other words, we treat them seriously; we do not simply rely on their generosity and human decency. - The Leader of the Opposition is getting very excited, because he is aware that many of his Labor colleagues around Australia have sneered at the fact that we have used senior charitable people in order to give policy advice. - Yes.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. It is not always easy to work with the unemployed, particularly the long-term unemployed. I would like to thank everyone who has been involved with the Job Network thus far for giving the unemployed people of Australia a better deal than they ever had under the old system. All the participants in Job Network 1 deserve the gratitude of everyone in this House. I am confident that the Job Network will go from strength to strength as a result of the second Job Network tender round, which was announced on Friday. It was the largest ever human services contract in Australia, worth $3 billion over the next three years. It is very good news for regional Australia because the number of Job Network sites will go up from about 1,400 to over 2,100. The number of permanent sites will go up from 1,100 to over 1,700 and the number of non-metropolitan sites will go up from 600 to over 1,100. I am pleased to say that 150 locations will be getting a permanent Job Network site for the first time, and more than 80 of them are in non-metropolitan Australia. I should also mention that the region of Parramatta will have the number of its sites increased from eight to 14.It is also good news for what has rightly been dubbed the `social coalition', because community based and charitable organisations, especially small community based organisations, will see their share of the Job Network increase from 30 per cent to nearly 50 per cent. Most importantly of all, it is good news for job seekers because the intensive assistance performance of successful tenderers averages 25 per cent more  than the current average intensive assistance performance. This is a good outcome for the Job Network. It was a performance based, competitive tender process, and in any competitive process it is right that good performers should give way to better performers. The job seekers of Australia deserve the best possible services, and that is precisely what they are going to get under Job Network 2.This government has not always been praised by ACOSS, but I am delighted that, in the wake of Friday's announcement, Michael Raper, the head of ACOSS, said of the Job Network providers under Job Network 2, `So having more of them, having them close, having them more local is a big help for unemployed people.' To have that kind of a pat on the back from Michael Raper shows that the government is getting something very right with Job Network 2.</DOC>

 - We already have a tax on the fundraising activities of charities. It has been made very clear by the Treasurer and by the government that, in relation to certain activities by charities, there is a turnover limit below which there is no requirement at all to register in relation to the GST. There are very generous exemptions as far as donated goods are concerned, there are very generous exemptions in relation to the sale of second-hand goods, and the whole scheme of the GST is designed to underpin and support the activities of charities within Australia. The fundamental principle is that, unless you go over $100,000 in relation to a charitable activity, there is no requirement at all to register for the GST. I have contributed to a number of lamington drives; I have been involved in organisations that have run them - and I would love to think that most of them had made $100,000 a year. The reality is that they have not. So, if you want an example, try something other than lamingtons.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Wannon for his question. I think all honourable members are well aware that the third ministerial conference of the WTO was held in Seattle last week. It obviously got just as much media coverage here as it did across the rest of the world. Members would also be aware that, at the end of last week, the ministerial conference concluded without the completion of a declaration launching a new round of trade negotiations. Naturally, the government is very disappointed at that outcome. Our delegation went to Seattle with a clear view of supporting the launch of a new, broad-based round of negotiations focused on gaining better market access across the world and across the critical sectors of Australia's exporting industries. We maintained from the outset that the built-in agenda of agriculture and services should have been the core of the next round of negotiations, and to that end we were prepared to support industrials.Contrary to a lot of the reporting in the media that the main cause of the breakdown at the end of the week was the demonstrations and riots in Seattle, I think the reasons run a little bit deeper than that. They go to the issue of an overly ambitious agenda that some countries were running. They wanted to inject extra issues into the agenda such as investment, labour standards, the environment and government procurement competition, which overloaded the agenda. There was not the opportunity to do enough preparatory work in Geneva before they got to Seattle to cope with that.Along with that, a lot of commentators reflected on the alleged inadequate organisation by the host country, the United States. In some areas of the whole process last week that was certainly left wanting. There was  also a focus on, as I say, the lack of agreement on text coming out of Geneva before it was presented to ministers. There was a concern before we got to Seattle that the stumbling block, if any, would be agriculture. I can report that that was not the case. The agriculture text, which we spent an entire night and day in the Green Room negotiating, was all but completed. The EU was going to sign off on that text subject to seeing what happened to their agenda as far as investment was concerned. So it was these other issues that distracted the attention of the meeting that caused the suspension of the conference at the end of the week without there being a ministerial declaration launching a round. The excessive emphasis by the United States on labour standards, despite determined resistance by developing economies, certainly did not assist the process as the week went on.The bottom line is that there was significant progress made last week with regard to where we are going to be next year. There is a built-in agenda for next year for negotiations on agriculture and services. The director-general said that the agenda and the progress that was made last week will be frozen, and that is the point from which the negotiations will begin, particularly on agriculture, next year. We need to ensure that that is the case when they return to Geneva and debriefings take place on the outcomes of last week. We need to recognise that this is now an organisation that has a membership of 135 countries of very diverse and different backgrounds and economies - the rich and the poor, the developed, the developing and the least developed economies of the world - all trying to come to consensus about the best path forward in terms of trade liberalisation. Our government remains committed to the policies that we espoused on trade liberalisation.We believe that the only way forward for Australian exporters is to continue to drive the argument for better market access. We intend to continue to prosecute that case as energetically as we possibly can. We will be doing that in the future both within the WT0 and the multilateral framework, given that we have a mandated agenda for agriculture and services to begin negotiations next year. We  will be prosecuting that case at a regional level in forums such as APEC - we will be hosting the APEC Ministerial Council meeting next year - and also on a bilateral basis, particularly in regard to strengthening the relationship within our region. The regional economies seem to be returning to a better economic state of affairs, and so are our exports into the region, as the Prime Minister said yesterday on the Sunday program. There has been a healthy 16 per cent growth in food exports to Asia in the September quarter. Total food exports are now 12.5 per cent above what they were in the September quarter 1997, and that was at the start of the crisis. We continue to focus our energies on pushing ahead with that agenda. The downside as far as Australia's exporters are concerned is that the multilateral negotiations may not be launched for another 12 months, and so we are marking time. There is no slip backwards. There is no slippage. We are looking forward to prosecuting that market access case to get a better set of outcomes for our exporters, and we will continue to do so.I must say in conclusion that the Australian delegation and the private sector NGOs who were working with us in Geneva also did an outstanding job in working the corridors both day and night and achieving the significant progress that we did. That includes the representative of the opposition who came with us and worked very closely and in concert with the government delegation there. We look forward to taking up those mandated negotiations at the beginning of next year on agriculture and services.</DOC>

 - I have not maintained that to the honourable member for Lilley, nor indeed to anybody else. It remains the case that the principles I and the government have laid out apply, including the turnover figure of $100,000 in relation to organisations. I do not know of many pie drives that raise $100,000 - I would like to believe they could. I do not know of any lamington drives that raise that much. You obviously move in more exalted circles than I do. Most of the pie drives and lamington drives I have been involved in have raised a great deal less than $100,000. I think the member for Lilley is doing what he is very good at - that is, uninformed scaremongering.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Cowper for his question and his continuing interest in the fishing industry. This government has been increasing resources available to combat illegal fishing in Australian waters, and the parliament has recently passed new legislation to give us more powers to apprehend fishing vessels operating within and outside our coastal waters attempting to obtain access to Australian fishing stocks. Last week the Australian authorities were able to apprehend a Korean vessel inside the northern Australian fishing zone. It was a major operation following the sighting by Coastwatch of the vessel. HMAS Gladstone  was dispatched to the scene. The vessel refused to stop, attempting to escape into Indonesian waters.The naval vessel fired weapons of increasingly higher calibre and eventually was able to board the vessel and apprehend the crew. This was a dangerous night-time operation, and I would like to commend the naval vessel and all of those associated with the operation, including the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and Coastwatch, for the successful apprehension. The vessel is now in  Darwin and the government expects that there will be a successful prosecution. The coalition is determined to send a clear message to those who would seek to take advantage of Australia's vast fishing zone that we are determined to police it and to police it effectively. We have the third largest fishing zone in the world and it is potentially - and already is - very productive.The new legislation gives us more powers to apprehend and board ships operating outside our zone. We can use reasonable force now to intervene where there are suspected illegal activities occurring. All of this is very important to help us protect our highly valuable and diverse fish resources. This incident involving a Korean vessel is further evidence that the government's policies to get tough on illegal fishing are working and that the various Australian agencies are cooperating effectively together to put the government's policies into force.</DOC>

 - They always go a bridge too far, don't they, in the Labor Party? The rules that the government has laid down are entirely clear: charities are GST free. That means that if you are rendering charitable services not only is there no GST on it but you get back all of the embedded tax on everything you buy. Let us go to the pie drive. Under the Labor Party, of course, if a charity buys a pie warmer they will pay sales tax on the pie warmer. - You have been running this system for years. Under the Labor Party, when the charity filled its car with petrol, it paid 43c a litre in petrol tax. Was there ever any input tax credit on petrol for a charity? Under the Labor Party, when the cars went to pick up the disabled, was there any credit for the petrol that they were putting into the cars? When they were buying the paper plates and cups, were they getting credit for any of those things? No, of course they were not. The Labor Party was operating a system where embedded into everything that charities bought for charitable activities or otherwise was a full indirect tax cost. Did we hear any complaints from the Labor Party? Was there any concern from the Labor Party over all of the time since 1932? Of course there wasn't. - The first rule is that, for a charity, its charitable services are GST free  and it gets what it has never got before and that is full input tax credits. It never got that before; never got any embedded costs in the things that it bought back under the wholesale sales tax system. - Of course they paid GST - it was embedded in everything they bought. It was in their petrol, their transport, the manufacturing process. In relation to everything that they bought there was embedded wholesale sales tax. -  - It is a good idea before you defend your own tax system to understand how it works. Wholesale sales tax embeds into every price in the community. The second thing is that, where charities are engaging in commercial activities, if they have a turnover, as the Prime Minister said, of over $100,000 they are subject to the system. That is then ameliorated by several other rules. They are not subject to it if they are selling donated second-hand goods. They are not subject to it if they are selling 50 per cent below commercial markets. They are not subject to it if they are selling 50 per cent below cost. There is no GST on the sale of donated second-hand clothing, nor indeed on any second-hand goods. The question arises: what happens if there is a transformation or a manufacturing process undertaken? If there is a transformation or a manufacturing process which is a commercial process competing with the private sector then, for reasons of competitive neutrality, the same tax system will arise. Would the Labor Party complain about that? One of the clauses that the Labor Party put in the competition policy that it signed with every state government in this country was the principle of competitive neutrality. It is a Labor Party principle. The Labor Party principle of competitive neutrality - and we support it - is simply this: where somebody is competing on a commercial basis with the private sector, they ought to be subject to the same tax arrangements. It is the same principle under which commercial operations are now starting to be charged in relation to land taxes. It is the same principle  under which all of the state governments are now seeking to make them subject, on the basis of competitive neutrality, to the various state taxes.All of these institutions are paying the financial institutions duty. Would the Labor Party ever worry about that? They pay bank account debits tax. Would the Labor Party worry about that? They pay the wholesale sales tax embedded in their price. Would the Labor Party worry about that? They pay a full 43c per litre in petrol. Would the Labor Party ever worry about that? Under the competitive neutrality principle, the government, observing its agreement as signed by the Labor Party with the state governments, ensures that where there is commercial competition the same tax in relation to that commercial competition ought to apply.	But, in relation to the GST and charitable activities, charities get something that they have never got before. They get back all of the taxes which are embedded in their prices - which means that the rendering of charitable services is cheaper than it has ever been before, and that is one of the great benefits of a modern taxation system for the 21st century.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong for his question and I acknowledge his great interest in Public Service reform and, indeed, his contribution to the development of the new legislation. Today is a historic day in the history of the Australian Public Service, because it is the first working day that the Public Service is operating under the new Public Service Act 1999. The passage and proclamation of this act,  which was proclaimed yesterday, represents a fundamental overhaul of Australian public sector management and is a major step forward to providing the basis for a high performance Australian Public Service. The old act was highly pre  scriptive, very long, very complex. It led to a process driven Public Service. The new act is one which is significantly shorter - some 47 pages; it is less than one-fifth the size of the old Public Service Act. It is accessible, understandable and written in plain English, and it articulates the distinctive character of the Australian Public Service and what the Australian Parliament expects of it. The detailed prescription of the 1922 act has been replaced by a clear statement of principles, values and the code of conduct.One of the major features of the new legislation is that it devolves employment responsibility to agency heads and vests in them the flexibility and authority to run their agencies in the way that best suits their clients, the Australian people, and the government of the day. Accountability for the use of those powers has been enhanced. Merit is, for the first time, defined clearly in legislation and will continue to be the cornerstone of employment decisions within the Public Service. Particularly importantly, the new act contains protections and a clearer statement of an apolitical Public Service. For the first time, there is a legislative requirement that the Public Service uphold defined values, including that it is apolitical and that it performs its functions in an impartial and professional manner.I want to thank all those associated with the development of this new legislation - particularly the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission and those members of the House who contributed to the development of this new act. I am sure that we will see the Australian Public Service develop as a creative and flexible service which is geared now to fully meet the needs of its clients in the Australian community.</DOC>

 - As usual, the opposition spokesman either misquotes or inadequately quotes what I said. Let me, for the benefit of those opposite, go back to what I did say. I predicted - and it remains my prediction - that, as a consequence of the introduction of the GST, cars in this country will be cheaper. That remains my prediction. That is what I said in the election. There has been no backflip. There has been no backsliding. If there has already been some discounting in anticipation of the change, then of course that is a consequence of the new tax system. It is not a consequence of anything else.	 It remains the case that the amount of tax levied under the new system is dramatically lower than the tax levied under the Labor wholesale sales tax system. You go from a 22 per cent wholesale sales tax to a 10 per cent goods and services tax. That represents a very dramatic lowering of the imposition of taxation on the sale of cars and, therefore, the prediction made by the coalition before the election was that the price of cars would be dramatically lower. Of course, that remains our prediction.I was asked on a radio program a particular question and I gave that answer. I do not deviate from the belief that, as a result of the introduction of the new taxation system, cars in this country will have a lower price. Obviously, in anticipation of the change, the market is behaving in a particular fashion. That is to be expected. The industry spokesman for the opposition knows that; anybody who understands any kind of behaviour of markets knows that.But, at the end of the day, I believe that cars in this country will be cheaper after the introduction of the new taxation system. Many of them are already cheaper. That is a direct consequence of the announcement of our new taxation policy. My take-out from all of this is that the Australian Labor Party wants to slug the car consumer with a higher rate of tax and a higher price than does the coalition. If the Australian car buyer will accept that, if the Labor Party wants to live with that, then the Labor Party is welcome to  do so. I stand by what I said in the election campaign: it remains my belief, my prediction, that the price of cars in this country will be lower as a result of the introduction of our new taxation system.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question and I recognise that he, like some other members of this House, represents a pretty big slab of the outback. The Australian outback is to us what the Highlands are to Scotland. It is one of the last great frontiers in the world today, a huge area indeed, with a population of probably only around 180,000 people. But it does, of course, contain much of the country about which Australian legends have been made. The government supports moves to declare the year 2002 Year of the Outback in this country. Those suggestions originally came from a Queenslander, Mr Bruce Campbell. They have now received strong support from governments right around Australia, which I am delighted about. The year will see a major celebration of outback history, culture and achievements. For many people around the world today, their very imagery of Australia is formed by the outback. I think the tourism potential alone must be absolutely enormous.We are told that some 80 per cent of tourists who come to Australia do so to a greater or lesser degree because they want to see something of rural and regional Australia, and yet less than 20 per cent actually ever get there, so there is a huge untapped international market in the area of tourism. Even domestically, I am told that - and the figure amazes me - over six million Australians spent all 365 days and nights at home last year; they did not leave home. Again, we could entice some of those people to go and look at our marvellous backyard. Jackie Kelly, the Minister for Sport and Tourism, is a very keen promoter of this idea as well.  There is a tremendous amount that can be achieved.The year will be promoted through events such as shows in capital cities, music festivals, art shows, special awards, perhaps a last great cattle drive of the sort that so many Australian legends were built on, and a series of other community events in regional Australia. In the first instance, we are funding a comprehensive business plan covering all facets of the year, including administration, marketing, event coordination and financing. We will be looking to see that this is a true partnership between governments, business and outback communities.</DOC>

 - I acknowledge the member for Eden-Monaro's interest in the upgrades to the AIS facility and I am pleased to report to the Prime Minister that our budget initiative for the resurfacing of the track at Bruce Stadium occurred on budget, on time. Despite extensive rain throughout October and November, the mondo surface was set at the AIS track, replacing the old surface which had bubbled and was causing some problems in the preparation of our elite athletes. The mondo surface is exactly the same as they have in Stadium Australia - a surface which will be torn up after the Paralympic Games. This will leave the mondo track at the institute as the premier athletics surface in Australia. That track is not just used by AIS athletes and Australian teams; it is also used by ACT Athletics and for Little Athletics carnivals. We have the state championships and the major events for Little As occurring at that venue. -  - I know the interest that the member for Eden-Monaro has in Little As as well as in the Paralympics and our winter preparation team. It is going to be a very valuable asset as well as a further extension of the ACT's sport and tourism program in terms of attracting major events to the ACT and holding those events of all kinds at the AIS.</DOC>

 - I would have thought that even to the Australian Labor Party, after debating this for some time -  -  - I would have thought that after all of this time the Labor Party would have become familiar with the concept of taxes embedded in prices and, just for the benefit of the Australian Labor Party, I restate the principle. A pie warmer is made by a machine on which there is wholesale sales tax. A pie warmer is transported on a truck on which there is wholesale sales tax. The truck is filled with petrol and diesel on which there is diesel excise. - The manufacturer of the pie warmer, to cope with his wholesale sales tax, puts it into the price. The transporter with the truck, to cope with his wholesale sales tax, puts it into the transport. The diesel is added into the transport. The premises have taxable goods that go into them. The electricity that is used to warm the pie warmer has embedded wholesale sales tax. And under wholesale sales tax, the state-of-the-art Labor Party tax system, which is emulated in the world by only Botswana and Swaziland, no person can get back embedded taxes. I often wonder to myself how the Australian Labor Party sits there and thinks that, of all the political parties in the world, it is the only  one that has seen the truth of wholesale sales tax. - Mr Speaker, I have to talk about wholesale sales tax to answer the question because the question is about wholesale sales tax and how it affects prices. - For anybody in business or in charity or in export, under the embedded wholesale sales tax system you do not have any chance to get back taxes on your inputs - none whatsoever. Every other country in the world is giving their exporters a free go because you get back all the taxes on your inputs. Every other country in the world is giving their manufacturers a fair go because they can get back all of the taxes embedded in their inputs. This would be the only country in the world that is standing back and not doing it. It is about time we gave them the opportunity to do it.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Kalgoorlie for his question and for his interest in this issue. As members of the House would know, the Timor Gap treaty has functioned well in creating a valid legal framework for the shared oil and gas exploitation in the area between East Timor and Australia. It is the government's strategy to encourage the smooth and continued operation of the treaty. We are looking at a two-step process which involves consultations which we are currently undertaking with all of the relevant parties. The House may be interested to know that on 17 November the Indonesian government confirmed to our ambassador in Jakarta, John McCarthy, that the treaty is no longer between Indonesia and Australia. During the course of last week, I discussed the treaty arrangements with Sergio de Mello, the special representative of the Secretary General for East Timor. The UN is willing to act for East Timor as Australia's treaty partner during the transitional phase; thereafter, the treaty will be a matter for an independent East Timor. The East Timorese have confirmed to us their acceptance of these transitional processes.I remind the House that Xanana Gusmao stated publicly on 14 October his intention - to use his words - `to respect the terms of the treaty'. On 4 December, officers from my department had discussions in Darwin with both the United Nations and the CNRT - the East Timorese officials. The East Timorese made it clear during those discussions that they still intended to respect the terms of the treaty. They may wish to revisit some aspects of the treaty later, but they do recognise the very great importance of maintaining a stable basis for investment, because clearly that is not only in Australia's interest but above  all - and much more importantly - it is in East Timor's interest. None of these things are terribly simple. Nevertheless, the work that we have been doing over quite some time now - and I have spoken in the House before on this matter - is moving ahead, in our view, fairly smoothly. We look forward to being able to continue with the exploitation of oil and gas in the Timor Gap area, obviously to some extent to the benefit of Australia but very importantly to the benefit of the people of East Timor.</DOC>

 - I think I made it quite plain the other day that the 7c was only ever indicative and that we would set the price at the time that we moved to the new arrangements. I think that is quite simple. So the level at which the excise will be reduced will be determined on the basis of the price of the fuel at that time. I cannot think of anything more simple.</DOC>

 - I am aware of some benchmarks because the then shadow minister, the member for Canberra, laid down some benchmarks by which the Labor Party would assess the Workplace Relations Act, which went  through in 1996. We have been going back to actually have a look at the benchmarks which they themselves established. There were five -  - No, these were your five benchmarks. You were invited to put up the benchmarks. It was not six, seven, eight, nine and 10. You were asked what were the benchmarks -  - Mr Speaker, in that parliament you probably supported them, very sensibly. He had five benchmarks. The first was: would industrial disputes come down under the coalition's Workplace Relations Act? As everybody knows, they have come down. The second one was: will there be more jobs created in this parliamentary term under this regime? The official figures show absolutely and without any question there are a lot more jobs under us than under Labor. The third was: will the wage outcomes be fairer? We do now know that low paid workers have in fact been dealt with much more fairly with a 7½ per cent increase in real wages in the time that we have been in office compared to a five or six per cent reduction when Labor was in office. His fourth benchmark was: will labour productivity increase faster after this act than the current trend rate of 1.75 per annum? The latest figures are 2.4, much better than the 1.2 and certainly better than the 1.75. Thank you for being so specific. His fifth question was: will the overall wage and salary outcomes be more consistent with a low inflation, low interest rate environment than the outcomes of the present system? Every home owner in the country knows that we have the lowest interest rates since the man walked on the moon, inflation is much lower and wages are tied to productivity. That is a good result for everybody.It is interesting that Labor set their own benchmarks quite specifically, put out in April  1997, and now they do not have the courage or the ticker to admit that they were wrong. They do not have the courage to stand up to the trade union movement and acknowledge that this legislation was opposed by them against the interests of the average worker. Why don't they do that? It is because, as usual, they do what they are told by the trade union movement, not just those outside this parliament but all the trade union officials sitting on the front bench, including a decade of former ACTU presidents sitting directly behind the Leader of the Opposition. It is time that the Leader of the Opposition actually developed a policy of his own, that he actually stood up against the vested interests who sit behind him and that he acknowledged the benefits for workers by sensible evolutionary reform. For this country there is no option just to say no; this country has to move forward. As we saw with the first set of reforms, we will see the beneficiaries of that approach: the average working Australian men and women.</DOC>

 - I am not aware without further inquiry of the details of individual decisions by the start-up office. I am quite certain that the Leader of the Opposition is fully aware that I would not carry that sort of information around with me, so I will undertake to have a look at the matter, as I did yesterday when I was asked a like question.As I have been asked a question on charities, I think it might be appropriate if I fulfil the undertaking I gave to the parliament yesterday and that was to investigate the suggestion made by the Leader of the Opposition that the contracts required to be signed by people getting assistance were in some way analogous to cash for comment arrangements - an absurd suggestion. The Leader of the Opposition asked whether I could confirm  that charities are being forced to sign contracts to receive financial assistance from the GST Start-Up Assistance Office. Seeing that he has asked me a question about the GST Start-Up Assistance Office, it does seem relevant that I should take this opportunity of talking on that very subject, thus anticipating any question of a point of order on relevance - the GST Start-Up Assistance Office requiring them to favourably acknowledge the contribution of the Commonwealth.I undertook to investigate what the Leader of the Opposition put to me and I can inform him that requiring organisations in receipt of government assistance to acknowledge Commonwealth assistance is hardly new. In fact, I have come across a grant contract concluded by the Department of Employment, Education and Training on 19 January 1996 when the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was in fact the minister. - Yes, this is cash for no comment, Mr Speaker, and I will explain to you how it works. It has a very interesting clause. This contract contains a section on acknowledgment and publications which contain the following:Where contract material is to be used for publication or dissemination of information or material in any form, and where at any time during or after completion of the project, the grantee - that is, the people getting the grant - publishes a book, article, newsletter or other item or material which relates to the project, the grantee shall ensure (a) no comment is made that is party political in nature . . . In other words, you cannot talk about the policy. All our contract obliges you to do is to acknowledge the source of the money, but what Labor did was to put a political gag on organisations that got money from the Labor government. It was a political gag. It goes on in (b), which is more normal, to acknowledge the support of the Commonwealth.For the Labor Party to criticise the government for including a standard acknowledgment clause is absolute nonsense. By way of further clarification, I would add that the contracts relating to funding assistance  through the GST Start-Up Assistance Office are negotiable - they are not mandated - and to date 17 contracts have been signed. There has been no difficulty with the clauses with acknowledgment and publicity. Any suggestion of cash for comment is, of course, ludicrous.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Mitchell for his question. He would be aware, I think, that ACCI-Westpac released its survey of industrial trends today which showed that industrial conditions are very, very strong. Listen to this: Mark Patterson, the Chief Executive of ACCI, said this -  - I welcome the endorsement of the business community that comes from the Labor Party by their interjections. Perhaps they could take a leaf out of the book of the Victorian Labor Premier. He does not  mind mixing with business down in Melbourne at $1,000 a head. Mark Patterson, the Chief Executive of ACCI, commented as follows:This is the last survey of this century. Once again, it is very good news. We are crossing over from the 20th century into the third millennium on a confident note. The best actual results for new orders and output in five years, a recovery in capital expenditure plans and high level of capacity utilisation indicate that, after five consecutive quarters of robust economic recovery, we can look forward to sustained growth in the year 2000.What economic policies have given Australia this sustained economic growth? They were the policies which were important for stabilising our fiscal position, taking Australia out of deficit and debt and putting the budget back in surplus. They were the policies of entering into an agreement with the Reserve Bank of Australia to give it a focused monetary policy objective in keeping interest rates low. They were the policies of reducing government debt. These have been the policies of privatisation in relation to Telstra, and industrial relations reform and competition, which have given Australia low inflation and high productivity.The member for Mitchell asks of me, `What are the alternative economic policies and what effect would they have?' We might ask ourselves: is there an alternative fiscal policy to the government's? Has the Labor Party announced a position on fiscal policy? Has the Labor Party announced a position on monetary policy? Does the Labor Party have a policy on privatisation? Does the Labor Party have a debt retirement policy? Does the Labor Party have a tax policy? Is there an alternative tax policy? I was very interested to read the Sydney Morning Herald of Wednesday, 1 December 1999 where Michelle Grattan reported:The Opposition Leader, Mr Beazley, conceded yesterday that in promising to 'roll back' the GST the Labor Party was travelling an uncharted road with an unknown destination.. . .              . . .             . . .'You don't have to see the end of the process when you start down the road. The point is to start the journey.  'We're committed to rolling it back; you'll have to give us time as to what this means.'That is what Mr Beazley said. Here is the old John Lennon Nowhere Man on an uncharted road with an unknown destination - and this is modern leadership in the Labor Party. The thing that keeps them together is not policy, because they do not have any of that. The reason why you hear these incessant detailed questions is that that is the one thing that can keep the Labor Party together.I want to speak up today in defence of the member for Hotham because he has been under sustained attack in his party room for supporting the government policy on capital gains tax cuts. In his party room today he got flak from MPs that were kept in the dark on the business tax deal. We went back to see if he had ever made a speech on the economy, which he has not done yet after over 12 months in the job. He made one speech on capital gains tax back on 19 February 1999. I think it is his piece de resistance. At that stage, he extolled Labor's capital gains tax policy. He said:It was Labor that introduced capital gains tax in 1985 as a direct base broadening and equity measure . . . - Hear, hear! He continued:It raised $2.4 billion in 1996-97 and would be considerably higher now . . . Here was the pledge on 19 February 1999:Labor will not support any weakening of the capital gains tax base.That was on 19 February. By the end of November, contrary to what the backbench thinks, the member for Hotham took a brave and decisive stand. It was his most economically responsible stand - he supported the Liberal Party. A Labor frontbencher that supports the Liberal Party is a Labor frontbencher taking an economically responsible position every time.We would recommend more brilliant strategies to the Labor Party such as supporting Liberal Party policy. It is a brilliant strategy from the Labor Party. It gives you a position on things. It indicates that there is some depth  of thought, and we congratulate you, as your backbench congratulates you, on a brilliant decision to support the government on business taxation.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Lilley. I am not advised as to the reasons for particular decisions but, given the basis on which the start-up office has been organised and given the rationale behind the funding of the whole process of explaining the implementation of the GST, I would defend a decision to give money to an organisation like the National Farmers Federation on the grounds that it has a capacity to facilitate the explanation of the implementation of this policy change to a very significant section of the Australian community.The coalition believes in giving advice and help to Australia's farmers. The coalition believes that it is responsible use of taxpayers' funds to put them in the way of organisations that in turn will be part of the education process in relation to the new taxation system. As I said in answer to the first question asked by the Leader of the Opposition, I naturally do not carry around the details of every single decision made by the start-up office. But for anybody in the Labor Party to suggest that there is something odd, something indefensible, something to be criticised, about using an organisation like the National Farmers Federation as a way of ensuring that the farmers of this country - which generate an enormous amount of export  wealth for Australia - get the benefit of explanation regarding the implementation of the GST strikes me as odd, even if it is somebody who is so insensitive and so indifferent to the plight of rural Australia.At a time when the farmers of Australia have been done in the eye by the World Trade Organisation negotiating process, at a time when difficulties are being imposed, I think it is entirely proper of the government to use such an organisation, which I think has a very fine track record of advocating intelligent changes and being willing to argue the case of important changes to its constituents. I think the farmers of Australia will take note of the fact that once again the Australian Labor Party is hostile to their interests.</DOC>

 - There has been quite a bit of interest, of course, in recent days in Virgin Airlines and its proposals for setting up a subsidiary here in this country. I can confirm that the government has granted Virgin foreign investment approval to establish a new domestic airline, subject to it meeting our other regulatory requirements. In particular, of course, and most importantly, that means our safety requirements. Airport Coordination Australia has provisionally issued Virgin with departure and arrival slots at Sydney airport, including slots during the peak periods.In terms of making some other comments about this very interesting development, the House will recall that the Treasurer and I announced in June of this year that the government would allow foreign companies to own up to 100 per cent of an Australian domestic airline or establish a new airline - unless, of course, it was somehow contrary to the national interest.It ought to be also understood that it is as a result of our policy initiatives that this new entrant is possible. This could not have happened under Labor Party policy. I believe that there will be benefits for the travelling public and Australia. We do welcome the prospect of increased competition on the domestic airline market. The deregulation of our domestic airlines provided very real benefits to the travelling public. But, as a matter of interest, air fares have been moving upwards in real terms - in quite substantial terms - in recent times. Economy class alone has increased by about eight per cent in recent years.Increased airline competition offers, I think, the very real prospect of reduced prices for the travelling public. It offers the real prospect of further jobs, particularly in regional areas, with the further growth of tourism. As Virgin confronts other issues - negotiating terminal access with the private sector operators of the major airports and so forth, clearing up the key regulatory approvals before it can start operating - I think that we have a real prospect here to look forward to greater access to reasonably priced air fares, which can be of substantial national interest. Whilst we acknowledge that Virgin Airlines has a lot of work still to do, this is a welcome development and one that, if handled properly, will indeed benefit the travelling public.</DOC>

 - I stand by what I said yesterday. Most of the pie drives and lamington drives I have been associated with have raised less than $100,000. I want to make that perfectly clear. Obviously, I do not move in the exalted, more elite circles of the opposition; my pie drives have had considerably less success. The principle that was enunciated yesterday remains true: any operation that has a turnover of less than $100,000 is not in the GST.There is, as the Treasurer reminds me, a capacity to run the fundraising activities in relation to fetes and other things quite separately from an organisation's other activities. The whole structure of this has been designed to ensure that small organisations are not caught up in any way with the operation of the GST. I think the $100,000 limit is a very, very generous one. The principle is that, if you are carrying on an operation which is in commercial competition with the business sector, then, obviously, another principle applies. But, if the activities are of a charitable kind, the legislation has been designed in a way to ensure that the application of the GST is as I have outlined.There is, of course, a great deal of misinformation around about the GST and, while I am on my feet, I might draw the attention of the House to an article that appeared on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald which referred to World Vision's finance director, Mr Greg Hempenstall, who said:that he would seek clarification on whether child sponsorship programs would be subject to the GST, after a Taxation Office ruling that any charity sponsorship where the donor received `consideration' would be taxable. I am advised that, because these arrangements are in the nature of donations, they will not in any way be subject to the GST. And, as the Treasurer reminds me, they are income tax deductible as well.</DOC>

 - Australian farmers certainly are very disappointed that the Seattle round of World Trade Organisation talks did not herald the beginning of a new, vigorous round of discussions to achieve fairer and freer trade, particularly in agricultural products. There would be no group of farmers more disappointed at the breakdown of these discussions than sugar producers, such as those who are represented, very effectively, by the member for Hinkler. The sugar market is perhaps the most corrupt of all of the agricultural markets around the world and it is an industry where there is a crying need for international trade reform.I acknowledge the efforts of our trade minister in Seattle because, in spite of all the odds, it seems that more progress was made in relation to agricultural discussions than in any other field. Indeed, as the minister reported yesterday to the House, an agreement could have been reached on agriculture had it not been for the fact that some other countries, particularly the United States and those in the European Union, were determined to introduce into the discussions a whole lot of non-trade type issues - issues such as employment, food security, investment policies and the like. It is unfortunate that those non-trade issues should appear at trade talks. These talks were essentially about achieving a better trade regime and there are other forums for those sorts of matters to be discussed. It is unfortunate that by dragging these items across the agenda a satisfactory agreement  could not be obtained to proceed with worthwhile talks in relation to agricultural trade.Australia will continue to press for reforms in this area. We will continue to reject programs like the huge US farm subsidies in the last farm subsidy bill. We will reject concepts like multifunctionality - the European objective that farmers fundamentally have a role in making the hillsides look attractive, keeping cows there so the tourists can have pretty pictures. This concept that farmers are just actors in a Disneyland style theme park is not consistent with fair and free world trading regimes. Farmers can be effective traders and effective contributors to the national economy by supplying goods in a reasonable and fair way.It may be of interest to the House that farmers in countries in the European Union where subsidies are high are leaving the land at a greater rate than those in non-subsidised countries. It is a fallacy to suggest that this sort of protection guarantees income for farmers. Australia will continue with the efforts that were introduced by the previous Minister for Trade, the member for Farrer, and followed on by the current minister in bilateral discussions with various nations. We will be tough negotiators. We have already taken substantial steps to liberalise our own markets and we now have a right to expect better outcomes in these discussions in the future.</DOC>

I think the exemptions proposed are fair and reasonable. I believe the carve-out is justified and I think that, when the full ramifications are known and understood - there is of course a process involved which is going on at the moment; it does not start up until 1 July next year - that will be widely known in the Australian community.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Forde for her question and for the interest that she takes in all the employment services in her electorate. The Job Network has obviously been good for job seekers generally because it has been performing about 50 per cent better than the old CES at the vital task of getting unemployed people into work. However, there has been some concern at different times that the Job Network might not work quite so well for job seekers from a non-English speaking background. I can inform the House that, of some 400,000 intensive assistance commencements, 93,000 have been job seekers from a non-English speaking background. Fourteen per cent of job seekers overall are of a non-English speaking background but 21 per cent of intensive assistance commencements are job seekers from a non-English speaking background.The system has successfully targeted disadvantage factors in referring job seekers to intensive assistance. I can also tell you, Mr Speaker, that three months after leaving intensive assistance 39 per cent of non-English speaking background job seekers have been in paid employment or further education or training. Three months after leaving Job Search Training, which is another one of the Job Network programs, 49 per cent of non-  English speaking background job seekers are in paid employment or further education or training. These are actually slightly better outcomes than for job seekers generally.The good news from Job Network 1 should improve further in Job Network 2. In areas where 10 per cent of job seekers are of non-English speaking background, all providers must demonstrate a capacity to help non-English speaking background people. Under Job Network 2 there is also the capacity for specialist providers. I am pleased to say that there will be five non-English speaking background specialist providers under Job Network 2. As well, there will be specialist providers for indigenous job seekers, job seekers with disabilities and other special categories of disadvantaged job seeker. This performance based competitive Job Network is going to go from strength to strength in the months ahead and provide even better results for Australia's disadvantaged job seekers.</DOC>

 - All charitable activities are GST free. That is in the legislation. -  - I notice that the member for Hotham - the Duke of Hotham - is now worried about embedded taxes. He has never been worried about embedded taxes - wholesale sales taxes - in things that charities have been buying for the last 70 years. You never worried about embedded taxes before  and today you got worried about embedded taxes. You have been happy for the last 70 years for charities to be buying things with embedded taxes and, all of a sudden, because you lack a policy, you got worried about embedded taxes today.I often ask myself: if this government wasn't engaging in tax reform, what possible questions would the opposition be asking in question time? What possible policy would you have? After 1 July of next year, what possible questions will they be asking? Here they are on an uncharted road with a destination unknown - self-described, the leader of the Labor Party.The government set up a thing called the Charities Consultative Committee, which went through all of these matters with the charities. It resolved some hundreds of them. From 350 questions they got down to 60. They resolved nearly all of them, and one of the ones they resolved was this point. The point I was making on ABC radio this morning was the way in which this was resolved between the Taxation Office and the charities, whereby the tax office said that entities have the option to run events as arms-length unregistered activities, the proceeds being a donation and paid across tax free. What I said on the radio is what the tax office had said. A donation does not have a GST, I am afraid. -  - He just said a donation has a GST. Here is a man who is engaged in the biggest campaign against something he yet doesn't understand. A donation does not have a GST. And there it is in the report which I referred to on AM  -  -  - Here we have the question about what I say on AM  this morning, which happens to be the ruling which the Commissioner of Taxation gives - and that is some kind of heinous sin. Then he raises the question of books or anything else that comes under the de minimus rule - the de minimus rule which had been enacted by the Labor Party - and that was a heinous sin as well. Here you have the opposition on a stunt a minute - no policy, an uncharted road to an unknown destination, from a nowhere leader who has no policy. The only leadership they ever showed in the last year was in following the Liberal and National parties - the best decision they ever made - and they ought to do a lot more of it.</DOC>

 - I welcome the opportunity presented by the honourable member for Barker to indicate that the government's program in respect of information technology outsourcing is continuing down an outstanding path and bringing enormous benefits for the whole of government. This program is designed to attract jobs, to attract investment, to help small and medium businesses in Australia and to generate substantial savings for its taxpayers.Yesterday, the government signed contracts with IBM Global Services Australia for the provision of IT services to the Department of Health and Aged Care and the Health Insurance Commission. These contracts will deliver about $70 million in new business to Australian small and medium enterprises. At the same time, they will improve service levels and save taxpayers $30,000 a day for every day of the five-year contracts.The winning bidder not only had to deliver improved services and to provide an immediate windfall for taxpayers but also had to commit to delivering significant long-term benefits for the Australian IT&amp;T industry. Those benefits include: some $260 million worth of products and services, which will be sourced and developed in Australia; new business initiatives which will generate over $100 million worth of exports, of which $24 million worth of exports will be generated for small and medium Australian businesses; some strategic investment worth $9.5 billion; and, best of all, the creation of 282 new jobs, of which 160 will be located in regional Australia.The new contracts will see IBM Global Services Australia create 105 jobs in Brisbane, and I am sure the honourable member for Griffith would welcome that particular decision. They will result in ASI Solutions, an Australian SME, establishing its manufacturing operations in the Northern Territory. These contracts will deliver some $600,000 in cash and computing equipment to the University of Ballarat, and I know the honourable member for Ballarat welcomes that decision in this outsourcing initiative. These results, once again, validate the government's strategy to outsource the Commonwealth's IT infrastructure needs. They demonstrate, once again, that the government is determined to use its purchasing power to promote the growth of the Australian IT&amp;T industry.</DOC>

 - The answer to the first part of the honourable member's question is no, but I will find out exactly what the Queensland branch of the Royal Life Saving Society has had to say. I will very carefully check it against everything that has been attributed to that organisation.In relation to the more general point raised by the honourable member, I do not accept for a moment that the application of the GST will be damaging to the charitable sector. I believe that the arrangements that have been put in place, including the arrangements that were alluded to by the Treasurer in the answer that he gave a few moments ago, clearly indicate that, once we get rid of this scare campaign that is being engaged in by the Australian Labor Party -  -  - The Labor Party have only one policy, and that is a policy to go down on their bended knees and pray and hope that the GST falls over. That is the only policy. They are bereft of any alternative. That is the only policy they have. The Leader of the Opposition made it very clear that one of the reasons why they signed up to the capital gains tax changes was so that they could focus in an entirely and completely negative fashion on the introduction of the GST. By this line of questioning, they are revealing themselves as total political frauds. They are revealing themselves as a group of  men and women who, after four years in opposition, have no policy. - The Leader of the Opposition, by his interjection, merely confirms the negative approach that he is taking to politics. The Labor Party has now had almost four years in opposition. In that four years in opposition, it has developed no employment policy. - The Leader of the Opposition has had almost four years to develop an alternative philosophy. He tells us in general terms that he is going to roll this tax back. He does not say how he is going to roll it back. He does not tell us where the money is coming from. - As I understand it, it is part of the position of the Australian Labor Party to roll this tax back. We would like to know where they are going to roll it back. We would like to know where the money is coming from. - Oh, not a policy! - The Prime Minister will resume his seat!</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The honourable member for Aston always shows a very real interest in the serious side of international issues and, in particular, important policy questions. Honourable members will of course be aware that the Korean Peninsula is a security flashpoint in a region which is of immense importance to Australia. We have very much welcomed the advances that have been made in dialogue between the United States and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea over the last few months in the context of what is sometimes called the Perry review. I am especially pleased that a policy objective of the United States, which is  certainly shared by Australia and other regional countries, that North Korea suspend long range missile tests has apparently been endorsed by the North Korean government. As a result of that, the United States is proposing to lift certain trade sanctions against North Korea.When I was in New York on 27 September I met with the North Korean Foreign Minister, Mr Paek. That was the first ministerial level meeting between an Australian and a North Korean foreign minister in 24 years. During that meeting I did urge North Korea to do what it could to reduce tensions in North Asia. As a result of that meeting, North Korea has since invited Australian officials to Pyongyang for a further round of talks. We are discussing dates at the moment, but those talks are likely to take place some time during February.Whether Australia moves in time towards the recognition again of the DPRK, and, importantly, the re-establishment of diplomatic relationships with the DPRK, is a matter which is still under consideration. What we absolutely want to do is to maintain the pressure that we can maintain on North Korea to make a very serious contribution to enhance regional security not only through the suspension of plans to conduct long range missile tests but also by abandoning various programs that North Korea has considered over the years for the development of weapons of mass destruction.Let me say in conclusion to the honourable member's question that the Australian government has been of the view that we should make a humanitarian contribution to North Korea given the very serious humanitarian problems that certainly have existed there. I remind the House of the visit by the former member for Holt and the member for Griffith to North Korea during this year and their representations to me about the particularly dire situation of food supplies in North Korea. We announced on 16 May a $10 million humanitarian assistance program for North Korea. We will of course consider, as the months unfold during next year, whether there will be a need for us to provide any addition  al assistance over and above what we are already committed to.North Korea is not only a problem in terms of the regional security architecture but also an important component of our region. It is, I think, appropriate that Australia should, at the very least, have a constructive dialogue, or as constructive a dialogue as we can maintain, with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Parramatta for his question. In the last sitting week I was asked a question about the monitoring of prices during the introduction of Australia's new tax system; perhaps on that occasion I was a little conservative with some of the figures that I was using. On that occasion I said that over one million prices would be monitored during the transition to the new taxation system. After having received updated advice from the ACCC, I can advise the House that over three million prices will be monitored between December 1999 and December 2001. That will comprise seven  different collections of prices and will cover between 8,000 and 9,000 outlets right across Australia, including outlets in the electorate of Parramatta and in the electorate of a number of my colleagues on both sides of the House. This will mean that in the first collection of prices there will be over 610,000 assessments, so 610,000 prices will be considered in the first round.The ACCC is likely to have access on a monthly basis to information on up to 80,000 prices for browngoods - which are TVs and stereos and so on - and whitegoods and approximately 30,000 grocery prices. The ACCC is further developing details in relation to prices on petrol, motor vehicles and bank fees. In addition, I can advise the House that the ACCC is sending out to more than 1.3 million businesses information about GST price exploitation in a fact sheet called `Price exploitation: what every business must know'.It is timely to remind the House that, if businesses seek to exploit the transition to the new tax system, they may be fined up to $10 million per company per offence and up to half a million dollars per person per offence. If you are going to cheat during the transition to the new tax system, you will pay the price.</DOC>

 - The Leader of the Opposition asked me about a social coalition. Before I come to the detail of the Leader of the Opposition's question, I would remind the Leader of the Opposition that this government has provided unprecedentedly generous incentives for business to give to charitable organisations. This government has been far more generous, so this is the last thing that the Leader of the Opposition can suggest.As far as the Leader of the Opposition's question is concerned, the principle that I have enunciated remains true; that is, if the activity is under a certain level, then they are not caught in the GST net. In relation to any commercial activities, so far as the charity is concerned, there is no application. When you apply those principles, it is perfectly obvious that 10 per cent will not be payable.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Deakin for the question, because I know that honourable members are very interested in issues relating to the expansion of tourism markets and making Australia a more attractive destination for those who come on short-term business arrangements, particularly where they are likely to enhance not only our economy but also a range of opportunities for Australians through the initiatives in which they may be involved.Tourism is one of the largest export earners and it is important that we do develop it, but we need to do so in a way which maintains the integrity of our immigration system. To that end I would like to advise the House of  the way in which the government is seeking to do that. I recently asked a former colleague, along with a former Labor minister, to participate as part of a reference group to look at the steps that might be able to be taken to make it easier for employers, for instance, to identify people who are working in Australia without a legal right to do so.Employers can already check with my department if they need information, and we are going to expand that arrangement with the addition of a toll-free number. We are going to implement a revised employer awareness campaign to ensure that employers are aware of their obligations when seeking to engage staff. But for employers who ignore the services and the information available and continue to employ people who are either here on tourist visas with no work rights or who are unlawful and have no entitlement to work in Australia, the reference group in the department that have assisted in relation to this have recommended a range of sanctions that might now be imposed.The proposals envisage that first offenders would be given a written notice and that there would then be an opportunity to focus on their obligations. However, employers who repeatedly and persistently take on people who are unlawful or who are on visitor visas will face sanctions including fines of up to $66,000 and up to two years in jail. The object here is to ensure that employers who are able to meet their legal obligations and to uphold the law are not at a disadvantage in relation to others who are seeking to exploit people's vulnerability.With this in mind, I am very conscious of the seasonal and short-term requirements of some industries. I have agreed to expand the working holidaymaker program this year to about 78,000 places, with an increase of something in the order of 13,000 places from the numbers issued this year. That should make it easy for a number of people in agribusinesses, as well as in some of the casual opportunities that exist in the Australian labour market, to be able to access people who can lawfully work on a casual basis.I have also decided to offer a fee waiver to all short-term business entrants travelling on  the electronic travel authority. This will be a significant breakthrough for business travellers and will be of particular benefit to meeting the needs of conventions and exhibitions and the like that are held within Australia. Conventions generate something in the order of $3 billion for Australia's economy. The ETA system can work effectively to help in expanding that range of opportunities.Finally, I do intend to introduce a new sponsored visitor class with an optional security bond. This should further open up opportunities for family and business visitors and, I am sure, will be welcomed. The measures I have outlined today will be a boost to Australian industry. They do occur in a way which enables us to maintain the integrity of our immigration system and our border arrangements.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Boothby for his question. During this last sitting of the parliament before the year 2000, I think it is appropriate that he should ask such a question and that I have the opportunity to say something about Y2K preparations overseas. My department has been monitoring very carefully what other countries have been doing to prepare for the Y2K problem, including in discussions with foreign governments and representatives of key sectors in those countries and also with Australian telecommunications, aviation and power sectors and, over and above that, with the relevant UN specialised agencies. Since February, my department has provided advice to the Australian community on the international dimensions of Y2K. We have issued a large number of consular advices so that the public are aware of what the problems might be.On 7 October, in particular, an assessment was issued by my department on the impact of Y2K on key sectors in 70 countries in which the Australian government is represented. That information, for the information of the House, is available on the Internet. The media have also been briefed and the department has written to the travel industry, airlines and other relevant people. All Australian missions overseas have completed extensive Y2K checks and all key systems have been  certified as compliant - so I hope they are. They have also put contingency plans in place to minimise the effect of Y2K disruption on essential consular services.In Canberra, a departmental task force will be operating on a 24-hour basis from 31 December 1999 to assess difficulties if and when they arise. In particular, it will address the impact on Australian exporters and also on consular services. So the department is doing all that it possibly can to ensure that the interests of Australians who are travelling at the time of the beginning of the millennium are properly protected. I would urge Australians who are thinking of travelling at that time to ensure that they keep in contact with my department's web site because that will be regularly updated to reflect information on major Y2K developments overseas.</DOC>

 - Once again, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has misrepresented what was said by the government during the campaign.

 - I thank the member for McEwen for her question. One of the reasons why apprenticeships have increased to record levels in Australia - they are now standing at about a quarter of a million - is that New Apprenticeships gives employers choice about who provides the off-the-job training. This is through the so-called user choice element of the New Apprenticeships system. Under this element, employers and apprentices can choose whether the off-the-job training will be provided by a TAFE or a private training provider. This means that the training meets the needs of the business and the needs of the employer. It has been a powerful factor in driving up the quality of off-the-job training under the New Apprenticeships system. Why businesses are so supportive of New Apprenticeships is that it is an enterprise friendly system that gives them training which increases their productivity and profitability.I am very disturbed to report to the House that last week the Victorian Labor government, under union pressure, decided to freeze user choice in Victoria. This means that no private training provider in Victoria will be allowed to increase the number of apprentices in the coming year. It also means that no new private training provider can enter the training market.Let us be very clear about this: employers like user choice. Victoria has reneged on the national policy agreed to by the ministerial council on training. As a result, many employers in Victoria will not be able to get the  training they want for their employees. And it is very likely that many employers will be discouraged from taking on new apprentices next year in Victoria because of this ideological policy forced on the Labor government by the trade union movement.This illustrates what happens to training opportunities for young Australians when policy is controlled by a political party dominated by the trade unions. It is a lesson to all Victorians about why the Labor Party, when in office federally, strangled the apprenticeship system, what it is likely to mean in the future and what it would mean for a Labor Party led by a leader on an uncharted road, heading nowhere, waiting for the trade union movement to deliver training policy to that party.It is this government to which young Australians and businesses turn to create new opportunities for young people to get skills. It is the Labor Party and its supporters in the trade union movement who are choking off those opportunities.</DOC>

 - As I do with other examples put to me by the opposition, I will examine what the Leader of the Opposition has said. If there is anything I can add as a result of that examination, I will. The Leader of the Opposition in his question spoke of the impact of the GST on the charitable sector. - Oh, he didn't? He is not talking about the GST anymore? - Oh, I see. You didn't say anything about the GST? - The Leader of the Opposition talked about the impact of the GST. I have just had drawn to my attention some remarks that have been made by a couple of people who know something about the impact of the GST on services provided to the needy in our community. One of them is a spokesman for an organisation called the Salvation Army, which of course is probably the best known and amongst the most respected welfare organisations in this country, if not in the world. Their spokesman being interviewed on Canberra radio this morning had this to say: The Salvation Army is now comfortable with the GST with the compensation that is being provided by the government. We believe that the government is providing adequate compensation, that in fact the government is providing funding for ongoing education. We have signed off on it more or less with still a little bit of tinkering around the edges and some discussion but they're only just minor discussions.In other words, the spokesman for the Salvation Army is saying that the Salvation Army is now `comfortable with the GST with the compensation that is being provided by the government'. I would have thought if you were talking about the attitude of the welfare sector -  - Going beyond the Salvation Army, we go to a spokesman for the Wesley Mission, also a very highly respected, generous, effective provider of social welfare in this country. Its spokesman, Mr Richard Menteith, had this to say on the ABC 7.30 Report  televised last night:Wesley Mission has always seen the GST as a significant improvement on the other tax paradigms and regimes that we've had in previous years.I am not surprised that he would say that because it is a significant improvement on the wholesale sales tax system that the Leader of the Opposition wants to bring back to the Australian tax system. He then went on to say:We need to recognise that the tax changes, the tax reforms, are here to stay. We need to learn how to work within the rules.Basically, we've got to not worry about the difficulties that these may introduce but, rather, have a  look at the way in which we can adjust our methods of doing things.Can I say in relation to those two organisations, amongst the most respected welfare organisations in the nation - indeed the Salvation Army's repute for compassion is world renowned as indeed are the various activities of the Wesley Mission - I think both of those spokesmen more accurately understand and reflect the intelligent view in the welfare sector. They are not intimidated. They are not encouraged by the ridiculous scare campaign of the Leader of the Opposition.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Curtin for her question. I can answer her question by saying that from 1 July next year 80 per cent of Australians are going to face a marginal income tax rate of 30 per cent or less. That is great news for the working families of Australia. If you happen to be on $50,000 at the moment you can go onto a tax rate of 48½ per cent - that is the Labor Party tax rate. For people who are on $50,000, under the coalition from 1 July next year that 47c marginal income tax rate will come down to 30 per cent. That will be a great thing for the working families of Australia.In addition to that, the government will be increasing family allowances. Let us take the example of a one-income couple with one child under five years of age. That couple currently on a salary of $29,000 would be paying under Labor's tax rate $6,317 in tax, and under the coalition's new tax rates on 1 July next year they will be paying $5,515 - a saving of $802 in income tax alone. But we have to take into account family assistance. At the moment they would qualify for family assistance of $3,127. Under the new family assistance rates next year, they will qualify for family assistance of $5,355 - an increase  of $2,228. That family, with tax cuts and family assistance, will have $58.27 per week additional assistance. That will be a great thing for the families of Australia.The Labor Party of course would have you believe they are in favour of income tax cuts; they are just against the measure that would pay for them. Where have we heard this before - the idea that you could be against indirect tax rises but in favour of income tax cuts? That was actually put in a statute. It was not just a promise; it was l-a-w before the 1993 election. The Labor Party said you could have income tax cuts without any indirect tax changes. Here is the bill, which is still law, which put the income tax law that was promised before 1993 right off the record to a date which was to be proclaimed not later than 1 July 1994. There is the law. Those income tax cuts under the Labor Party were not proclaimed for one day. There was not one cent, one day, of income tax cuts.The modern Labor Party are basically trying to do the whole stunt over again. They would come in here and tell you, `We're against GST and we're in favour of income tax cuts.' What they will never do is tell you how they could possibly be paid for. On the one hand, they say that they are against GST and they support wholesale sales tax. On the other hand, they say that maybe they are in favour of keeping GST, but they will roll it back. The immortal words of `nowhere man', the Leader of the Opposition, are `I am on an uncharted road with an unknown destination.' Here is the nowhere man, the Leader of the Opposition. He is on an unchartered road with an unknown destination. One day he is for the wholesale sales tax, along with modern, progressive taxation systems to be found in Botswana and Swaziland. The next day, he says, `I am going to keep the GST, but I will roll it back. It is an uncharted road with an unknown destination.' This is a man who could not stand press scrutiny for an hour.When he was asked yesterday what his policy on the GST was, he rose to the dispatch box and said, `We will take it off health.' Well, health is GST free. After that was pointed out to him, he said, `Oh, well, I'll reconsider that.' He had a policy yester  day I think for 30 seconds at the dispatch box. He was going to take it off health until he realised it was off health. He is on his uncharted road to an unknown destination. He is the nowhere man of modern taxation who stands up here because he does not have a policy shred to rely on in his life. He asks all these little questions to hide the real weakness in this debate - the complete and utter lack of policy from the Labor Party.</DOC>

 - I am not going to get into details of particular organisations without further investigation. But I can acknowledge that there are certain transitional provisions that mean that where the GST is payable in relation to club memberships, then the imposition of the GST or the anticipation of the GST is being taken account of by a number of those organisations, given that membership fees paid now will cover a period beyond 1 July next year. That was made perfectly clear in the transitional legislation that was introduced by the Treasurer.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Pearce for her question. There is no question that the continuing prosperity of small business is good for Australia - it is good for people who are looking for a job; it is good for boosting the living standards of all Australians. That is why this government is unashamedly pro small business. We are very keen about and do give high priority to small business. One of the reasons Australia is doing well today is that we have encouraged our small business community to get out there and invest, take a punt, make things happen, employ more people.When we were first elected, we set up the Bell committee, which was to go around looking at red tape on small business. In a nutshell, we want small business to spend more time running their businesses than they do filling out the red tape put on them by government. One of the Charlie Bell committee recommendations was a new system of tax administration. This is terribly important for small business. I notice that yesterday and a week or so ago we had a question about the business activity statement and the two-page form that small business will have to fill out. Yesterday we had a stunt from the Labor Party about paperwork. Having the Labor Party talk about the concerns of small business is a bit of a joke. Not one of those opposite have ever been in small business. -  - The ACTU is becoming a small business, that is true. Most of those opposite are former trade union officials. They would not know a small business if they fell over it. What incredible hypocrisy. I asked for a sample of the paperwork which today confronts small business as a result of the tax system that the Labor Party put in place. Just for starters, we have got one form, plus the information to go with it. What did Labor have when they were in office? They had a minimum of 21 forms against our form. They had sales tax, a reportable payments declaration, a voluntary agreement for pre  scribed payments, a payment summary, a payee declaration, prescribed payments, a prescribed payments householder payments summary, an application for registration as a group employer, a paying authority notification form and on and on. And that is before you even take out all the advices that go with them.The fact is that when we get to 1 July we are putting in place a much better system for small business when it comes to tax administration. The incredible hypocrisy of the Labor Party is that on this one issue they support the introduction of a pay as you go system. We are getting rid of reportable payments, prescribed payments, PAYE and provisional tax - just to mention four of them. That is a huge benefit to the small business community, and yet the Labor Party are out there running a scare campaign on the basis of paperwork. We are for the first time as a government tackling the problem of paperwork for small business, and what is your policy? You have had two good policies recently. You supported the capital gains tax initiative, and that is a great benefit for small business. Halving capital gains tax is really putting incentive back into the system for small business. The second thing that you have been supporting is the pay as you go system. The massive attack that we have made on red tape is a huge boost to small business. We look forward to its introduction. I have got the pile of old forms here, if you are strong enough to carry it out.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. The fact is that the government's tax reforms will provide a major boost to rural and regional Australia. In the first instance, the point has to be made that rural economies of the sort that you have just described are export economies. The essential nature of rural economies is that they are export economies. The first thing that tax reform of the sort that we are talking about does in this country is remove the embedded tax burden on exports - $4½ billion of embedded taxes on exports; $900 million a year for the farm sector alone. I have heard no suggestion from the other side at all that they even understand this problem, let alone have a policy solution for it. None of them have ever exported. Well, they have got in the way of a few exports and got in the way of the jobs of the people who depend upon exports, but they have never grappled with the question of the embedded tax burden on our exports.Transport costs too are dramatically reduced. In a country like ours, dependent upon exports, massive reductions in transport costs are very important. This is the last year of provisional tax. Hated by small businesses and farmers everywhere, Labor's provisional tax goes. The burden of capital gains tax has already been lifted. What is the alternative? Well, it is Labor's, which in a nutshell is higher taxes and higher costs, particularly in rural and regional areas. Coming to those transport costs, the cost of diesel for heavy transport is slashed by 23c a litre. Costs are further reduced, with all wholesale sales tax going. - Of course farmers pay that. He does not understand. It is built into everything they do because they depend on transport. It is called `embedded'. You do not get a concession on wholesale sales tax on your truck. - Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition does not understand the nature of the tax system that they defend. All excise on rail goes, and GST as a business input on fuel goes as well. By this time next year, provisional tax will be a thing of the past, and capital gains tax reforms are already in place, bringing a new confidence in business and retirement planning in regional Australia.Let us come back to this alternative for a moment. By default, it is obviously the defence of the existing system. It is the defence of a broken system. We know it is broken because of 1993, when they told us that we could have tax cuts, l-a-w law tax cuts, without increases in any of the other taxes. As soon as they got into power, what happened? They have been harping on about fuel taxes in recent days. What did you do to the fuel excise immediately upon your return? You pushed it 10c up on leaded and 5c on unleaded, with commensurate rises in transport fuel costs. What hypocrisy for you people to talk about fuel costs in rural areas! Look at your record on it. Then we come, of  course, to your refusal to ever move on provisional tax. You never even reduced the uplift factor. We had the introduction of capital gains tax, and it grew much more rapidly than even your own figures anticipated. You did not cut it. You certainly did not offer to remove it for small businesses and for farmers in the way that we have recently done.So where is Labor's solution? They say they have this new-found concern for rural and regional Australia. Where is their solution to the problem of the embedded tax burden on our exports? Where is the leadership on this vitally important issue for rural and regional Australia? It is all about trying to look good on a lazy indulgent surf on a wave of a broken tax system that, firstly, will not boost export competitiveness, secondly, will not help regional jobs and, thirdly, will not meet our future expenditure needs. It will not meet our future expenditure needs unless we keep repeating Labor's 1993 performance - pushing up fuel excise, pushing up wholesale sales tax and pushing up personal tax rates. It is a broken system. That is the only alternative on record, and they keep promoting it.</DOC>

 - I am delighted to respond to the member's question and to remind the House that the government's new tax reform will, as the Deputy Prime Minister mentioned, sweep $900 million of taxes from farmers' budgets. For the first time, farmers will be able to compete on a level playing field with the tax systems of their competitors around the world. The facts are that Australian farmers, along with those in Swaziland, Botswana and the Solomon Islands, are the only ones left in the world who have to bear the burden of wholesale sales tax and a range of other indirect taxes in their production costs. That puts them at a significant disadvantage.When the fruit producers from the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee are selling their fruit around the world, they have a tax burden that other countries do not have to bear. But when fruit comes into Australia from other parts of the world, it comes in  without those taxes. Australian farmers have one hand tied behind their back, because they are paying these embedded taxes on their production. By introducing a modern taxation system, we will be able to compete much more fairly. When New Zealand cheese comes into Australia without the burden of wholesale sales taxes and an old-fashioned tax system, it will compete evenly with Australian cheese. Australian farmers will not have to bear the cost of the WST and fuel tax on their transport which helped to make them uncompetitive.This is a significant turnaround for farmers - a real advance for them to enable them to compete fairly and evenly with farmers around the world and to help boost our exports. Around 70 per cent of Australian farm produce is exported, so it is vital that our farmers not be handicapped by tax penalties placed on them by old-fashioned taxation systems. That is Labor's way; it is not our way for the future. We are determined to give Australian farmers a fair go and to give them support in competing in the difficult markets around the world.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Calare for his question. I will analyse what he put; I do not know offhand what the mathematical consequences are. As far as the impact on salary is concerned, I would not think offhand it would be dramatically different. I particularly welcome the fact that the Remuneration Tribunal has made a recommendation that in future the incomes of members of parliament will be adjusted in accordance with community movements and  community standards. I have long thought myself that that would be a very good idea. We have a very unsatisfactory situation at present where, by dint of the former system falling over as a result of other changes which in themselves were very desirable, we have had a three-year period during which there has been no rise at all. Inevitably, the adjustment, when it comes along, looks bigger than in reality it is. That is exactly what has happened on this occasion.On the whole, I think the recommendation made by the tribunal is very fair and reasonable. I know that there is community hostility to any adjustment in the remuneration of members of parliament but, unless you hold the view that it should never be increased, both sides of parliament have to accept that there is going to be criticism. I think the Remuneration Tribunal's approach on this occasion is fairly balanced. It has to be stressed again that all they have done is to compute what the basic salary would have been if it had been adjusted in accordance with movements in average salaries over the last three years. So, unless you are asserting that no adjustment at all over that three-year period was defensible, I do not think you could have a fairer way of adjusting it.As to the other things, I will have a look at what the honourable member said. I do not undertake to argue for a change to what the Remuneration Tribunal has put. There have of course been some changes on superannuation. We have had this debate before, and no doubt it will go on. I think there are arguments for and against. On the one hand, I know why people criticise the superannuation but, on the other hand, the level of contributions made by members of parliament is above the level of the average contribution made by many other people. It is also the case that, when you take into account the aggregate packages of members of parliament - particularly at a ministerial or opposition leader level compared with people discharging similar responsibilities in the business community - I do not think anybody can argue that they are over-remunerated.It is not the most popular cause in the nation, but I think on any objective test the  Remuneration Tribunal's response has been pretty sensible. I would hope that it will receive the sensible, thoughtful support of those people who bother to look objectively, because public service in this place is important. You need to have proper provision for people on both sides who choose to enter parliament. A lot of people sacrifice more lucrative careers to do so. Some do not, but in the nature of things you cannot adjust according to those two groups. I think the overall stance taken by the tribunal is reasonable and that is why the government has indicated that, subject to the phasing in, it will support it.</DOC>

 - I would like to thank the honourable member for his question. There is no doubt that, if you have stronger families, you produce a stronger society and a better Australia. That is why this government has a very proud record, particularly our economic record, in providing a much better environment for families. There is no question that the new tax system will be a lot fairer because it recognises the costs of raising children. Our tax reform will provide $11.9 billion in personal income tax cuts, and that goes straight back to families. In addition, there will be $2.5 billion in assistance to families under the new family tax benefit parts A and B.From July 2000, the new Family Assistance Office will deliver the family tax benefit parts A and B, child-care benefit, maternity allowances and maternity immunisation allowances to all eligible families. The new Family Assistance Office is a joint venture between Centrelink, the ATO and the Health Insurance Commission. But it is not just the two million families that will benefit substantially from those income tax reductions and the increase in family assistance but also older Australians, whom I think this side of House looks after  significantly better than the Australian Labor Party does. Of course we also have pensioners and people on low incomes. For the first time, if you are a single pensioner, you will not have to pay tax for up to $14,500, and for couples the figure is $24,500. -  - That means that all of those elderly Australians, even if they are in the member for Lilley's electorate, will not have to pay any taxation - which is far better. And 50,000 self-funded retirees will now become eligible through the relaxation of the pension income and assets test, along with the abolition of provisional tax. With the abolition of the WST, the substantial income tax cuts to families, the increase in family assistance and, of course, those special provisions now for older Australians, this new tax system will substantially benefit even the electors in Richmond.</DOC>

 - In answer to the honourable member for Lowe, I will have a look at exactly what I said on that date in November 1997. I must say that I would be more disposed to accept that the member for Lowe is correctly representing me than some of those who are closer to me in his party. I will have a look at what he said. I certainly do recall the circumstances in which I would have made comments to that effect. It was in  the wake of the decision taken by the government to abandon the policy it had announced in relation to the accommodation bond so that the pressure that would have created for those situations would not arise.It remains my belief, my understanding, that the way in which the nursing home fee system, the accommodation fee, operates does not of itself compel the circumstances that you have alluded to. I think the House will appreciate that there can be other circumstances and other explanations. I do not think the House should accept for a moment that, if that person was obliged to do what you have described - and I am not saying that he was or was not; I will investigate it - that was a necessary consequence of the government's policy. It was not our policy to do that, it is not our policy to do that, but I will certainly have the matter investigated.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for his question. - The question related to comments about job security and wages. The whole question of the increase in people's wages in the last few years and the consequences of changes that we have made to the Workplace Relations Act are very important, as are the allied comments about job security. I note that the Leader of the Opposition this morning has been at the ACTU council meeting, taking his instructions on policy. In those remarks, he referred to developments in the labour market which go particularly both to job security and casual employment. This is a common theme from the Labor Party. But what they do not appreciate, let alone ever acknowledge, is that there have been quite substantial improvements on both of these criteria. I relayed to the House the other day how the shadow minister back in 1997 said that there were five tests by which we would benchmark the government's performance. On each and every one, the fact is that we have come up trumps with the reforms that we have introduced.The question of job security is certainly important. It was an issue in the 1996 election, when we were first returned to government. Just after that election, a frontbencher now for the Labor Party, the member for Melbourne, said that jobs were no longer secure; that was one of the reasons, he said, that Labor had lost in 1996. It is very interesting to look at some of the data on this, and in particular a table of job security going back 20 to 25 years. When you look at that and ask whether or not people felt secure in their jobs, whether or not they felt safe, the lowest point for job security in recent times has not been when we have been in office but when the Labor Party was in office. Who was the employment minister back in 1992 or thereabouts, holding the recent all-time low record  for job security? None other than the member for Brand, the nowhere man, the Leader of the Opposition, the man with no policies and no ticker to develop them. Those are the figures on job security.But another sort of common theme that we get out of the Labor Party is about casual employment. This is a pretty interesting one from them as well because they are always saying that we, the coalition, as a result of our reforms are casualising the labour force. In fact, the official figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that that is completely untrue. In fact, as a result of our reforms, the proportion of all part-time employees who are employed on a casual basis has actually fallen under the Workplace Relations Act from 67.5 per cent in August 1996 to 65.4 per cent in August 1998. Not only have you had a fall off in casual employment in that regard, but also the proportion of those people on permanent employment has risen from 32.5 per cent to 34.6 per cent, an increase of 2.1 per cent.So, rather than this increasing casualisation, when you actually check your facts - you ought to check your facts before you make these claims - you see that under our reforms we have arrested the problem that was created under you. What have you done? You have opposed every single reform measure which would actually deal with the problems you yourselves have identified. This is typical of the Labor Party. They do not do their homework. That underpins the fact that they do not have any policies - although today the Leader of the Opposition did announce another one. That was on Australian workplace agreements, which is one of the changes we introduced which has given us higher productivity and higher wages, when he said that he was going to follow the Queensland Labor Party policy to scrub AWAs.On all these benchmarks, the system that we have introduced, which Labor opposed up hill and down dale, has produced significant benefits for the average person. The last one I want to mention relates to wages. I think one of the proudest boasts of this government is, in fact, made for us by the ACTU. When it was announced that Greg Combet was  taking over from Mr Kelty, Mr Combet said - and I quote from his document Unions @ Work:Since 1996, the Living Wage has achieved an increase, after inflation, of 9.1% for the lowest paid workers - a record admired by our counterparts overseas.The fact is workers under us are better off. They have had a far better deal. When our tax package is introduced next year, there will be more benefits still.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Blair for his continuing interest - like that of other members, I might add, like the members for Longman and Fairfax and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry himself - in the welfare of many forestry workers in his electorate. The fact is that at present there are still negotiations about a regional forest agreement going on between Queensland  officials and Commonwealth officials. But it might be of interest to the House to know that simultaneously and unilaterally the Queensland government has introduced the Forestry Amendment Bill 1999 to implement all the conditions of the contract signed with certain stakeholders, which of course is referred to as the `stakeholders agreement', not the `regional forest agreement'.The Commonwealth has some very great concerns both on environmental and economic issues on these matters. Clause 213, which is being set in law, allows for the harvesting - in contravention of the present harvesting rules in Queensland - of all commercial species in their new production area down to 40 centimetres in diameter at the lower levels of the tree. That is an old-fashioned 16 inches in diameter. That is about the size of the tree that is going to be cut down. That is, of course, a progressive clear fell of an entire forest. They will be going back into that forest every year to measure every tree. As soon as they hit 16 inches in diameter they are going to cut them down. Three green groups signed up for that.But then, of course, we find the real threat to the smaller sawmillers of Queensland in clause 215, where the Queensland government is going to take the right of first refusal over every sawmill and every wood contract in Queensland. That means those sawmills are unsaleable to any other person. Nobody is going to go through the cost of making an offer for a property of that nature, knowing it could be gazumped by the Queensland government. Sixteen mayors met the other day in rural and regional Queensland. If anyone sees the minutes of their meeting, they will know they are not happy with this outcome.The questioner also asked me to make some reference to the activities of state and federal politicians in regard to the wider RFA process. Wasn't I given a wonderful lead-in today when the Leader of the Opposition decided to cry crocodile tears about the people of Manjimup? Manjimup is the central wood harvesting, wood industry, town of Western Australia where - through the Leader of the Opposition's constant campaign against  the Western Australian RFA, in complicity with his colleague Dr Geoff Gallop - there has been a collapse of the small business community. He comes to this House crying crocodile tears about some little shop that he says is going down. I will bet you that they do not. I will tell you: if they do, they will not be closing down because of the GST; they will be closing down because Gallop and Beazley ran a campaign to take their jobs away from them. In fact, 200 jobs were lost overnight in Manjimup. Those people all shopped in Manjimup. -  - They bought from Retravision, and they bought from the jewellers, who have had a 50 per cent reduction in their business. Isn't it amazing that the response from the Leader of the Opposition to 200 jobs lost is laughing, and indications that anybody who complains in this place and defends -  - Boofhead! - Yes, I am a boofhead. That's right. I am happy to be the boofhead if being a boofhead means you stand up in this place for jobs. I am happy about it. I will cop it. But we have got all of those who voted against the RFA legislation that creep into this place and got under the carpet without making a bump, that all go back to their electorates and say, `We're fighting for you, boys,' then they come in here and vote down a piece of legislation by amendment. The CFMEU says they are wrong. NAFI says they are wrong. - There are other issues that are relevant to the activities of federal and state members on the RFA - as I was questioned - and they include, of course, blocking tactics. While we are having a bit of humour, it is interesting that the Financial Review  today ran a very insightful cartoon, in which the Leader of the Opposition is sitting up in the members enclosure with his bit of cake and his mate with a glass of champagne, who says, `I know batsmen generally get themselves out but you're still meant to be bowling.' In the timber industry he is Geoffrey Boycott. - </DOC>

 - There is a very simple answer: scheduled goods 3, 4 and 8 are exempt from the GST. Non-scheduled goods, such as those that can be bought in  supermarkets, are subject to a GST. The issue with personal lubricants is that they come under the category of `public health good', which relates to sunscreens, condoms, lubricants and folate tablets. That came out of the expert advisory committee. The final point is that health loses $800 million of embedded wholesale sales tax in the GST.</DOC>

 - Job Network has been very good for regional Australia. Under the former Labor government there were just 350 Commonwealth Employment Service sites around the country; under Job Network 1, Job Network services were delivered from 1,400 sites, including 1,100 permanent sites. Under Job Network 2, which I announced last Friday, Job Network services will be delivered from 2,100 sites around the country, including from more than 1,700 permanent sites. In the employment region of country South Australia, which includes the electorates of Grey, Wakefield and Barker, total Job Network sites, including outreach sites, will increase from 45 to 72. In the region of greater Western Australia, which includes the electorate of Kalgoorlie, total Job Network sites will increase from 26 to 108. I am sure my friend the member for O'Connor will be pleased to know that, in that suffering town of Manjimup, Job Network sites go from one to three to deal with the ravages caused by the Beazley-Gallop forest policy. In central and northern Queensland, which includes the electorates of Leichhardt, Herbert, Dawson, Capricornia and Kennedy, Job Network sites will increase from 50 to 91. These increases are typical of widely increased Job Network coverage throughout regional Australia. In the Northern Territory, for instance, there used to be seven CES sites. -  - In Job Network 1 there were 14 sites, and in Job Network 2 there will be 25 permanent sites and four outreach sites. Because this does not satisfy the member for the Northern Territory, I should stress that under Labor, when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Employment, when unemployment in the Northern Territory was 10 per cent -  -  - Labor put seven CES sites into the Northern Territory. Under the coalition, with unemployment down to four per cent, there will be 29 Job Network sites in the Northern Territory. I take the member for the Northern Territory's point that one site, Nhulunbuy, has not been offered a new contract under Job Network 2. I assure the member for the Northern Territory that my department is about to go back to providers to obtain employment services in the Top End of the Northern Territory, including Nhulunbuy, on a fee-for-service basis.We are all local members. We have all have got constituencies to defend. I know that opposition MPs are expected to complain whether there is anything to justify that complaint or not, but I really think that the member for the Northern Territory should help the Labor Party to devise an employment policy of its own. Finding an ALP employment policy is about as hard as getting a signal from the NASA Mars Polar Lander. Finding any ALP policy is like finding Elvis Presley or the Loch Ness monster: you would like to see it, but you do not expect to find it. The regions of Australia are in very good hands under this government.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. Yes, I am aware of recent comments. In today's Daily Telegraph , the New South Wales education minister John Aquilina said that federal budget cuts had given his government no option but to close the Seaforth Institute of TAFE. I wish to inform the House that this is an utterly false claim. It is the New South Wales government which has cut funding to TAFE, and not the Commonwealth. I would like to put the facts before the House.In 1998 the Commonwealth, through the Australian National Training Authority, allocated $224.3 million in recurrent funding  to New South Wales for vocational education and training. This sum has been indexed up, to maintain the Commonwealth's commitment to sustain funding in real terms for vocational education and training. In the year 2000, this figure will increase from $224.3 million to $239.4 million. If you contrast this with the New South Wales record, you find that the Labor Party once again is exhibiting its massive blind spot in relation to apprenticeships and training. The New South Wales Department of Education, Training and TAFE has admitted in the inquiry into the closure of Seaforth TAFE that the New South Wales government has effectively cut almost $35 million from TAFE in the year 1999-2000. So, while the Commonwealth is maintaining expenditure, the New South Wales government is slashing expenditure.This, one has to say, is typical of the blind spot that the Labor Party has in relation to vocational training and apprenticeships. While the federal Labor Party was in office, we saw the heart ripped out of the apprenticeship system, with the lowest number of apprenticeships and traineeships as a proportion of the work force for three decades. -  - And you still don't understand it. You still don't. You have no policy on this. The Leader of the Opposition has, as we know, no ticker to develop a policy on this. He has no policy for TAFE, no policy for education and no policy for apprenticeships. You are seeing our policy produce record opportunities, but the nowhere man over there has no policy and is seeking to undermine the opportunities of young Australians. That is what state Labor is doing. It is doing it in New South Wales. I told the House yesterday that it was doing it in Victoria, as well. It is up to this government - and this government is accepting the challenge - to make sure that the skills of this country are of world-class standard and that young people have real opportunities.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Boothby for his question. As we now seem to be emerging from the Asian financial and economic crisis, I think we can say that in this region one of the economies that performed the best was the Australian economy. We had high growth on low inflation. Our markets were stable. We have had high productivity and, along with the government's reform agenda, this will drive Australia into the next decade. I might observe that it is a long time since we have had a question on the economy from the opposition. We do not seem to get any questions on the economy from the opposition any more. It is probably hard to ask about the economy if you do not have an economic policy to base it on. Next week I will be attending the first G20 meeting which is being held in Berlin. The G20 is a new group which comprises developed and developing nations that  are considered systemically important to the world international financial system.Australia has done a lot of work in international fora on the reform of the financial system. We have been part of the financial stability forum which comprises the G7 and four others. We are one of the few economies in this region which is a member of the G20. We have been active in the APEC forum. I presented a report to the Prime Minister in December of last year on the international financial system. We produced a transparency report on our institutions, which is now being used as a model around the world for economies that are seeking financial stability.There will be a key meeting in Berlin to discuss further reform of the international financial system. Australia will be pushing the work it has already done in that forum to try to get changes which will lead to enhanced stability, increased growth and better economic opportunity for the region. This is a great opportunity for Australia to be part of this important world forum. The fact that we are a member of it is an indication of our strong economic position in the region, a position which has enhanced the credibility of Australia in international forums, and we will be pushing our case next week at that meeting.</DOC>

 - I am very pleased to inform the House that the ABS data released this morning showed that Australia's rate of unemployment has fallen to 6.7 per cent. That is the lowest level of unemployment that this country has had since June 1990. It contrasts with, for example, a level of 11.2 per cent when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. The current unemployment rate of 6.7 per cent compares with a rate of 7.5 per cent prevailing in January 1999. Furthermore, in the first 11 months of 1999 and with one month's data to come, a total of 195,000 new jobs have been created. The total job creation under the coalition government now stands at 568,000. There is no economic indicator of which the members of the coalition are more proud than the fact that under this government in less than four years we have created 568,000 new jobs. This is a product of strong economic growth, an excellent productivity performance, budget surpluses, low inflation and low interest rates. All of those things have contributed to this outstanding performance.While welcoming the fall in national unemployment, I recognise that unemployment rates vary very considerably across the country. Parts of Sydney now have unemployment rates at or below two per cent; the Northern Territory, 3.5 per cent; and the Darling Downs area of Queensland, four per cent. By  contrast, in regions such as Wide Bay-Burnett, Western Adelaide, the Richmond-Tweed and the Mersey-Lisle in Tasmania, the unemployment rate is still unacceptably high at above 10 per cent. That highlights the need for both sides of politics to get behind further policy to further reduce unemployment.I can say, speaking for this side of politics, that we do have policies to further reduce unemployment, but I can find no policies on the other side. As it is with the GST, so it is with the labour market. The Leader of the Opposition, the nowhere man, is bereft of any policy alternatives. He has had almost four years now to generate an alternative, and all he has done is to obstruct and oppose virtually every attempt made by the coalition government to reduce unemployment. He ought to take a leaf out of the book of somebody that I thought he might have been philosophically a little closer to than perhaps some of his critics from the centre right here in Australia. I refer in particular to Gene Sperling, who is a principal economic adviser to President Clinton - hardly, I might say, a darling of the far right or even the centre right in American politics. In an analysis of Sperling's advice and attitudes on economic policy to Clinton, an author had this to say:Sperling saw that lower deficits, by sparking private investment, did more for the disadvantaged than he and others on the left had imagined. Lower interest rates and steady expansion forced businesses to reach into the fringes of the labour market, bringing the unskilled into the work force and training them more effectively than any government program could possibly do.They are the words of somebody who is an adviser to the centre left of politics in the United States. It recognises the conventional wisdom, which is now shared by both parts of the political divide in many countries, that what you need if you are going to reduce unemployment is policies that encourage economic growth, encourage investment and encourage business risk taking. You need programs that are going to boost the business sector in order to drive unemployment down. The Leader of the Opposition interjects that the only reason this has fallen is because of the participation rate. It is true that the participation rate has not risen in line with the  growth in the economy as much as many may have expected. But one of the reasons why the participation rate has declined is that, because interest rates are now lower as a result of other government policy, there is not the same economic pressure on families to be two-income families.If you look at the graph of the participation rate in earlier periods when unemployment has fallen and there has been economic growth, you get a completely different pattern. This is a very good figure, but it is not a cause for complacency or a suggestion to this government - and nor do we take it as such - that it has in any way finished the job on unemployment. There are still too many Australians out of work, but at least we have made solid progress. We have generated 570,000 jobs, we have had policies and we have had the courage of our policy commitment. In contrast, after four years the Labor Party is bereft of an alternative and bereft of any capacity to tackle the problem of unemployment in this country and, day by day, it denies the interests of the unemployed whom it claims to represent in this place.</DOC>

 - As a result of the matter raised yesterday by the member for Lowe - who tabled the document that he mentioned in his question - I would remind the House that the member, in asking the question, drew my attention to a statement that I made in, I think, November or December 1997 in which I said:I can categorically say to anybody now who goes into a nursing home . . . that under no circumstances will you have to sell your family home.As a result of getting the document, I have sought some advice from the Department of Health and Aged Care. I would like to inform the House of the result of that because there is a legitimate interest in this allegation not only by the member for Lowe but also by the community. I am advised by the department that the gentleman in question entered Cardinal Stepinac hostel - not nursing home - on 3 December 1998. He died on 8 April 1999 while resident at the hostel. On 13 August 1999, the department received an unsigned copy of a deed transferring his home to the hostel.I am advised that the facility he entered is a hostel whose right to seek a refundable contribution prior to entry remains the same as was the case under the policy of the former government - the Labor government. It has been, I am told once again, not uncommon for people entering hostels to sell their homes as a means of financing refundable hostel entry contributions. However, no hostel has any right to apply any coercion to a person to secure that contribution. I am further informed that the matter is being handled by the Aged Care Complaints Resolutions Scheme. Offic  ers are currently collating information from people who had contact with the deceased and they have not yet been able to make contact with all the relevant people. Following the fact collation stage, the department will provide a report to the complainant. From then on, there are a number of courses available.I think the honourable member for Lowe and the House would be aware that the Cardinal Stepinac Association has issued a statement denying the allegations and denying coercion. There is apparently a difference of view on that between the association and the late gentleman's solicitor, in particular, who is very heavily involved not only as a lawyer but also in other ways in this matter. I will continue to press the department and the minister to ensure that there is a full investigation. But I make the point that this gentleman, on all the information available to me, did not enter a nursing home under the nursing home policy of the government, as the member for Lowe implied in his question. He in fact entered a hostel.As is well known by members on both side of this House, a policy introducing accommodation bonds for hostels was introduced by the former Labor government many years ago. That policy has continued and it has involved, as would be expected, quite a number of people who, in wanting to go into a hostel, have sold their home in order to provide the accommodation bond. So I invite the member for Lowe and I invite others to further investigate this matter because it would appear, on the information currently available to me, that the member for Lowe has misrepresented me and the position of the government.It remains our view that no person, whether from a  nursing home or hostel, has any right to coerce anybody into selling their home, but to suggest - on the evidence available to me and on the information I have been given - that in some way the document you tabled yesterday represents a breach of the undertaking that I gave in November 1997 and to which you referred is wrong. That undertaking stands. We stand by our nursing home policy. This man, on my information, entered the hostel under the policy of the Labor  government led by Mr Hawke and Mr Keating which was, in relation to hostels, continued by my government. - </DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Fadden for his question. He asks me to compare Christmas 1995 - the last Christmas of the last Labor government - with this year and to highlight the changes that have occurred in the four years since the coalition was elected. It is an interesting stocktake to do.Inflation through the year to the September quarter 1999 was 1.7 per cent; for the comparable period to September 1995 it was 5.1 per cent. Productivity grew by 2.4 per cent through the year to June 1999; over the same period in 1995, productivity growth fell by 0.2 per cent. Over the year to the June quarter 1999, real wages grew by 3.7 per cent; over the same period in 1995, real wages growth under Labor was? Zero.Over the year to November 1995, Labor's last Christmas, the unemployment rate was 8.5 per cent; over the year to November 1999, the unemployment rate was 6.7 per cent. At November 1999 variable mortgage interest rates were 6.8 per cent; in the 1995 year, Labor's last Christmas, the variable mortgage interest rate was 10.5 per cent. Over the year to June 1998, the budget recorded a cash surplus of $4.2 billion; over the year to June 1995 coming into Labor's last Christmas, the budget was in deficit by $13.2 billion.That is an indication on inflation, growth, productivity, the budget, variable mortgage rates and jobs of some of the things that have been achieved in Australia over the last four years. That is what economic policy does. -  - I hear the interjection coming from the member for Paterson but I do not need to hear it to know that the one thing it will not relate to is a policy. The  Labor Party has no policy on the economy, no policy on monetary policy, no policy on interest rates, no policy on the reduction of debt, no policy on business tax and no policy on indirect tax.As the Leader of the Opposition himself said, what he hopes to do is surf back into office on the GST wave. As the member for Wentworth said to me, some kind of modern Midget Farrelly on a surfboard coming back in - not on any policy that he has thought up, not on any position that he has - but Midget Farrelly leading the Labor Party on a surfboard back on the wave of the GST.You have never seen a self-analysis like you saw from the Leader of the Opposition when he was asked what he would actually do with GST. His policy up until now has been to bring back the wholesale sales tax, to bring Australia back into line, as the Labor Party loves it, with the modern taxation systems of Botswana and Swaziland. Then he says that it may not be the wholesale sales tax. He now says, `Maybe we will have the GST. Perhaps we will just roll it back.' The first question he is asked is: roll back where, how much and how is he going to pay for it? His answer was that he is on an uncharted road with an unknown destination - a leadership summed up by the John Lennon song Nowhere man. The `Nowhere Man' on an uncharted road to an unknown destination surfing back on the GST with a policy which is taking him nowhere and more likely to lead to a dumper than to any beach return.</DOC>

 - I know the matter of food vouchers has been raised by the National Tax and Accountants Association. No doubt, that is where the Labor Party fishes around for most of its questions. The point I make in relation to food vouchers, of course, is that a food voucher for the same amount under the new taxation system is going to buy more, because food -  -  - It is an obvious proposition. Food is GST free. Those people who are selling food get all of their input tax credits back. Food is GST free. As a result the vouchers will get more.In relation to grants to charitable organisations, as the Prime Minister said, as a result of charities being GST free and getting input tax credits back, their cost of operations will fall. The government has decided that it will be grossing up the grants by 10 per cent so that the charities will be netting the reduction in cost. If I may say so, this is something that the Labor Party never worried about. They never worried about the embedded cost to charities.We know this shameless attack for what it is: an elaborate cover for a party which has no policy and no capacity to make a decision. It is a party on an uncharted road with a destination unknown, led by a nowhere man. If that is the best that Australian Labor can do, it deserves to be in opposition. The only lucky thing for it is that as yet it has not been subject to the scrutiny that it will be subject to as it goes into its fifth year of opposition still without a policy, still without a position, still without any capacity to give any hope or leadership to the Australian people, and still sitting in opposition as a result. - </DOC>

 - I thank the member for Kooyong. Given the interjections, I will start by reminding the House that one of our great achievements this year was to save the jobs of 200,000 young people as a result of retaining the aged based junior rates system, a great victory for young people. Today's unemployment numbers are at 6.7 per cent, but on the trend rate we have the equal lowest figure since July 1990 - clear evidence that fixing the problems created by Labor is presenting real benefits to the Australian community. The Public Service Bill is an important change to workplace relations in the public sector, moving away from paid rates to minimum rates.We have had growth in real wages. According to the ACTU, one of the proudest boasts Australia can make is an increase in real wages for low income people, since we have been in, of 9.1 per cent. AWAs are an innovation in our reforms, going through at 3,000 and 4,000 a month. There are 1,600 non-union collective agreements, covering 160,000 people - real progress providing real benefits to Australian workers. Whilst we are seeing disputes rising in the Labor states, the overall national scene as a result -  -  - It is a fact. In New South Wales the place is ablaze with industrial action by all of your left-wing mates in the public sector. Despite the Labor Party's efforts to increase disputes -  -  - disputes have been at their lowest level since 1913. For small business, labour costs have been controlled, whilst wages have been increasing. We have had substantial reform in major export industries which create jobs and boost living standards in the mining industry. Getting rid of tallies is a real boost for the meat industry. On the waterfront there are the best ever crane figures - again, productivity improvements providing benefits to everyone.Yesterday my second deal for the year with the Labor Party saw the passage of equal employment legislation for women. One of the good things in that - the result of an amendment suggested by the opposition, which we took up - means no filling out of forms for business next year. There are no forms until April 2001, together with other streamlining measures to reduce red tape. We announced this year a doubling of resources for indigenous employment, giving real assistance to those most disadvantaged.My colleague the Minister for Employment Services has done a very good job again with Employment National, delivering benefits to Australians - good for employers and particularly good for people who are unemployed. For small business we have been cutting red tape. With the biggest ever income tax cut in Australia's history we are delivering real benefits through major tax reform - a tremendous boost to the business community.Lastly, the halving of the capital gains tax is a policy measure which will warm the hearts of every small business person in the country. It is putting incentive back into the system, and that means more jobs. The Labor Party should cancel all holidays, except for a couple of weeks, and they should be out there selling the benefits of our joint policy. Reducing capital gains tax is great news for small business. Lastly: are there any alternative policies? It is like a desert on the other side. -  - And the surf breaking on the adjoining beach. They do not have any poli  cies. I note that back on 15 July, in his press release the then shadow minister for employment called on the government to `commit to a community debate on unemployment'. The only debate has been on our side. You have no policies. You only ever do what you are told by the ACTU. Only occasionally do you have the good sense to develop a policy, and that is our policy. Whether it is employment opportunity for women or capital gains tax, it has been a good year for small business.</DOC>

 - The situation is not as outlined in the final part of the honourable member's question. There will not be a cut taken. I do not think the honourable member made allowance for the impact of the removal of wholesale sales tax. The principles of the application of the new system have already been clearly enunciated. I will analyse the example that the honourable member has given against those principles and, if there is  any further information that ought to be supplied, it will be.</DOC>

 - We are fixing railways. - There are a whole range of areas where we have been very active, and I think we have a good story to tell. I will work through some of the areas. In aviation we have got a new and measured approach to aviation safety reform. We have got the further liberalisation of Australia's international air services policy. In fact, we have now opened up so much capacity that it is not being filled. We have granted Virgin Airlines foreign investment approval to start a new domestic airline in Australia. Perhaps in keeping with the old story that if an aeroplane lands safely you do not hear about it, but if one does not you get a problem, I point out something that I am very proud of and that all Australians ought to be very proud of: Airservices Australia has just won the Eagle award from the International Air Transport Association as the best provider of air traffic services in the world. Out of 250 air traffic service providers, ours won - the best in the world this year.Now I come to maritime services: I heard the previous speaker mention that we have the highest crane rates on record in this country. On waterfront reform: there have been 1,400 voluntary stevedoring redundancies at no cost to the taxpayer. There has been a $30 million  tax reduction for Australian shipping in fuel cost reductions. A review of part 10 of the Trade Practices Act is now complete, and a board review of the Navigation Act was initiated in August - an issue put in the too-hard basket for years by the previous government. We have made real progress with infrastructure. IBTOS concessions have been applied to the eastern gas pipeline. There are the City Link extension project, the Adelaide airport multi-user terminal, the Botany Co- Generation facility, the Brisbane cruise port and, more recently, the Walsh Point coal terminal in Newcastle has been made eligible for the $14 million concession.When it comes to rail, I have a few pointers: 74 per cent of the market share for rail on the Melbourne-Perth corridor. That is one of the largest shares for rail anywhere in the world today. We are cutting the times significantly for a whole range of long distance freight haulage tasks in this country: 2½ hours less for the Melbourne-Adelaide route, for example. When they had a go at reforming it under One Nation the times went up, not down. We have now got it down to 2½ hours. We are looking at three hours from Melbourne to Perth over and above that. In addition there are: $124 million towards a Sydney dedicated through-route for rail; $165 million for the construction of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line; a feasibility study for the inland rail link from Melbourne to Brisbane; and - I know my predecessor welcomes this - the complete abolition of all of Labor's excise on diesel for rail from the middle of next year. On road transport we have got the uptake of higher mass limits across nearly every Australian state and territory. It is a major GDP boost and very significant in economic terms, with around $840 million per year from higher mass limits being unfolded. We have got an offer on the table to the one state that is still really holding out. We now have significant reforms being made possible through the provision of major resources for new bridges - just to touch of a couple of areas. With regional services, we have the first rural transactions centres - us putting services back into rural and regional Austral  ia - the first of them opened by the Prime Minister at Eugowra just a few weeks ago. - A great morning. They turned out en masse. I can tell you from the mail we have had on this that people appreciate what we are doing, because we are making a real effort to put face-to-face services back in rural areas. We have since had several more openings: at St Marys in Tasmania; at Welshpool in Victoria; at Urana, where the former Deputy Prime Minister opened it; and at Gresford.We now have 58 financial centres under Creditcare going back into rural and regional areas. There is the Rural Communities Program, with $107 million the other day for the Macquarie Rural Advisory Service. Rural Plan has a large number of programs now being progressed under it. The Regional Australia Summit saw 230 delegates here. We have a steering committee, under Professor John Chudleigh, which has now met twice, taking forward those ideas. We have got a governmental task force working in tandem.One of the most interesting things about that is that there are some very interesting community projects. Communities from around Australia that have reinvented their future came forward with their story to tell. I would have to say to the member for New England that none of them can match for impact what he managed last night in Guyra with that extraordinary, and at this stage unidentified, object that landed in a nearby dam. I do not think that anybody can quite  match that. We still do not know where it came from or whether anybody has got control of it, or quite what it is going to achieve -  - No, no; it has gone to the bottom of the dam but it is not a Labor Party policy. I have to say that it does reflect the fact that nobody has lost their sense of humour in rural and regional Australia. I was amazed to read what one of the locals said of it: The town's water supply has been cut off, and we're asking for a breathalyser-free day because there isn't anything else to drink and we've all got to go down to the pub.He went on to say:If nothing else, by the end of the week a million people will have seen different things land at Guyra.So a sense of humour is alive and well out there.Finally, part of the question was `Are there are any alternative proposals?' Are there any alternative proposals, any leadership at all, any proposals for rural and regional Australia? Anything worth while on rail or on aviation? All we have heard is a description of our slashing of transport costs as being a $7.8 billion boost to pollution. That is all we have heard. It is the only policy they have got: a $7.8 billion dollar boost to pollution. -  - It was the member for Dickson. You know, their new-found spokesman for the bush has not repudiated it yet and still regards the cutting of transport costs in Australia by the largest amount ever as nothing more and nothing less than a boost to pollution.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Longman for his question; I know how proud he is of the performance of his local high school Birriwa in the National Training Awards this year. The focus of the government's policies this year on education and training has been on widening access to  quality education and training for all young Australians and improving thereby their job prospects. At the very top of the government's agenda has been making sure that every young person in Australia has got the opportunity to read and write to an adequate standard. This year, the National Literacy Plan has been rolled out across the nation, and in every state and territory young people have been assessed against the national standard. These results will be published within the next few months, early next year.This year, new national goals for schooling were set in place which recognised - and the Labor Party have never recognised this; they still have not caught up with the debate - that an effective addressing of disadvantage requires a strong focus on improving educational outcomes. The historic change to the funding system for non-government schools announced in the budget will, as some in the sector said, `for the first time give working-class families real choice in education'. These reforms will be putting a powerful new incentive within the school systems to improve quality and raise standards. Government school funding will increase this year by 25 per cent over the 1996 figure.One of the government's great achievements has been putting in place the new apprenticeship system. After the Labor Party virtually ripped the heart out of apprenticeships in Australia, the government has put in place a system which has been enthusiastically adopted by employers. The employers of this country have shown their support for this reform by recruiting a record number of young apprentices and putting into place opportunities that have never before existed for young Australians.School based apprenticeships and quality vocational education and training in schools are giving new hope to the 70 per cent of school leavers who do not go directly from school to university - a group of young people neglected year after year by the Labor Party; and that is admitted by many Labor Party ministers and other commentators on the frontbench. Over 30,000 businesses are now involved directly with schools in providing young Australians with enterprise education  and workplace know-how. Under the new national agreements on TAFE, TAFE places are growing to record levels, with over 160,000 new places in TAFE projected under the current ANTA arrangements.It is important to emphasise that the government has acted very strongly to address educational disadvantage in regional and rural Australia. Special incentives have been provided to help solve skills shortages through the rural and regional new apprenticeships initiative. The number of new apprenticeship sites in regional Australia has risen from 118 to 200 as a result of the recent tender round. Assistance for isolated children, the basic boarding allowance, has been raised and indexed for the first time. The emphasis in our capital expenditures has been on regional universities, and indeed $133 million has been put into regional universities over the three years of this government.It is very encouraging to see rural and regional educational participation rates now rising. The number of students at regional universities has gone up from 74,700 in 1996 to 82,500 this year. Total university undergraduate places are up and total university revenues are at an all-time high. The government has provided $259 million to assist the universities to get the flexibilities into their staffing arrangements that are now possible under the Australian workplace agreements.Contrast this very full Christmas stocking in education and training with what is not offered on the other side of the House. I was asked whether I was aware of alternative policies. The Christmas stocking is very thin on the other side of the House. It has a little note on the top of it from Kim Beazley asking Santa to give him a policy. It says, `One policy will do, any policy, but please give us a policy because we have not been able to generate them and the Australian Education Union has not sent them as yet.' They keep looking in the mailbox and they are not there. So they are now relying on Santa. They will not be getting any policies from the Leader of the Opposition or from his frontbench so they had better try something else.</DOC>

 - I thank the member for Hughes for her question. As the member representing the Holsworthy camp, she exhibited great knowledge of the Defence Force on  a recent trip to East Timor. I welcome her question this afternoon. I am sure all Australians can be proud of the contribution that the Australian Defence Force has made to the successful operation in East Timor. With INTERFET deploying on 20 September, the majority of those on the ground in the first few days were, in fact, ADF forces.At the time, the security situation was dangerous because of the activities of the local militia but now, as we see the images of schools and markets reopening in East Timor, security is gradually returning to East Timor. The total number of refugees returning to East Timor has probably passed the 115,000 mark. The contribution to INTERFET continues to be more than half of the total forces in East Timor of some 9,700 people. Without that contribution, it is doubtful the level of peace and security currently in the territory would have been achieved. The multinational force has done an excellent job in achieving this mandate for the United Nations.The planning is well under way for the transition to phase 3 of the United Nations operation, the Blue Helmet peacekeeping operation under the United Nations transitional administration in East Timor. When the United Nations peacekeeping force takes over, we will still have a significant number of Australians contributing to that operation. As the Prime Minister has indicated previously, that number will be about 1,500 to 2,000 troops. The East Timor deployment caps off a very active year in the defence portfolio. It has been a year of significant achievement and significant improvement in the management and reform of the department, and I intend to pursue that next year.Under Labor, the Department of Defence was allowed to jog along without considerable management. There were consistent blowouts. No attempt was made to manage projects which consistently ran over cost and time. The funding of Defence was allowed to fall away, to where it was substantially under pressure, because of the actions taken by the Labor Party at that time. At no stage did the Labor Party attempt to grab hold of the defence department and make it respond to the needs of the time. These are the problems  the government was left with and is currently dealing with.I am pleased to announce today that I will be visiting East Timor and Bougainville before Christmas. I will be seeking the advice of the military commanders in those positions and also their reports on the circumstances surrounding their deployments. I will convey to them the good wishes, I am quite sure, of all members of the House and the Australian public. The Australian government has always been committed to ensuring that our defence forces are properly manned, trained and equipped. Our defence forces are a source of immense pride to all Australians and I am sure all members of the House will support that.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Aston. I have to confess to being slightly confused by the last part of the question: was I aware of any alternative policies? The answer to that is that no-one is aware of any alternative policies because there are none. Nearly four years later it does not matter what the portfolio area is the fact is there are simply no policies. Obviously, at the end of the day, you will not be able to surf to government by saying nothing. This has unequivocally, by any assessment, been a year in which Australia has won enormous respect around the international community. The reason we have won respect is that it has been a year of significant achievement. It has been a year when we have worked tirelessly to help the people of East Timor to decide their own futures. -  - That is something that, for 13 years, you did not work for at all. Secondly, when the violence erupted in East Timor we acted decisively in order to assist INTERFET to bring peace and security to East Timor. I think all members on this side of the House and just about everybody in the Australian community apart from -  -  - Mr Speaker, do you know what they say of the Leader of the Opposition? Can't bowl, can't throw. -  - I think all members on this side of the House and just about all people in the Australian community, with the exception, of course, of a few Labor camp followers, recognise that what Australia has done for East Timor during this year has been honourable and decisive. We on this side of the House shall always be proud of what we did for those people - always. We will be proud unequivocally not only this year but until we all finally leave the political scene.We have also helped Indonesia very substantially in its transition to become the world's third largest operating democracy. We have provided significant assistance there. We have been stalwart in standing up for Australians who have got into difficulties overseas during the year - and, again, few will forget the work that the Australian government did, with the assistance of many others, to win the release of Steve Pratt and Peter Wallace from prison in Yugoslavia. We also finally were successful in getting released from prison James Peng, and that, in itself, was a very significant achievement.It is a year during which we have helped Papua New Guinea with the reorientation of its economic policies and assisted it in getting back together again with the World Bank and the IMF. It is a year during which we have assisted with the Bougainville peace process and once more maintained peace in Bougainville with the particular assistance of our Peace Monitoring Group. It is a year where we have helped East-Asian economies recover from the Asian economic crisis, and it is a year where our aid program, let me say, has not only performed extraordinarily well but also been recognised as performing very well. Indeed, the OECD determined only  yesterday that Australia was in the vanguard of OECD members in terms of the quality of its aid program.So, no matter what conscience the Labor Party has about the issue of East Timor, no matter what disputes there are in the Labor Party, which were very manifest when Gough Whitlam appeared before the Senate committee at the beginning of this week - and it is interesting to hear the different private comments that come from the members of the opposition about this issue - and no matter what jeering comes from the opposition on the issue of East Timor, this government has a tremendous amount to be proud of in what it has done and in terms of Australia's standing in the international community in terms of the support we have given and the good international values that we have projected around the world.</DOC>

 - The last one is the easiest, Mr Speaker, because the questions have been going nowhere and the answers have been absolutely accurate. Regarding the so-called information that my department had, I have asked them about this and they have said that most of the letters they got contained material that could best be described as rumour. One letter, and I can actually quote from it, said:We are concerned that some or all of these contracts may not be genuine, but of course we have no tangible evidence.They tell me that one letter did contain some specific facts, and they informed me that they handed that on to the Health Insurance Commission, which is absolutely proper. In terms of the comment that the honourable member made about the unsubstantiated allegations, that was what started the Health Insurance Commission investigation in December 1998, and my comments there were absolutely accurate.</DOC>

 - It has been a difficult year for many farmers, but this government has taken a lot of positive actions to assist, and there are of course many success stories in Australian agriculture over the last 12 months. I think the government has a right to take credit for its contribution to many of those success stories. We have taken considerable actions in the parliament to reduce the tax burden on farmers, and from next year close to $1 billion of costs will be removed from the farm sector as a result of our tax reform. The new business tax reforms will remove capital gains tax for farmers who sell one farm to buy another or who wish to retire, and of course the existing primary producer tax concessions will remain.On the export front, again there have been a lot of gains. We have been able to obtain access for Tasmanian fuji apples to Japan, apples to China, citrus to Korea, easy peel citrus to Japan, potatoes to Mauritius, honey to South Africa, New Zealand and the EU and dairy products to Brazil. We have been able to resume access for watermelons to New Zealand, horses to Asia, and beef to the  Philippines, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea and Japan. In addition, we chalked up $1 billion worth of wine exports for the year, a great Australian success story. In the fishing area, Australia is on track to implement mandatory ballast water arrangements to help protect Australian fisheries from the incursion of pests from ballast water. In addition, we had success in the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea against the Japanese in relation to southern bluefin tuna, and there is legislation before the parliament to ratify the UN fish stocks agreement.The wool stockpile has been privatised and growers will vote in February on new arrangements for their industry. The government has put on the table an offer to assist the dairy industry, if they choose to restructure. Wheat growers have taken ownership of the wheat marketing arrangements following the wind-up of the statutory Australian wheat board. Live sheep trade to Saudi Arabia is set to commence following my meetings with the Saudi Arabian Minister for Agriculture, Dr Muammuar. The Lamb Industry Development Fund is under way, as is the $24 million pork industry restructuring strategy, which has helped fuel one of the greatest turnarounds in primary industry in recent Australian history. The success of the pork industry this year is really outstanding. So there are certainly a lot of issues to be addressed, but the government can be pleased with its contribution in the past year to assist many farmers towards a more profitable future.The second part of the question dealt with any alternative policies. Well, I have been searching long and hard. I listened to the member for Dickson suggest that higher fuel prices was an appropriate farm policy, but I did not notice the missing shadow minister for agriculture endorsing that idea. It would have been a pity to put something on the blank page. Let's keep it blank. Let's keep it empty. I notice even members of the opposition now are starting to laugh when somebody asks about a Labor Party policy because they think it is just as funny. Why should you have policies? If you are an alternative government you just tell the people, `Trust us.' Last time we trusted them we know what happened, and  no-one is likely to be that silly again. No policies, no ideas, no action, and that is why the Labor Party deserves to be on the opposition benches.</DOC>

 - Well that bag of wind is complete rubbish. As much as I can write them down, I will take them point by point. We addressed MRI to provide a need to the Australian community that you had been incapable of providing. We did this as part of a large negotiation on a $1 billion radiology budget that was out of control when we came to government and which we brought into control. The opportunity was created on the basis of advice I tabled from the secretary to my department some weeks ago from the Attorney-General's Department on the basis of the docks dispute, nothing else. The fact that I took no interest in the thing is complete rubbish. Every time I have been provided with any information I have acted in a timely and absolutely appropriate manner. We did not seek to make the radiologists keep confidentiality on the negotiation because cabinet had approved me to go out and negotiate with them. We were negotiating with a group on a $1 billion budget that we were trying to bring into control and they were expected to consult with their members. The fact that I failed to set up an investigation is completely not borne out by the facts. The Health Insurance Commission set up an investigation within weeks of receiving information, and the fact is as soon as we had even rumour we put in place in September last year a system of statutory declarations which is the reason why nearly 20 people are now going to the Director of Public Prosecutions.You say I consistently ignored advice. You cannot provide one single example of that. You are prepared to make allegations, you are prepared to bluster, but the fact is that there are no facts backing up what you say. I have openly made every opportunity for the Auditor-General to have any information he wishes. The fact is you are just jealous that we have made an attempt to provide some 100,000 people a year with a scan that they were paying $400 to $800 for when you were in government. The fact is that some people have abused this, and they are going to be dealt with most severely. But, quite frankly, your little threats across the table don't offend me and don't scare me at all unless you are planning to sit on me.</DOC>

 - I thank the honourable member for Wentworth for that question. It is appropriate, in a week in which,  quite properly, the coalition parties will mark the 50th anniversary of the election of the Menzies government in December 1949, to say something about the social policy record of this government as it stands in a very proud line in the tradition of the coalition on social policy. Since the government has been elected, it has pursued a social policy agenda underpinned by a very strong notion of the social coalition. That social coalition seeks to build a partnership between the government, the business community, the welfare sector and individuals. We have given the welfare sector of the Australian community a new role in policy advising, we have emphasised prevention and early intervention, we have emphasised action meeting the needs of individual communities and we have placed a very strong emphasis on mutual obligation.I will take a moment to mention one or two of the major initiatives that have given effect to that agenda. These are initiatives that have gone to some of the great social concerns of the Australian community - social concerns that have been neglected for far too long within the Australian community. None is more important than the menace of drugs and the way in which they affect the young in the Australian community. One of the social initiatives of which this government is par  ticularly proud is the great priority we have given to the Tough on Drugs Strategy. That strategy has seen unparalleled levels of money committed by the national government not only in pursuit of the drug barons but also in providing superior education, superior rehabilitation and superior support services to those who are affected by the drug menace. Our community and business partnership has provided, amongst other things, a $51 million tax incentive for philanthropic giving, the inaugural Prime Minister's award for excellence. This has been matched by our commitment to early intervention in the area of youth homelessness.I want to particularly thank a number of my ministers in connection with social policy. I congratulate those two ministers responsible for the introduction of a world first in relation to the new Job Network. I thank the current Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs for when he had responsibility for it, and I thank the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. This was a world first and it has delivered - as today's unemployment figures bear out - outcomes far superior to those delivered by the old Commonwealth Employment Service. As those on this side will remember, when the Job Network was introduced the Labor Party lampooned the idea. They said it would be a failure. They tried to run a scare campaign, and they tried to denigrate the notion of privatising the Job Network in this country. But they have been proved wrong. They have been demonstrated once again to be people who are -  -  - It is significant that, as I go through a list of the government's social policy achievements, the members of the Labor Party behave in that fashion. It merely brings home to us on this side of the House, and draws to the attention of those people of Australia who are in the public gallery, the sheer contemptuous indifference of the Labor Party to social policy in this country. It  underlines the fact that in this area, as in so many other areas, the Labor Party have no alternative. If they had an alternative, they would be questioning us about our policy. If they had an alternative, they would be taking it to the people of Australia. Just as they do not have an employment policy, they do not have a drugs policy. Just as they do not have an education policy, they do not have a social partnership policy. Just as they do not have a taxation policy, they do not have a policy to promote the issue and the principle of mutual obligation. Our achievements in the area of social policy go very close to matching our achievements in the area of industrial relations. - The area of health and medical research is so tremendously important to the future health of all Australians that I would imagine everybody in this chamber, whether they are a member of the House or a citizen of Australia attending question time, as is their right in a democracy, would have applauded the budget announcement of the Treasurer that over the next four years this government will precisely double the amount of money going to health and medical research in Australia following the recommendations of the Wills committee.In the area of assisting older Australians, we announced a $200 million package of primary health care and coordinated care measures in the budget, an $80 million initiative to provide respite for carers of older people and a new $148 million nursing home package. They were announced this week by the Minister for Aged Care. All of these policies and commitments are designed to address the practical concerns of the Australian people. They fulfil the commitment I  made in 1996 that this government would be a government for all Australians, that it would not be a government just for the people who supported it but it would be a government for all of the Australian community.I contrast that record of achievement with the failure of the Labor Party over almost four years to develop any significant alternative policy in any significant area of concern to the Australian people. I can only say that in four years they have not assumed the challenges of opposition. They have pretended that somehow or other the Australian people made a mistake on two occasions and that sooner or later the Australian people, through the natural swing of the political pendulum, will put them back into office. - That is a record of performance in social policy of which the government is very rightly proud. Finally, I inform the House that earlier this afternoon an agreement was concluded between the government and the Australian Democrats regarding certain amendments to the taxation legislation now in the Senate. That agreement will secure the speedy passage, I am told, of that legislation. It is an agreement that responds very significantly to the recommendations of the consultative committee concerning the relationship between charities and the new taxation system. I compliment the Treasurer on his work in negotiating the agreement with  the Australian Democrats. The Treasurer will shortly announce the details of that agreement. -  - It does indicate very clearly the capacity of the government in this, as in so many areas, to deliver practical outcomes of lasting benefit to all of the Australian community. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper .</DOC>
